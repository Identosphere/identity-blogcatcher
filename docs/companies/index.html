<p>I’m excited to be able to reveal a great new commercial partnership we’ve been developing behind the scenes for a&nbsp;while.</p><p>We’re working with LexisNexis Risk Solutions to enable the implementation of self-sovereign digital identity (SSI) solutions. We’ve been collaborating since 2019, running discovery initiatives culminating in a joint go-to-market commercial arrangement.</p><p>SSI has been a cornerstone of the Nuggets vision since 2016. It represents a fundamental shift in the way personal data is owned, shared and controlled, giving consumers complete control of their personal information. With SSI, consumers can control when their data and identity documents are accessed, and by whom. You no longer have to send precious documents away, or have them stored in multiple physical or electronic locations.</p><p>Right now, if someone wants to open a bank account, or apply for a loan, mortgage or other financial product, they have to send personal documentation, either physically or electronically. The result: company servers full of sensitive customer information, which become a prime target for fraudsters.</p><p>Our new partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions — one of the world’s largest protectors of private and confidential data — will help to validate the benefits and strengths of the self-sovereign identity&nbsp;model.</p><p>SSI isn’t just good news for consumer privacy. It should also facilitate quicker processing and lower costs for risk and compliance for businesses like banks carrying out know-your-customer (KYC) and know-your-business (KYB)&nbsp;checks.</p><p>At Nuggets, we’ve always been driven by our belief that customers should be able to take back control of their data. As relentless data breaches show, the existing model of personal data storage is&nbsp;broken.</p><p>Through this new partnership, we’re helping to fundamentally change the way personal information is shared with, and used by, financial institutions. We’re helping individuals and businesses enhance their privacy and security protocols, for the benefit of&nbsp;all.</p><p>LexisNexis Risk Solutions provide solutions for a range of industries, including insurance, financial services, healthcare and government. With offices across the world, they’re also part of RELX, a provider of information and analytics for professional and business customers in various industries.</p><p>Here’s Steve Elliot, MD of LexisNexis Risk Solutions UK &amp; Ireland, on our new partnership:</p><p>“Effective solutions that can digitally identify and authenticate a person more quickly, more accurately and more securely, can have wide-ranging benefits for individuals, organisations and society as a whole, from reducing the time it takes consumers to acquire goods and services, to widening access and reducing fraud and money laundering. It’s really exciting to think that innovations like these could help reduce the increasing prevalence of large scale breaches of consumers’ personal data. We’re really excited to be working with Nuggets to explore how SSI can help achieve those benefits whilst maximising data privacy and security for consumers.”</p><p>If you share our belief in transforming the way personal information is stored and shared, and think your business could benefit from this approach, we’d love to hear from you.

  <p>“Artificial intelligence (AI)I will automate everything and put people out of work.” “AI is a science-fiction technology.” “Robots will take over the world.” </p>
<p>The hype around AI has produced many myths, in mainstream media, in board meetings and across organizations. Some worry about <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/human-beings-ai-and-robots-to-represent-the-new-workforce-in-2028/">an “almighty” AI that will take over the world</a>, and some think that AI is nothing more than a buzzword. The truth is somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>“Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, the majority of organizations have been maintaining or even increasing their investments in artificial intelligence,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/56819">Saniye Alaybeyi</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “However, only half of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-3-benefits-of-ai-projects/">these projects</a> ever make it to production.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>AI is not only augmenting mundane jobs. IT leaders need to create value for AI by establishing business benefits such as cost reductions and operations improvement by providing practical applications of the technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gartner has identified six common myths and misconceptions about AI.</p>
 Myth No. 1: AI Is an unnecessary luxury in times of the COVID-19 pandemic 
<p>AI is emerging as an important enabler of cost optimization and business continuity during the COVID-19 crisis. Contrary to the misconception that AI is an unnecessary luxury when enterprises are struggling with cash flows and uncertain economic conditions, AI is generating revenue. It is improving customer interactions, analyzing data more quickly, generating early warnings about upcoming disruptions and automating decision making.&nbsp;</p>

 Myth No. 2: AI and machine learning (ML) are the same and interchangeable 
<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. ML requires a well-thought-out training and data acquisition strategy. AI, on the other hand, is an umbrella term for a broad set of computer engineering techniques, ranging from ML and rule-based systems to optimization techniques and natural language processing (NLP).&nbsp;</p>
 Myth No. 3: Intelligent machines learn on their own 
<p>A finished ML product gives the impression that it is able to learn on its own. However, experienced human data scientists frame the problem, prepare the data, determine appropriate datasets, remove potential bias in the training data and, most importantly, continually update the software to enable the integration of new knowledge and data into the next learning cycle.</p>
 Myth No. 4: AI can be 100% objective 
<p>Every AI technology is based on data, rules and other kinds of input from human experts. Because all humans are intrinsically biased in one way or another, so is the AI. Systems that are frequently retrained — for example, using new data from social media — are even more vulnerable to unwanted bias or intentional malevolent influences.</p>
<p>Even if your current AI strategy is “no AI,” this should be a conscious decision based on research and consideration.</p>
<p>“At the moment, there is no way to completely banish bias; however, we have to try our best to reduce it to a minimum,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/12496">Alexander Linden</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “In addition to technological solutions, such as diverse datasets, it is crucial to also ensure diversity in the teams working with the AI and have team members review each other’s work. This simple process can significantly reduce selection and confirmation bias.”</p>

 Myth No. 5: AI will only replace mundane jobs 
<p>AI enables businesses to make more accurate decisions via predictions, classifications and clustering. These abilities have enabled AI-based solutions to reach deep into work environments, not only replacing mundane tasks, but also augmenting those that are more complex.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the use of imaging <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-need-for-ai-governance-in-healthcare/">AI in healthcare</a>. A chest X-ray application based on AI can detect diseases faster than can radiologists. In the financial and insurance industry,&nbsp;roboadvisors are being used for wealth management and fraud detection. These capabilities don’t eliminate human involvement in those tasks but will eventually limit it to observing and dealing with unusual cases. Adjust job profiles and capacity planning and offer retraining options for existing staff.</p>
 Myth No. 6: My business does not need an AI strategy 
<p>Every organization should consider the potential impact of AI on its <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-chief-data-officers-guide-to-an-ai-strategy/">strategy</a> and investigate how this technology can be applied to the organization’s business problems. In many ways, AI exploitation is the same as forgoing the next phase of automation, and could place enterprises at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Even if AI is not an immediate fix to a problem, businesses should revisit the decision to not implement AI periodically,” says Alaybeyi. “Organizations need to find appropriate use cases that leverage AI’s power to augment human work, decisions and interactions, as well as other functional innovation opportunities.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next four years, 69% of what a manager currently does will be automated. In such a disruptive environment, enterprises need a reality check on how best they can integrate AI into their strategy and be ready for forthcoming disruptions.</p>

  <p>Next.js is a React framework that aims to provide the best development experience. It is feature rich, including hybrid static and server rendering, TypeScript support, built-in CSS support, API routers, and much more.</p>

<p>TypeScript is an open-source language that is built on JavaScript that allows developers to use types. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use TypeScript with Next.js.</p>

<p>Finally, you will secure your application with Okta Single Sign-On and the built-in functionality of Next.js, as well as the support of the next-auth package.</p>

 Create Your Okta Application 

<p>The first thing you will need to do is create an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta developer account</a> if you don’t have one already. The account is free, doesn’t require a credit card, and allows you to start with Okta immediately. Once you have signed up, log in to the Developer Console and click on Applications. Click Add Application and select Web. In your application settings screen set your URIs to <code>localhost:3000</code> instead of the default <code>localhost:8080</code>. Next, set your Login redirect URIs to <code>http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/okta</code>. This is the default callback URI that <code>next-auth</code> will use. Give your application a meaningful name, I named mine NextJs. Click Done and you will be brought to your application’s management screen. Click on General and note your Client ID and Client secret as you will need these in your application.</p>

<p></p>

 Create Your Next.js Application 

<p>Open your favorite IDE. For this tutorial, I used Visual Studio Code. Navigate to the folder where you wish to keep your application. Next, use the <code>create-next-app</code> task runner by using the command <code>npx create-next-app</code> and follow the instructions. After the runner is complete, open the folder it created for you.</p>

<p>Since you are using TypeScript in this tutorial you will need to set up TypeScript support. Create a new file in the root of your application called <code>tsconfig.json</code>. Next.js will automatically populate this file with its default values but you can edit them if you wish. Next, run <code>npm run dev</code> in your console and you will see instructions about installing your dependencies for TypeScript.</p>

<p>To do this, open the console and run the following commands.</p>

   <code>npm i typescript@4.0.3
npm i @types/node@14.11.8
npm i @types/react@16.9.52    
</code>   

<p>This will complete your TypeScript setup. But there are more dependencies you should add at this point. You can add <code>next-auth</code> at this point. Next-auth makes setting up any type of authentication in Next.js simple. Of course, for this application, you are only setting up Okta as an external provider. Install next-auth with the command below and you will see how to implement it later.</p>

   <code>npm i next-auth@3.1.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, for this tutorial, you will use Bootstrap for your CSS framework.</p>

   <code> npm i bootstrap@4.5.3
</code>   

 Convert Your Next.js Application to TypeScript 

<p>The task running for creating a Next.js application does not include an option for using TypeScript. Therefore you will need to manually convert your application from JavaScript to TypeScript. The process is simple and should only take a moment.</p>

<p>You have already completed the first two steps by setting up your <code>tsconfig.json</code> file and installing your dependencies. Now you will need to convert files with the <code>.js</code> extension to <code>.tsx</code>. You will need to do this for each file in your <code>pages</code> directory and any subdirectories. Any subsequent components you add will also need to have the <code>.tsx</code> file extension.</p>

 Set Up Your Authentication 

<p>Next, you’ll need to set up the authentication for external providers.</p>

<p>Before you can implement authentication, you will need to ensure that your <code>.env.local</code> file is set up correctly. Add this file to the root of your project if one doesn’t exist yet. Add the following values to it.</p>

 <code>OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENTSECRET={yourClientSecret}
OKTA_DOMAIN={yourOktaDomain}
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
</code> 

<p>Now, under your <code>pages\api</code> folder create a new folder called <code>auth</code> if one doesn’t exist yet. Add a file called <code>[...nextauth].ts</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import Providers from 'next-auth/providers'

const options = {
  // Configure one or more authentication providers
  providers: [
    Providers.Okta({
      clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTID,
      clientSecret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTSECRET,
      domain: process.env.OKTA_DOMAIN
    }),
    // ...add more providers here
  ]
}

export default (req, res) =&gt; NextAuth(req, res, options)
</code>   

<p>Finally, open <code>pages\_app.tsx</code> and replace the existing code with the following.</p>

   <code>import '../styles/globals.css'
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'

import { Provider } from 'next-auth/client'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    &lt;Provider session={pageProps.session}&gt;
      &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;
    &lt;/Provider&gt;
  )
}

export default MyApp
</code>   

<p>This code is the default Next.js code wrapped in a <code>Provider</code> class from next-auth. The provider class makes sharing the session between pages easier. You added the Bootstrap CSS in this file as well. This will enable you to use Bootstrap on your pages.</p>

 Write Your Next.js Components and Pages 

<p>Your application is set up and ready to develop. Start by adding a new folder called <code>Components</code> to the root of your directory. This will be a folder for your shared components. Add a new file called <code>Movies.tsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>export default function Movies() {

    return (
        &lt;div className="row"&gt;

            &lt;div className="col-lg-4"&gt;

                &lt;div className="card"&gt;
                    &lt;img className="card-img-top" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gDYZG%2BzDL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Card image cap"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
                    &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;h5 className="card-title"&gt;Die Hard&lt;/h5&gt;
                        &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;He's the only chance anyone has got.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div className="col-lg-4"&gt;

                &lt;div className="card"&gt;
                    &lt;img className="card-img-top" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRlNDUxZjAtOGQ4OC00OTNlLTgxNmQtYTBmMDgwZmNmNjkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_.jpg" alt="Card image cap"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
                    &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;h5 className="card-title"&gt;Die Hard 2&lt;/h5&gt;
                        &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;They say lightning never strikes twice... They were wrong&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div className="col-lg-4"&gt;

                &lt;div className="card"&gt;
                    &lt;img className="card-img-top" src="https://belgianfilmfreak.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/d0.jpg" alt="Card image cap"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
                    &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;h5 className="card-title"&gt;Die Hard: With a Vengence&lt;/h5&gt;
                        &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;Think Fast, Look Alive, Die Hard&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
</code>   

<p>This component will be displayed on the <code>Dashboard</code> page for logged-in users. It displays some of the most important movies in history to the user.</p>

<p>Next, you can add a file called <code>Unauthorized.tsx</code>.</p>

   <code>import { signIn } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Unauthorized() {

    return (
        &lt;div className="row"&gt;
            &lt;div className="col-lg-10 col-offset-1"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Hey There, looks like you reached an area you don't have access to.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt; Please sign in here.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt; &lt;button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={signIn}&gt;Sign in&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
</code>   

<p>This is the first time on the client that you are using the <code>next-auth</code> package. You are importing the <code>signIn</code> feature from the <code>next-auth/client</code> component. This function will navigate the user to a list of providers that you implemented previously. The user will then be able to click on that provider and be taken to their login screen. The <code>Unauthorized</code> component simply presents the user with a message that they reached a protected part of the site without being authenticated and routes them to the appropriate provider.</p>

<p>The last file to add to this folder is the <code>Header.tsx</code> file. This is just a banner that sits on top of each page and has a login or logout button depending on the state of the user.</p>

   <code>import { signIn, signOut, useSession } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Header() {

  const [session, loading] = useSession();

  var button;

  if (session) {
    button = &lt;button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={signOut}&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;;
  }
  else {
    button = &lt;button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={signIn}&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;;
  }

  return (

    &lt;div className="row mb-4"&gt;
      &lt;div className="col-lg-12"&gt;
        &lt;nav className="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"&gt;
          &lt;a className="navbar-brand" href="#"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;

          &lt;button className="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"&gt;
            &lt;span className="navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/button&gt;

          &lt;div className="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent"&gt;
            &lt;ul className="navbar-nav mr-auto"&gt;
              &lt;li className="nav-item active"&gt;
                &lt;a className="nav-link" href="/"&gt;Home &lt;span className="sr-only"&gt;(current)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li className="nav-item"&gt;
                &lt;a className="nav-link" href="dashboard"&gt;Movies&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;div className="form-inline my-2 my-lg-0"&gt;
              {button}
            &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code>   

<p>The simplest way to see if a user is logged in is to check if the session exists by calling <code>useSession()</code> from <code>next-auth</code>. If it does, you present the user with the option to log out using the <code>signOut()</code> function. If it does not, you present the user with a login button that ties into the <code>signIn()</code> function you used on the <code>Unauthorized</code> component.</p>

<p>You can tie everything together by creating your pages. By default, Next.js should have added an <code>index.tsx</code> file. (Well, really, it added <code>index.js</code> but you should have changed the extension to <code>.tsx</code> already.) You can replace the code in that file with the code below.</p>

   <code>import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

import Header from '../components/Header'

export default function Home() {

  return (
    &lt;div className="container"&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Movies By Nik - Find Your Next Movie&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;

      &lt;div className="row"&gt;
        &lt;div className="col-lg-12"&gt;
          &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code>   

<p>Here you are giving any user a landing page to display what your site is about and using the header to provide a login button if necessary.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to create a dashboard page. Start by creating a new file in the <code>pages</code> directory called <code>dashboard.tsx</code>. This page will need to check if the user has access to the page and display the <code>Unauthorized</code> component if not and the <code>Movies</code> component if they are. You can add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react'

import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

import Header from '../components/Header'
import Unauthorized from '../components/Unauthorized'
import Movies from '../components/Movies'

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Dashboard() {

    const [session, loading] = useSession();

    var content = session ? &lt;Movies&gt;&lt;/Movies&gt; : &lt;Unauthorized&gt;&lt;/Unauthorized&gt;

    return (
        &lt;div className="container"&gt;
            &lt;Head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Movies By Nik - Find Your Next Movie&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
            &lt;/Head&gt;

            &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;

            {content}

        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
</code>   

<p>As you learned already, the easiest way to check if a user is authenticated is to check if the <code>session</code> exists.</p>

 Test and Conclusions 

<p>You should be ready to start your application now. From the command line run <code>npm run-script dev</code> and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should be presented with the home screen for the application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next click on the Movies link. You should receive a message telling you that you don’t have access to the dashboard. Click Sign in and select Okta then log in with your Okta credentials. You should be redirected to the dashboard page showing you some of the greatest movies in history.</p>

<p></p>

<p>From here you can continue to build on your react components and develop your API to support your frontend knowing that your application is safe and secure with Okta’s authentication.</p>

  <p>This talk aims to share the experience achieved during&nbsp;Q-Secure Net, a 2020's project co-financed by the European Institute of Technology (EIT) and Italtel, Cefriel, Politecnico di Milano, CNR, UPM and Telefonica. Q-Secure Net will provide a cost-effective and flexible network solution for&nbsp;unconditionally secure communication services&nbsp;based on&nbsp;Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)&nbsp;thought for fiber-optic networks.</p>
<p>The talk will also present an application of&nbsp;Blockchain Atomic Swaps&nbsp;for the exchange of securities and cryptocurrencies, developed in the project and based on QKD. Atomic Swaps have great potentials for financial scenarios regarding securities, crypto exchanges and cryptocurrencies but have specific security threats.</p>
<p>The QKD market is expected to grow over $980 million by 2024. In the long term, the QKD will be strategic for the design of new architectures in many sectors like telco, defence and transports and 5G sectors. QKD's infrastructural security and its ability to mitigate cyber-risks, also allow a whole new class of approaches and applications for Decentralised Finance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QKD Features</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capabilities for Fintech applications</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atomic Swap and Crypto Exchanges</p>

  <p>Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for cybersecurity tasks are attracting greater attention from the private and the public&nbsp;sectors. Estimates indicate that the market for AI in cybersecurity&nbsp;will grow from US$1 billion in 2016 to a US$34.8 billion net&nbsp;worth by 2025. The latest national cybersecurity and defence strategies of several governments explicitly mention AI capabili-&nbsp;ties. At the&nbsp;same time, initiatives to define new standards and certification procedures to elicit users’ trust in AI are emerging&nbsp;on a global scale. However, trust in AI (both machine learning and neural networks)&nbsp;to deliver cybersecurity tasks is a double-&nbsp;edged sword: it can improve substantially cybersecurity practices, but can also facilitate new forms of attacks to the AI applica-&nbsp;tions themselves, which may&nbsp;pose severe security threats. We argue that trust in AI for cybersecurity is unwarranted and that,&nbsp;to reduce security risks, some form of control to ensure the deployment of ‘reliable AI’ for&nbsp;cybersecurity is necessary. To this&nbsp;end, we offer three recommendations focusing on the design, development and deployment of AI for cybersecurity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_taddeo"></a>

  <p>Security is Culture – and culture starts with people (not technology!) The complex topic of SAP-security is a massive challenge for the almost 500.000 companies worldwide using SAP. The challenges are the same for everyone, and it is the combined corporate responsibility of the C-Level and all employees to protect the enterprise from threats. These core applications can be secured by focusing on the 3 main attack vectors: People, Processes, and Technology. Within this keynote, Jochen Fischer shares what needs to be done to define clear ownership and responsibilities for SAP-security. Enabling people to understand the risk in SAP is fundamental to design a sustainable strategy that is based on the individual risk profile of each individual company. It is time to stop the monkey business when it comes to mission-critical topics like security. As independent expert, Jochen Fischer provides state-of-the-art methodologies to deliver the right people the suitable skills required to protect SAP without burning money on tools that have no or limited effect on corporate cyber resilience.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_fischer"></a>

					 <p>Not to mention, open standards make good business. The ICP/IP protocol the internet runs on is an open standard that beat out the proprietary Microsoft protocols. HTTP is another standard—any browser can visit any website because of it. Bluetooth is another standard—any headphones can connect to any phone, which makes both the headphones and the phone more valuable as a result.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Standards enable the Trinsic platform to interoperate with other self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials platforms. For example, if the State of California were to use Trinsic to issue digital driver’s licenses, any business or organization that needed to verify those licenses (such as a pharmacy when people pick up certain prescriptions) would not need to necessarily use the Trinsic platform to do so and vice versa. Any developer that uses the Trinsic platform—including <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">Trinsic’s APIs</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>, and the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>—will inherit <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-commitment-to-interoperability-ahead-of-iiw/">interoperability with solutions</a> that also implements open, community-driven SSI standards.</p>

					 <p>Standards also enable us to avoid vendor lock-in. The State of California probably doesn’t want to force all its constituents to download a specific company’s digital wallet to store the driver’s license. Instead, it will want its citizens to have the freedom to choose from a variety of apps. (It may help to imagine if the whole internet was run by Microsoft, and you had to have a Microsoft device in order to access government services. That wouldn’t fly, because at that point Microsoft would be a monopoly.)<br><br></p><p>Not only would the State of California probably want its constituents to be able to choose from a variety of digital wallets, it would want its constituents to have the ability to leave their current wallet provider and switch to another at any time they wish without losing their credentials during the transition. The Trinsic Wallet is one of the first SSI digital wallets to provides its end users with the <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">import/export of credentials</a> functionality.<br><br></p><p>There are two kinds of standards that Trinsic implements to enable interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in: data model standards and protocol standards.</p>

					 <p>Computers are very precise, so it’s important they have a model for how data is structured. For (an oversimplified) example, if you had a database that stores data like this:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>

					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Then you will run in to problems if you try to insert the following into the database:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				{e-mail: ‘Joehd@gmail.com’, date_of_birth: ‘10/22/91’, f_name: ‘Joe’, zodiac: ‘aries’}			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>If you needed to share user databases with other people in an industry, you would need to form a standards body (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">W3C</a> or <a href="https://www.computer.org/">IEEE</a>, etc.) to agree on what data will be collected, what order it appears in, how it’s spelled, punctuation, etc. The more specific the use case, the easier it is to standardize.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two fundamentally important standards that Trinsic uses, both developed at the W3C:<br><br></p>  <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs): DIDs are the identifiers used in SSI. They don’t store any data. Think of them as a username, a phone number, an IP address, or any other identifier—except they don’t need a central registry to authorize them. In SSI, every person has a new DID for each relationship they have. And the issuers of credentials have a public DID with a reputation so verifiers can trust it.  <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable credentials</a>: This is data that an issuer attests about you and signs with their DID. This same thing happens with the DMV in real life—they issue you a credential that others can verify is legit. Only now, there’s a digital version in addition to the plastic. Verifiable credentials answer the question “says who?”.

					 <p>Once we’re using the same data model, we must figure out how to communicate. Theoretically, I could export my verifiable credentials out of my wallet onto a thumb drive and upload them into your wallet (if it supports the verifiable credentials data model), so you can check them out. But clearly, using common protocols is better than that.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 DID Communications 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>DIDComm is an important standard protocol that lets a DID have secure communications with another DID. DIDComm started in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> community and recently moved to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>. Every action the Trinsic platform enables, whether it be creating secure connections or verifying a credential, uses some number of DIDComm.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Aries RFCs 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>At the core of the Trinsic platform is the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>. The .NET implementation is a collection of implemented standards based on the Hyperledger Aries RFCs (Request for Comment) documents. This is a project that is meant to make apps and clients that can interact with a variety of distributed ledgers. All of the protocol specifications can be found in the&nbsp;aries-rfcs&nbsp;repo here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A protocol is a step-by-step process to accomplish a task. If it’s not followed exactly correctly by either side, the process will fail. I’ll give an example of a university issuing a student ID to someone.<br><br></p>  School sends a&nbsp;credential offer&nbsp;to&nbsp;student<br><br>  Student responds with a&nbsp;credential request&nbsp;to the school, to confirm<br><br>  School sends a&nbsp;issue credential&nbsp;message to the student, which includes the credential  <p><br>Trinsic doesn’t have to implement every Aries RFC. But if we implement a feature that can be done in a way that follows an RFC, we will follow the RFC to do so so that it’s interoperable with other implementations.</p>

					 <p>As SSI continues to mature, the number of related standards will increase and existing standards will evolve.

<p>This coming weekend, 13-15 November 2020, will see the first ever <a href="https://www.odyssey.org/momentum/">Odyssey Momentum</a> event. It will be an online mass collaboration that reimagines what a typically physical event, such as a hackathon, looks like in the pandemic era. Occurring over 49 hours and featuring 105 teams, <a href="https://www.odyssey.org/#challenges">21 challenges</a> and more than 2,000 participants, Odyssey Momentum will take place completely online.</p>



<p>It will also see the premiere of <a href="https://cherrytwist.org">Cherrytwist</a>, a self-hosted open source challenge management platform that gives ecosystems the power to manage their innovation challenges, community, grants and projects portfolio effectively. Cherrytwist is backed by a non-profit foundation of the same name and supported by Jolocom self-sovereign identity (SSI) technology.</p>



<p>The problem that the Cherrytwist platform seeks to solve is a timely one. Not just for this online-only outing of the well-regarded <a href="https://www.odyssey.org/about/">Odyssey</a> events but also for the wider world. That is, that any challenge, being a problem to be solved or overcome, requires diverse skills and talents to collaborate, making step by step progress towards the end goal. The team brought together to do this will need to share knowledge and expertise, communicate and feedback. They will need to interact, working from the same shared context and agreements in a trusted environment.</p>



<p>TL;DR – Managing complex challenges is, well, challenging. Currently, they tend to be managed in an ad-hoc way, with meetings held via Zoom or Microsoft Teams, collaborative copy created on Google Docs, spreadsheets shared via email and so on.</p>



<p>Taking a highly decentralized and fully open source approach, Cherrytwist offers a platform for managing challenges in a neutral way. Its vision is to enable a vibrant community that comes together, giving everyone the opportunity to fully contribute to the complex challenges we face today. Additionally, it seeks to unleash the potential for innovation that comes when all team members can build on, refine and improve each others’ contributions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://cherrytwist.org/about/">Cherrytwist Foundation</a> is led by Rutger van Zuidam, who also runs the Odyssey hackathons, Neil Smyth, technical director at the YES!Delft Digital Hub, and Shell’s former chief digital officer, Rene Honig. It was their shared belief in the need to find a better way to organise society that drove the establishment of the foundation in June 2020.</p>



<p>Since then, progress has been rapid. This has been primarily driven by the goal of hosting the Odyssey Momentum event on top of the Cherrytwist platform. With that achieved, participants in Momentum will then be free to continue to collaborate effectively after the event, by having persistent and shared representation of all the hackathon’s challenges.</p>



<p>Before work started on Cherrytwist, however, its guiding principles needed to be set. Foremost among these were that it needed to be Web 3.0 powered but Web 2.0 compatible. To put this in very simple terms, that means it would work for anyone now, using accounts, logins and so on, but that it would be ready for the re-decentralized Internet, running self-sovereign identities behind the scenes.</p>



<p>Cherrytwist aims to help the transition from the current centralised reality for digital identities, smoothing the path to the self-sovereign future. To do this, the platform was designed with SSI in mind, not only to leverage its capabilities for Web 3.0 but also because such a structural change is not something that can be retrofitted. It has to be foundation.</p>



<p>After evaluating SSI options, Cherrytwist chose to integrate our Jolocom SDK into its software to enable <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/">SSI-based identity</a>. As a result the Cherrytwist platform is designed so that all the key entities within or engaging with Cherrytwist will get their own SSI, be they individual users or groups, projects, challenges and so on. These identities will be used to execute all the key actions taken within Cherrytwist, such as committing to a project.</p>



<p>As everything within Cherrytwist is identified using SSI logic, and every interaction happening uses SSI, this creates a trail of past events, exchanges and transactions that can be accumulated by each identity. That then creates a higher level of control over the whole challenge-solving process.</p>



<p>Initially the platform will manage the identities in a guardian role, acting when authorised. For now, this role is only there out of necessity. Wider society is not yet using SSI. But the sooner the platform can hand over responsibility for the digital identities to the identity owners the better say Cherrytwist – and so do we.</p>



<p>Cherrytwist is very much set up to make sure that it’s the users themselves who are in control. When starting to address a challenge, users will define the challenge within an ecoverse – essentially a hosting environment for challenges. And the vision is that there will soon be many ecoverse instances, each hosting their own challenges. Any organisation is free to create its own Cherrytwist instance. It is open source, after all.</p>



<p>This means there is no central player who needs to be trusted or counted upon and that, because this is an <a href="https://github.com/cherrytwist">open source and community driven development</a>, it’s very safe and very accountable. Plus, you will always be able to see who’s been interacting with your challenge – who was involved and who was doing what when – creating transparency about who’s contributing what.</p>



<p>In short, Cherrytwist gives its users full data ownership. Once initiated, the platform becomes yours to create a fully decentralized challenge environment.</p>



<p>Throughout the journey so far, we’ve been helping the Cherrytwist Foundation as it has formulated its approach to SSI, facilitating the integration of the Jolocom stack and supporting through regular calls and technical guidance. Further, we have been able to leverage our network and connect Cherrytwist with other initiatives looking to ease the transition to a self-sovereign future.</p>



<p>For us, this whole experience has been a great opportunity to showcase our work at so highly regarded an event as the Odyssey hackathons, and in such an ambitious endeavour. It’s also a perfect way to show how easily the Jolocom stack can be integrated, setting the foundations for SSI-enabled interactions. And finally, it’s been a privilege to be such an integral part of so big a project, particularly one that will be unveiled to so influential an audience.</p>



<p>Now, with Odyssey Momentum due to kick off in only a matter of hours, we can sit back and relax, a little. Good luck to all involved – sponsors, organisers, teams and participants. We can’t wait to see what happens next.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> is a stable identifier in form of an URI that introduces a level of indirection for key management and managing other useful information such as service endpoints. It means, you can rotate and add properties related to your DID and validators can find out about those changes. Trust is usually rooted in a Blockchain but some DID methods exist that don’t require any on-chain transactions. Consequently, when we speak about a DID, then we need to be more precise and also speak about the particular DID method of that DID which defines the CRUD operations on a target system such as Ethereum. Depending on the privacy, security, scalability and other guarantees, developers can choose from a variety of different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>By resolving a DID a validator can typically discover the authoritative keys for different purposes or more generally, a set of verification methods for that DID. An Ethereum account could be a verification method as well. Service endpoints are extensible by design, so you could define your own ones if needed. However, the DID community has agreed on a set of well known service endpoints. Amongst them, the DIDComm service endpoint solves the how-to-reach-me problem and can be used to establish a secure communication channel with the other party. Despite there are only a few limitations of what properties can be associated with a DID, privacy regulations such as GDPR need to be considered very carefully.</p> If I had a Phone Book with DIDs&nbsp;… <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages</a><p>So, what happens if you had a corporate registry (or phone book) where all companies had their own DIDs and please note, the phone book should not expand on individuals for privacy reasons. You would be able to start to interact with them or more specifically with their agents by just knowing their DIDs. An agent is a piece of software that runs on behalf of their controller and manages DIDs, their associated private keys, relationships with other agents and other credentials. The <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/daf">DID Agent Framework (DAF)</a> was developed by the identity team at ConsenSys AG (former uPort) and provides an agent framework for different architectures (frontend, backend, mobile, hybrid deployments using method delegation such as to support remote KMS/HSM). These agent-to-agent interactions will be secured using state-of-the-art cryptography regardless of the chosen transport channel. This approach is called <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/guide/">DIDComm Messaging</a> which originated in the Hyperledger foundation and is now being specified as V2 by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) as a pre-standard. DIDComm Messaging provides a secure communication channel between two agents. After a channel has been established, well defined message-based sub-protocols can be used to make more sense of the interaction, e.g., to increase the trustworthiness of the other&nbsp;party.</p> How to trust the Phone Book&nbsp;entries? Illustrates different steps in an agent-based system<p>The Hyperledger Aries project has defined a couple of DIDComm Messaging sub-protocols as Hyperledger Aries RFCs to build a decentralized reputation network based on the global <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) standard and specifications developed in DIF such as <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">DIF Credential Manifest</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">DIF Presentation Exchange</a>. Reputation is established by issuing, collecting, revoking, verifying the provenance of attestations and proving control over attestations which use the W3C VC data model. Be it the company’s home address, group membership, relationships with other company departments or with the umbrella company, subscriptions, contracts with other parties, invoices — literally, there is no limitation in what can be attested. Agents can be integrated with existing systems and work flows to enforce policies (e.g. based on attestations), obtain consent and acquire additional input data at certain steps in these sub-protocols.</p><p>If none of the existing sub-protocols in HL Aries fit, one could define a new sub-protocol. If the problem to solve is general enough, e.g. because it is used by a larger community such as by Baseline, it will be possible to register these sub-protocols in the didcomm.org registry for more visibility. It is certainly possible to use DIDs and VCs without DIDComm Messaging and add a domain-specific service endpoint to the DID that offers the&nbsp;service.</p><p>Other approaches exist that allow bi-directional binding DNS names to DIDs. For example, this can be accomplished by signalling support for the <a href="https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/">DIF DID Configuration</a> specification in the service endpoint section of the DID. The endpoint would point to a JSON file hosted under a well-known URL of that domain that contains cryptographic binding between the DID and the domain protected by existing TLS certificates (i.e. Internet PKI). This ensures that a specific DID belongs to a web origin, e.g. example.com, in a fully GDPR-compliant manner.</p><blockquote>did = client.discoverDid(‘www.acme.com’)</blockquote><p>Nevertheless, this approach can be combined with the aforementioned HL Aries approach to build trust beyond DNS because we all know that the trust layer of the Internet is broken. However, leveraging the existing Internet PKI could be a good starting point to discover DIDs for certain domains until more natural trust anchors such as the <a href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/1._panel_-_daniel_du_seuil.pdf">European Commission (ESSIF)</a> or <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/gleif-uport-test-verified-data-exchange-in-financial-and-commercial-transactions/">GLEIF</a> start to build a trust framework rooted in DIDs and&nbsp;VCs.</p> Is this Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI)? <p>You might have noticed that we have not mentioned the term Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) so far. This is because DIDs, VCs and DIDComm Messaging don’t necessarily require an end-user wallet to have useful applications which are typically associated with SSI. However, people could use the same approach to provide end-user apps (mobile, PWA, browser extensions, web services) that operate as their own agents to manage their SSI&nbsp;wallets.</p> Relationship with&nbsp;ENS <p>DIDs and VCs are great for off-chain use cases but they are not great on-chain. This is where <a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name Service (ENS)</a> still can make sense. ENS is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. On the other hand, if all you need is off-chain verification of an Ethereum account and that the account belongs to a company, then you don’t need ENS. Also note that ENS has a few design flaws which can be mitigated when an agent-based system architecture is&nbsp;used:</p>  DNSSEC oracle is not always up-to-date (specifically when the domain owner changed) which represents a security vulnerability.  Stored ENS records are hashes but they are not salted (for practical reasons), so it is questionable if this complies with&nbsp;GDPR.  Most ENS records are not verified, e.g., everyone could claim anything.  No L2 solution exists for updates (not yet) and therefore higher transaction costs can be expected.  No version history of ENS records is kept (without examining the ledger state history itself), e.g., it is not easy to find an older version of a public key which could be useful in order to (re-)verify historical data.  <p>If a system already uses ENS, then it could make sense to use ENS, DIDs, VCs and DIDComm Messaging together by adding a DID TXT record to an ENS entry. So, developers could use the ENS name as a lookup key to find other DIDs. Then, they could find out more about the reputation of that ENS name, or execute other off-chain protocols with their agent. A dedicated DID registrar contract for ENS might not be required because the linkage between the ENS name and the DID could be verified off-chain by other means (e.g.,&nbsp;VCs).</p> The DIDComm-agent Way&nbsp;… <p>The technologies described in this article can be used with SSI but are not strictly limited to end-user focused use cases.

  <p>Organizations face challenges in scaling <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/2-megatrends-dominate-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2020/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> projects because they lack the requisite skills, collaboration, tooling and know-how to create and manage a robust, production-grade AI pipeline.</p>
<p>Through 2023, Gartner estimates that 50% of IT leaders will struggle to move their AI projects past proof of concept (POC) to a production level of maturity.&nbsp;To reduce this high failure rate, organizations need to build the right roles for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-habits-of-organizations-with-successful-ai/">AI success</a>.</p>
<p>“In many organizations, data scientists are still wearing too many hats due to a dearth of talent across other roles,” said<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/41189"> Arun Chandrasekaran</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner, during his session at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/symposium-spain">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 AI is a team sport 
<p>To successfully operationalize and scale AI initiatives, organizations need to build diverse AI roles and skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“AI is a team sport,” said Chandrasekaran. “On their AI team, CIOs and technology innovation leaders need to have data scientists, data engineers and complement the team with AI architects and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/understand-3-key-types-of-machine-learning/">machine learning (ML)</a> engineers. Together they can envision, build, deploy and operationalize an end-to-end ML/AI pipeline.”</p>
<p>That team should never operate in isolation and should collaborate with business domain experts, IT experts, and other relevant staff and stakeholders to deliver successful AI initiatives.</p>
<p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/2-megatrends-dominate-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2020/">2 Megatrends Dominate the Gartner Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence, 2020</a></p>
 Roles of AI architects and ML engineers 
<p>Finding the right resources and how they work together as part of the AI team becomes pivotal for the success of AI projects. Two newer roles are complementing the AI team: AI architects and ML engineers.</p>
<p>The AI architect is laser-focused on the transformational architecture efforts that AI introduces. Their primary responsibility is to orchestrate the deployment and management of models in production and provide inputs on the applicability of ML and deep learning models within AI’s various disciplines, such as natural language processing or image recognition.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz00N2ZiMjJlNTFmNWExMWViYmRlMmRiODA5ZDk5OGE3YQ=="> </a></p>
<p>Because ML is the most utilized AI initiative, organizations are also increasingly hiring ML engineers as part of the AI team. They can move ML solutions in production and optimize the environment for performance and scalability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through 2023, the ML engineer role will be the fastest-growing role in the AI/ML space. Gartner estimates that today there is one ML engineer for every 10 data scientists, and it will likely change to between 5 and 10 by 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“ML engineers need to ensure that AI platforms deliver against technical and business SLA requirements,” said Chandrasekaran. “ML engineers are expected to be the connecting fabric with data scientists from an IT perspective and ensure their ML models run well in production.”</p>

<p>Over the past months Mydex CIC has been <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/">working for the Scottish Government</a> on a strategy for implementing and scaling a system of ‘smart entitlements’ for the citizens of Scotland.</p><p>The Smart Entitlements concept is very simple. Its goal is to create a common, easy approach for citizens to access public services that is consistent across multiple service providers. To achieve this, it provides citizens with the ability to store their personal information in an Attribute (or personal data) Store which they own and control. Using this Attribute Store, citizens are able collect, receive and keep verified data about themselves and subsequently allow its reuse (if relevant) when they seek to access or use other public services.</p><p>Practically speaking, under the proposed system service providers would a) generate a secure electronic tokens that verify facts about a citizen (such as proofs of their address, age, disability or educational qualification), b) provide these tokens to citizens to be held safely in the citizen’s own attribute/personal data store, so that c) citizens can share these tokens with other service providers, under their control, as and when they are&nbsp;needed.</p><p>The benefits could be&nbsp;immense.</p>  Citizens would have to spend much less time and effort trying to find, present and prove information — filling in endless forms — and would also find the process less stressful and yes, sometimes less humiliating.  Organisations could use the process to reduce unnecessary data processing, verification of data entered into forms, all the duplicated effort, and errors that come from forms, enabling them to do more with&nbsp;less.  And the Government itself would benefit from the creation of a safe, efficient, privacy-protecting data sharing infrastructure that would support its inclusive growth and wellbeing agenda, while providing it with the digital capabilities to respond to new situations as they arise — such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  <p>In a separate project we proved that, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">technically speaking, it is indeed feasible</a> for service providers to generate verified attributes and for citizens to store them in an Attribute Store. (A ‘verified attribute’ is any piece of information about a person or performance that has been generated or checked by a responsible trustworthy body and made available to another party in such a manner as to be trustable as a specific attribute.) This approach is already being put into practice <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">in other projects</a> working with groups of organisations serving the same&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>But is such an approach operationally feasible? Could it work at scale? And how to achieve that&nbsp;scale?</p> A roadmap for&nbsp;success <p>The good news is that we have identified a way to achieve all the&nbsp;above.</p><p>It involves some technical things like creating metadata standards to make sure data is machine readable and to ensure clarity about levels of assurance about the data ( including descriptions of how the data was collected, created, protected and verified). But essentially, it boils down to identifying a good place to start (for example, focusing on attributes that are widely used by many services and are easy to mint and share) — and then getting on with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Crucially, it is do-able, now. There are no critical technical, operational or legal obstacles stopping Scottish Government from being able to implement this approach with immediate effect which is why they are able to move ahead with their Beta Phase during&nbsp;2021.</p><p>The details of this approach are laid out <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Smart-Entitlements-Research-Recommendations-and-Report-for-the-Scottish-Government-FINAL.pdf">in this report</a>. But its core features are&nbsp;simple.</p><p>First, Scottish Government agencies, departments and initiatives such as the National Entitlement Card, local authorities, housing associations and the Scottish Qualifications Authority have all the data that’s needed to deliver critical mass. Other bodies and agencies, such as Social Security Scotland, can always add additional data to the system as it grows and matures, as well as accessing verified attributes (with citizens’ permissions) for their own service provision purposes.</p><p>By enabling these agencies and departments to share data via citizens’ Attribute (personal data) Stores, the recommended approach minimises dependencies and maximises agency for the citizen. It can be done, now, by the Scottish Government without needing the permission or cooperation of other bodies. And it enables the Government to independently pursue its own agenda and policies.</p><p>Second, it can be done without major disruption and risk. The recommended strategy does not require any significant changes to existing back office systems that provide attributes or consume them. Instead, it connects these existing systems with a new piece of infrastructure (Attribute Stores) that join the data dots, adding a new layer of capability, flexibility and opportunity as they do&nbsp;so.</p><p>At the same time, it can proceed incrementally, taking one step at a time, so that the risks of big leaps into the unknown are avoided. Instead, it allows for a test-and-learn approach that builds momentum, impact and benefits over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Third, taking this incremental step-by-step approach brings immediate benefits for the uses of data that are initially prioritised while setting the right course for the future. The more service providers, verified data points and citizens that are involved, the more it builds the infrastructure and capabilities needed to bring further benefits. Once this infrastructure and processes have been put in place, an increasing number and range of attributes and attribute providers can be added incrementally, thereby expanding the number of use cases that can be supported and benefits that can be realised.</p><p>Fourth, in doing this, it generates powerful win-wins. All the key stakeholders involved — citizens, service providers and Government — benefit from doing&nbsp;it.</p><p>The Scottish Government is now <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/">launching a Beta Phase</a> to take this initiative to its next steps. The opportunities it presents are&nbsp;huge.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-way-forward-for-personal-data-6251d1503bdd">A Way Forward for Personal Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The world is caught between high expectations, futuristic fears, and non-legally binding recommendations on how to proceed with AI development and management. This means that although technologies are advancing and that many use cases are being proven effective to support enterprise data management, security, interactions with customers, and many more customized solutions per industry, most organizations are hesitant to board the AI train. For many, they do not feel they have enough guidance to launch a future-proof AI project. For the moment, all we have is a growing collection of AI governance frameworks from reputable groups such as the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai/principles/" title="OECD">OECD </a>and the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/640163/EPRS_BRI(2019)640163_EN.pdf" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>. These provide valuable insight into what concepts should be front and center of any AI project and are the precursors to legislation. But better will be when governments and regulators clearly specify what is required for a robust, trustworthy, and human-centric model to be developed and used in a business context.</p>
 Edging Closer to a Regulation 
<p>On October 20th 2020, the European Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20201016IPR89544/parliament-leads-the-way-on-first-set-of-eu-rules-for-artificial-intelligence" title="European Parliament Vote">voted on and accepted</a> recommendations on what should be addressed in a future legislation, the proposal of which is expected in early 2020. <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0186_EN.html#title3" title="Guiding Principles">The guiding principles</a> that were agreed upon are: a human-centric and human-made AI; safety, transparency, and accountability; respect for privacy and data protection.</p>
<p>A risk-assessment that defines different levels of risk caused by an AI system may be used to further regulate high-risk AI technologies. The higher the risk a system poses because of malfunction, malicious action, or because of its intended purpose, the higher the regulatory oversight and responsibility an implementing organization could carry. This is one option that could help facilitate the proposed requirement of human oversight at any time for high-risk AI technologies.</p>
<p>A separate proposal discusses a "<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0178_EN.html" title="Future-oriented Framework">future-oriented civil liability framework</a>" that would clarify and reconsider liability of self-learning algorithms in relation to developers, implementing organizations, and users. The Product Liability Directive (PLD) is one regulation that could serve as a starting point, and eventually be adapted to offer protection regarding digital and AI-based products. The framework that defines liability will have to be extended to include distinctions of frontend and backend operators, both of which would be held liable proportionately to the degree of control that each holds with the model's operation. Overall, liability should be proportionate with a model's risk, which requires clearly defined risk categories that models can be assessed by. Insurance coverage must also adapt, and the proposal suggests that the European Commission work closely with the insurance sector to find policies that offer sufficient protection.</p>
 Learn How to Prepare 
<p>These proposals are promising in that they show movement by the European Parliament, edging closer to a regulation. But these proposals did not have any surprises in them -- they are a natural extension of the European AI governance conversation. AI governance will continue to formalize, and if you want to know how to get started, join KuppingerCole's <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cybernetixworld2020" title="AI Workshop at cybernetix.world 2020">workshop on AI Governance on November 24th at cybernetix.world 2020</a>.</p>

 Dilemma of Smart Wallet and Different Approaches <p>Writer: Xiang&nbsp;Yao</p><p>From Subscribe: Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend</p><p>Hi, friends. It’s been two months since the last update. Yield farming has attracted so much attention and also has a significant impact on the development of Smart Wallets. As I mentioned in the last column, the Smart Wallet operators will stop unrestricted subsidy, and they need to find new approaches for continuous growth. Several means were proposed, such as using targeted subsidy, building a billing system, and finding L2 integration solutions.</p> Response to congestion <p>The good news is many smart wallets are taking positive&nbsp;actions.</p> Gas policy&nbsp;updated   Dharma has ended unrestricted subsidy for all transactions except for specific ones.&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.dharma.io/update-to-dharma-gas-policy/">link</a>  Authereum has asked the new users to pay the deployment fee.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/authereum/gas-policy-update-2-650fc4faf549">link</a>  Argent only pays for security operations.  Dapper will no longer be subsidizing gas for non-Dapper Labs developed games. Some non-core CryptoKitties functions and <a href="https://medium.com/dapperlabs/gas-policy-update-for-dapper-ethereum-117a7474a423">will no longer subsidize</a> gas for the ‘approve’ function on CryptoKitties. <a href="https://support.dapperlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055953573-Gas-Policy-Update-Sept-24-20-">link</a>   Layer 2 solution integrated   Gnosis just released the Safe Multisig on the xdaichain. <a href="https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4552860-how-to-use-the-gnosis-safe-on-xdai-with-metamask">link</a>   New blockchain supported   MYKEY features TRON Network as the third smart contract layer.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/mykey-the-first-smart-wallet-on-tron-starts-a-public-beta-come-to-claim-airdrop-9eea5cd31fa9">link</a>   A new competitor with a low-cost creation&nbsp;feature   Loopring updates optimized the wallet smart contacts reducing the cost of creation. <a href="https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-monthly-update-2020-09-a6c4fae84146">link</a>   What did wallets&nbsp;do? <p>I’ve been keeping an eye on each smart wallets’ development, especially on their response to the high network fee problem. This section will talk about my observation about active smart wallets and thinking in the next section — sort by the number of registered users.</p> Dapper Labs <p>It seems that Dapper Labs is making a concentrated effort to build its public ledger, Flow. However, they still own the most users among all smart wallets, reaching 38,000, and has a stable growth(nearly 40 new users per day) not affected by the congestion. One reason is the contract is quite simple and only spend 135k gas, less than other wallets. Many new users come in most congestion days, such as Sep. 3rd, nearly 150 newcomers signed up to enjoy free transactions.</p><p>However, like other wallets, Dapper cut the subsidies. It only provides limited free transactions for Crypto Kitties, and users need to pay for the transaction pass for other types of transactions.</p> Argent <p>The number of Argent users increased from 20,000 to 30,000 rapidly in only two months starting from June, which seems they can get the first chair over Dapper soon. The unexpected congestion blocked the process. In the beginning, all transactions in the Argent app is free, but the <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/blog/gas-fair-use-policy-update/">“painfully high gas price” cost them $400K only in July</a>. They used three ways to achieve balanced costs and revenues.</p>  Users need to pay for most transactions. The transfer and Dapps’ actions will charge users in ETH, DAI, USDC, BAT, ZRX, WBTC, REP. However, Dapps can offer free gas to Argent users, as Maker&nbsp;does.  Explore Layer 2 solutions. Argent announces that they’re researching Layer 2 opportunities and working with the best team in the space. This would benefit for the high cost of the gas&nbsp;fee.  Introduce commissioned aggregated trade. Argent <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/blog/the-best-way-to-trade/">launched a massive upgrade</a> that users can trade any token pair at the best market rate, earning <a href="https://www.chainnews.com/articles/997517812123.htm">a 0.15% commission fee</a> from each transaction.   MYKEY <p>MYKEY is deployed in multiple public chains based on <a href="https://github.com/mykeylab/keyid-eth-contracts/tree/master/contracts">KEY-ID protocol</a>. On Sep. 9th, it <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/mykey-the-first-smart-wallet-on-tron-starts-a-public-beta-come-to-claim-airdrop-9eea5cd31fa9">features TRON network</a> as the third infrastructure after EOS and Ethereum and reaching 6,000 new users in the first&nbsp;month.</p><p>TRON’s integration makes it cheaper to deposit and withdraw USDT. The cost will be covered by MYKEY relayer, so users enjoy the free transaction.</p> Gnosis <p>Gnosis has a <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-protocol-and-xdai-partnership-1de0e48fb14b">partnership </a>with xdai. As part of the partnership, Gnosis has invested in the xDai Ecosystem Fund to become significant holders of the STAKE Governance token. The xDai chain is an EVM based Ethereum sidechain following Proof-of-Authority consensus.</p><p>After that, Gnosis <a href="https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4552860-how-to-use-the-gnosis-safe-on-xdai-with-metamask">released </a>the Safe Multisig on the xdaichain to provide instant transactions with low network&nbsp;fees.</p> Dharma <p>Dharma is against the trend that in the most congestion period, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dharma_HQ/status/1288853793493250048">subsiding Uniswap trade transactions since July 30</a>. “Never miss a trade. Never pay for gas.” The <a href="https://twitter.com/Dharma_HQ/status/1288853801776984064">slogan</a> ends <a href="https://blog.dharma.io/update-to-dharma-gas-policy/">on Oct 23</a>, defining “Never” as 86&nbsp;days.</p><p>However, the free use of Uniswap brings unexpected trouble. Uniswap airdropped 400 UNI to all users who had been using its product. Unfortunately, Dharma users <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/retroactive-airdrop-excludes-proxy-contract-users-e-g-dharma-matcha-etc/1222">are not eligible to claim UNI token</a> because only addresses which directly called the Uniswap contracts were considered users. 2,833 Dharma users were affected. Dharma carried out a <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-excluded-proxy-contract-airdrop-phase-1/">Retroactive Airdrop proposal</a> to retroactively distributes 400 UNI to 12,619 distinct addresses who interacted with Uniswap via a proxy contract. Now it’s in the <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2">voting&nbsp;stage</a>.</p><p>In the meanwhile, Dharma has updated <a href="https://blog.dharma.io/dharma-2020-q4-roadmap-update/">Q4 Roadmap.</a> The infrastructure is reconfigured, and after that, Dharma is purely a Smart Wallet rather than a DeFi&nbsp;product.</p>  1. Debit Card Deposits will be unavailable for 1–2 weeks while we build out the new feature set mentioned above  2. <a href="https://blog.dharma.io/introducing-the-dtoken/">dTokens</a>are being deprecated permanently as a means of earning yield in&nbsp;Dharma  3. Our Compound integration (aka Yield tab) and P2P payments system are being temporarily retired   Monolith <p>Monolith <a href="https://medium.com/monolith/closing-the-loop-on-defi-with-monolith-c4954339cda1">integrates </a>fiat-to-crypto exchange to close the loop on&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>It seems there’re no new users since June 1st in the <a href="https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/UaFym3IA7e1qZivL9TNqodqzUbf0tPrdOyXdbBRx">DuneAnalytics</a>. However, it’s a feature to avoid high gas fee. Monolith breaks new wallet creation in two steps: first, create accounts when Ethereum gas price is low; second, initialize when the user registers. The initialization spends much lower gas than deployment, enabling Monolith unaffected by high gas price. And I think it’s a good model case for other projects.</p><p>The most important thing for me is <a href="https://twitter.com/TokenBrice/status/1317123330877566976">TokenBrice</a>, the community manager of Monolith, is stepping down. Best wishes to&nbsp;him!</p> Authereum <p>After changing gas policy three times <a href="https://medium.com/authereum/ethereums-rapidly-changing-gas-market-and-sponsored-transactions-on-authereum-70f496f132a9">1</a><a href="https://medium.com/authereum/gas-policy-update-6c320e28558a">2</a><a href="https://medium.com/authereum/gas-policy-update-2-650fc4faf549">3</a>, Authereum announced <a href="https://medium.com/authereum/authereum-is-out-of-beta-bb66be4f75ad">Authereum V1</a>. However, new users need to pay for registration, and the transfer is not free&nbsp;anymore.</p> Loopring <p>Welcome to the show! Loopring wallets are still delivered to beta-testers, so I cannot make a reasonable evaluation. See the <a href="https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-monthly-update-2020-09-a6c4fae84146">post</a> and look forward to the public&nbsp;version.</p> Around the&nbsp;wallets   Snapshot <a href="https://twitter.com/SnapshotLabs/status/1317366931502944257">added support</a> for EIP-1271 so users can vote from a smart contract wallet. However, I failed and got “Wrong Signature Error.” Now the issue is being&nbsp;fixed.  <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/6b15a3da608cb49e271d6f7a9fe8422629bb4c0c/EIPS/eip-3023.md">EIP-3023</a> was proposed to provide a registry for checking if a contract is a user wallet. This can avoid sending mistakes and statistical errors.  Layer 2 solutions based on zkRollup have rapid progress.  Matter Labs and Curve <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/curve-zksync-l2-ethereums-first-user-defined-zk-rollup-smart-contract-5a72c496b350">unveiled </a>a zkSync L2 smart contracts testnet with Curve Finance as the first resident&nbsp;dapp.  Hermez published its <a href="https://blog.hermez.io/the-hermez-white-paper-is-out/">whitepaper</a>.  StarkWare delivered <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/hello-cairo-3cb43b13b209">Cario</a>, the first production-grade platform for generating STARK proofs for general computation. Also, they spoke out their consideration of <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/the-road-to-l2-interoperability-718ff69ec822">L2 interoperability</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/the-optimistic-rollup-dilemma-c8fc470ca10c">Optimistic Rollup</a>.  Aztec announced <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-zkrollup-layer-2-privacy-1978e90ee3b6">Aztec 2.0</a>, a scaling solution with privacy allowing users to send token privately with ~300&nbsp;tx/s.   What’s the next&nbsp;step? <p>The gas price is quite low now but we’ll never go back. As I mentioned in the last post, we can’t enjoy free transactions on Ethereum anymore, unless…?

 Overview of Smart Wallet Development <p>Writer: Xiang&nbsp;Yao</p><p>From Subscribe: Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend</p> Abstract <p>Smart Wallet is a path to mainstream for the cryptocurrency. Using a smart contract as an account to interact with blockchain in place of using the private key, Smart Wallet makes it easier to use DeFi and various dapps on blockchain for average users. Smart wallets are rapidly emerging on Ethereum since 2017, namely <a href="https://wallet.gnosis.pm/">Gnosis Multisig</a>, <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Gnosis Safe</a>, <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/">Argent</a>, <a href="https://monolith.xyz/">Monolith</a>, <a href="https://mykey.org/">MYKEY</a>, <a href="https://www.dharma.io/">Dharma</a>, <a href="https://www.meetdapper.com/">Dapper</a>, and <a href="https://authereum.com/">Authereum</a>. Nearly 100,000 accounts are created by these smart wallet operators, holding more than billions of dollars. There’s an obvious trend that more Smart Wallets are designed for consumers, which drives the change in the pattern of blockchain account.</p> The Development of Smart Wallet on&nbsp;Ethereum  What is Smart&nbsp;Wallet? <p>Smart Wallet is the user interface and its underlying smart contract-based blockchain account. With well-designed account logic, Smart Wallet brings exciting features.</p> Stage 0: Crypto Entry before Smart&nbsp;Wallet <p>People use crypto wallets to interact with underlying blockchain. It’s a key management tool, a blockchain browser, and a dapp store where to view and use blockchain applications, such as transfer, staking, lending, etc. Currently, people use the custodial wallet or non-custodial wallet. The essential difference between them is who has the full control of the account, or precisely the private&nbsp;key.</p><p>The custodial wallet offers a traditional internet account rather than a blockchain account. User need to trust the custodian. In contrast, a non-custodial wallet gives back full control to the user, but meanwhile the user can’t enjoy the feature as same as internet products, such as account recovery, transfer limit, whitelist, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>That’s why we need Smart Wallet. With a proximity to the experience of Internet products, Smart Wallet is the potential path to realize such tasks using the smart contract.</p> Stage 1: MultiSig, Smart Wallet for Enterprise <p>Smart Wallet is not a new concept since Multisig Wallet is Smart Wallet indeed. Date back to 2015, Gavin Wood made the first implementation[1] of the MultiSig wallet. Since then, Gnosis, BitGo, Mist, DS Group, Parity made their implementation.</p><p>The goal of MultiSig wallets is to enhance security by a smart contract. The assets are owned by the smart contract, requiring multiple parties predefined to agree on transactions before execution. MultiSig wallets can avoid single failure risk of private key&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>Gnosis Multisig, the most widely adopted MultiSig Wallet, has nearly 4,000 users and has stable growth. Most of them are accounts for crypto funds, companies, exchanges, and foundations. Few individual users use MultiSig wallet unless he/she is a hardcore user or has much&nbsp;money.</p> Stage 2: Gasless, Smart Wallet for&nbsp;Customer <p>Smart Wallets for the customer are emerging rapidly in 2019. According to DuneAnalytics, the Smart Wallets for customers are launching one after another. Argent, Monolith, MYKEY, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Dhamar, and Authereum all go live in 2019. The number of users gained in 2019 is nearly 44,000, while in the first five months of 2020, the number of new users achieves 47,000, showing the sound momentum of&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The trend of user growth of Smart Wallets can be seen in the figure&nbsp;below.</p> The difference between the two generations’ Smart&nbsp;Wallets <p>The biggest difference between the 2nd-generation &amp; the 1st-generation Smart Wallet is that all 2nd-generation Smart Wallets adopts meta-transaction to lower barriers for normal people, or we can say the Smart Wallets for customers is a gasless wallet, so the user doesn’t need to care about the transaction fee. There’s a relayer collecting user’s signed transaction and send it to the blockchain. The relayer service is usually provided by the Smart Wallet’s operator; however, it’s a trustless and permissionless service, which means the relayer can’t forge or tamper with the transaction, and everyone can deploy own relayer without authorization.</p><p>The other difference is reflected in account recovery, transfer limit, transaction batch,&nbsp;etc.</p> Brief Comparative Analysis of Mainstream Smart&nbsp;Wallets  Overview <p>What does the Smart Wallet look like? They’re quite different because they’re designed for different demands. Here’s the brief view of the selected Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Features <p>Every Smart Wallet listed here is a well-designed product with features. Each product needs to be described in detail to fully understand its functionality. However, some features are common: account recovery and gas abstraction.</p> Account Recovery <p>Most of the Smart Wallets(except for Monolith, but in the <a href="https://medium.com/monolith/your-monolith-account-is-due-for-an-upgrade-35b1814a01ed">latest blog</a>, they have a plan to upgrade the protocol to realize recovery function. ) support account recovery, which means you can reset your account through other means. This is quite different from traditional crypto wallets. And most of them provide official recovery service, assist the user in recovering the account after authenticating the user by email or bioinformatics.</p> [In addition from Brice’s comment, who’s working for Monolith]  Since day one Monolith provides account recovery, through the seed phrase only the user knows. We do not have a recovery service yet (like Argent's Guardians).  However, since the seed is known to the user, one can at any time take full control over their wallet without needing Monolith app/services using MetaMask and Etherscan:  <a href="https://medium.com/monolith/importing-using-your-monolith-wallet-with-metamask-and-etherscan-a22862283929">https://medium.com/monolith/importing-using-your-monolith-wallet-with-metamask-and-etherscan-a22862283929</a>  Gas Abstraction <p>All the Smart Wallets here use gas abstraction to enable the wallet gasless. And most of them provide limited free use. Outside of the free scene, they use a different way of charging users, such as service fee account, the ticket for transactions, or charge by cost per transaction.</p> Investors <p>Most of the Smart Wallets are being invested by investment institutions, while two of them raise funds through ICO. The total amount of financing reach $100M, but it should be noted the fundraising are is not entirely for the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Security <p>All the smart contracts of the Smart Wallet are audited, and most of them have a bug bounty program. However, the initiatives can increase security, but they cannot fully guarantee it. Here’s the information. What’s more, security is very complicated and needs expertise to understand. Next, I’ll write a feature article to analyze the security of Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Challenge for Smart&nbsp;Wallets  Security Issue <p>Compared to normal wallets, smart contract introduces new risks to Smart Wallets. To prevent from being hacked, the smart contract should be well audited as far as possible. Besides, the admin key risk still exists while the admin key is intended to upgrade the contract or terminate an emergency. Referring to defiwatch’s (<a href="https://defiwatch.net/">https://defiwatch.net/</a> )attempt, an analysis like smartwalletwatch is necessary to make users aware of the&nbsp;risks.</p> Pricing Model <p>Smart Wallets use meta-transaction to enable gasless transaction while the transaction fee is paid by the relayer. However, the relayer needs to charge the user for sustainable development. It’s important to design a sustainable pricing model to lower barriers of using blockchain, such as allowing deposit through&nbsp;fiat.</p> Compatibility <p>Smart Wallets face many compatibility issues, such as compatibility with new token standards, compatibility with web portals, compatibility with off-chain signatures. Fortunately, new protocols like WalletConnect &amp; EIP-1271 enhance compatibility, but there’re still many UX&nbsp;issues.</p> Next Step of Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trends <p>#1 Smart Wallet Weekly.

<p>Writer: Xiang&nbsp;Yao</p><p>From Subscribe: Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend</p> Background <p>Last week, I published the first <a href="https://smartwallet.substack.com/p/smart-wallet-new-paradigm-for-blockchain">article</a>, which briefly introduces the overview development of Smart Wallets. A critical suspicion on Smart Wallet is that the assets are custodial, which indicates the wallet operator can dispose of the assets. In this article, I will analyze the Smart Wallet’s sovereignty and give some examples of how to control your wallet&nbsp;fully.</p> What is sovereignty? <p>Sovereignty means the user can fully control the account. For EOA, the one who owns the corresponding private key has sovereignty. If the third party holds the private key, the account is custodial. For contract accounts of Smart Wallet, sovereignty is much sophisticated because of the logic of diversity. However, it can be judged from three aspects: (1) What’s the highest authority of the account? (2)Does a designated third party(trustee) have a way to take over the account or freeze the assets? (3)Does the user has a way to send ANY transactions WITHOUT the permission of a third party? (4)Is the account contract upgradable, and is it rejectable?</p> What can a trustee do with the account and&nbsp;assets? <p>Most Smart Wallets enable account recovery and emergency operations via authentication off-chain, which means a designated third party(trustee) can change the owner of the account. The trustee can be the wallet provider, a hardware wallet, a seed phrase on paper that user assigns, such as the other wallet the user owns, families, and trusted friends. Different Smart Wallets grant the trustee(s) different authorities:</p>  Change the owner of the&nbsp;account.  Add a new owner of the&nbsp;account.  Assist in accelerating the security&nbsp;process.  Freeze or restrict the&nbsp;account.  <p>The introduction of a trustee has increased the robustness of the account but also increases the risk of trust. However, the trustee’s authority is restricted and may be canceled, so users still have the highest authority.</p><p>In the contract level, the trustee can be anyone. Still, most products only have a defaulting trustee operated by the wallet provider who authenticates users via email, phone number, and identity documents.</p> What’s the highest authority of the&nbsp;account? <p>The account owner has the highest authority of the account, who can change the state of account arbitrarily and forcibly. Though a trustee has some privileges to change the account owner or freeze it, the account owner can disrupt the flinching behavior and remove the trustee(s). The account owner is a private key or a group of keys with pre-defined logic and may be saved in several&nbsp;forms.</p>  The owner is a private key that is kept offline. — e.g.,&nbsp;MYKEY  The owner is a private key that is kept locally (e.g., in the smartphone) but CANNOT be exported. -e.g., Argent,&nbsp;Dharma  The owner is a private key that is kept locally and can be exported. -e.g.,&nbsp;Monolith  The owner is a private key that is kept on the cloud and can be exported. -e.g., Authereum  The owner is a (k,n) threshold of private keys while some can be exported. e.g., Gnosis,&nbsp;Dapper  <p>All crypto wallets are trying to protect the private key to avoid loss, and Smart Wallets have different methods to reduce the single point&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Of all these products, smart design in MYKEY is what I’m most interested in introducing. MYKEY separates the authority into the administrative authority and operational authority. The admin key has the highest authority but cannot perform normal transactions; thus, it can always be kept offline. With the delay mechanism and the assistance of Emergency Contacts, the compromise of an administrator’s key will still not cause fatal&nbsp;damage.</p> Can I send transactions without the wallet interface? <p>Smart Wallets use meta-transaction to broadcast the transaction. Anyone with a valid signature can send the transaction. Typically, most users use the wallet interface to send transactions that rely on the relayer service by the wallet provider. What if the provider stops relayer service? Smart Wallets give different solutions. For most Smart Wallets, the signing key is the owner key or one of the owner keys. For MYKEY users, the operation key is&nbsp;instead.</p>  The signing key can be exported so users can package transactions without the wallet. e.g., MYKEY, Monolith, Gnosis,&nbsp;Dapper  The signing key cannot be exported, but users can extract raw signatures from the wallet. e.g.,&nbsp;Argent.  The signing key nor the signatures can be exported, so users need to change the key through the trustee(s). e.g.,&nbsp;Dharma  <p>Unlike ordinary wallets, Smart Wallets only sign transactions; the transaction package and broadcast are done by the backend service. Sending transactions without relying on the wallet interface makes it possible to stay liveness when the wallet provider doesn’t work. However, it’s hard to package transactions with etherscan or CLI clients(geth, parity…) for ordinary people, so this only works for the hardcore players. Argent gives a good demonstration for avoiding service interruptions, but there’s still a threshold. Most users are not able to dispose of their&nbsp;assets.</p> What can I do if I don’t want to upgrade the contract? <p>Smart contracts in Ethereum are immutable by default. However, for some scenarios, to add additional features or fix potential vulnerabilities, most projects create upgradeable contracts. Therefore, it threatens the account security.</p><p>Most Smart Wallets have a modular design, and the upgrade means enabling a new module, or enabling a new module and disabling the old one. Enabling or disabling a module needs authentication, but most of the Smart Wallets will force users to upgrade. Otherwise, they cannot use the wallet anymore unless they use the exported owner key to control the&nbsp;account.</p> How to make a perfect&nbsp;upgrade?  What’s a perfect&nbsp;upgrade? <p>The perfect upgrade guarantees trustless, secure, and it’s better with fewer&nbsp;costs.</p> How to make it trustless? <p>Trustless means users are free to choose. In terms of implementation, the upgrade needs authentication, or there’s enough long time for users to migrate to another&nbsp;account.</p> Who can make an&nbsp;upgrade? <p>The contract allows a “privileged user” to approve a new contract. Currently, the “privileged user” is the wallet provider. It can be an EOA or MultiSig account. There are no apparent trends that Smart Wallets will change to DAO governance.</p> Are the users forced to&nbsp;upgrade? <p>By design, users have the right to choose to upgrade or not. There’re two main implementations.</p>  The upgrade is not global, and each user authenticates for an&nbsp;upgrade.  The upgrade is global but has a long enough waiting period, any user with doubt can migrate&nbsp;account.  <p>In reality, users cannot use the wallet without accepting an upgrade in case 1 and may miss the warning notification in case&nbsp;2.</p> Is the upgrade immediately? <p>The upgrade process requires a public notice period so that more users are likely to get informed. The waiting period can be on-chain or off-chain, while the former is more secure, and the latter is more flexible for emergency cases.</p><p>However, most Smart Wallets don’t have a standardized upgrade process. MYKEY has a <a href="https://security.mykey.org/contract-upgrade">webpage</a> to list the upgrade rule and upgrade&nbsp;history.</p> How to make it&nbsp;secure? <p>Secure is the most critical issue for the wallet. A lot of efforts should be made to guarantee the assets are safe. Security audits and bug bounty are common&nbsp;methods.</p> Security Audit <p>The outstanding security institutions are well auditing all Smart Wallets, it’s important to make every planned upgrade well audited before upgrading. Most Smart Wallets hasn’t disclosed every audit reports&nbsp;yet.</p> Bug Bounty <p>It’s essential to put the source code to the examination of more experts, that’s why we need a bug bounty. In June 2020, Open Zeppelin <a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/argent-vulnerability-report/">disclosed a vulnerability</a> of Argent and helped them to fix the vulnerable smart contract. Open Zeppelin gets the reward of High severity, which is up to $25,000. As far as I know, <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/argent-bug-bounty/">Argent</a>, <a href="https://hackerone.com/monolith">Monolith</a>, <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/tagged/bug-bounty">Gnosis</a>, <a href="https://security.mykey.org/bug-bounty-program">MYKEY</a>, and <a href="https://support.authereum.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043760793-Does-Authereum-have-a-bug-bounty-program-">Authereum</a> have their bug bounty programs.</p> How to make it&nbsp;cheaper? <p>The cost of the upgrade is a less-discussed issue. In case the upgrade is global, then it’s not a problem. However, if the upgrade needs every user’s agreement, meaning that it needs 1 billion additional transactions for 1 billion users’ upgrade. Is it reasonable and practical? Is rollup technology helpful with&nbsp;that?</p> How to fully control a Smart Wallet&nbsp;account? <p>No operating manuals will be given to let you “escape from” your Smart Wallets. I just want to point out the direction and key points. Not all Smart Wallets are listed&nbsp;below.</p> Argent <p>It’s important to own a guardian by yourself, in case you lost your phone, and the official guardian doesn’t work. You can use <a href="https://security.argent.xyz/">https://security.argent.xyz/</a> to do so. Metamask, Ledger Nano, and Trezor are supported presently.</p> MYKEY <p>Always keep safe of your recovery phrase(the admin key), in case MYKEY doesn’t work properly, follow the <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/nirvana-plan-for-better-protect-users-assets-c80cac231ad">Nirvana Plan</a>, and use the <a href="https://github.com/mykeylab/mykey-tx-tool">tools</a> to control your accounts.</p> MONOLITH <p>Take care of your seed phrase, and read this&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/monolith/your-monolith-account-is-due-for-an-upgrade-35b1814a01ed?source=collection_home---2------2-----------------------">article</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>Most Smart Wallets guarantee sovereignty while there’s still much room for improvement. In the normal state, users can take control of their identity and property. Extra attention needs to be paid to the upgrade process. Smart Wallets can provide a more transparent and standardized upgrade to ensure trustless and&nbsp;secure.</p> About Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend <p>Smart Wallet Trend is a newsletter where you can find news, insights and fresh ideas about Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p><p>My name is Yao Xiang, currently a researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab.</p><p>Feel free to contact me via comment or <a href="mailto:freeyao@mykey.org">send 📧email</a> to me directly.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/how-to-get-sovereignty-of-your-smart-wallet-f256674cb751">How to get sovereignty of your Smart Wallet?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab">MYKEY Lab</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 When regulation, new tech, and public opinion&nbsp;converge <p>On May 25, enforcement begins under the European Union’s General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). This long-awaited regulation attempts to put the genie of digital personal data back in the proverbial bottle. Web companies were the first to realize the potential goldmine that is user data and began building businesses around it, attracting users and profits through a model of free services that generate data to sell or consumers to target. ~20 years into this model, public opinion and law-makers have realized the huge costs we’re suffering by letting people be turned into the product. Data breaches and abuses are perhaps the most visible, but huge inefficiencies and massive power in the hands of a few internet monopolies may be just as impactful.</p>From Larry Diar <a href="https://diar.co/volume-2-issue-17/">https://diar.co/volume-2-issue-17/</a><p>Many businesses are scrambling to meet the new compliance standards. It’s a sweeping regulation that impacts any business operating in the EU, collecting data from EU citizens, or doing any business in the EU, so the impact is global. Interested observers are waiting to see how some of the more vague language will be interpreted and how aggressively regulators will pursue potentially massive fines (up to 4% of a company’s global revenue). Meanwhile, a few are pondering a very different set of questions: how do regulations built for Web2 complement the new models we are building for&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>New cryptographic and decentralized technologies — most notably blockchains — have the potential to build data privacy into the core of digital systems. Developed while the GDPR and similar regimes were being drafted, the spirit of the technology and regulations are kindred: more control in users’ hands, more responsibility required of 2nd and 3rd parties. But it’s unclear in ways how the ‘letter of the law’ will apply to this new technology.</p><p>Thinking about how these simultaneous legal and technological changes, and shifts in social expectations, interact is key to planning for a more privacy-preserving future. While there are a few apparent incompatibilities — for example, the right to be forgotten on an immutable ledger — good design principles that help all parties make informed decisions can let these operate well together. Regulations and new technology that aim for ‘privacy by design,’ along with mounting public pressure for good data controls, can combine to usher in a new age of data privacy and user-control.</p> Private protections via public&nbsp;ledgers <p>Blockchains like Ethereum are public ledgers: they store pieces of data on a shared system that anyone can access, and nobody can delete. One of the things this enables is a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/magazine/beyond-the-bitcoin-bubble.html">‘identity layer’ for the Internet</a>, giving users control of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>This would change the dynamics of digital interactions, likely altering the currently popular model of collecting and monetizing vast amounts of consumer data — the practice that led to regulations like GDPR. This new dynamic is now possible because decentralized technologies can let us build a decentralized consensus around who somebody is, rather than relying on centrally built and managed silos like Facebook or governments.</p><p>There’s an irony to using a public ledger to enable and protect private data. If personal data were put on Ethereum, that data would be permanently public for all to see and use. That is, of course, not what we’re doing at 3Box. As detailed in our <a href="https://medium.com/uport/privacy-preserving-identity-system-for-ethereum-dapps-a3352d1a93e8">approach to privacy-preserving identity</a>, this new system relies on a public ledger but minimizes what data is actually put&nbsp;there.</p><p>All that needs to be stored on-chain is decentralized identifier (DID), which is just a random string of characters. It’s currently not explicit whether these addresses will be classified as personal information under GDPR. Some precedent and the treatment of IP addresses suggests it may, at least in some cases. However, the DID itself tells nothing about the user: it is simply a random public address that a user claims control of through a private key in order to interact with others via a decentralized identity.</p><p>The personal data associated with a DID is controlled privately by the user. This data can be stored on private servers and encrypted so nobody but the user has access, can be pseudonymous so even when the user shares it doesn’t tie to their identity, and can be deleted anytime the user chooses. The only thing public is coded ‘pointers’ between the users DID and servers where the information is&nbsp;stored.</p><p>Multiple keys are used so that even pseudonymous identities can’t be correlated. In 3Box’s system, a user can have many keys linked to a given identity and many identities, giving many ways to manage sharing or pseudonymity.</p><p>This combination does require <a href="https://medium.com/@lyricalpolymath/web3-design-principles-f21db2f240c1">thoughtful design </a>to help users, who act as their own data controller. Personal data does not need to be stored publicly — but it certainly can be. Many products, proposals, and open source projects would enable users write personal data to a blockchain if they chose to, and once this is done it cannot be undone. While we cannot control what’s possible in a world of open-source software, we can help developers and users <a href="https://medium.com/uport/different-approaches-to-ethereum-identity-standards-a09488347c87">make good decisions</a>. GDPR does not really anticipate situations in which the user is their own controller, and their own legal obligations to themselves.</p><p>Done right, users never have to disclose their personal data publicly and get all the benefits of an immutable, user-controlled transaction history. As one example of the flaws of today’s system: <a href="https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/ftc-credit-report-mistakes-1270.php">21% of credit reports have erroneous data in them. </a>Immutable transaction records would enable proof of origination to prevent this (and the billions of dollars spent each year on identity resolution, with companies trading user data back and forth), while not requiring that users ever disclose their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>This system isn’t just more secure, it can be more private and far more powerful. Not just for users, but for businesses too: it will make it possible for companies to deliver the same or richer user experience without the risk &amp; cost of holding customer&nbsp;data.</p> Adoption through value, not just compliance &amp;&nbsp;tech <p>It’s great that the EU is taking serious steps to curb data abuses, and GDPR may have a significant impact on corporate responsibility. It’s doubtful it will lead to wholesale shift in how data is treated today, with it primarily in the control of organizations. And while public opinion seems to be shifting to demand more security and privacy, convenience and complacency still reign in many&nbsp;cases.</p><p>To shift Web3 to a user-centric model, with data truly in the hands of users, will require something more: value. The new model and technologies we are creating ultimately need to show their worth not through ethics and laws but through products and services that give people and organizations obvious value. And while we have work to do, our model will provide enormous reasons for identities of all types to&nbsp;adopt:</p>  Save users from identity theft and data breaches (Equifax alone cost an estimated $4bn) and protect organizations against cybercrime, estimated to be $<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/12/10/2017-roundup-of-internet-of-things-forecasts/#771dd60c1480">6tn </a>by&nbsp;2021  Give consumers a route to some of the $100bn+ that Facebook &amp; Google collect in ad revenue, and businesses a more effective way to discover and serve their highest value customers  Make large data sets &amp; rich customer histories available to startups, reducing barriers to competition  Give users infinitely granular <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_eurobarometer_240615_en.pdf">control </a>over their devices, accounts, relationships, and digital&nbsp;services  Reduce the 83% of adults who worry about identity theft, and the 40% who lose a password every&nbsp;week  <p>The GDPR in Europe may lead to some huge steps in curbing data breaches and giving users more control. It remains to be seen how regulators will treat public ledgers, a relatively new and unconsidered technology, but we’re confident they are complementary. The identity models being built on blockchain tech can not only enable the privacy and security the law aims for, but can drive widespread adoption of data rights and protections well beyond what the regulation calls&nbsp;for.</p> Join the conversation in the <a href="http://chat.3box.io">3Box discord community</a>.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/3box/entering-the-age-of-data-privacy-7c3451ed3a57">Entering the age of data privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/3box">3Box</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>At 3Box we live and breathe identity, and while GDPR and data abuses like Facebook’s may be concerning, they have also brought some welcome attention to the issues of digital privacy and data control. As we push ahead to a self-sovereign future, I wanted to share how I think of the 3 parts of identity in our increasingly digital, interwoven society.</p> 1. Reducible identifier <p>Identity as a concept is difficult — even scholars in the field can’t agree on a definition. They do agree, though, that identity for each of us is not singular and static but rather plural and dynamic. Who we are changes over time and contexts. However, we as people and societies and institutions need something concrete to pick me out from the crowd of others, even others who may share my same name. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153">Seeing Like a State </a>James Scott calls this ‘legibility.’ When we get past local communities and the Dunbar number, we need to make society understandable. We reduce things to lists and bits of information, and one of the must fundamental bits of information is who we&nbsp;are.</p><p>We need a legible, concrete, reducible identity. This leads to passports, social security numbers, and other root identifiers from the physical world. Much of the work in the identity industry is around verifying and authenticating who somebody is in this regard, whether through knowledge questions, facial or bio metric scan, or proof that they know a password or hold a private&nbsp;key.</p> 2. Contextual identification <p>While reducible identification is critical to anyone trying to keep track of a group, it doesn’t actually tell us much about the person who has been identified. Context about that reducible identity gives orientation to who the person (or otherwise) actually is. Traditionally this may include where somebody lives (driver’s license), who their parents are, what tribe (including nationalities, teams, gangs, political affiliations, religion, etc) they are a part of, or who their employer is — anything you might fill out on a test or census form. More recently, this would include a person’s social graph (Facebook friends, LI contacts) and location&nbsp;data.</p><p>This may be static or dynamic information, but it’s not ephemeral — it roots them in time and space. As we move to a more digital-first world, and hopefully soon <a href="https://medium.com/uport/entering-the-age-of-data-privacy-7c3451ed3a57">a self-sovereign world</a>, we talk often of capturing this contextual information as ‘attestations’ or ‘<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/">verifiable claims</a>’ to our root (reducible) identity, giving us a way to bring all the context about us together in a powerful, private, verifiable (trusted) way.</p> 3. Dynamic&nbsp;identity <p>A reducible identifier and contextual identification provide a way to differentiate each other, to verify who somebody is and know some categorical details about them. But they do not tell you who somebody is. The richness of our identity is captured in the multitude of behaviors, preferences, relationships, interactions, histories and even thoughts. Only here can true identity — the plural, dynamic identity — be seen. One persons preferences and behaviors may contradict each other over time, and often do, so this cannot be captured in a reducible and ‘verifiable’ context. It is only captured when our goal is to understand who somebody is deeply, rather than pick them out from a crowd of&nbsp;others.</p><p>In today’s world, data reflecting who we are is being generated and captured constantly. With much of our lives online and in our phones, and sensors cheap enough to put on everything, nearly all our interactions with the external world can be turned into digital data. In fact, our internal ‘data’ — health, mood, biological patterns is now logged as well. This is infamously captured and monetized by Facebook and others, but it is also incredibly powerful. If <a href="http://uport.me">put in control of users and creators of data</a>, we can build a world that lets us use this rich data to truly understand the people around us far better than ever before, and as far more than bits of reducible and contextual information.</p><p>In fact, with rich, full identity data, we could understand our dynamic selves far better than previous identity construct have allowed us. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310">Homo Deus</a> Yuval Harari envisions a breakdown of the singular ‘self’ into a multitude of biological signals and patterns and interactions, changing the very notion of identity — perhaps an indication of why this concept proves so hard to nail&nbsp;down.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/3box/the-3-parts-of-identity-in-a-dynamic-world-f94724c2bae9">The 3 parts of identity in a dynamic world</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/3box">3Box</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Experts define Operational Technology (OT) as&nbsp;«hardware and software that detects or causes a change, through the direct monitoring and/or control of industrial equipment, assets, processes and events.»</p>
<p>OT differs from IT, in terms of functionalities, the culture of operators and threats. In recent months, we witness an increasing convergence of IT and OT systems.&nbsp;This area is a novel and rapidly expanding one for both cybercrime and industry.&nbsp;Recent IBM’s 2020 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index summarizes that attacks targeting operational technology (OT) infrastructure increased by over 2000 per cent in 2019 compared to the previous year.&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these trends: it is the digital accelerant of the decade and accelerated companies’ digital transformations by approximately a global average of 6 years.</p>
<p>For example, one of the impacts of COVID-19 –at least until a vaccine is discovered– is the reduction of on-site staff. In the case of OT systems, this put a strain on the already limited resources and required an increase in external connectivity. The result is the numerous industrial plants exposed to, for example, ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a bird-fly point of view, IT and OT are still missing a holistic approach that includes cybersecurity, physical security and cyber-physical security, an integrated cyber-risk estimation and governance models able to span across IT and OT domains. Overall the primary need concentrates around as reconciliation of IT Security (typically built on Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability paradigm) with OT Cybersecurity (which fundamental properties are instead Safety-Reliability-Productivity).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status of IT and OT security</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long term impacts of the pandemic on the digital transformation agenda of industry</p>

  <p>Cyber resilience, a term often heard but never fully understood, has made headlines for many years. Nonetheless, we are still confronted with ransomware attacks that lead to the standstill of organizations, as evidenced in the 2017 Maersk attack or the declared state of emergency by the mayor of the city of New Orleans in December 2019 after the city was hit by a cyberattack.</p>
<p>Many organizations perceive cyber resilience as yet another regulatory topic to be addressed by the IT department or the IT security teams, ignoring the regulatory requirements deriving from stakeholders such as the European Central Bank, or the need to interlink cyber preparedness with business continuity efforts and the much-needed support not only by the business departments but also the C-suite.<br>All this stems from an incomplete understanding of cyber resilience and what added value it can offer to an organization. The presentation aims to close this knowledge gap by highlighting key regulatory requirements, and how these can be addressed in coordination with key decision-makers. It will also provide insights into future regulatory developments with a specific view on the EU legislation. The presentation will also talk about testing approaches for cyber resilience, such as the TIBER-EU (Threat Intelligence-Based Ethical Red Teaming for the European Union) framework.</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<p>1) After completing this session, the participant will be able to refer to relevant CR regulations and put them into context and everyday use and to understand expectations from the FS regulators.<br>2) After completing this session, the participant will have knowledge about how CR is applied in other FS organizations, and what tools and methods exist to assess CR readiness.<br>3) After completing this session, the participant will be able to discuss key CR topics with senior management to promote the importance of CR, and to make a business case for it.<br>4) After completing this session, the participant will be able to refer to available resources on the internet to deepen his/her knowledge of CR.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_10_minkmar"></a>

   You likely have an identity governance and administration (IGA) solution in place to address data privacy and regulatory requirements. “Identity governance” refers to identity needs like&nbsp; access request approvals and certifying user access levels, and “administration” refers to the back-end user account provisioning processes in place to meet those needs.

  <p>You likely have an identity governance and administration (IGA) solution in place to address data privacy and regulatory requirements. “Identity governance” refers to identity needs like&nbsp; access request approvals and certifying user access levels, and “administration” refers to the back-end user account provisioning processes in place to meet those needs. In this blog, we’ll look at the requirements that have driven the adoption of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance and administration</a>, how the changing identity landscape is posing challenges for legacy IGA solutions, and how modern IGA approaches fill those gaps.</p>

 Why You Need an Identity Governance and Administration Solution 

<p>You have to manage user access requirements, ensure compliance with an ever-increasing number of regulations, protect your organizational data and intellectual property, and maintain a seamless customer experience across multiple devices. IGA solutions have evolved over the years to address this broad set of needs.</p>

<p>A robust identity governance and administration solution should enable the certification of appropriate user access levels and allow you to govern that access with policy-based controls. Additionally, it should enable your security and compliance teams to handle access requests, access approvals, and role administration. An effective IGA solution should also help your organization achieve regulatory compliance.</p>

 IGA Landscape Challenges&nbsp; 

<p>You’ve likely had your existing identity governance and administration solution in place for a long time, and you’ve seen the identity landscape change drastically around it. Accelerating changes in enterprise technologies, cyberthreats, and the user landscape are putting growing pressure on traditional IGA solutions and, in turn, on your security and compliance teams.</p>

<p>The identity landscape today encompasses a growing number and type of users, accounts, devices, applications, and systems. Applications and systems are no longer just on-premises. They live in a dizzying hybrid of on-premises, cloud, and SaaS environments – and your users, encompassing your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">consumers</a>, and partners, access them from many different devices and networks. On top of these complexities, you’re protecting your data and users against an increasing number of internal and external threats while the number of compliance regulations mounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You’re left with a critical question: Can your IGA solution keep up?&nbsp;</p>

  Identity Silos Leave you with Poor Visibility<br>Enterprise IT environments become more complex every year, increasing the number of applications and systems you provide user access to. Most legacy identity governance solutions don’t connect and manage all applications, especially with systems living in a hybrid of on-premises and cloud environments. Combined with your user identity information scattered across multiple identity silos, this can lead to poor enterprise user access visibility, a lack of context, and an inability to recommend appropriate access privileges, like entitlements and role assignments. It’s difficult to secure identities, user access and maintain compliance when you don’t have – and can’t achieve – complete visibility. 
	 Compliance Becomes Challenging<br>Your IGA solution should enable you to understand who has access to what, but with fragmented visibility, your security and compliance teams don’t have the information needed to be compliant with the increasing number of regulations. Longstanding regulations like the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a> (HIPAA) and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3763">Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)</a> have been joined by new legislation like <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) and the <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a>, are increasing the pressure on your security and compliance teams. Breaching these regulations comes at a high cost. Noncompliance with SOX can cost organizations up to $25 million in fines as well as criminal or civil prosecution. It’s estimated that <a href="https://dataprivacymanager.net/5-biggest-gdpr-fines-so-far-2020/">$192 million</a> in GDPR violations have been levied against companies since the legislation went into effect.&nbsp; 
	 Resources are Exhausted <br>Identity governance solutions are expected to work across multiple siloed environments with tens of millions of access privileges spread across legacy and modern applications on both on-premise and cloud environments. Automation is critical to preventing your teams from over provisioning or granting inappropriate access privileges. Unfortunately, many legacy systems can’t be automated, resulting in an overflow of access requests for your team. Requests that require manual, human reviews and fulfillment. 
 <p>The shortcomings of existing&nbsp; IGA solutions can lead to identity governance fatigue and leave your organization more vulnerable. When considering a new, modern IGA solution, here are a few best practices to look for:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  AI-Driven IGA Solution - A modern identity lifecycle management solution that simplifies and automates the access request, access approval, certification and role modeling processes. By leveraging an AI-driven analytics engine, the solution identifies and applies appropriate user access, automates high-confidence access approvals, recommends low risk accounts for certification, re-certifies high-risk accounts, and automates the removal of unnecessary roles.&nbsp; 
 <p>A solution that automates access and governance controls to more easily manage the demands of today’s dynamic workforce throughout the entire users’ lifecycle.</p>

  Data Agnostic - A solution that does not include data bias, a data model that reflects the entire user access landscape. A solution that provides the ability to contextually examine all identity-related data, identify and recommend the right level of user access rights via high, medium, and low confident scores while providing the ability to apply appropriate birthright and or leaver user access rights to accounts, applications, systems, roles, and entitlements across the enterprise.&nbsp; 
 <p>A solution that reduces overall request volumes by predicting appropriate user access at the right time, to the right resources.&nbsp;</p>

  Extensible Data Model - A solution with a highly scalable identity model for managing all users, devices, and things. A solution that enables data aggregation from diverse identity authoritative sources combined with an identity relationship model. A data visualization model that automatically identifies contextual relationships across users, devices, and things.&nbsp; 
 <p>A solution that automates identity orchestration and automation across <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a>, identity governance, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity management</a> via AI-based remediation recommendations.&nbsp;</p>

 Identity is the new perimeter — but how can companies properly protect&nbsp;it?  Strongholds must be built around each individual’s identity, but what’s the best way to do this in an era of hyper-connectivity? Biometric solutions are our best&nbsp;answer. <p>The ways in which employees access corporate systems have changed dramatically. The shift to remote working, alongside the sheer volume of devices being used to access private networks, must be the wake-up call to reevaluate and modernize security strategies.</p><p>The security perimeter has shifted from the office to user end-points, and now finally to the end-user itself and their identity. The question being asked is not whether or not identity is the new perimeter, it’s how can it best be protected?</p><p>How can companies ensure that on-premise and cloud services are safe, while employees and third parties are suddenly requesting access to private systems from all over the&nbsp;world?</p><p>The answer to securing the new perimeter lies in rethinking how we authenticate and validate identities in the era of digitization.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the online domain identities are too commonly guarded with weak credentials like email addresses and passwords. These methods are inherently insecure, leaving companies and their users susceptible to privacy and security&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Not only are login credentials at extremely high risk of being compromised in breaches, (Computer Weekly reports that there are over <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252485713/Over-15-billion-credentials-for-sale-on-dark-web">15 billion credentials for sale on the dark web</a>), users also still disregard password best practices, insisting on sharing passwords, PINs, and other login data, despite the known&nbsp;risks.</p><blockquote>“<a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/infographic-95-percent-share-6-passwords-with-friends.html">95% of people share passwords with up to 6 people</a>” — LastPass</blockquote><p>In an increasingly connected world, weak credentials expose organizations and individuals to large-scale threats. To make matters more complicated, criminals are exponentially adept at using compromised email addresses and passwords to breach end-points and networks.</p><p>Since one set of compromised credentials can enable a bad actor to breach an entire network, it’s imperative that we rethink authentication and identity management.</p> Identity is the new cybersecurity frontier — but who can companies trust? <p>The answer is no one. By implementing a zero-trust approach to authentication and identity management, companies can ensure that only the right users have access to the right systems, at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>Zero-trust models differ from traditional security models in that they assume that nobody can be trusted (whether they’ve previously gained access to a network or not). This means users will need to continuously authenticate to prove their identity.</p><p>Read our blog on zero-trust security to gain a deeper understanding of zero-trust security&nbsp;models…</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/what-is-zero-trust-security-cad4a9e16899">What is zero-trust security?</a></p><p>By leveraging a zero-trust approach, companies can dramatically reduce the chance of a threat actor breaching private systems. But to ensure strong security without jeopardizing convenience, companies must move away from traditional authentication methods which are cumbersome and unreliable.</p> Biometric solutions are key to securing identities in the remote&nbsp;era <p>Biometric authentication and identity management solutions solve some of the key remote security challenges.</p> Improved user experience <p>Biometrics allow for fast, easy, and secure remote login experiences that are minimally disruptive to workflow.

If vendors fail to do this, a user’s identity could be permanently compromised.</p> The stakes are higher with biometrics <p>Last year, BioStar 2, a web-based security platform that is used by thousands of companies, suffered a breach in which 28 million records were compromised.

Biometric data should not be linked to personally identifiable information — like a user’s name, email address or date of&nbsp;birth.  No one should have access to a user’s complete set of encrypted biometric templates  The same standards should apply independent of a user’s device or operating system.

   Zero trust and IAM from the cloud as the foundation of hybrid IT must be simple 
<p>Most companies today rely on a hybrid IT infrastructure: Existing on-premise solutions are extended with flexible best-of-breed SaaS solutions. This improves flexibility and agility, but also increases the scope for cyber attacks due to the growing number of digital identities. For example, the Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report 2020 showed that attack patterns that target end-users - such as phishing and the use of stolen credentials - lead the attack rankings again. With obvious numerical sequences and the multiple use of passwords, consumers - employees as well as customers - also make it easy for attackers. These new broadened IT infrastructures, which are becoming more and more complex due to numerous identities and new devices - keyword "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) - require a new security concept: Zero-Trust.</p>
 What is Zero Trust? 
<p>The idea behind Zero-Trust is simple: Never trust, always verify. In concrete terms, this means that every access to the corporate network - whether by a user, a device or an application - must be constantly verified depending on various factors. Companies should therefore be able to answer the following question at any time and ideally in real-time: Who is allowed to log on to which service via which device at which time and how, and what (un)critical content can be accessed?</p>
 Answer the "trust question" automatically 
<p>To answer this question, risk-based access decisions involving both the user and the device in use are automatically made using machine learning. For example, users can be secured using Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication (AMFA), which typically involves entering a password followed by a choice of various other factors. For devices, the system checks whether the device is a managed, registered device and also includes location factors. Among other things, the combination of user and device checks results in a risk score that decides on access.</p>
<p>In order to make these complex decisions automatically in real-time, a central control point (access proxy) is required as a core component of the zero-trust architecture. The more data this control point has at its disposal and the more systems and information from third-party solutions are integrated, the better risk scores it can determine, make decisions based on policies and provide secure access to systems and data quickly.</p>
<p>For example, Okta has an extensive integration network with more than 6,500 pre-built integrations, including Proofpoint, which among others provides anti-phishing software to analyze email traffic. By integrating with Proofpoint Okta can incorporate information to determine the risk score, including denying access to victims of phishing attacks and Very Attacked Persons (VAPs) or allowing access only based on very strong multi-factor authentication.</p>
 Easy is Right – for admins and users 
<p>IT security solutions are often circumvented or levered out whenever possible if they are not simple and intuitive. For example, if a customer fails to change his or her password and is no longer able to access a shopping account, customers often choose another provider with a simpler user experience to make purchases. But also a well-intentioned high password complexity can have a negative impact on both experience and security. When a 15-character alphanumeric, case-sensitive password with special characters is required and which must be changed each quarter, passwords are often written down in one or more places. The attempt to improve security then turns into the opposite. This is why the guiding principle for identity and access management (IAM) is easy but secure is right.</p>
 An identity platform for B2E, B2C and B2B from the cloud 
<p>In the past, often different platforms were used for workforce and customer IAM. However, this means at least twice the complexity, twice the effort to integrate and build policies, and a loss of control due to too many identity providers (IdPs), which further increases the attack surface.</p>
<p>A single directory as a central access system that integrates all systems and applications provides IT managers with the foundation for centralized access management and the ability to implement SSO and multi-factor authentication (MFA) across the board. Furthermore, workflows can be defined according to the most diverse B2E/B2B/B2C use cases with little or no additional programming effort, i.e. low code and no code. This means, for example, that it is possible to define what should happen in certain login scenarios: sending a welcome message, registering and verifying as a user or making an entry in the central CRM database or trigger a process to verify the identity e.g. by validating their national ID cards.</p>
<p>A central cloud-based service (IDaaS) simplifies and accelerates implementation and integration time, enables IT teams to assign access securely and quickly, shortens time-to-market and value, and offers high and flexible scalability and short response times to constantly changing requirements.</p>
 The following applies to the user experience: The simpler, the better 
<p>The success and acceptance of security solutions depend on user experience (UX). With cloud-based IAM, MFA and single sign-on, IT security is perhaps for the first time in a position where an increase in security goes hand in hand with an increase in convenience. Users no longer need to have countless passwords on screen and update them regularly; simple user interfaces and the use of biometrics and apps for verification contribute to an uncomplicated and secure log-in experience.</p>
<p>In addition, by linking access authorization to risk scores and context factors such as location or criticality of resources, Okta enables the authentication chain to be adapted for the best possible user experience: If, for example, a validated user is located within a secure corporate network and uses a registered, trusted device, he or she can gain access to non-critical resources under clearly defined rules without having to authenticate at all - simply and securely.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>In a world where everything has to move faster and faster, security and user experience are becoming the most important criteria for whether consumers trust a solution or use a service, and thus determine the long-term success of organizations in the digital space. Zero-trust concepts paired with identity and access management help companies to realize IT security and UX as a powerful combination.</p>

<p>The efficiency case for the roll out of digital identities has been well established, with evidence emerging from countries across geographies over recent years [1] [2] [3]. However, the need for digital identities today extends beyond, becoming a near-necessity to keep public services functioning uninterrupted with prolonged periods of social distancing forced by COVID. Digital identities can enable E-Government services which are accessible remotely and 24×7. This was on display in the United Kingdom’s with the GOV.UK Verify digital identity platform. The first month of lockdown in March 2020 triggered a 10% rise in the number new digital identities being created  to remotely file Universal Credit claims at the start of the lockdown in March 2020 [4]. This helped deliver crucial financial support to ensure that thousands of citizens could access vital services in the midst of the crisis.</p>



<p> The GOV.UK Verify program has not been without its issues. Adoption rates have fallen well short of the 25 million users by 2020 target.  Having taken a private sector led approach, the low adoption and usage rates have forced 3 out of 5 identity providers (IdPs) to stop supporting the solution due to concerns regarding its profitability [5]. Rolling out a successful digital identity program is a commitment for the long haul and it may seem that the short-term financial pressures faced by private actors may make them unsuited to perform the role of IdPs in cases where uptake falls short of expectations. While the private sector IdP model has seen huge success in the Nordic region, with near universal digital identity coverage, this approach has been met with mixed results in other geographies [6]. Industry projections now suggest that the pandemic might just have tipped the balance in favour of a government issued digital identity model [7]. </p>



<p>Irrespective of the model adopted by a country, one thing is for certain; digital identities are expected to see significant growth in the coming years, laying the foundation for the next wave of E-Government innovation. But the proliferation of digital identities is not an end in itself, empowering citizens is. It is thus highly pertinent to deliberate extensively on what constitutes good digital identity.  As a digital identity solutions provider, we look to global projects and emerging technology trends to inform our own product decisions. Along the way, we have adopted the following design principles to place the interests of our users (the citizens) at the forefront. </p>



<p>Privacy
by Design</p>



<p>Given
the sensitive nature of digital identity and the extent of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) involved, public trust in a solution is
paramount. At the core of this is ensuring that the solution is designed with
citizen privacy as a priority. Procivis has been guided by the values of the
Self-Sovereign Identity and Blockchain movements that leverage cryptographic
techniques to ensure user control and sovereignty over their PII [8]. In line
with this, every new feature must tick the following boxes; consent &amp;
choice, purpose legitimacy &amp; specification, collection limitation and data
minimization. </p>



<p>Offering
high-value use cases </p>



<p>While
government issued digital identities have been around for nearly two decades,
one of the primary factors setting apart successful programs from others, is
access to services that citizens value. Beyond offering the primary
functionality of authenticating yourself in the digital realm, cases from
around the world have shown that adoption is strongly correlated with the availability
of services with high-transaction frequencies. One such service is the
provision of legally binding digital signatures. In Estonia, digital signatures
have all but replaced wet signatures, with over 200 million digital signatures being
submitted every year by a population of 1.3 million people [9]. Other use cases
that have encouraged adoption include services that permit citizens to receive
and manage official documents, certificates and licenses digitally. Brazil and
Argentina have seen significant adoption of digital identity wallets since
permitting citizens to store their driver’s licenses and vehicle documents on
their smartphones. These are amongst the cases which have informed the development
of our first three core features – eAuthentication, eSignatures and eDocuments.
</p>



<p>Seamless
user-experience</p>



<p>It
is not just enough to provide access to vital services; it is also important
that the user-experience for a citizen is intuitive and seamless. For instance,
a number of countries introduced smart cards, which permit citizens to
authenticate and sign documents electronically. However, several of these
processes relied on also possessing a card reader, which proved prohibitively
complex and impeded adoption. Smartphone based digital identities address this
issue by relying on commodity hardware and familiar user journeys. Furthermore,
a number of government digital services suffer from being digitized in
fragments. For example, in Switzerland a number of official documents can be
ordered on a government portal, but the payment processes are separate,
requiring that citizens make a wire transfer after receiving an invoice. In the
Canton of Schaffhausen, we combine ePayments with eAuthentication and
eDocuments on a mobile app, permitting citizens to go through the process of
ordering, paying for via credit card and receiving their official documents all
in one seamless flow. </p>



<p>Interoperability
to build an ecosystem of services</p>



<p>As
highlighted above, the true value of a digital identity lies in the access to
services that it can enable. It is thus vital that solutions rely on open
standards that make it easy for third parties (public and private sector) to
integrate digital identities into their processes. The financial sector is one
industry that finds immense
value in leveraging a trusted digital identity. In Denmark for instance, out of the 70 million monthly transactions, 40 million
were used for banking transactions.&nbsp;However, a government-issued
identity forms the trusted foundation of a digital society and can find
applications in quarters far broader than initially envisioned. </p>

<p>Decentralized identity has matured as foundations, working groups, and consortiums emerged to align standards across companies. However it has diverged significantly from the early days when it was closely aligned with the Ethereum developer community. We see potential to accelerate global impact on underserved populations by bringing these communities together. If there is something you want to build at the intersection of decentralized identity &amp; crypto, we’d love to hear from you.</p><p>Email: isaac@bloom.co | team@bloom.co</p><p>Telegram: @IsaacPatka</p> <p>This is the blog post version of the talk I gave on October 30 at the EthOnline impact event</p><p>"Decentralize it with smart contracts" could have been the theme of the crypto space in 2017 and 2018. Lending, trading, derivatives, credit bureaus, and identity were all being coded in Solidity and deployed on Ethereum testnets. Some efforts have worked, some have fizzled, and some have branched off in different directions.</p><p>Decentralized Identity is a prime example of an effort from the early days of Ethereum that has matured significantly, but independently of the rest of the crypto space.</p><p>The true value of Decentralized Identity is the ability to identify everyone, even where data is lacking. Hundreds of millions of people globally are excluded from traditional identification systems. Institutions see these individuals as high risk, and expensive to onboard. Unique, localized dynamics for credit and fraud further add to the problems of financial exclusion.</p> They don't need on-chain identities <p>While these individuals are perfect candidates to be onboarded directly into an adaptive and decentralized approach to identity, they don't need on-chain identities - yet. The key detail here is that smart contracts don't solve any problems that these individuals face.</p><p>Problem 1: How do we uniquely identify individuals, when they might not be registered with any government systems, or are in a market where government identifiers are frequently stolen &amp; impersonated?</p><p>Solution: We can uniquely identify people with a public-key infrastructure.</p><p>Problem 2: How do we source data to strengthen individual identities where data is lacking?</p><p>Solution: We can leverage traditional and alternative data sources, as well as environmental data, such as P2P relationships and everyday interactions. We can associate this data with public keys associated with individuals.</p><p>Problem 3: How do we ensure Decentralized Identity complies with emerging legal frameworks for privacy &amp; personal information?</p><p>Solution: We don't store any identifiable information on chain, even at the direct request of a user. Instead, we store it off chain, in a way that only the user controls the access and sharing of their information.</p><p>None of the challenges above are solved by putting individual identities on-chain. We realized this mid-way through 2019, at which point we were submitting a mainnet Ethereum transaction for every new user sign-up. We stopped anchoring individual identities, but we never stopped registering new users.</p> But - they are enabled by blockchain technology! <p>Most Decentralized Identity approaches are using Ethereum or Bitcoin keys under the hood. An identity wallet is often a wrapper around a simple Ethereum wallet, the same wallets that are used in on-chain monetary transactions, like <a href="https://github.com/trustwallet">Trust Wallet</a>.</p> Decentralized Identity standards are maturing <p>Concepts that started as smart contract account registries, and attestations have evolved into standards.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core/blob/master/contracts/AccountRegistryLogic.sol">BloomID</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> (Decentralized Identifier)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core/blob/master/contracts/AttestationLogic.sol">Bloom Attestations</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-vault">Bloom Vault</a> → <a href="https://digitalbazaar.github.io/encrypted-data-vaults/">Encrypted Data Vault</a> &amp; <a href="https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/">Secure Data Store</a> community  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/hellobloom.github.io/blob/master/attestation-data/Bloom-Merkle-Tree-22facf0b-bedb-4b45-bb7d-edcd57213eb0.md">Bloom Selective Disclosure Merkle Tree</a> -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">Mattr BBS signatures</a> (among others)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core">Bloom Attestation Smart Contracts</a> → <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-rl-2020">W3C RevocationList2020 spec</a> (among others)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/share-kit">Bloom Share Kit</a> → <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange">Presentation Exchange Specification</a> &amp; <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API (CHAPI)</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/verify-kit#example">Bloom Share Kit Payload</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">Verifiable Presentations</a>  <p>More than 60 DID methods have been invented, none by Bloom.

   Here’s a thought exercise for you: How will we develop software in the near
future? Below, I’ll lay out what I think that looks like. Some of the things in
this post exist in some form already.  And some things don’t exist… yet.

  <p>Here’s a thought exercise for you: How will we develop software in the near
future? Below, I’ll lay out what I think that looks like. Some of the things in
this post exist in some form already.  And some things don’t exist… yet.</p>

<p>To begin, I’m going to start with a short story about someone using this
futuristic development environment:</p>

 A Story 

<p>Imagine Viola. She is a software developer at Sunnyvale Systems, a logistics
company. Viola is on the phone with a customer, who called in to report a bug in
their route planning software. The customer is Polish, and unable to type the
Polish letter “Ś” into text fields in the Sunnyvale Systems user interface. It
takes a little while to figure out what the bug is, but Viola is able to get to
the bottom of the issue by connecting her development environment directly to
the customer’s  browser session.</p>

<p>Viola tries a few things with the customer on the line. “Try now,” she says, and
the customer tries again. No dice. A few more changes, and Viola asks the
customer to try  again, repeating this until she finds the solution—the
Sunnyvale Systems UI ignores the “Ctrl+S” keyboard combination to prevent the
“Save webpage” dialog  from opening for people who are used to Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>However, Polish keyboards send “Ctrl+Alt+S” when a user types “Right Alt+S” to
enter the “Ś” letter, and the logic to ignore “Ctrl+S” interferes with this.
<a href="https://medium.engineering/the-curious-case-of-disappearing-polish-s-fa398313d4df">The fix is to only ignore “Ctrl+S” if “Alt” isn’t pressed as well</a>.</p>

<p>Once Viola figures out what the issue is, it’s time to move her changes to the
production system. To do this, Viola points her development environment at the
production system, makes the change, but gets a warning that her updated change
has no tests for it. So she quickly adds a test to make sure that the Ctrl+Alt+S
key combination is not ignored. About 500 milliseconds after that test passes,
her change is live. She asks the customer to reload his app one more time and
try typing “Ś” —it works, and the customer hangs up, 
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">a little shocked that his issue was fixed so quickly</a>.</p>

 Why Isn’t the “Future” Here Already? 

<p>Computers have barely achieved even a fraction of their potential. Most of what
is holding back the potential of computers is not the technology itself, it’s
the mental models that humans use to interact with computers.</p>

<p>Even with all of the advances that we’ve made since
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Star#The_Xerox_Alto">1981</a>, the way that we
use computers hasn’t really changed much since then. We’ve made astounding
advances in processor, storage, and display technology since then. In fact,
computation is essentially free today. But in spite of all those changes, the
way that we think about, with, and for computers hasn’t changed. The computers
that we use today are essentially fancy typewriters.</p>

<p>That may sound like hyperbole, but let’s consider some examples of ways that
developers interact with their computers today:</p>




<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">



</a>


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">



</a>




<p>On the left, we have Visual Studio Code, a popular program used to write code.
On the right, we see a command line interface, used to run, build, and test
code.</p>

<p>Each program uses fixed-width fonts. And furthermore, the picture on the right
is literally from a program that simulates a teletype, a “typewriter” that could
talk with other similar typewriters over the telephone. It’s another example of
the saying “We shape our tools, and our tools shape us.” Programmers in 2020 use
the same computer interface that the authors of UNIX used to write UNIX 50 years
earlier:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix"></a></p>

<p>There have been many attempts to break free of the typewriter interface for
computers, some of the better examples of this include HyperCard, Squeak, and
the Genera OS.</p>




<a href="https://blog.archive.org/2017/08/11/hypercard-on-the-archive-celebrating-30-years-of-hypercard/">



</a>


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeak">



</a>


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera_(operating_system)">




</a>





<p>However, for various reasons none of these interfaces took off. For
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">better or worse</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Beginning..._Was_the_Command_Line">text based interfaces are here to stay</a>.</p>

<p>What does any of this have to do with “the development environment of the
future,” you may ask? Well, I strongly believe that as long as we’re using a
screen, keyboard, and mouse to interact with the computer, we simply can’t
ignore the effects of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence">path dependence</a>.</p>

<p>We will have to make compromises while still striving for the more ideal
environments that things like HyperCard, Squeak, and Genera all point to. Simply
put, a pragmatic approach is required.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider here is that the internet has changed the way that we
work with and think about our computers. In particular, the internet changed
software development from a “top down” approach to a “ground up” one. Microsoft,
which was founded before (and famously ignored) the internet, perfected the “top
down” style of software development and distribution. What they failed to see,
and tried to stop, was the “ground up” approach that Linux and the Free Software
movement epitomized. A popular analogy from the early 2000s was 
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">the cathedral and the bazaar</a>,”
though I’ve found  it more useful to think of Free Software as a Cambrian
explosion of software, where software is selected based on ease of use and ease
of understanding,  instead of ease of acquisition. In short, the current state
of the computational medium means that old interfaces and pragmatism win.</p>

<p>The concept of “a computer as a fancy typewriter” is here to stay for now. Let’s
make the best of it.</p>

 Towards a More Ideal Development Environment 

<p>You can split the approaches used to program a computer into roughly two camps:
batch processing and interactive Computing. Batch processing is what banks used
to do in the days before computers: Stop everything while you focus on
processing all of the day’s financial transactions. (This is where 
“<a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/are-bankers-hours-still-relevant">banker’s
hours</a>”
come from.)</p>

<p>Batch processing is sort of like making soup by following a recipe exactly, down
to the nanoliter. In terms of software development, the batch processing
approach is where the programmer takes great pains to write software that works
right the first time it’s written. In contrast, the interactive computing
approach is sort of like making up a soup as you go along, constantly tasting
what’s in the pot as you mix in ingredients. In software development, the
interactive computing approach is one where the computer is constantly helping
the programmer as code is being written. When computers were as big as rooms and
cost as much as houses, it made sense to use the batch processing approach to
write software—the computing time was worth more than the programmer time. Now
that computers are basically free, it’s the programmer’s time that is worth
more. Now it makes sense to have the computer help write the software too.</p>

<p>This brings us to the first aspect of the development environment of the future:
A fully interactive environment, one where the programmer works with the
computer, not for the computer.</p>

<p>We see hints of this today: Microsoft Word will highlight suspected mispellings
or grammar error, programmers can have their development environments warn them
if there are syntactical errors in their code. But we still have a long way to
go. One thing missing in particular is automated testing. Today, a production
test suite is considered “fast” if it completes in a minute or so. However, a
minute is roughly 59.9 seconds too long. Automated tests should be so fast that
they can run as the programmer types.</p>

<p>On a related note, much of modern-day programming takes too long. Instead of
measuring software operations using hours, or minutes, we should be using
milliseconds. Changes to tests, database schemas, production systems, source
control… all of these things should happen in milliseconds.</p>

<p>Also obviously missing from the list of things that computers can do to help
programmers, is treating all code as a graph, rather than a linear text file.
“Lines of text” is yet another vestigial appendage from the teletype era. The
way that a programmer interfaces with a computer today is something like this:
Humans write code as linear text, which is parsed into a graph, compiled into a
linear set of instructions, which is parsed by the CPU into a graph, to be
executed. Many programming languages and programming environments are making it
easier to see, reason about, and work with code as a graph (or abstract syntax
tree), and we already know about a lot of great things you can do when you have
access to code as a graph, like Jester for Java, code slicing, LLVM, etc. The
issue is simply that thinking of code as a graph is another mental model to
adopt, and the benefits are hard to attain if your programming language doesn’t
expose the abstract syntax tree in an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand way.</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of already explored computer science research that
we have yet to adopt, and are particularly interesting when taking a look into
the near future. If we have a development system where tests and other changes
happen in milliseconds and code is a graph, then we can imagine how a system
with those characteristics might look—a system with no “environments,” no
development, testing, or production. No servers. No databases. Just code that
runs everywhere.</p>

<p>If this sounds ridiculous, consider that much of what I describe is already
available today!</p>

 Existing Visions of the Future of Software Development 

<p>Parts of what I describe above exist already. 
<a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> and <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a> are online,
interactive software development environments where changes to code happens
instantly. Companies like 
<a href="https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless">Fastly</a>, 
<a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>, and
<a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> have compelling “serverless” platforms, as do AWS,
GCP, and Azure. You could build part of what I described if you, for example,
hooked up Glitch to some fast unit tests and, when the code passed the tests,
had it automatically published to CloudFlare workers.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re willing to learn a custom (OCaml inspired) programming
language, you can see what the future of programming looks like by using
<a href="https://darklang.com/">Dark</a> which (among other things) allows you to edit code
as a graph, makes updates to production in milliseconds, and doesn’t require you
to think about servers or databases.</p>

 Where to Go from Here? 

<p>If I could encourage you to take only one thing from this post, it would be
this:</p>

<p>When you are building systems for programmers, build systems where the
programmer works with the computer, where the computer augments the programmer’s
intelligence, rather than tries to replace it.</p>

look like—and what parts are already here. Don’t forget to

  <p>Digital leaders tend to think of digital transformation and acceleration in terms of technologies, business outcomes, process changes and their impact on people. But they often overlook the massive disruption that kind of transformation generates for leadership — and the enormous impact they can have on the success or failure of their organization’s digital transformation.</p>
<p>Those who are most successful exhibit seven standout characteristics. Kasey Panetta, Senior Content Marketing Manager at Gartner, sits down with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/12240/Mary-Mesaglio">Mary Mesaglio</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, to discuss the seven traits of these highly successful digital leaders and why it’s so important that they be curious about new things, understand the difference between creativity and innovation, and never consider digital to be the outcome.</p>
 Listen to interview 
<p>For the full interview, listen to the podcast below or read the transcript that follows, which has been edited for clarity and length.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37663"]</p>
 No. 1: Digital leaders are neophiliacs 
<p>Neophilia is a term for people who are naturally attracted to newness. Neophiliacs are always ready to explore new situations, tend to be more open to making and embracing new opportunities, and are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-digital-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming-in-the-next-5-years/">curious about new ideas</a>.</p>
<p>There are downsides to being a neophiliac, but it's necessary for digital leadership because the rate of obsolescence and the rate of change in the information technology field are not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">Why Now Is the Time to Accelerate Digital</a></p>
 No. 2: Digital leaders invent, but also copy 
<p>This trait requires leaders to pick areas to innovate while also borrowing from other areas. Digital leaders are very selective about where they invent, which is generally in areas where they want to be better than everybody else. But they're also excellent about copying because they are not trying to invent everywhere.</p>
<p>Digital leaders are clear on where they need to be exponentially better and where they can copy, since that's not the reason people buy from the organization. It’s <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/avoid-these-9-corporate-digital-business-transformation-mistakes/">not effective to dabble</a> in a lot of innovation efforts. Instead, leaders should be very clear in the areas it’s okay to copy.</p>
 No. 3: Digital leaders eschew industry boundaries 
<p>It can be a trap to consider the organization’s point of view, innovation possibilities, business model or digital transformation based on industry point of view. Many high-performing digital leaders, like Facebook, Amazon and Google, aren’t concerned with what industry they're in. Rather, they're concerned with what gap they can fill for customers. Their customer is at the center of what they do, not traditional industry boundaries.</p>
<p>Industry delineations like “financial services” can be unhelpful in determining new opportunities because they focus on what’s there, rather than what’s not there. The best innovation opportunities are often in the space between existing stuff. An industry lens does not help with filling that space with interesting new offerings. But a customer-needs view might.</p>
 No. 4: Digital leaders appreciate that innovation is more than just creativity 
<p>There is this notion that innovation and creativity are interchangeable, so if you have people with great ideas, boom, you get innovation. In reality, creativity is just one of five behaviors that you need to bring innovation to market. Creativity will generate the ideas, but you also need a challenging behavior to question, “Why would we do this? Is this really useful? Would someone buy this from us?”</p>
<p>Alongside challenging behavior, you’ll need collaboration to pull together disparate parts of the business and various disciplines. The fourth behavior is construction, which is the actual building part. Finally, you need people who will commercialize this innovation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does digital help you get to your destination? Because digital is not a destination</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To truly innovate and bring something to market, you’ll need all five of these behaviors, not just creativity. It’s important to audit your team and make sure you have skill sets in each area. It’s easy to overrepresent certain behaviors.</p>
<p>For example, during COVID-19 you might end up with more challenging behavior because people are simply fatigued, or your team might be great at coming up with a concept, and terrible at actually selling it on the market. Identify the gaps and pull in teams to fill them.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/digital-workplace-trends-you-cant-ignore/">Digital Workplace Trends You Can’t Ignore</a></p>
 No. 5: Digital leaders build teams with high AQ 
<p>Intelligence quotient (IQ) and emotional quotient (EQ) are fairly well known, but fewer leaders measure the adversity quotient (AQ). AQ measures human resilience and the capacity to come back from being dealt a blow. High AQ lends itself to better employee retention that is critical for digital leadership, because the nature of digital transformation often disrupts the way people work by breaking rules and overturning old assumptions.</p>
<p>To increase their resilience in high-pressure situations, high-performance athletes are often coached to visualize the positive and the negative “What would it feel like to bite the gold?” But also, what are some of the things that could happen to throw me off my game? What if the lineup is broken up, or I get a splinter in my foot the day before? It’s envisioning all potential obstacles and “practicing how I might come back from those” that can help with resilience.</p>
<p>Build AQ by introducing a little bit of unexpectedness or coaching and exploring different challenges and changes. Give people tools to deal with obstacles so that they're not thrown off their game entirely when things don't happen exactly according to plan. This trait is more important than ever because resilience is what we need to sustain us through the long, chronic phase of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
 No. 6: Digital leaders never consider digital to be the outcome 
<p>Digital is just a tool, it is just a means to an end. Nobody digitalizes just to be digital, just as nobody transforms just to transform. Be sure to clearly define and articulate the reason for digitalizing. If you digitalize without that kind of extra-clear hard-edged goal, you can end up in bad places.</p>
<p>For example, lots of people don't like online grocery shopping because they like browsing the shelves or they find it annoying to have to click on every single item or they want to be surprised by something they hadn't thought of and impulse buy.</p>
<p>To protect against “doing digital” just for the sake of being digital, consider what you’re trying to optimize or what are the desired outcomes. Maybe you want to make more money or increase margins or improve transparency or make things more secure. Does digital help you get to your destination? Because digital is not a destination.</p>
 No. 7: Digital leaders geek out on technology and so do their people 
<p>This is an often-underrated trait. Digital leaders actually do need to know a lot about technology to be able to evaluate where the opportunities lie. This is especially important when understanding what AI or other technologies can offer you or the possible impacts on the organization. However, it's not just leaders who should embrace their inner geek, but also their people.</p>
<p>Consider asking employees what they do with their free time. Perhaps they are doing something cool with Raspberry Pi or maybe someone else regularly writes a technology blog on their own time, and they've never mentioned it in a corporate or a professional environment. This might surface interesting responses, especially for younger employees who may have more free time, that might be useful for digital initiatives.</p>

 The GiD Report#134 — DOJ challenges Visa/Plaid, SSI is “hot&nbsp;stuff” <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-133-for-big-tech-it-doesnt-matter-who-wins-the-election-unless-you-re-facebook-c5e8d2dda9cc">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we’ve got this&nbsp;week:</p>  DOJ challenges Visa/Plaid acquisition  Wired’s overview of Biden administration on&nbsp;tech  Privacy’s continued prominence from Prop 24 to Tim Berners-Lee  Digital identity’s billion-dollar valuation  Harvard: self-sovereign identity is “hot&nbsp;stuff”  Paul’s Convenient Decentralization Theory  Stuff happens   1. There’s been a large focus on Big Tech antitrust but the DOJ’s lawsuit challenging Visa’s planned acquisition of Plaid shows that antitrust sentiment applies universally. Photo: cottonbro (pexels)<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visa-s-planned-acquisition-of-plaid-11604591434?mod=hp_lead_pos4">the WSJ</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>The department brought the case in a Northern California federal court, alleging the deal would eliminate the nascent but significant competitive threat that Plaid poses to Visa in the online debit market. The acquisition would allow Visa to unlawfully maintain a monopoly in online debit, leading to higher prices, less innovation and higher entry barriers for online debit services, the department alleged.</blockquote><blockquote>“If allowed to proceed, the acquisition would deprive American merchants and consumers of this innovative alternative to Visa,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the department’s antitrust chief.</blockquote><blockquote>“American consumers and business owners increasingly buy and sell goods and services online, and Visa — a monopolist in online debit service — has extracted billions of dollars from those transactions,” Mr. Delrahim&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>A Visa spokesman said the lawsuit is “legally flawed and contradicted by the facts…The combination of Visa and Plaid will deliver substantial benefits for consumers seeking access to a broader range of financial-related services, and Visa intends to defend the transaction vigorously.”</blockquote><p>Greg’s thoughts:</p><blockquote>The Justice Department is finally beginning to understand how the game is&nbsp;played.</blockquote><p>And here’s Dan&nbsp;Primack:</p><blockquote>Thought bubble: DOJ claims that Visa is already a “monopolist,” as evidenced by Mastercard’s alleged inability to capture more than 25% of the online debt services market. But it also argues that Plaid is poised to threaten Visa, thus raising some doubt as to how strong Visa’s stranglehold really is in the first&nbsp;place.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand: DOJ obtained communications from a top Visa executive who said that Plaid “threatens Visa” in terms of debut, analogizing it to an underwater volcano that has explosive potential despite being barely&nbsp;visible.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visa-s-planned-acquisition-of-plaid-11604591434?mod=hp_lead_pos4">Justice Department Files Antitrust Lawsuit Challenging Visa’s Planned Acquisition of&nbsp;Plaid</a>  Tim Wu: <a href="https://superwuster.medium.com/reviewing-ben-thompsons-stratechery-45b545dd959">Reviewing Ben Thompson’s Stratechery</a>   2. As we noted the other week, regardless of who wins the U.S presidential election, issues concerning antitrust, privacy, Section 230 reform, moderation/misinformation will remain top of mind for policymakers. <p>Wired has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-broke-internet-can-joe-biden-fix-it/">a good overview of what that will look like under a Biden administration</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>).</p><p>Here’s the scoring&nbsp;system:</p><blockquote>Because it’s been a long week, I’ve scored them from one Joe-Biden-eating-ice-cream (not happening) to five JBEICs (bank on&nbsp;it).</blockquote><p>On antitrust (5&nbsp;JBEICs):</p><blockquote>So whether we’ll see bold, aggressive, consequential antitrust enforcement and rulemaking against Big Tech during the Biden administration, or just modest, incremental, possibly-doomed-in-the-courts stuff, is still up in the air. What’s for sure is that we’ll see something. Antitrust gets five out of five&nbsp;JBEICs.</blockquote><p>Privacy law only gets 2 JBEICs given a divided government:</p><blockquote>On the other hand, it’s Congress, it’s a very complicated topic with a ton of money on the line, and it’s Mitch McConnell with a Democratic president, so we shouldn’t get our hopes up too high. But a federal privacy law next year is still a possibility. I give it two out of five&nbsp;JBEICs.</blockquote><p>Expect adjustments to Section 230 but not fundamental reform (3&nbsp;JBEICs):</p><blockquote>However, there’s another category of legislation concerning Section 230 that is much more viable. I think of these as Section 230 “hook” bills, because they try to hook Section 230 onto other legislative goals. The best example of this is the EARN IT Act, introduced by Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republican Lindsey Graham. The law would force companies to “earn” their Section 230 protections by submitting to an elaborate regime meant to make sure they aren’t facilitating the spread of child sexual abuse materials. Other bills similarly would condition Section 230 immunity on some other set of criteria that may have little to do with the underlying point of law. So while fundamental reform is probably off the table, we could see edits to Section 230 at the margins. It gets three&nbsp;JBEICs.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-broke-internet-can-joe-biden-fix-it/">Trump Broke the Internet.

Even if Wired downplays the chances of national privacy legislation, privacy will continue to be a big focus for local governments, businesses, and most importantly, users. <p>Indeed, California successfully passed Proposition 24, which aimed to close some loopholes from California’s original 2018 privacy legislation.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/one-clear-message-voters-election-more-privacy/">Wired</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>):</p><blockquote>Companies have many ways of profiting from collecting and accessing our data. Few involve money directly exchanging hands in a sale. The law approved Tuesday targets the companies once able to evade regulation by claiming they “share” but don’t “sell” data. CPRA combines the concepts of sharing, selling, and monetizing data. It requires companies to disclose what they’re collecting from users and with whom they’re selling or sharing the data, and it requires them to allow users to opt out of having their data collected, whether or not it’s “sold” in the literal&nbsp;sense.</blockquote><blockquote>CPRA creates a new category of Sensitive Personal Information (SPI), including race, sexuality, religion, and health data. Businesses must disclose to users if they plan to collect, share, or sell SPI. Once informed, users can prevent companies from sharing SPI. It also allocates $10 million to a new California Privacy Protection Agency that will enforce the&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, the language of the 2018 law left the door open for companies to require users to opt out of tracking from each site they visit rather than end tracking with one swoop. CPRA allows users to employ a global opt-out, such as a Do Not Track tool, but also to allow tracking selectively.</blockquote><p>Privacy as a value proposition also continues to build momentum on the business side of things. Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee just signed on some huge clients for his latest privacy project including the BBC, the NHS, and NatWest&nbsp;Bank.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/tim-berners-lee-attracts-nhs-bbc-natwest-to-inrupts-solid-platform.html">CNBC</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>):</p><blockquote>Inrupt, founded by Berners-Lee and CEO John Bruce in 2018, is aiming to develop technology that gives people control of their data, allowing them to choose where their data is stored and who has access to&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>The start-up announced Monday that it had launched an enterprise version of its Solid platform. Built with scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Solid allows users to create Personal Online Data Stores, or Pods, that they can then share with third party-apps if they&nbsp;wish.</blockquote><blockquote>Bruce <a href="https://inrupt.com/enterprise-server-release">wrote in a blog</a> that the NHS, for example, was using the platform to allow patients to store their personal medical data on Pods, as well as data from health apps on their phone or other&nbsp;devices.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s going to drive groundbreaking new opportunities that not only restore trust in data but also enhance our lives,” claimed Berners-Lee, who is Inrupt’s chief technology officer.</blockquote><p>We’ve talked about TBL’s project in the past and what really stands out is how spiritually aligned it is with the work we’re doing here at GlobaliD.

And digital identity will continue to gain prominence in the new Web. Now the market is starting to price in just how valuable that proposition is. <p>For instance, Stripe-backed Fast just notched a billion-dollar valuation. Here’s Fast CEO Domm Holland on digital identity:</p><blockquote>E-commerce was projected to be $5 or $6 trillion this year, and that was pre-COVID. And we all know that COVID has done nothing but amplify e-commerce. It grew by 30% quarter-over-quarter recently. So if we just won checkout, that’s already an incredibly large business. But really, there’s so much more value we can unlock with consumers and we definitely want to be providing more. I think that conviction spurs us on. But we’re never ever going to drive that value for consumers if we don’t execute on checkout first. For the time being, sure, we’re competing with fintechs. And it will always be a core part of our business. But if we become the identity network, you can’t quantify what that would be&nbsp;worth.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/fast-a-startup-backed-by-stripe-discusses-billion-dollar-valuation">Fast, a Startup Backed by Stripe, Discusses Billion-Dollar Valuation</a>  <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fast-checkout">Fast has a plan to reinvent online shopping.

Of course, the movement around self-sovereign identity takes that one step further. And according to Harvard, it’s “hot stuff”right now. <p>Here’s <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">the Harvard&nbsp;blog</a>:</p><blockquote>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is hot stuff. Look it up and see how many results you get. As of today, I get 627,000 on Google. By that measure alone, SSI is the biggest thing in the VRM development world. Nothing I know has more promise to give individuals leverage for dealing with the organizations of the world, especially in business.</blockquote><p>Also Harvard:</p><blockquote>The easiest tool to imagine is a wallet, or a wallet app (here’s one) with some kind of dashboard.</blockquote><p>It’s understandable then why Civic is <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-secure-identity-is-now-civic-wallet/">phasing out it’s identity app and merging it into its wallet</a>.

Speaking of decentralized identity, Paul wrote a neat piece on what he calls The Convenient Decentralization Theory. <p>Here’s <a href="https://pstav.medium.com/the-convenient-decentralization-theory-aece8ef2f31c">Paul</a>:</p><blockquote>In todays world, money, data, and identity largely live in a federated world, meaning that certain powers hold the vast majority of this information in silos. But just as the movement from “harvested ice” and “plant ice” in the early 1900s to refrigerators in the 1930s brought on unimaginable benefits and autonomy to people and businesses, so too I’d say the convenient decentralization theory&nbsp;applies.</blockquote><blockquote>The bitcoin movement, which has been taking off long before COVID, is moreso in the spotlight due to monetary policy concerns exacerbated by the epidemic. It’s brought to light just how easy it one day could be to create protocols for decentralized solutions and allow people to be more autonomous with their money and&nbsp;value.</blockquote><blockquote>The same ethos and technologies that apply to the bitcoin movement can apply to the data we generate online and the way we hold our digital identities. In short, web 3.0 and the ethos it brings will usher in a world where online trust will be re-imagined through decentralized online identities, the way our data is stored and monetized will be decentralized and yield direct payments to individuals, and the way we exchange and create value will be significantly easier than it is today (especially for the underbanked). Can you imagine the goodness that will come out of these movements? We’ve just but scratched the&nbsp;surface.</blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a>— <a href="https://pstav.medium.com/the-convenient-decentralization-theory-aece8ef2f31c">The Convenient Decentralization Theory</a></p> 7.

<p>Back in March 2019 Ubisecure’s Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) service, <a href="https://rapidlei.com/">RapidLEI</a>, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/profileaddress-legal-entity-identifier/">announced a partnership</a> with Austria-based data marketing specialist, ProfileAddress. Under its ‘<a href="https://www.register-lei.com/">Register-LEI</a>‘ brand, ProfileAddress joined RapidLEI’s Registration Agent (RA) programme as an RA for Austria, Germany and the UK. From 2020, Register-LEI’s services have been offered in additional markets, and it has become a global RA.</p>
<p>I caught up with CEO Michael Fux to discuss the current state of the LEI world and his vision for the future of Register-LEI.</p>
 Francesca: Let’s start at the beginning. Why did ProfileAddress decide to get started offering LEIs to its customers? 
<p></p>
<p>Michael: In 2017, a friend of mine who was working with a private bank in Liechtenstein mentioned problems with the registration of an LEI for his private wealth clients. We then set out to solve these problems. At first we applied to the GLEIF [Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation] as an LOU [Local Operating Unit], but quickly realised the advantages of working with RapidLEI as our LOU instead and focused on our quality of service and customer support as a RapidLEI Registration Agent.</p>
 F: And of course I have to ask, why did you choose – and continue to choose – RapidLEI as your LOU? 
<p>M: The choice was and is easy to make. Register-LEI stands for high-quality service based on state-of-the-art technical implementations. RapidLEI offers exactly that. Further, we aim to offer our customers excellent support and can ourselves rely on the support of the RapidLEI team. Finally, we both continually look for improvement to all services to ensure the highest standards of customer care.</p>
 F: What impact do you think the current global situation has had on LEIs? 
<p>M: In some countries, including Austria, you can benefit from tax advantages by investing in securities. However, this is subject to a positive annual result, which may be a problem in times of crisis. In those countries the rate of newly issued LEIs may drop. On the other hand, fresh money is being pumped into the economy to support it, which can lead to devaluation and inflation. This effect can be compensated for by buying stocks, and for that we need the LEI system and safe trading.</p>
 F: Do you foresee any trends for LEIs looking into 2021 and beyond? 
<p>M: The number of registered LEIs will generally grow. The rate of increase will depend on the situation in the individual market. However, the focus should also be on ensuring lapsed LEIs are renewed, so that organisations do not find themselves unable to trade at critical times [due to an invalid LEI and relevant regulations].</p>
 F: What’s next for Register-LEI? 
<p>M: Right now we are teaming up with KSV1870 (“Kreditschutzverband est. 1870”, one of Austria’s leading economic platforms with innovative, digital solutions) with the aim to become market leaders in Austria next year. At the same time, we are increasing our efforts in international English-speaking jurisdictions, financial centers and tax havens. Finally, Register-LEI offers LEI registration as well as managed services, outsourced or insourced.</p>

  <p>When COVID-19 changed how the world did business, organizations shifted into survival mode and pushed for a focus on digital products. As businesses <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-digital-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming-in-the-next-5-years/">shifted tactics</a>, customers made it clear that not only did they like the shift to digital, they’d prefer to stay there for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seventy-six percent of CIOs reported increased demand for new<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/"> digital products</a> and services as a result of COVID-19 and 83% expect that to increase further in 2021, according to the Gartner CIO Agenda 2021. Along the same line, 65% of CIOs saw an increase in the use of self-service by customers/citizens, and 79% expect that usage to grow in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is especially true among top-performing organizations, with nine out of 10 pursuing <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/digital-workplace-trends-you-cant-ignore/">digital channels</a> and nearly 75% introducing new digital products faster. And it seems to be working. Organizations that increased their use of digital channels to reach customers or citizens are 3.5 times more likely to be top performers than trailing ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These changes allow organizations to maintain and develop deeper relationships with established customers at a time when new customers are tough to find. More digital products and services or self-service avenues encourage established customers to spend more, despite a lack of in-person touchpoints. These digital avenues will also enable organizations to extend sales and service hours without requiring more staff.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>COVID-19 might dominate the headlines, but it’s just one of eight key macro factors that will reshape business in this decade. The global pandemic will have long-lasting and far-reaching impact on the business world, but other shifts in macrobusiness environment areas — such as systematic mistrust, weakening international relationships and climate change — have not gone away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-functional-leaders-should-know-about-scenario-planning/">Executives </a>will have to grapple with a host of other challenges during the 2020s, but from that maelstrom will rise new business opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic arrived at a time when economies were already on the edge,” said<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18594/Mark-Raskino"> Mark Raskino</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/symposium-spain">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>. “A decade-long boom, generated substantially from inexpensive finance and lower-cost energy, led to structural stresses such as highly leveraged debt, crumbling international alliances and bubble-like asset prices. These were overdue for a reckoning.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 No. 1: Global pandemic&nbsp; 
<p>The impact of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">COVID-19 </a>will depend heavily on how long the pandemic lasts. A shorter time frame means that people will revert more quickly to pre-pandemic ways of operating. For example, after 9/11, people reverted to normal flying behavior three years later. If the pandemic persists, it’s more likely to have long-lasting societal effects. For example, the Great Depression impacted food habits for decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about how the pandemic will affect societal behaviors like personal hygiene and personal space norms, social gatherings and family interactions, the savings ratio and consumer buying habits.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 2: Market crash and recession&nbsp; 
<p>Although COVID-19 served as the visible catalyst for the 2020 market crashes and subsequent recovery, the reality is that the markets were already fragile and precarious. In fact, Gartner found that in 2018 and 2019, half of CEOs were anticipating and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/use-this-3-phase-framework-to-navigate-the-covid-19-downturn/">preparing for an economic downturn</a>, which makes this recession unique to those in 2002–2003 and 2009. However, no one anticipated the deep damage caused by COVID-19, with a crash followed by persistent volatility.</p>
<p>Look to exploit remote work and e-commerce for better infrastructure and target requisitions to accelerate the digital business journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 No. 3: Systemic mistrust&nbsp; 
<p>Even before COVID-19, global consumer and citizen trust was at an all-time low. Now, closed borders, fights for vaccines, and arguments over masks and rules, combined with a mistrust of “other”— even previously close trading partners — threaten to widen the gap. However, it’s possible that over the long term, a common enemy in the virus will inspire empathy, common purpose and cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, executives should consider whether consumers will continue to be loyal to long-standing brands or shift to those that have supplies of limited goods. CEOs had to make difficult decisions in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Evaluate whether those actions irrevocably shifted attitudes toward the brand. A more personal connection — such as an open, authentic and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-proactive-customer-experience-in-the-midst-of-covid-19/">empathetic email to customers</a> — might help overcome distrust.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 4: Weak productivity&nbsp; 
<p>Slow productivity growth and a lack of focus on efficiency and productivity has been at odds with the economic growth of the past decade. COVID-19 further reduced productivity by complicating business operations. The cost of operating in a socially distanced world is increasing costs, requiring significant reengineering to return to pre-COVID productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set bold goals for productivity that necessitate reinvention.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 5: Environment concerns&nbsp; 
<p>At the very start of 2020, climate change was moving to the forefront of framing long-term business strategy and plans. Although temporarily overshadowed by COVID-19, half of CEOs still see climate change as a factor impacting their industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by temporary environmental wins caused by lockdowns and reduced travel, although you can look to these outcomes for inspiration on how to adjust work permanently. Keep in mind that major infrastructure projects designed to mitigate climate change could be delayed in some geographies by a redirection of funding to stimulus packages, requiring alternative carbon reducing strategies to be invented.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 6: Talent shortage&nbsp; 
<p>Despite an increase in unemployment rates globally, key talent shortages will continue to plague executives. While COVID-19 has increased unemployment and underemployment, it has not created <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lack-of-skills-threatens-digital-transformation/">new pools of in-demand talent</a>. Even small shortfalls of critical talent will corrode or destroy market positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reconsider what types of skill sets will be needed in the post-COVID-19 world, and begin or increase reskilling programs during downtimes. Introduce agile learning as a core management philosophy and consider ways to widen the talent availability pool by rethinking remote work or gig economy options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-the-workforce-you-need-post-covid-19/">Build the Workforce You Need Post-COVID-19</a></p>
 No. 7: Technology advancement 
<p>Technology advancement will, of course, have a large effect in the coming decade. AI, blockchain, quantum computing and the mass arrival of machine customers will change how organizations and societies operate. There will be more frequent market disruptions and the emergence of what comes after digital: Autonomous business. This will change the landscape of the decade.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>ForgeRockers are a passionate and powerful crew! We showed what we can do to make a difference in our communities during our recent Global Action Week where we took time out of our regular schedules to give back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Employees across the globe put on their masks and ventured out into their communities to clean up parks and schools, feed the hungry, mentor, volunteer at animal sanctuaries, advocate for STEM programs in schools, or support the elderly. The pandemic meant a course correction for some of our ideas, but together we logged more than 200 volunteer hours service worldwide over the course of five days.&nbsp;</p>

 ForgeRockers Give Back&nbsp; 

<p>“While this year has been a tough one for everyone, we recognized that it was more important to our employees than ever to give back to the communities, organizations and initiatives that meant the most to them. I am extremely proud of the CSR team’s ability to react to the changing environment and still host a dynamic and rewarding Global Action Week that has empowered so many ForgeRock employees to take action and make a difference.” - Ben Hutchings, CSR Lead &amp; People Program Manager</p>

<p>"I hiked about 42km in the Lake District over three days carrying everything we needed for the trip in our backpacks. During the hike I used the app Charity Miles to raise over $500 for a global organization called Girl Up. I chose Girl Up, as they are a movement to advance girls' skills, rights, and opportunities to be leaders. As someone who identifies as female within both the STEM industry, and hiking community - both areas where female representation is the minority - this is an important cause I feel particularly close with.” - Becky Maund, Senior Support Engineer</p>

<p>“I spent the day volunteering at Odd Man Inn Animal Refuge in Washougal, WA. They are a nonprofit farm sanctuary, adoption shelter, and wildlife rehab center. Odd Man Inn has a special place in my heart for taking in abused animals that have no other place to go. I had the pleasure of making sure all of the animals were happy, healthy, comfortable, and felt safe and right at home by cleaning their living quarters, passing out meals, and providing pets with the love and pampering they deserve.” - Krismy Botkin, Software Engineer</p>

<p>“I took a two man canoe down to the Bristol Harbour and taped some bin bags to the front seat of my canoe, and with the power of oars and a small net I paddled across the harbour cleaning rubbish from the water. Being in the center of the city, it can often fall prey to people mistaking the river for a garbage bin. This is a shame because there is actually a lot of wildlife on and under the water. By the end, I was tired but extremely satisfied with the amount of refuse I had collected. It's something I'd definitely do again.” - George Knight, HR Technology &amp; Data Manager</p>

<p>“A few coworkers and I spent the morning cleaning up Dolores Park in San Francisco. Many San Francisco residents don’t have yards or gardens, so public parks become our refuge when we want to (safely) get some fresh air. A lot of work goes into maintaining these spaces, and I felt that it was important to give back to the place that has helped my mental and physical health during this time.” - Greta Sohn, Content Marketing Manager</p>

 ForgeRock Learns 

<p>In addition to actively giving back to their communities, ForgeRockers also participated in a speaker series. Throughout the week, we hosted four virtual discussions. We learned about busting the mental health stigma from Tara Robinson from <a href="https://changesbristol.org.uk/">Changes Bristol</a>. We also spoke with <a href="https://www.tiffanydawson.co/">Tiffany Dawson</a> about how to promote gender equality in STEM. Felisia Castaneda from <a href="https://www.recology.com/recology-san-francisco/">Recology San Francisco</a> taught us how we can all make small changes that impact the environment. And we closed out the week with a powerful discussion about racism and DE&amp;I with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinwithane/">Kevin Withane</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 550 Hours Dedicated&nbsp; 

<p>By the end of the week, we had spent more than 200 hours volunteering and more than 300 combined hours learning. Global Action Week is a terrific extension of our purpose as a company to help people access the connected world - safely and simply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m so proud of our collective efforts and can’t wait to see what we accomplish next year!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I collaborated on this post with <a href="https://twitter.com/marcushellberg">Marcus Hellberg</a>, Head of Community at Vaadin. Marcus and I met years ago on the conference circuit, and we’re both from Finland. My great grandparents were Finnish and built the sauna and cabin I grew up in in Montana’s remote woods. Marcus and I share a passion for using Java and web technologies to build fast, efficient applications.</p>
 
 
<p>You might notice we keep saying "Vaadin Fusion" instead of "Vaadin." I’ve always thought Vaadin was a web framework based on Google’s GWT (Google Web Toolkit). I asked Marcus about this, and he explained to me there are now two products—Vaadin Flow and Vaadin Fusion.</p>
 
 
<p>The classic Vaadin server-side Java API is now called Vaadin Flow. Vaadin Fusion is a new TypeScript frontend framework designed for Java backends. Both offer full-stack type safety and use the same set of UI components. Vaadin is no longer based on GWT. Instead, its components use web component standards.</p>

 What Is Vaadin Fusion? 
 
 
<p><a href="https://vaadin.com/">Vaadin Fusion</a> is an open-source, front-end framework designed specifically for Java backends. Fusion gives you type-safe access to your backend from your client app by auto-generating TypeScript interfaces for your server Java objects. It wraps REST calls in async TypeScript methods, so you can access your backend as easily as calling any TypeScript function.</p>
 
 
<p>End-to-end type checking means you catch any breaking changes at build time, not in production. Oh, and there’s auto-complete everywhere, so you can focus on coding, not reading API docs.</p>
 
 
<p>Views are written in TypeScript with LitElement, a lightweight, reactive component library.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Spring Boot-based Vaadin Fusion Application 
 
 
<p>Begin by creating a new Vaadin Fusion app with the <a href="https://start.vaadin.com/">Vaadin starter wizard</a>. It allows you to configure views, tech stack, and theme before downloading an app starter.</p>
 
 
<p>Rename the About view to "People" and change its URL to "people":</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Go into the application settings and change the name to <code>Vaadin Okta</code>. Then, select TypeScript + HTML for the UI stack to get a Fusion project.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
<p>Click Download, and you’ll get a zip file containing a Maven project.</p>
 
 
<p>Open the project in your IDE.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The two important folders in the project are:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>/frontend</code> - This folder contains all the frontend code</p>
 
 
<p><code>/src/main/java</code> - This folder includes all the backend code, which is a Spring Boot app</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Start the application with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The launcher should open up the app in your default browser. If not, navigate to <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Secure Your Spring Boot Backend Services 
 
 
<p>Vaadin Fusion uses type-safe endpoints for server access. You create an endpoint by annotating a class with <code>@Endpoint</code>. This will export all the methods in the class and make them callable from TypeScript. Vaadin will also generate TypeScript interfaces for any data types the methods use.</p>
 
 
<p>Vaadin endpoints require authentication by default. You can explicitly make an endpoint class or a single method accessible to unauthenticated users by adding an <code>@AnonymousAllowed</code> annotation.</p>
 
 
<p>In this app, you want to restrict access to only authenticated users. You’ll use OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Okta to make this possible.</p>
 
 
 Add the Okta Spring Boot Starter 
 
<p>Add the Okta Spring Boot starter and Lombok dependencies to the <code>&lt;dependencies&gt;</code> section of your <code>pom.xml</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.4.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;

&lt;!-- Only for convenience, not required for using Vaadin or Okta --&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.projectlombok&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;lombok&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Make sure your IDE imports the dependencies, or re-run <code>mvn</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 Register an OpenID Connect Application 
 
<p>Create a free Okta developer account on <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">developer.okta.com</a> if you don’t already have one.</p>
 
 
<p>Once logged in, go to Applications &gt; Add Application and select Single-Page App.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Configure the app settings and click Done to create the app:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
<p>Name: Vaadin Fusion</p>
 
 
<p>Base URIs: <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code></p>
 
 
<p>Login redirect URIs: <code><a href="http://localhost:8080/callback">http://localhost:8080/callback</a></code></p>
 
 
<p>Logout redirect URIs: <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code></p>
 
 
<p>Grant type allowed: Authorization Code</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Store the issuer in <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> by adding the following property:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Configure Spring Security 
 
<p>Vaadin integrates with Spring Security to handle authorization. Instead of restricting access to specific routes as you would with Spring REST controllers, you need permit all traffic to <code>/**</code> so Vaadin can handle security.</p>
 
 
<p>Vaadin is configured to:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Serve <code>index.html</code> for the root path and any unmatched server route</p>
 
 
<p>Serve static assets</p>
 
 
<p>Handle authorization and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection in server endpoints</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>By default, all server endpoints require an authenticated user. You can allow anonymous access to an endpoint or a method by adding an <code>@AnonymousAllowed</code> annotation. You can further restrict access by adding <code>@RolesAllowed</code> to an endpoint or a method.</p>
 
 






The security configuration below assumes you are only serving a Vaadin Fusion application. Suppose you are also serving Spring REST controllers or other non-Vaadin resources. In that case, you need to configure their access control separately, for instance, adding <code>antMatchers("/api/**").authenticated()</code> if you serve REST APIs under <code>/api</code>.



 
 
<p>Create a new class <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> in the same package as <code>Application.java</code> with the following contents:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.application;

import com.okta.spring.boot.oauth.Okta;

import org.springframework.http.HttpMethod;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.WebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    public void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {
        // @formatter:off
        web.ignoring()
          .antMatchers(HttpMethod.OPTIONS, "/**")
          .antMatchers("/**/*.{js,html,css,webmanifest}");
        // @formatter:on
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        // @formatter:off
        // Vaadin handles CSRF for its endpoints

        http.csrf().ignoringAntMatchers("/connect/**")
            .and()
            .authorizeRequests()
            // allow access to everything, Vaadin will handle security
            .antMatchers("/**").permitAll()
            .and()
            .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        // @formatter:on

        Okta.configureResourceServer401ResponseBody(http);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Vaadin Endpoint for Accessing Data 
 
<p>Now that you have the server set up for authenticating requests add a service you can call from the client app.</p>
 
 
<p>First, create a <code>Person.java</code> class to use as the data model in the <code>com.example.application.views.people</code> package.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.application.views.people;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Person {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you aren’t using Lombok, omit the annotations and add a constructor that takes in <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code>, and create getters and setters for both.</p>
 
 






If you’re doing this tutorial in an IDE, you may need to enable annotation processing so Lombok can generate code for you. See Lombok’s instructions { <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij">IntelliJ IDEA</a> } for more information.



 
 
<p>Open <code>PeopleEndpoint.java</code> and replace the contents with the following:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.application.views.people;

import com.vaadin.flow.server.connect.Endpoint;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

@Endpoint
public class PeopleEndpoint {

    // We'll use a simple list to hold data
    private List&lt;Person&gt; people = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

    public PeopleEndpoint() {
        // Add one person so we can see that everything works
        people.add(new Person("Jane", "Doe"));
    }

    public List&lt;Person&gt; getPeople() {
        return people;
    }

    public Person adEclipsedPerson(Person person) {
        people.add(person);
        return person;
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Vaadin will make the <code>getPeople()</code> and <code>addPerson()</code> methods available as asynchronous TypeScript methods. It will also generate a TypeScript interface for <code>Person</code>, so you can access the same type-information of both on the server and in the client.</p>
 
 
 
 Call the Spring Boot Endpoint from Vaadin Fusion 
 
<p>Create a view that uses the server API. Open <code>frontend/views/people/people-view.ts</code> and replace its code with the following:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import {
  LitElement,
  html,
  css,
  customElement,
  internalProperty,
} from 'lit-element';
import Person from '../../generated/com/example/application/views/people/Person';

import '@vaadin/vaadin-text-field';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-button';
import { Binder, field } from '@vaadin/form';
import PersonModel from '../../generated/com/example/application/views/people/PersonModel';
import { addPerson, getPeople } from '../../generated/PeopleEndpoint';

@customElement('people-view')
export class PeopleView extends LitElement {
  @internalProperty()
  private people: Person[] = [];
  @internalProperty()
  private message = '';

  // Manages form state, binds inputs to the model
  private binder = new Binder(this, PersonModel);

  render() {
    const { model } = this.binder;

    return html`
     &lt;h1&gt;People&lt;/h1&gt;

     &lt;div class="message"&gt;${this.message}&lt;/div&gt;

     &lt;ul&gt;
       ${this.people.map(
      (person) =&gt; html`&lt;li&gt;${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}&lt;/li&gt;`
    )}
     &lt;/ul&gt;

     &lt;h2&gt;Add new person&lt;/h2&gt;
     &lt;div class="form"&gt;
       &lt;vaadin-text-field
         label="First Name"
         ...=${field(model.firstName)}
       &gt;&lt;/vaadin-text-field&gt;
       &lt;vaadin-text-field
         label="Last Name"
         ...=${field(model.lastName)}
       &gt;&lt;/vaadin-text-field&gt;
       &lt;vaadin-button @click=${this.add}&gt;Add&lt;/vaadin-button&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
   `;
  }

  async connectedCallback() {
    super.connectedCallback();
    try {
      this.people = await getPeople();
    } catch (e) {
      this.message = `Failed to get people: ${e.message}.`;
    }
  }

  async add() {
    try {
      const saved = await this.binder.submitTo(addPerson);
      if (saved) {
        this.people = [...this.people, saved];
        this.binder.clear();
      }
    } catch (e) {
      this.message = `Failed to save: ${e.message}.`;
    }
  }

  static styles = css`
   :host {
     display: block;
     padding: var(--lumo-space-m) var(--lumo-space-l);
   }
 `;
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Here’s what this code does:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Defines two internal properties: <code>people</code> and <code>message</code> to hold the component’s state. Any time a property changes, the template will get re-rendered efficiently.</p>
 
 
<p>Initialized a <code>Binder</code> for handling the new-person form. It keeps track of the model value, handles validations, and submits the value to the endpoint.</p>
 
 
<p>The template:</p>
 
 
 
<p>Lists all people in an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>)</p>
 
 
<p>Displays a form for adding new people. The form uses two Vaadin components: <code>vaadin-text-field</code> and <code>vaadin-button</code>. The fields are bound to the Binder with the help of a spread operator (<code>…​=${field(…​)}</code>). You can read more about forms in the <a href="https://vaadin.com/docs/v17/flow/client-side-forms/tutorial-binder.html">Vaadin documentation</a></p>
 
 
<p>The Add button calls the <code>add()</code> method, which submits the form to the backend and adds the saved <code>Person</code> to the people array.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p>If any of the server calls fail, <code>message</code> gets populated to inform the user.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Start Your Vaadin + Spring Boot App 
 
<p>Start the application with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should now be able to launch the application and see the views. However, if you try to access the People page, you’ll get an error because you aren’t authenticated.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You need to add a login view and authenticate the user before calling any of the secure endpoints.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Add a Vaadin Login Page and Restrict Access to Views 
 
 
<p>You are going to use a custom login screen and Okta Auth JS to authenticate users. You will do this in three steps:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a service for handling everything auth related</p>
 
 
<p>Create a login view</p>
 
 
<p>Restrict view access to logged-in users and redirect unauthenticated users to the login view</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create an Auth Service for Authentication 
 
<p>Begin by installing the Okta Auth JS library with npm:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@4.0.3</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, create a new file, <code>auth.ts</code>, in the <code>frontend</code> folder. This is where all the authentication magic happens.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import { AccessToken, OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const authClient = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktadomain}/oauth2/default', // use your own
  clientId: '{frontend app client id}', // use your own
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/callback',
  pkce: true
});

const isAuthenticated = async () =&gt; {
  // Checks if there is a current accessToken in the TokenManger.
  return !!(await authClient.tokenManager.get('accessToken'));
};

const signIn = async (username: string, password: string) =&gt; {
  const authResult = await authClient.signIn({
    username,
    password,
    scopes: ['openid', 'email', 'profile'],
  });

  if (authResult.status === 'SUCCESS') {
    authClient.token.getWithRedirect({
      sessionToken: authResult.sessionToken,
      responseType: 'id_token',
    });
  }
};

const signOut = () =&gt; authClient.signOut();

const handleAuthentication = async () =&gt; {
  if (authClient.token.isLoginRedirect()) {
    try {
      const tokenResponse = await authClient.token.parseFromUrl();
      const {accessToken, idToken} = tokenResponse.tokens;
      if (!accessToken || !idToken) return false;

      authClient.tokenManager.add('accessToken', accessToken);
      authClient.tokenManager.add('idToken', idToken);
      return true;
    } catch (err) {
      console.warn(`authClient.token.parseFromUrl() errored: ${err}`);
      return false;
    }
  }
  return false;
};

const getAccessToken = async () =&gt; {
  const token = (await authClient.tokenManager.get(
    'accessToken'
  )) as AccessToken;

  return token;
};

export {
  isAuthenticated,
  signIn,
  signOut,
  handleAuthentication,
  getAccessToken,
};</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Here’s what <code>auth.ts</code> does:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>It creates an internal instance of <code>AuthClient</code> configured with your info</p>
 
 
<p>It exports the following methods:</p>
 
 
 
<p><code>isAuthenticated</code> returns a boolean indicating whether or not the user is authenticated</p>
 
 
<p><code>signIn</code> takes a username and password and asks the client to authenticate. The client will redirect to the redirect URI</p>
 
 
<p><code>handleAuthentication</code> reads the response from the redirect and saves the returned tokens</p>
 
 
<p><code>getAccessToken</code> returns the access token for use with server calls</p>
 
 
<p><code>signOut</code> signs out the user</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Login View 
 
<p>Next, create a login view so users can enter their credentials and get authenticated.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new folder <code>frontend/views/login</code>. In that folder, create a new file <code>login-view.ts</code> with the following content:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>import { customElement, html, internalProperty, LitElement } from 'lit-element';
import { signIn } from '../../auth';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-login/vaadin-login-form';

@customElement('login-view') (1)
export class LoginView extends LitElement {

    }

  protected createRenderRoot() {
    return this;
  }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
The view uses LitElement to define a new component, <code>&lt;login-view&gt;</code>.


2
Use the <code>&lt;vaadin-login-form&gt;</code> element for capturing login information.


3
The <code>login-event</code> is bound to the login method with <code>@login=${this.login}</code>.


4
The <code>login()</code> method calls the <code>signIn()</code> function in the <code>auth</code> service, which in turn will redirect the user to the callback URL.


 
 
 
 
 
 Restrict View Access to Authenticated Users 
 
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is to add an authentication guard that only allows logged-in users to access the views. Any unauthenticated users should be redirected to the login page first. You also need to define logic for capturing the callback from Okta and logging out users.</p>
 
 
<p>Open <code>frontend/index.ts</code> and replace its contents with the following:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import { Commands, Context, Route, Router } from '@vaadin/router';

import './views/main/main-view';
import './views/login/login-view';
import './views/helloworld/hello-world-view';
import { handleAuthentication, isAuthenticated, signOut } from './auth';

const authGuard = async (context: Context, commands: Commands) =&gt; {
  if (!(await isAuthenticated())) {
    // Save requested path
    sessionStorage.setItem('login-redirect-path', context.pathname);
    return commands.redirect('/login');
  }
  return undefined;
};

const routes: Route[] = [
  { path: '/login', component: 'login-view' },
  {
    path: '/callback',
    action: async (_: Context, commands: Commands) =&gt; {
      if (await handleAuthentication()) {
        return commands.redirect(
          sessionStorage.getItem('login-redirect-path') || '/'
        );
      } else {
        return commands.redirect('/login?error');
      }
    },
  },
  {
    path: '/logout',
    action: async (_: Context, commands: Commands) =&gt; {
      signOut();
      location.reload();
      return commands.prevent();
    },
  },
  {
    path: '',
    component: 'main-view',
    action: authGuard, // Require a logged in user to access
    children: [
      { path: '', component: 'hello-world-view' },
      { path: 'hello', component: 'hello-world-view' },
      {
        path: 'people',
        component: 'people-view',
        action: async () =&gt; {
          await import('./views/people/people-view');
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];

export const router = new Router(document.querySelector('#outlet'));
router.setRoutes(routes);</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Here’s what this code does:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>authGuard</code> is a Vaadin Router action that uses the auth service to check if a user is authenticated. If not, it will save the requested path and redirect to the login view</p>
 
 
<p>In the router configuration, you added three routes:</p>
 
 
 
<p><code>login</code> maps to the login view component you created in the previous step</p>
 
 
<p><code>callback</code> handles the return value from Okta. If the authentication was successful, it will navigate to the path the user requested before being redirected to the login page</p>
 
 
<p><code>logout</code> signs out the user from the Okta Auth JS client and then destroys the Spring Security context by calling <code>/logout</code> on the server</p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Adds the <code>authGuard</code> to <code>main-view</code> with <code>action: authGuard</code></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Consume the Secure Endpoint from the Client 
 
 
<p>One last thing we need to take care of before we can access the backend is to include the access token JWT with server requests. We can do this with a middleware.</p>
 
 
 Create a Middleware to Add the Access Token JWT to Server Requests 
 
<p>Create a new file, <code>connect-client.ts</code> in the <code>frontend</code> folder with the following content:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import {
  ConnectClient,
  MiddlewareContext,
  MiddlewareNext,
} from '@vaadin/flow-frontend/Connect';
import { getAccessToken } from './auth';

const client = new ConnectClient({
  prefix: 'connect',
  middlewares: [
    async function addAuthHeaderMiddleware(
      context: MiddlewareContext,
      next: MiddlewareNext
    ) {
      const token = await getAccessToken();
      if (token) {
        context.request.headers.set(
          'Authorization',
          `Bearer ${token.accessToken}`
        );
      }
      return next(context);
    },
  ],
});

export default client;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The middleware uses the <code>auth</code> service to get the access token and adds it to the outgoing request headers.</p>
 
 
 
 Call the Secure Endpoint Methods 
 
<p>You are now ready to use the application. Run the application with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Once the application is up, go to <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code>, log in with the user you created.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Once you are logged in, you should be able to view and add people through the secure server endpoint.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Add a Logout Link 
 
<p>Finally, add a logout link so users can sign out when they’re done.</p>
 
 
<p>Open <code>main-view.ts</code> and add a link at the end of the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section of the template, just after the Avatar image:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;header slot="navbar" theme="dark"&gt;
  &lt;vaadin-drawer-toggle&gt;&lt;/vaadin-drawer-toggle&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;${this.getSelectedTabName(this.menuTabs)}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/user.svg" alt="Avatar" /&gt;
  &lt;a href="logout" class="logout"&gt;Log out&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add a margin to the link so that it doesn’t touch the edge of the screen in the styles section of <code>main-view.ts</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
header h1 {
  font-size: var(--lumo-font-size-l);
  margin: 0;
}

header .logout {
  margin-right: 12px;
}
...</code> 
 
 
 
<p>After making these changes, you should see a Log out link in the top right corner.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Now you should be able to log in, add people, and log out. Huzzah! 😃</p>

This reduces wallet holders to a passive role, which at best delivers suboptimal utility to the holder, and at worst can reinforce the unhealthy power asymmetries between institutions and people that exist today.</p><p>Interactive connections solve this problem by creating a two-way street between a wallet holder and an institution.

<p>Before the pandemic, most organizations moved their digital strategies forward at a steady pace. Leaders either wanted proof of success and didn’t feel great urgency to invest more in digital or the organizational culture seemed resistant.</p>
<p>But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, many employees started <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ask-these-questions-before-deploying-remote-access-technology/">to work remotely</a> and organizations ramped up digital engagement with customers. Surveyed corporate directors increased the development of digital products and services to maintain and accelerate their customer engagement, and help them reach their revenue growth targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz05NTlhZjA0MDE0NDgxMWViYWJhYTBhNTZkNmU3ZDRjZg=="></a></p>
<p>The way forward for them was to increase, rather than decrease, the speed of<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/prioritize-digital-business-initiatives-to-accelerate-into-the-future/"> their digital business initiatives </a>and to elevate funding for IT to support this acceleration.</p>
<p>The survey found that 87% of corporate directors deemed technology as having a transformational role in addressing strategic business priorities. Sixty-seven percent of corporate directors expected budgetary increases in technology, and the majority of them anticipated a 6.9% increase in their current IT budgets as a result of the acceleration.</p>
 Why is digital strategy acceleration important now? 
<p>Digital business acceleration is important now for three reasons:</p>
 
 COVID-19. The pandemic demonstrated the value of digital initiatives in e-commerce, deliveries, supply chain virtualization, process automation and other activities, especially where physical activities were no longer possible. 
 Costs and operations. The recession has driven the need to overhaul costs and streamline operations. 
 Results. The rapid responses to the pandemic make accelerating digital business seem feasible and also critical for the survival of a company. 
 
 Boards of directors position the CIO as a partner in digital strategy&nbsp; 
<p>To respond to this crisis and its aftermath, the role of the CIO as an advisor to the board on digital business issues will also increasingly change. More than half of boards of directors said that CIOs will serve as partners with senior business leaders, while over a third look to the CIO to lead digital business issues alone.</p>

 Knock, knock. Who’s there? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To most Americans, the question is a pathway to laughter. To many Sub-Saharan Africans, on the other hand, the matter of who’s who can be painfully complicated, inconvenient, or potentially transformative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">494 million</a>&nbsp;people do not have a form of identification, which is as much as 45% of the population. In other words, almost half of the Sub-Saharan Africans cannot prove who they say they are, thus walled off from access to public services and social welfare such as education or healthcare, denied the right to vote, and left ineligible to participate in any formal financial transactions or economic activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Cash. Cash Who? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implications of identification on livelihoods are more pronounced in the region because, among the many challenges mentioned above, Sub-Saharan Africa has historically hosted the biggest population underserved by the financial sector. </p>
<blockquote><p>Despite steady growth over the past years,&nbsp;<a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=1228">less than one-third</a> of adults (age 15+) in the region own at least one financial account, compared with the world average of 67.1% and 93.8% in North America. Without an ID, individuals and businesses have no options but to rely on cash transactions.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financially speaking, for individuals, having a digital identity means&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/toward-new-impact-narrative-financial-inclusion">building resilience</a>&nbsp;— coping strategies in the face of life uncertainties and changes. It could be done through activities like instant online saving, instead of having to choose between finding a reliable savings club, spending hours traveling to a bank, and keeping cash under the pillow. It also significantly eases the process of participation in pension schemes and receiving qualified subsidies. The value of digital identity to individuals is more than resilience building; it’s also about seizing opportunities. By leveraging financing tools such as loans or investments, individuals have higher chances to survive and thrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the business front, having an identity as the business owner helps with financing for business needs, such as a planned expansion or weathering an unplanned pandemic, through formal financial arrangements with&nbsp;<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.617.4016&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">more competitive interest rates</a>. It also builds business credit history, which is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/blog/10-stats-explain-why-business-credit-important-small-business">especially meaningful</a>&nbsp;to small to medium enterprises. Moreover, having a credible online presence verified by the government agencies or a third-party IDV service provider can be a critical part of customer acquisition in today’s global economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, financial inclusion banks on identification, and to Sub-Saharan Africa, digital identity will turbo-charge inclusive financial growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No Time Like the Present 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers have&nbsp;<a href="https://faculty.babson.edu/lcdstein/research/stein-yannelis-freedmanbank.pdf">found</a>&nbsp;that financial inclusion interventions have a larger effect on people who open bank accounts earlier than those who do so later. It takes time for the enabling effect of digital identity on financial inclusion to occur, and so does the digitalization of identity. The writer argues that now is the best time to assess the needs for designing and rolling out digital identity systems that serve both the currently documented and undocumented in the region. The region can leverage the existing and continuously developing mobile networks and data and privacy regulation frameworks and follow in the footsteps of a few pioneer countries in the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SIM connection rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to grow from 77% in 2019 to 86% by the end of 2025, at a CAGR of 4.3%, and the mobile internet user rate from 26% to 39%, at a CAGR of 9.7%, according to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GSMA_MobileEconomy2020_SSA_Eng.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;published by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/">GSM Association</a>. The rising mobile penetration level lays a solid foundation for the potential continent-wide rollout of mobile identity, whose worldwide addressable market was valued at $34 billion through 2022, per OWI’s&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/product/mobile-identity-the-34-billion-opportunity/">research in 2018</a>. The high mobile penetration rate also means plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SCT_Report_R_WebSingles.pdf">opportunities</a>&nbsp;leveraging tools such as mobile money for transactions among individuals and businesses and government-sponsored cash transfer programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A reliable digital identity system also needs to be backed by a strong data and privacy regulation framework. By 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://unctad.org/news/data-and-privacy-unprotected-one-third-countries-despite-progress">half</a>&nbsp;of the African countries have had data and privacy legislation in place, and 61% have set up e-transaction laws, with the number&nbsp;<a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2019/12/24/kenya-now-has-a-data-protection-law-what-does-this-mean-for-netizens/">on a gradual rise</a>.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, several countries in the region have already taken the first stab at the digital identity system. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europeanceo.com/world-view/electronic-identification-cards-herald-a-digital-future-for-ghana/">Ghana</a>&nbsp;began its national registration and issuance of electronic ID cards to citizens in 2018;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/kenya-creates-africas-first-national-digital-id-scheme/">Kenya</a>&nbsp;is creating a population-wide identity scheme in Africa, a US$60 million program; and earlier this year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/loans-credits/2020/02/18/nigeria-digital-identification-for-development-project">Nigeria</a>&nbsp;launched the Digital Identification for Development Project with a US$115 million credit from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA). The identity digitization initiatives in these countries are not only meaningful for financial inclusion. They serve as trailblazers for their neighboring countries, especially given the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/digital-identity-for-all-push-in-africa-now-has-clarity-and-political-will-id4africa-executive-director">increasing demand</a>&nbsp;for digital identity and digital assets driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and its&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239797">disproportionate economic impact</a>&nbsp;among households.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the rising mobile penetration, the promising regulatory landscape, and the countries carrying the torch, there are hurdles to clear. For instance, there’s still room for modification in regulation. It is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/no244_0.pdf">found</a>&nbsp;that many of the data and privacy laws are not as comprehensive as international regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Some of the rights enforced by GDPR such as the right to data portability, which&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/data-protection-and-privacy-laws">mitigates the risk</a>&nbsp;of locking consumers into a single service provider, is not covered in these laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, while policymakers and other stakeholders, like international organizations, should be careful when evaluating costs and feasibilities, the benefits of acting sooner rather than later are self-evident. With the data collected from digital identity systems, from simple data like population and gender ratio, to more complicated data points like health and socio-economic statistics, Sub-Saharan African policymakers will be<a href="https://theconversation.com/poor-data-affects-africas-ability-to-make-the-right-policy-decisions-64064">&nbsp;better positioned</a>&nbsp;to conduct evidence-based research and make data-informed policies. In addition, better infrastructure supported by government initiatives will help attract private-sector players both at home and abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital identity can be a transformative force in advancing regional criticalities such as financial inclusion in the public and private sectors. The sooner we take action, the faster we may bring changes to communities in need.</p>

  <p>The question of how much control to retain versus how much to give up is something that occupies the minds of parents, management consultants, and often coaches. A high level of control helps achieve specific objectives, but, at the same time, it may lead to a complex bureaucracy that slows down self-initiative, entrepreneurship, and general productivity. A high level of empowerment, on the other hand, fosters creativity and ownership, but it may lead to unmanageable or risky outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the world of identity and security, organizations across all sectors also face this conundrum. Managing identity involves both controlled (stateful) and autonomous (stateless) security tokens.&nbsp;</p>

  Stateful tokens are opaque and can be de-referenced by a central authority only after request (token introspection). The authority manages the state of the token, including revocation. The token depends on the availability and performance of the authority. 
	 Stateless tokens are self-contained and can be "unpacked" by any party with the appropriate key material. Stateless tokens can be processed with or without the availability of an authoritative service.&nbsp; 
 <p>Knowing which to use is often straightforward, but sometimes what you really want to deploy is something in between.</p>

 A Closer Look at Token Swapping Use Cases 

<p>Exposing open services and APIs to external clients is a perfect use case for stateful tokens. Because external clients can be located anywhere and security tokens can travel over many networks, more control is needed. With stateful tokens, you can have opaque tokens that don’t carry sensitive content, always introspect tokens against a central authority, and revoke tokens as needed to provide a high level of control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a> architectures that require security checks at every stage, including each microservice-to-microservice call, using stateless tokens makes more sense. That’s because they don’t depend on a central authority, which could impact the ability to scale and to continue operations if the authority is unreachable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Token swapping describes the ability to exchange one security token for another in a different, enriched, or restricted form. A gateway can function as the "token swapper." It intercepts requests, validates tokens, and generates new tokens either by itself or in conjunction with other services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let’s look at the example of a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services">financial</a> company exposing APIs to partner organizations. Such a scenario requires a higher level of control and the ability to revoke granted access, so, for these external clients, the financial institution issues stateful tokens. Token swapping allows the company to use those stateful tokens on the front end but then switch to stateless tokens for scalability and other benefits within their microservices environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you swap a stateful token for a stateless token in the right way and at the right time, you can achieve that delicate balance between control and autonomy to better suit your purposes.</p>

  <p>In the aforementioned scenario, ForgeRock Identity Gateway, deployed as a north-south gateway, validates stateful OAuth2 tokens by introspection with ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">Access Management</a>, ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">Identity Cloud</a>, or any other OAuth2 authorization server. After validating the stateful token, Identity Gateway then generates a stateless JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the identity information the downstream services need to proceed autonomously.</p>

<p>Self-contained JWTs are a compelling token type for scenarios that require a high level of scaling, do not have a strong dependency on external services (such as the authority), and can tolerate the absence of token revocation capability. For many microservices scenarios, this is a very effective use case for token swapping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Local JWT validation can also be conducted by service meshes, such as Istio, or by ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">Identity Gateway</a>, deployed as an east-west gateway, or Microgateway with the JwtValidationFilter. Note, however, that service meshes support self-contained JWTs but do not integrate well with stateful OAuth2 and remote token introspection. Furthermore, JWTs consumed by service meshes like Istio need to have the appropriate content, which can be built using token swapping. The "token swapper" can aggregate the appropriate JWTs.</p>

<p>Token swapping is not limited to stateful OAuth2 to JWT token swapping. You can create transformations using other token types – such as OpenID Connect, SAML or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">SSO</a> tokens – and services like the security token service (STS). You can also enrich tokens with user roles, entitlements, or attributes obtained from the authority.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To learn more about balancing control and autonomy with token swapping, read about the following useful components: <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/JwtBuilderFilter.html">JwtBuilderFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/JwtValidationFilter.html">JwtValidationFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/IdTokenValidationFilter.html">IdTokenValidationFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/OAuth2ResourceServerFilter.html">OAuth2ResourceServerFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/TokenTransformationFilter.html">TokenTransformationFilter</a>.</p>

<p>With token swapping, you can expand your options for obtaining the right balance in the control versus autonomy dilemma—at least in the identity and security realm. Parents, philosophers, and management will have to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Last month’s <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) was held entirely online for the second time in its history. This bi-annual unconference, typically hosted in Mountain View, CA at the Computer History Museum, connects a wide variety of people from across the globe focused on solving the hard problems around digital identity. As an unconference, the attendees set the agenda each day. The format is focused on open collaboration which creates a real and rare opportunity to organically discuss not only the latest technology developments, but also the surrounding social, political and legal implications.</p><p>This year, over 400 attendees from across the globe participated in IIW31. It was a great showcase of both the work and progress being achieved across a variety of open standards and open source communities.</p><p>Although there is too much to cover in one write up, we wanted to highlight MATTR’s pick of the three major&nbsp;themes:</p>  KERI comes into the spotlight  Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity   KERI comes into the spotlight <p>One of the technologies that received a great deal of attention this year was Sam Smith’s <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> (KERI). Sam first introduced this topic over a year ago, and it’s evident that a lot has happened since then to bring these ideas and concepts to&nbsp;life.</p><p>KERI attempts to address the self-certifying aspect of identifier-based systems such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Central to this technology is the concept of Key Event Logs (KELs) which are maintained by each user in a distributed identity system. Key Event Logs contain digitally signed messages of all key management related transactions done by the user, and can be used not only to prove control over your identifier, but also shared with other external ‘witnesses’ who can independently validate and prove that you control your identifier. In practice, this means that KERI identifiers and keys are not “ledger-locked” — they are fully portable and can be validated using any ledger, distributed database, or other verifiable data registry.</p><p>In a session called “<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/2E/_KERI_for_Muggles">KERI for Muggles</a>”, Drummond Reed and Sam Smith identified 7 main characteristics that make KERI useful for identity:</p>  Self-certifying identifiers  Self-certifying Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Witnesses for Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Pre-rotation as simple, safe, scalable protection against key compromise  System-independent validation  Delegated self-certifying identifiers enable enterprise-class key management  Compatibility with the GDPR “right to be forgotten”  <p>There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=12A/_KERIfying_DID_Methods_%26_KERI_for_Interop">number</a> of <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13E/_DIDn%27t:_did:un_and_overlap_between_DIDs_%26_KERI">additional</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14A/_Verifiable_Trust_Bases:_How_to_make_the_web_of_trust_new_again_with_KERI">sessions</a> that dived into advanced KERI topics, including how KERI can create interoperability between different <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a> and solving the operational concerns related to bringing these ideas to life. There are <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keripy">ongoing</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keriox">open-source projects</a> at the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) which are driving this work forward. We look forward to the positive change this will bring to our ecosystem, particularly in reducing our technology’s strict dependence on specific infrastructure like distributed ledgers.</p> Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems <p>Following on from <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">IIW30</a>, there was a continued theme around the bridging of W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) with existing identity protocols on the web today such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), which are mainly used in federated identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Evolution of existing protocols such as OIDC allows existing infrastructure providers to make adjustments to their implementations in order to start using new technology, rather than having to tear it all down and rebuild. The goal here is to build as much as we can upon previous work while addressing a number of significant shortcomings around federated identity as it exists today. We’ve covered <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">this topic</a> before, so needless to say, we’re committed to solving this problem and we were extremely supportive of the continued discussion around these issues at this&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>A key component of this approach is the ability to allow existing identity solutions to issue and verify Verifiable Credentials. One way to achieve this is to extend the OpenID Connect protocol to enable more portable digital identity. Instead of using OIDC as a bearer token between an Issuer and Relying party, we can create a client-bound assertion that’s held in a user’s digital wallet. To that end, we <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1F/_OpenID_Connect_Credential_Provider">introduced</a> an approach that we’re calling <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, which turns traditional Identity Providers (IdPs) into credential providers. It modifies current authentication/issuance flows used by OpenID Connect to allow IdPs to issue assertions that are re-provable and reusable for authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-relation information and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the “wallet” layer between issuers and relying parties. There was great participation in this discussion from some of today’s existing Identity Providers, and one of the outcomes from this IIW is that the specification will be contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item, where it will be further developed by the community there.</p><p>There was also a great deal of interest around the evolution of <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP). The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">SIOP chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect specification was written in a way that clearly tried to leave room for some of the user-centric design concepts that are quite popular today, but given that it was first introduced in 2014, it lacked the context of today’s technologies such as DIDs and VCs. ُThere’s a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues/1180/siop-laundry-list">laundry list</a> of topics to cover here, so kick starting this effort has been a matter of breaking down each component and coming up with potential solutions. We identified 3 main problems that SIOP aims to&nbsp;address:</p>  Enabling portable identities between providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR&nbsp;problem</a>  Dealing with different deployment types of OpenID providers  <p>There are a number of insights we can gain by addressing each of these issues separately, and bringing them together to form more robust solutions. It was exciting to see that there are <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14B/_SIOP_-_progress_on_the_laundry_list_(wrt_DID)">many people</a> interested in revisiting SIOP and trying to address the underlying issues with federated identity. The work will continue to develop at the OpenID Foundation AB working group, so the conversation doesn’t stop at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>In related news, there was some <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13J/_The_Web_Platform,_Privacy_and_Federation_(thoughts_on_WebID)">collaborative</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=20C/_Browsers,_Privacy_and_Federation_(Cookies,_WebID,_CHAPI,_etc)">dialogue</a> with Google’s <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> technology, which aims to explore how browsers can help solve the user privacy problem of cross-site cookie tracking on the web. Given that the IIW community is deeply focused on issues of security and user privacy, it made a lot of sense for those working on WebID to connect with people working on OpenID Connect, as well as the W3C community working on the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI). The team developing Chromium discussed the possibility of adding a minimal set of browser APIs to work with CHAPI. Having something like CHAPI supported directly by the browser would allow for a more friendly user experience, allowing a credential holder to choose the provider of their identity (instead of being dictated by the relying party) and enabling better credential storage synchronization. The discussion here is really just a starting point, and we’re looking forward to seeing how WebID incorporates this approach and continues to work with the IIW community as the work develops.</p> SSI maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity <p>It’s been nearly 15 years since Kim Cameron wrote the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of Identity</a>, and over 4 years since Christopher Allen first laid out the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 Principles of SSI</a>. In the time since then, thinking has evolved a great deal around how to bring the power of SSI to users. This work has not only included building out the foundational technologies, but also addressing the practical tradeoffs between convenience, usability, and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As these technologies get deployed in the real world, what’s emerging is the fact that what we call ‘SSI’ (Self-Sovereign Identity) is more a set of guiding principles in how we would like digital identity systems of the future to behave like or be based around, rather than a concrete checklist where you can say this technology is SSI. As it is, there are always new ideas about how to bring these principles to life in real world applications. This continued to be a hot topic at this IIW, including:</p>  Scaling peer communications  Scaling blockchains  Scaling privacy   Scaling peer communications <p>Besides all of the ongoing work on KERI, there were a number of updates surrounding technology enabling peer-to-peer communication. There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1J/_DIDComm_Messaging_V2_-_Where_we_are_and_what_to_expect">few</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=21D/_DIDComm_Mediator_Agents_(v1_%26_v2)_-_Intro_and_where_open_source_projects_are">sessions</a> dedicated to giving the community an update on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a> protocol, showing that the specification is maturing to a point where it will be stable enough to broadly implement. In addition, Daniel Hardman of <a href="https://www.evernym.com">Evernym</a> presented a thought provoking <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=23G/_Discovery:_Solving_the_Kobayashi_Maru_of_SSI">session</a> on the intersection of privacy and discoverability on the web, which he calls “The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru">Kobayashi Maru</a> Problem of&nbsp;SSI”.</p> Scaling blockchains <p>The team at <a href="https://consensys.net">Consensys</a> presented an interesting <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/3E/_Better_DID_Mehtods_with_Zero_Knowledge_Proofs_(ZKPs)%3F_-_Privacy_Preserving,_Globally_Verfiable_DIDs">proposal</a> for a new DID method based on <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK Rollups</a>. In recent years, there has been a big push in the community to reconsider the use of ledgers and minimize what information is made public, especially when it comes to identifying individual people. While there has been a lot of interest in DID methods that don’t use any blockchain or ledger infrastructure, Consensys and many others continue to explore the use of ledgers due to their unique properties, such as the ability to offer global resolvability. Although it’s early stages for this work and there is no codebase yet, there was a lot of interest from those in the community looking to use blockchain-based DID methods. Their approach would give DIDs global resolvability with the potential to keep the DID “off ledger” and privacy preserving, making it ideal for persons using DIDs. As mentioned earlier, the work on KERI is also helping to illustrate how we can continue using decentralized ledger technologies in a way that preserves user sovereignty and data portability.</p> Scaling privacy <p>As a followup to last IIW, we provided an introduction to multi-message signatures and an overview of recent developments made around using <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+ Signatures</a> for selective disclosure in JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials. We <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April of this year. Since then, steady progress on open-source implementations and technical specs have resulted in a number of additional enhancements to the privacy preserving characteristics of zero knowledge proof based credentials, including the ability to have blinded subject credentials and domain bound proofs. In addition to progress on the technical specification, there have been significant developments on open-source implementations from a number of independent organizations. This progress has made the case for privacy-preserving credentials and selective disclosure stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p> Summary <p>SSI and decentralized digital identity are maturing at a steady pace, but we still have a lot of work ahead to solve the difficult problems around trust, privacy, and scalability that come with deploying systems in the real world. We’re excited to see progress on the critical issues move forward as the work happens across so many different communities and areas of interest.</p><p>As always, we’re incredibly grateful for the work that <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Young</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a>, and the team at IIW are doing to bring together different perspectives and to host important discussions which are open, respectful, and always illuminating.

We will see you all at&nbsp;IIW32!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/highlights-of-iiw31-c36883cb70db">Highlights of #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Identity Server 2020.2 is released today, including SSO 8.6 and CustomerID 5.6. 
<p>At the core, software development should be incremental, where small changes are delivered quickly, with high quality and continual improvement in mind.&nbsp;There should be several elements: the correction of some deviations, some feature improvements, some maintenance and ideally a new feature or two. Inside this release we have a little of all of these things for you, and we have focused on a new feature. Check out the release notes&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/Identity+Server+2020.2+Release+Notes">here</a>&nbsp;for an in depth view of things. In brief, we have ensured our internal retooling functions well – and it does – we’re pleased with the ability to deliver code improvements quickly in a highly automated and testable manner. During this development cycle we delivered several patches to resolve deviations in our CustomerID application which also helped us to iron out the last wrinkles in the new CI. This allowed us to accommodate the security improvement required by Suomi.fi and create the SSO 8.5.1 patch in very short order.</p>
<p>Working with several customers, we elected to focus on Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) as an addition to our many authentication methods. Many of our customers create their own UI and already&nbsp;have&nbsp;the ability or desire to create their own Quick Response (QR) code, which can ease user onboarding, although you can still offer the secret as a text string. So we set-about the task of code creation inside the SSO application,&nbsp;including the API control functions and logging functions essential to any SSO authentication.</p>
 Continuing to the end of 2020 
<p>Within the product, we are going to do some incremental improvements in the last months of 2020. There are some additional tooling changes that will ensure that we can bring updated&nbsp;third-party libraries&nbsp;into every release we make. We are also adding a section into the Release Notes, as requested, covering the life-cycle management of external components (like which Tomcat is in use, when will PostgreSQL being updated next etc). In late 2019, the OpenID foundation finalised their CIBA (Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication) method into CIBA Core 1.0. So while we had implemented a pre-spec version of CIBA in the summer of 2018, we now need to make a couple of small changes to our Ubisecure Backchannel Authentication Adaptor (UBAA) to be Core 1.0 compliant. We expect to integrate several new external authenticators via UBAA in the first half of 2021 and then open the adaptor methodology up to all of you – easy integrations to SSO is coming soon! In the next week or so, we will publish our 2020.3 pre-release notes – the goals and intentions of the team for the final development cycle of 2020.</p>
<p>This iteration, IDS 2020.2, has been tightly focused and IDS 2020.3 will be very focused as well. Additionally, we are working on the scoping and predictability of our engineering as well as adding communication of upcoming development plans; for example pre-release notes as details against top line roadmap items and life-cycle management found on the release notes. The goal is to ensure that we can understand your needs and dependably place them into a development timeline. Coupled with the new CI and automated release testing we have done over the prior year, I am confident that we will continue to support and serve our customers the best possible code and new feature additions on a predictable schedule.</p>
<p>As we move forward to the end of the year, our team continues to work remotely with business as usual. All of us at Ubisecure hope that all of you, your colleagues and families are well and can tolerate this social isolation. We are looking forward to a return to normal office days, coffee breaks and being able to meet you in person. Until that happens, we are happy to engage with you virtually. So if you have any questions over this release, or upcoming work, please don’t hesitate to contact your account team or our support department. We are happy to help with anything around your identity solution needs.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In this release cycle we have been solidifying our new CI. We created three CustomerID patch releases, each removing deviations from the core code base which are now rolled-up into CustomerID 5.6 available in this release. SSO has also been patched, to add functionality to Suomi.fi requiring algorithm changes (Suomi.fi required continual encryption via&nbsp;AES128-GCM, you can read about it in our announcement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/technical-announcements/ubisecure-sso-8-5-1-has-been-released/">here</a>, and the Suomi.fi announcement&nbsp;<a href="https://palveluhallinta.suomi.fi/en/ajankohtaista/uutiset/5f51e6b9fc2bb907bbb64186">here</a>). These smaller patches allowed us to review the CI and ensure that we have the ability to quickly correct and release tested software. This ability is core to our operational future and essential to offering you good service. The Engineering team are also constantly working to increase the automated test cases to increase the test coverage for our platform – this means that more and more of the features are automatically tested via UI and API before the code is released to you.</p>
 New in this release 
 Time-based One-time Password 
<p>With this release, we extend the Identity Platform capabilities to include Time-based One-time Password (TOTP). In SSO you are now able to configure a new TOTP authentication method to be used similarly to other OTP methods. A new TOTP API application has been created for handling the adding and removal of secrets for users when setting up their device. It should be noted that you will need to facilitate ways for the users to generate and set up their devices and utilise the TOTP API to insert the secret to the user’s account, as there is no self-service UI or QR code generation available within SSO in this initial release.</p>
<p>This initial release of TOTP complies with&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238">RFC 6238</a>, which is a generic implementation for Time-based One-time Password and should function with any authenticator application that supports the RFC standard.</p>
<p>Within SSO you will have the ability to create a TOTP secret via API call for each user, see the example “Your Secret Key” below on the left, but having your end users add that secret key to their authenticator application is still a manual process. Each user will have to copy and paste or manually type in the secret key to set up their authenticator application which will then generate the 6 digit TOTP code used each time they access your application. The use of a QR code to enter the secret (see the QR code link to Wikipedia below on right), could be created by your UI team to ease onboarding. But at this time a QR code generator is not available within our Identity Platform. We will be looking for your feedback to determine if you require a QR code generator – or if you will use commonly available generators within your own applications to facilitate the setup for users.</p>
<p><a href="https://totp.danhersam.com/"></a></p>
<p>The following use cases are supported on a per application basis – meaning you can continue to have a variety of applications requiring only those users permitted or those sessions which need stronger authentication using your RFC 6238 compliant authenticator of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Improvements and corrections 
<p>There are always continuous improvements and corrections being made to the Ubisecure Identity Server and this release is no exception.</p>
<p>You will find improvements made to our developer portal pages, such as here – <a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms">https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms</a> – with information of the browsers and operating systems we support, software requirements related to java and databases as well as hardware recommendation for running operational environments. We have also added more information to the additional security consideration page –<a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/Security+considerations+for+production+environments+-+SSO">https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/Security+considerations+for+production+environments+-+SSO</a> – with recommendations on how to ensure that no system specific information is leaked to end users in an error situation.</p>

   Striking the balance between enabling users and administrators to be productive whilst protecting your sensitive systems and data is becoming ever more challenging.

   CDR is here! But don’t panic if your bank isn’t quite there yet. We can help with our new ForgeRock CDR Open Banking Accelerators. 

<p>Well, it’s finally here. The Australian government’s<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0#:~:text=On%2026%20November%202017%2C%20the,and%20control%20over%20their%20data.&amp;text=Consumer%20data%20relating%20to%20mortgage,shared%20after%201%20November%202020."> Consumer Data Right</a> (CDR) regulation is taking effect – in phases – starting with bank loans and personal information for the Big Four banks. The rest of the industry will follow suit in 2021.</p>

<p>Understandably, the rollout of yet another new regulation tends to be met with a bit of resistance. But <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services/cdr">CDR</a> has some significant upsides for banks that fully embrace the open standards requirement that come with it. It’s been argued that the open standards can lead to a new wave of greater innovation and consumer services. Here are three ways banks can benefit from CDR:.&nbsp;</p>

<p>#1. CDR can pave the way to greater uniformity of security and boost consumer confidence. Third-party global banking integrations have been quite loose with regard to security in the past. Lacking application programming interface (API) openness, some developers have resorted to insecure “screen scraping” techniques that left consumer data vulnerable. CDR requires openness, mandating industry-standard, security-conscious protocols that will increase consumer confidence in the way their data is handled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>#2. CDR can lead to better customer and user experiences (CX/UX). Everything today is digital and online. Even processes previously handled exclusively face to face – like new customer onboarding and enrollment – can now be done remotely, without ever having to set foot in a branch office. Since many customers have an online-only relationship, the digital experience must be optimized. This means speed and security need to be core components of the offering, ensuring that there are no data loss or sync issues between your bank and a third-party provider. Secure uniformity and openness of APIs can help support this.</p>

<p>#3. CDR can help monetize data for new consumer services. A core focus of CDR is putting consumers in charge of their data. But this doesn’t eliminate opportunities for new service offerings and partnerships between banks and third-party API developers or other financial services organizations. When done properly, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/kuppingercole-leadership-compass-identity-api-platforms">opening up your APIs</a> – and by extension, customer data –&nbsp; can lead to new revenue opportunities.</p>

<p>But before any of this can happen, you need to become compliant with CDR. Maybe you’re already there, but is the job really done? Was it a struggle to become compliant because of the legacy IT systems you have in place? Will that solution scale to your current needs, as well as the evolving and changing CDR standard?</p>

<p>No matter where you are in the compliance journey, ForgeRock has solutions – called “Accelerators” – that can help. Let’s take a more detailed dive into some of the specifics so you can see for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock recently released <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/cdr-open-banking-accelerators">CDR Open Banking Accelerators</a> to help drastically speed up compliance with the Australian Government's CDR mandate. These accelerators make it easier for you to comply with CDR mandates by providing a fully compliant container-based reference implementation, along with comprehensive documentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our accelerators are designed to minimize integration efforts, by deploying into your production environment rapidly and in an automated way. Identity architects, DevOps, developers, and project managers report that our accelerators have saved them up to two thirds of their total implementation time and cost. CDR Open Banking Accelerators can help you achieve a rapid ROI and improve the customer experience at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock CDR Open Banking Accelerators also ensure that the APIs used by financial providers prioritize customer authorization when sharing data with other requested providers. We designed the tools to adhere to CDR guidelines outlined by the Australian government.</p>

<p>ForgeRock can help you overcome compliance hurdles. Here’s how the CDR Open Banking Accelerators addresses four primary use cases within the Open Banking framework:</p>

  Gives Data Holders a plug-and-play, CDR-compliant endpoint, where Accredited Data Recipients can dynamically register themselves. 
	 Provides Data Holders with a compliant, centralized consent engine enabling Accredited Data Recipients to request access to customer data. 
	 Provides Data Holders with a MetaDirectory Cache Data Model and Sync Engine to create and maintain the required copy of the Registry. Provides Data Holders with a fine-grained <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/authorization">authorization</a> service based on customer consent. This Core Banking API enables you, as an accredited Data Recipient, to access data the customer consents to. 
 <p>You can decide to simply comply with the CDR regulation, or you can use it as a springboard to compete in the new Open API economy. ForgeRock firmly believes that, in the near future, the quality of CDR implementations and broader API offerings will be a determining factor for customers choosing new services. As Data Recipients begin to offer innovative services using banking APIs, customers will start to expect to make use of these third-party services. Plus, non-mandatory APIs help progressive organizations like yours capitalize on the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services/open-banking">Open Banking</a> revolution, so it’s a real opportunity to grow and evolve your business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re grateful to our trusted partner<a href="https://www.middleware.co.nz/#/"> Middleware NZ</a>, whose knowledge of the Australian banking market and technical acumen helped make the CDR Open Banking Accelerators a reality.</p>

<p>With a modern identity and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a> (IAM) platform, you can transform your customers’ user experience. They’ll be able to control who can access their data and what can be done with it. And by empowering your customers, you’ll open up new and exciting innovation opportunities for your organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1400050338">https://bihu.com/article/1400050338</a></p><p>Original publish time: November 3,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: Xiang Yao, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p><p>This is the first time that the Stablecoin Report has been published as a monthly report, please feel free to leave suggestions.</p> Quick Preview   The market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $1.510 billion to $22.13&nbsp;billion.  Last month, the circulation of USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI increased by 299 million, 306 million, 301 million, and 26 million. The circulation of TUSD decreased by 194&nbsp;million.  USDC has stepped out of Ethereum and has been deployed on Algorand and Solana, with a supply of more than $30&nbsp;million.  BUSD continues to grow on the&nbsp;BSC.  Stablecoins have attracted the attention of global regulators. The European Commission, the Financial Stability Board, and the IMF have issued regulatory frameworks or&nbsp;reports.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past month(September 26, 2020 ~ October 25, 2020, same below, the data report of the natural month will be provided from next&nbsp;month).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $1.510 billion to $22.13&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past month, Tether additionally issued 299 million USDT on Ethereum. The circulation of USDC, BUSD, DAI, PAX, HUSD, and GUSD increased by 306 million, 301 million, 25.6 million, 74.89 million, 96.12 million, and 510,000. The circulation of TUSD decreased by 194&nbsp;million.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last month, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all decreased by&nbsp;215,000.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT decreased by 253,000 and the number of holding addresses of USDC increased by 33,000. The number of other stablecoins holding addresses has not changed&nbsp;much.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last month increased by an average of 6.55% compared to the previous&nbsp;month.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous month, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;11.83%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last month decreased by an average of 28.82% from the previous&nbsp;month.</p> 2. Stablecoin stepped out of&nbsp;Ethereum <p>About 70% of stablecoins still choose Ethereum as the main issuance platform, and except for USDT which chooses to be issued on multiple blockchains, most stablecoins choose Ethereum as the only issuance platform. During the continued congestion of Ethereum, in addition to the steady increase of USDT on Tron, stablecoins have gradually stepped out of Ethereum. USDC chose multiple smart contract platforms to deploy, while BUSD began to expand within its ecosystem.</p> USDC has been deployed on Algorand/Solana <p>The Centre Alliance announced several pieces of cooperation information in September and October, announcing that it would deploy USDC assets on Algorand, Stellar, and Solana. Among them, the supply on Algorand and Solana has reached $7.180 million and $25 million, and USDC on Stellar will be issued in the first quarter of&nbsp;2021.</p> BUSD continues to grow on&nbsp;BSC <p>As a stablecoin asset issued by Binance, BUSD not only exists in the form of ERC-20 on Ethereum but is also deployed on Binance Chain (BEP2) and Binance Smart Chain (BEP20). With the progress of mining on BSC, the number of holding addresses of BUSD on BSC has exceeded 9,100, which is the same as the number of holding addresses of BUSD on Ethereum. Since the bridge of assets is provided by Binance Exchange, it is not easy to count the supply of BUSD on each blockchain. However, according to bscscan, the supply of BUSD on BSC should have exceeded $40 million, among which the amount of BUSD on Pancake exceeds $18&nbsp;million.</p> 3. Stablecoins attracted global regulatory attention <p>As early as 2019, stablecoins have attracted the attention of global regulators. The concept of ‘GSC’ was first formally proposed in the ‘Global Stablecoin Evaluation Report’ of the G7 Stablecoin Working Group in October 2019. ‘Global’ mainly refers to the stablecoin spanning multiple jurisdictions. The Bank for International Settlements also released a report on strengthening cross-border payments in July 2020, suggesting that CBDC and global stablecoins can provide potential assistance for cross-border payments.</p><p>The rapid growth of stablecoins in 2020 has even attracted the attention of global regulators. The European Commission, the G20 joint FSB, and the International Monetary Fund have successively issued regulatory reports on stablecoin.</p> European Commission announced the regulatory framework for encrypted assets and stablecoins <p>The European Commission published the final draft of the regulatory framework for encrypted assets on September 24. The report is 168 pages long and elaborates on the background of the proposal, the current status of the development of encrypted assets, and the regulatory recommendations for stablecoins.</p><p>The report pointed out that although the scale of the encrypted asset market was still small and did not pose a threat to financial stability, this situation may change with the emergence of ‘GSC’. Because ‘Global Stablecoin’ has stable value and uses the network effects generated by companies promoting these assets to seek wider applications. The European Commission will create a comprehensive and holistic EU ‘stablecoin’ framework for encrypted assets that are not covered by the EU’s existing financial services legislation to mitigate the risks identified by the Financial Stability Board, especially financial stability risks.</p><p>The plan still needs to be considered by the legislative counterparts of the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European&nbsp;Council.</p> The G20 joint FSB released a stablecoin regulatory report <p>On October 23, the FSB released the “Regulation, Supervision, and Supervision of the ‘GSC’ arrangement” report, which made high-level recommendations for the supervision, supervision, and supervision of the ‘GSC’ arrangement.</p><p>The FSB pointed out that the so-called ‘stablecoin’ is a specific type of encrypted assets that had the potential to improve efficiency in the delivery of financial services by linking their value to one or more other assets (e.g. sovereign currencies) to solve the high volatility of ‘traditional’ encrypted assets, but at the same time could pose risks to financial stability, especially in the case of mass adoption. Stablecoins have the potential to improve payment efficiency and promote financial inclusion, but the use of ‘GSC’ may have a huge impact on the justice of many countries.</p><p>The FSB was established after the G20 Summit in 2009. It was officially commissioned by the G20 to provide observation reports and policy recommendations for the global financial system, sponsored and led by the Bank for International Settlements.</p><p>The G20 is working with the IMF, the World Bank, and the BIS to discuss the complexity of the GSC in terms of practice and technology, including design and interoperability, and assess the potential and challenges of CBDC in cross-border payments. By the end of 2022, the G20 will work with the IMF, the World Bank, and BIS to complete the framework for regulating stablecoins and research on the design, technology, and experiments of&nbsp;CBDC.</p> The IMF issued a report showing that CBDC has potential, but it cannot solve all&nbsp;problems <p>A report issued by the IMF on October 16 stated that CBDC may benefit those countries that wish to increase control over their monetary policy, but it will not solve all&nbsp;crises.</p><p>The IMF pointed out that new digital currencies including CBDC and GSC had attracted regulatory attention. CBDC and GSC can reduce transaction costs through competition, broaden service channels through mobile devices, and promote financial inclusion. The cross-border use of digital currency will also bring risks and policy challenges. For countries with economic downturns, CBDC is not a panacea solution. It cannot save those countries with high inflation rates or similar domestic problems.</p><p>The report concluded that CBDC had not yet qualitatively changed the global pattern of currencies, but it may intensify the effects of currency substitution and currency internationalization. And if the GSC and the existing currency have the same accounting unit, it may have a currency effect similar to that of CBDC, and at the same time, there is a potential threat to financial stability. If a new GSC with an independent accounting unit appears (e.g. a new currency with a basket of currencies as a reserve), it can also provide better financial services, but it will have a more profound impact on global currency and financial stability.</p> Tips <p>This is what we’re sharing in this MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report, welcome to stay tuned for follow-up crypto stablecoin reports. We will provide you with more analysis of the development status, trends and international impact of stablecoins to help readers stay updated on the development status of stablecoin.</p><p>PS: MYKEY Lab has the final right to interpret the content of the article, please indicate the source for the quotation.

<p>Over the past few months Mydex CIC has been working for the Scottish Government on a project to test whether an ‘attribute led’ approach to public service provision can work. <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/05/13/digital-identity-scotland-prototype-draws-to-a-close/">The good news is: it can indeed work</a>, and that opens up a whole new world of opportunity for citizens, Government and service providers.</p><p>Under the approach we tested, public sector organisations provide individuals with verified attributes (details about them which have been checked using rigorous processes). Individuals store these attributes in their own Attribute (or personal data) Store, and can then share these attributes with other public sector service providers as and when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>We need this sort of approach because. when applying for and using public services, the personal data citizens need to provide can range over many different aspects of their lives, to some depth (in some cases). Creating the infrastructure for sharing verified attributes means that the right bundles of data can be put together quickly, efficiently and safely — in ways that protect the citizen’s data and privacy. (<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">Verified attributes are bits of information</a> about individuals that have been generated or checked by responsible organisations using robust, widely accepted processes.)</p><p>By equipping citizens with the means to accumulate and share this information in a safe, easy and secure manner it is possible to achieve significant reductions in friction, effort, risk and cost for both citizens themselves and service providers.</p><p>In the prototype work we tested all the independent components that need to work together to deliver a resilient, scalable system. This system is designed to place citizens at the centre of data sharing about themselves, empowering them with their own attribute store, with the ability to reuse verified data about themselves on an ongoing basis. Key areas of work included testing different ways of authenticating the identity of participants, ensuring the robustness of all necessary technical underpinnings (such as APIs), working with citizens to design user-journeys that are easy and intuitive, and addressing related communications issues.</p><p>For those interested in the details, <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Attribute-Prototype-Report-new.pdf">the full report is available here</a>.</p> Taking the next&nbsp;steps <p>Thanks to the success of this prototyping work the Scottish Government is now able to move on to the next stage:<a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/"> a ‘beta phase’</a> that will test the operation of this approach in practice. If this beta phase is successful, it could bring far ranging benefits to citizens, service providers and Government, making it much easier and cheaper for public services to be provided and used whilst improving outcomes and the speeding up of access to services citizens&nbsp;need.</p><p>But it also has bigger implications. The provision of Attribute Stores by which citizens can receive and share these Verified Attributes changes the architecture of personal data collection and use — moving it from a situation where service providers are the only ones gathering and storing the information they need, with citizens holding none of this information, to a situation where some of the data service providers need is stored separately from them (in the citizen’s Attribute Store) and accessed when needed. <a href="https://futurescot.com/digital-identity-service-could-be-used-from-birth-to-create-lifetime-records-for-every-scot/?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=97043733&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D1gas4oYmIQVhegdjVUK8L5-zuu18ngjg7HV6aIJE83InLTdOCiojxuOK0zStkqtr6tpUiDTsVe6V7OJH5hRz0PQ3ag&amp;utm_content=97043733&amp;utm_source=hs_email">For a press article on this, see&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>In the longer term, the creation of this new, independent layer of data sharing infrastructure could radically change how exactly how our digital economy works.

 Ontology is Now Officially a Technical Provider for Enterprise Solutions through Cointelegraph Consulting  May this be just the beginning. <p>For a thorough adoption of blockchain technology, the road must go through enterprises — this is something we have always known at Ontology, and with the recent addition by Cointelegraph Consulting to its technical provider list after a rigorous screening, we are more confident than ever that enterprise solutions will be a cornerstone to not just the success at Ontology, but the entire blockchain industry as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/advertise#:~:text=Cointelegraph%20is%20the%20leading%20media,million%20unique%20visitors%20per%20month.">With over 5 million unique visitors each month and over 17 million page views</a>, Cointelegraph has rapidly established itself as one of the media anchors in the blockchain space. But the readers it attracts aren’t merely traders, enthusiasts, or bitcoin fiends — rather, Cointelegraph has quietly established itself as a legitimate mediator between established enterprises and blockchain technology providers. As a result, a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/consulting">consulting arm</a> was launched that aims to “…connect the world between blockchain and traditional institutions of all sizes by bringing wider adoption of digital assets and enterprise-grade blockchain solutions through education and professional consulting services.”</p><p>In many ways, this match between Cointelegraph Consulting and Ontology was a predetermined match, as illustrated by the pre-existing enterprise case studies implemented by Ontology. The most recent example, with Daimler Mobility, saw the implementation of Ontology’s DeID to allow users to customize and personally manage their automotive experiences regardless of the car they’re sitting in. A decentralized identity solution is at the forefront of blockchain technology and provides unlimited potential for organizations since much of the digital trend these days revolves around data &amp; identity protection.</p><p>Another example of the pre-existing enterprise implementations is Ontology’s partnership with Kaiyun Motors and OGQ. By providing the technical support for a public chain, Kaiyun Motors has been able to store over 2 million data sets ranging from claims on autonomous vehicles, to real-time wear and tear data during last-mile logistics. Not only has this potentially saved lives on the road, but it has also possibly drastically cut down costs on claims and overdue maintenances for Kaiyun Motors. As for OGQ, Ontology’s public chain has recorded over 250 million pieces of digital asset content that have been uploaded on OGQ and granted over 14 million content creators to immutable possess their digital property such as emojis, images, videos, music, new fonts, stickers, and memes to&nbsp;fans.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.sagamarket.io/"> SAGA market</a> is another real-case application for Ontology’s public chain as over 200,000+ users and 10,000+ ecosystem partners rely on SAGA to access streams of decentralized data ranging from foreign exchanges to meteorology.</p><p>In addition to these in-depth case studies provided, Ontology also offers a series of enterprise solutions in the following sectors:</p>  <a href="https://ont.io/automotive">Automotive</a>: Component Authentication, simplifying the supply chain, and automating claim processes.  <a href="https://ont.io/marketplace">Data Marketplace:</a> Lowering transaction costs, adding a layer of security, improving data quality, and ensuring proper data&nbsp;access.  <a href="https://ont.io/attestation">Data Attestation:</a> Certification of data and identity, as well as providing proof of existence.  <a href="https://ont.io/finance">Digital Finance:</a> 5,000+ transactions per second, ONT ID to simplify the KYC&nbsp;process.  <p>Moving forward, Ontology will be <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/consulting/vendors">officially listed</a> on Cointelegraph’s vendor page, as will be the case studies we mentioned above in addition to others. By focusing on decentralized identities, Ontology is able to provide a wide range of use cases for enterprises of all sectors. This doesn’t even take into account the newly launched <a href="https://ontscore.com/">OScore</a>, a self-sovereign credit evaluation system based on user data stored on the Ontology blockchain — which also fully integrates with ONT ID to give users an added layer of identity protection, and control over who gets to access their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>We look forward to potential new use cases of implementing Ontology’s robust set of technical solutions for enterprise-grade problems.

  <p>With the increasing popularity of single-page apps and the growing API economy, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are becoming a very popular method for authenticating users. Rather than relying on the server to store the user’s state, JWTs encode information in a keyed payload stored on the client.</p>

<p>JWTs are not inherently less secure than server-side session storage. But developers should understand the tradeoffs and know what to do <a>if a JWT is compromised</a>. You should expire JWTs frequently and always <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/go/overview/">validate them before trusting them in your application</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re using JWTs properly, they provide several benefits. For single-page applications—where much of the heavy-lifting is done in the browser—JWTs make a lot of sense. Assuming the client can decode the JWT and verify its signature, it doesn’t need to make another trip back to the server to authenticate the user. JWTs also make sense for highly performant, globally-distributed server-side applications. By storing user information in the JWT, each node can authenticate the user locally rather than querying an authentication service on every request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll create a Laravel API that uses JWTs provided by <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> to authenticate users. You’ll use custom <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/middleware">Laravel middleware</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-php">Okta JWT Verifier package</a> to verify requests and restrict access to your API to authenticated users. If you’d like to download the final codebase, <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-laravel-jwt-example">it’s available on GitHub</a>. Otherwise, read on for the step-by-step process.</p>

 Using JWT Authentication to Secure a Laravel API 

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll use Okta to generate a JWT that allows users to call your API securely. You’ll then verify the JWT using Okta’s JWT Verifier package to ensure that users have a valid, non-expired token before they get your data. To keep this example simple, you’ll use a client credentials grant, but the same JWT returned in <a>standard Laravel authentication with Okta</a> would also work.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: Please ensure you have already installed PHP, Composer, and have signed up for a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">free Okta developer account</a>.</p>

 Setting Up a New Laravel Application 

<p>Before adding the API endpoints and authentication packages, you will need a fresh Laravel application with a database table and model. For this tutorial, you’ll create a <code>Location</code> model and database table that includes the names of several locations and their desirability on a scale of 1-10.</p>

<p>If you already have <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> installed, you can use it to create a new Laravel application from your command line:</p>

   <code>composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel okta-laravel-jwt
</code>   

<p>Then you’ll need to <code>cd</code> into the folder and install the dependencies.</p>

   <code>cd okta-laravel-jwt
composer install
php artisan key:generate
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This tutorial assumes you are using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x">Laravel 8</a>. While not considerably different from previous versions, you may notice some import paths have changed, so be sure to adjust this for your version of Laravel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Laravel abstracts away most differences between database providers, so you can use any database you like, but the simplest way to get started is with <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. To use SQLite, create a new file to house your database:</p>

   <code>touch database/database.sqlite
</code>   

<p>And update the <code>DB_CONNECTION</code> environment variable in your <code>.env</code> file to <code>DB_CONNECTION=sqlite</code>. Remove all the other <code>DB_</code> environment variables as you don’t need them for a SQLite connection.</p>

<p>Next, use the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/artisan">Laravel Artisan command</a> to create a new model and migration file:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:model Location --migration
</code>   

<p>You will need to allow mass-assignment of the <code>name</code> and <code>desirability</code> attributes on this model, so open up the <code>app/Models/Location.php</code> model file. Add the following <code>$fillable</code> property to the class:</p>

   <code>...
class Location extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'desirability'];
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you’ll need to add the model’s attributes to the database using the migration. Open up the new migration file Laravel created when you ran the above Artisan command. It should be the last file in your <code>database/migrations</code> folder. Modify the <code>up()</code> method to include the <code>name</code> and <code>desirability</code> fields:</p>

   <code>...
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('locations', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table-&gt;id();
        $table-&gt;string('name');
        $table-&gt;unsignedInteger('desirability');
        $table-&gt;timestamps();
    });
}
...
</code>   

<p>Commit the migration to your database using the migration Artisan command:</p>

   <code>php artisan migrate
</code>   

<p>Finally, before you build the endpoints for your API, you can create some default seed data using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/seeding">Laravel’s Database Seeder</a>. Open up the <code>database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php</code> file and replace the contents with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
namespace Database\Seeder;

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use App\Models\Location;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Seed the application's database.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        DB::table('locations')-&gt;truncate();
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Aruba', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Jamaica', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Bermuda', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Bahama', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Key Largo', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Montego', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the seeder via the Artisan command to reset the database and create the six new locations:</p>

   <code>php artisan db:seed
</code>   

<p>Your Laravel application, database table, and model are now ready. In the next step, you’ll add the API endpoints needed to retrieve, create, and delete data from this table.</p>

 Adding and Testing the API Endpoints 

<p>In a production application, you’ll probably want to create a controller to contain your API’s business logic. Because this is just a demonstration, you can do all the work in <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/routing">Laravel’s route file</a>. Open up the <code>routes/api.php</code> file and replace it with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Models\Location;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

Route::prefix('locations')-&gt;group(function () {
    Route::get('/', fn() =&gt; Location::all());
    Route::post('/', fn(Request $request) =&gt; Location::create($request-&gt;all()));
    Route::delete('/{id}', fn(int $id) =&gt; Location::destroy($id));
});
</code>   

<p>The first route will return all locations when <code>GET /api/locations</code> is called, the second will create a new location when <code>POST /api/locations</code> is called, and the third will delete a location based on the <code>{id}</code> you pass into the <code>DELETE /api/locations/{id}</code> call. To test these new endpoints out, start your local Laravel server:</p>

   <code>php artisan serve
</code>   

<p>You can use <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> or <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> to call each endpoint described above. For example, when I call <code>http://localhost:8000/api/locations</code> in Postman, I get the following JSON response back:</p>

   <code>[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Aruba",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Jamaica",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Bermuda",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Bahama",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Key Largo",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "Montego",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    }
]
</code>   

<p>Now that your API is set up, you are ready to add JWT authentication.</p>

 Adding the Okta JWT Verifier 

<p><a href="https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/middleware">Middleware</a> is usually the best place for custom authentication and request validation logic. In this step, you’ll create a new Laravel middleware, use the Okta JWT verifier to make sure the user has passed a valid JWT in as their bearer token, and add this middleware to all of the <code>/api/locations</code> routes described above.</p>

<p>First, install the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-php">Okta JWT verifier</a> package and its peer dependencies using Composer:</p>

   <code>composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt guzzlehttp/psr7 http-interop/http-factory-guzzle
</code>   

<p>The JWT adapter we’ll use is <code>firebase/php-jwt</code>, <code>guzzlehttp/psr7</code> provides HTTP interfaces for the API requests this library makes to Okta’s servers, and the <code>http-interop/http-factory-guzzle</code> adds PSR-17 support. The <code>guzzlehttp/psr7</code> library will be getting this <a href="https://github.com/guzzle/psr7/issues/327">support in version 2.0</a>, but in the meantime, the interop library allows you to fill in the missing pieces.</p>

<p>To use the JWT verifier, you’ll need a new Okta application with a Client ID and the Issuer URI of your Okta Authorization Server.</p>

<p>Log in to your Okta account and go to API &gt; Authorization Servers. Copy the Issuer URI and add it as the environment variable <code>OKTA_ISSUER_URI</code> in your Laravel application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To create a new server application, go to Applications and click the Add Application button in the top left. Select Service, Machine-to-Machine and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter a name for your application and click Next again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from this page and add them to your Laravel application’s <code>.env</code> file as <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET</code> respectively.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you have your Okta application and credentials, you are ready to use them to verify JWTs in Laravel. Create a new middleware using the Artisan command:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwt
</code>   

<p>Open up the new file at <code>app/Http/Middleware/VerifyJwt.php</code> and replace the contents with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;

class VerifyJwt
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Instantiate the Okta JWT verifier
        $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
            -&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
            -&gt;setAudience('api://default')
            -&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
            -&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
            -&gt;build();

        try {
            // Verify the JWT passed as a bearer token
            $jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());
            return $next($request);
        } catch (\Exception $exception) {
            // Log exceptions
            Log::error($exception);
        }

        // If we couldn't verify, assume the user is unauthorized
        return response('Unauthorized', 401);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>To use this middleware, you need to add it to your <code>Kernel</code> class and routes. Open <code>app/Http/Kernel.php</code> and add the following to your <code>$routeMiddleware</code> array:</p>

   <code>...
'jwt' =&gt; \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyJwt::class,
...
</code>   

<p>Next, open your <code>routes/api.php</code> file again and add the middleware to your <code>locations</code> route group:</p>

   <code>...
Route::prefix('locations')-&gt;middleware('jwt')-&gt;group(function () {
...
</code>   

<p>This applies the new middleware to every endpoint within the group, but you could apply it selectively to specific routes if you wanted.</p>

<p>Restart your Laravel application and try the endpoints again. This time, the API will return a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> response because you have not added a valid JWT to your request. In the last section, you’ll issue a JWT and use it to make requests to the API.</p>

 Issuing JWTs 

<p>Before you can issue a JWT and use it to authenticate users trying to access your new Laravel API, you need to create a custom scope in Okta to provide access. Go back to the API &gt; Authorization Servers page in the Okta Developer Console and click the pencil icon to edit the authorization server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Scopes tab and then the Add Scopes button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Give your scope a Name and Display phrase so you can identify it. In this example we’ll use <code>locations_api</code> for the scope name. Click Create when you’re finished.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that your Okta authorization server has a new scope specifically for your new API, you can get an access token with this scope. For demonstration purposes, you’ll use the Client Credentials grant to get an access token without user interaction. In a real application, you would likely have the application use an OAuth login flow and then issue the access token to the client application.</p>

<p>On the command line, use <code>curl</code> to get an access token, replacing the placeholder values in the command below with your own application’s client ID and secret:</p>

   <code>curl https://dev-XXXXXX.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d client_id=OKTA_CLIENT_ID \
  -d client_secret=OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -d scope=locations_api
</code>   

<p>When you run this command, Okta will issue an access token and return a JSON object which contains the JWT in a field called <code>access_token</code>.</p>

   <code>{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiI5b1o2N...",
    "scope": "locations_api"
}
</code>   

<p>Copy the value of the <code>access_token</code> field. Make a <code>GET</code> call to the <code>http://localhost:8000/api/locations</code> endpoint with the JWT in your <code>Authorization</code> header as a bearer token. In curl, the request will look like this:</p>

   <code>curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8000/api/locations' --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiI5b1o2N...'
</code>   

<p>Laravel will use the Okta JWT verifier you added to your new middleware to verify and decode your token. If it’s valid and not expired, you should see the same list of locations as you did before you added authentication to the app. The same bearer token can be used to access the  <code>POST</code> and <code>DELETE</code> endpoints until the JWT expires.</p>

<p>While this application used a machine-to-machine application to generate a JWT, you could use any Okta-issued JWT with the proper scopes to get the same access to the API above. This decoupling of authentication from your application logic is one of the most significant advantages of using a third-party authentication provider like Okta. It allows you to build scalable, distributed, and secure Laravel APIs.</p>

Everyone is pretty much focused on one thing right now. Today is election day in the U.S. And while for some, a result either way amounts to an existential crisis, for Big Tech, it doesn’t really matter who&nbsp;wins. <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-doesnt-much-care-who-wins-2020-election-5265548d-df6a-4a24-b387-1f0e147056ed.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The big picture: Individuals in tech are as passionate and fingernail-biting about Tuesday’s election as any other Americans. But the path ahead for the massive companies that have seized the industry’s reins over the past decade will only alter incrementally based on the polls’&nbsp;outcome.</blockquote><p>On regulations:</p><blockquote>Trump’s term saw a dramatic shift toward government action against tech firms. The Justice Department has sued Google, action against Facebook by states and the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly imminent, and investigations of both Apple and Amazon remain&nbsp;open.</blockquote>  These processes are all ostensibly non-partisan and theoretically unaffected by a change in administration.But in practice, a new attorney general could soft-pedal or even scrap the Google&nbsp;suit.  Democrats have their own reasons for pursuing action against the big companies — but unlike Republicans, they’re less focused on claims of censorship and more on the concentration of corporate power and the spread of misinformation.  <blockquote>The bottom line: Whoever wins the White House, scrutiny of tech’s allegedly monopolistic behavior will continue.</blockquote><p>A Biden presidency could see the issue of privacy elevated, but given everything else going on at the moment, don’t expect it to be a priority in the short&nbsp;term:</p><blockquote>Tech companies control the hardware and software that shapes our public and private communications, and that has placed them at the center of a million controversies.</blockquote>  We hold them responsible when their platforms become channels for misinformation and hate speech, and we blame them when their collection of personal data becomes intrusive or&nbsp;harmful.  <blockquote>Democrats have typically been readier than Republicans to favor stricter privacy rules and tougher controls on online misinformation, and if they win the White House and Congress, they might find ways to advance legislation that has long been&nbsp;stalled.</blockquote>  But a Democratic administration would have a long list of priorities ahead of such&nbsp;action.  <blockquote>Be smart: Some tech leaders — most prominently, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg — have practically begged the government to enact nationwide (and preferably lenient) nationwide laws on privacy and content moderation. They’d love to stop winging their way through one ethical minefield after another and just play by some standard, easy-to-follow rules.</blockquote><p>A Biden administration likely won’t focus as much on platform bans such as TikTok and WeChat, but tensions with China will continue and a divided internet is still on the&nbsp;table:</p><blockquote>The bottom line: Regardless of who wins the U.S. election, tech leaders expect U.S.-China tensions to continue, since each side sees the other as a long-term existential threat — but they also hope in the short term to keep getting what they need and selling what they&nbsp;can.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/trumps-campaign-website-hacked-by-cryptocurrency-scammers/">Trump’s campaign website hacked by cryptocurrency scammers — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/dutch-hacker-trump-twitter-account-password/">President Trump’s Twitter accessed by security expert who guessed password ‘maga2020!’ — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W85QiwL7qiU">Krystal and Saagar: The WORST Moments From The Big Tech Congressional Hearing</a>  <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/scoop-polls-show-support-for-tech-antitrust-action/">Scoop: Polls show support for tech antitrust action</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/for-tech-ceos-capitol-hill-is-now-mandatory-c0da9092-f9af-4e5c-a24d-04867979dccc.html">For tech CEOs, Capitol Hill is now mandatory</a>   2. And so regardless of who wins tomorrow (or whenever they figure out the results), there’s still a pandemic going on. 2021 will see us continue building on all the trends from&nbsp;2020. <p>Here’s Ina&nbsp;Fried:</p><blockquote>The big picture: As mentioned above, tech faces pressures on the privacy and antitrust fronts, but the pandemic has also accelerated the digitization of even the most change-resistant parts of society, including health&nbsp;care.</blockquote><p>And Karen&nbsp;Weise:</p><blockquote>“It is a ‘big, getting bigger’ moment in general we’re seeing. Which ties in, of course, to the antitrust focus and stuff that’s happening right now. The pandemic is obviously aberrational, but we’ve seen that everything reinforces existing patterns in many&nbsp;ways.”</blockquote><p>Nothing we didn’t already know. 2021 will be an exciting year for GlobaliD.</p> 3. If election results won’t have much of an impact on Big Tech’s path, a Biden win could hurt Facebook. <p>According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-facebook-has-the-most-to-lose-from-biden-democratic-victories">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>If Democrats sweep to power next week, as several pollsters predict, Facebook’s already lowly political fortunes are likely to take a sharp turn for the worse, Democratic congressional staffers and lobbyists say.</blockquote><blockquote>While the entire tech industry is fighting off demands by lawmakers for more regulation, Facebook is especially hard up for friends in Democratic circles, which could leave it on the outside as a possible Biden administration and Democratic Congress debate the future of the tech industry. Inside Facebook, some executives are bracing themselves for a tougher time if the political pendulum swings away from the Republicans, said a person familiar with the company’s thinking.</blockquote><blockquote>In recent years, Democrats’ ire toward Facebook has grown because of a perception that the social media app has become a conduit for President Trump and right-wing groups to spread disinformation and dehumanizing speech. They are still seething over Facebook’s failure to identify and block Russian actors from spreading disinformation to aid Trump during the 2016 presidential election.</blockquote><blockquote>“Facebook is seen as having sucked up to the Trump administration and had a profoundly negative effect on the culture of America and — in particular — of political dialogue,” said Blair Levin, a Washington-based policy analyst for New Street Research, a boutique Wall Street research&nbsp;firm.</blockquote><p>The end&nbsp;result?</p><blockquote>But a swing in political power to the Democrats could further minimize the company’s role in critical debates looming in Congress over the next year. Those debates are expected to include proposals to reform antitrust laws, aimed at making it easier for regulators to force tech companies to unwind their past acquisitions and to change the legal immunity that protects them from lawsuits over user-posted content. On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was among a handful of tech CEOs who appeared at a Senate committee hearing to discuss Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides that legal immunity.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-fb-3q-earnings-report-2020-11603992607?mod=djem10point">Facebook Posts Record Revenue Despite Ad&nbsp;Boycott</a>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2020-earnings-204642328.html?mc_cid=6fb48796ba&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">Facebook is losing users in the US and&nbsp;Canada</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-facebook-has-the-most-to-lose-from-biden-democratic-victories">Why Facebook Has the Most to Lose From Biden, Democratic Victories</a>   4. Speaking of Facebook, they recently launched their new streaming game app, but it won’t be available on&nbsp;iOS. <p>Because Apple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/26/facebook-launches-cloud-games-on-desktop-and-android-but-not-on-ios.html">won’t allow&nbsp;it</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook could bring cloud gaming to iOS if it enables the new product on the mobile web version of its service, but the company wants users to go to its apps instead, said Jason Rubin, Facebook’s vice president of special gaming initiatives.</blockquote><blockquote>“We don’t want people going to web Facebook 20 times a day. We have a great app,” Rubin said. “We would have to use Apple’s technology and browser on iOS, and that isn’t optimized to the benefit of cloud&nbsp;games.”</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook cloud gaming on iOS would allow iPhone and iPad users to find out what games their friends are playing, see lists that show top games on Facebook or play games with Facebook-unique features, Rubin&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“In many ways, consumers are being hampered,” Rubin&nbsp;said.</blockquote> 5.

This reduces wallet holders to a passive role, which at best delivers suboptimal utility to the holder, and at worst can reinforce the unhealthy power asymmetries between institutions and people that exist today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive connections solve this problem by creating a two-way street between a wallet holder and an institution. Instead of a passive responder, the wallet holder is a peer who can initiate actions of their own. In addition, wallet holders can interact not only with institutions, but also with other wallet holders, to communicate securely and share verified information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive connections are supported in the new Trinsic Wallet 3.1.0 release available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streetcred-identity-agent/id1475160728">App Store for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.streetcred.apps.mobile">Play Store for Android</a>. Like the other features in the Trinsic platform, interactive connections will continue to evolve over time based on the needs of our developer community. We’ve implemented four new features that help us get closer to the rich interactions people should expect with SSI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Proactive credential sharing  Interoperable chat messaging  Activity log  Connection invitation   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Sharing your credentials proactively 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Historically, wallet holders couldn’t share information from their credentials unless someone requested it through something called a verification request (or ‘proof’/’presentation’ request). That means you wouldn’t be able to share, for example, your business card with a new connection, or your address with someone who needed directions to your home, unless those people somehow conjured up a presentation request to send you first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can now share information from your credentials in a way that others can verify instantly conveniently from the Trinsic Wallet. When sharing credentials proactively, make sure 1) you and your connection are using the same network and 2) both of you have the Trinsic Wallet mobile app open throughout the credential sharing process.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Interoperable chat messaging 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Basic messaging functionality has been highly-requested ever since we removed messaging during our rebrand from Streetcred ID to Trinsic. It was a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">favorite feature of many</a>. Use cases range from the practical—eg., what if your name was misspelled in a credential offer—to the critical—developers in the UK and USA have created local contact tracing solutions using messaging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We chose to implement the feature using DIDComm—specifically the Aries Basic Message <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0095-basic-message">RFC 0095</a>—and display it in a chat-like interface on the Trinsic Wallet. That means messaging is interoperable between Trinsic and any other Aries-based implementations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Integrating communication and credential exchange tightly in a single experience ensures developers have the tools they need to create rich experiences with their users. The Trinsic API supports messaging (in beta) and has been used to send thousands of messages by a handful of developers. Our next release will include full messaging support in the API, SDKs, and documentation.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Activity log 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A historical log of activities with a given connection can now be found in the chat interface of the mobile application. You can view:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  messages you’ve sent or received  credentials you’ve shared or received  credentials others have shared with you  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our beta testers unanimously preferred embedding the activity inline with chat messages. At Trinsic, we frequently call upon familiar mental models to explain complex topics, like we did by introducing the credential card design to the market. Displaying historical credential exchange in a chat-like format invokes a similarly familiar mental model, making credential exchange even more accessible to people everywhere.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Connection invitation 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>You can now connect with anyone by creating your own connection invitation. Instead of waiting for a QR code to scan, you can now create your own QR code. You can also send a connection invitation to someone through email, SMS, WeChat, or whatever your preferred method of communication is.</p>

IDX provides a universal cross-platform identity (DID) for users that can be used everywhere across the Web3 ecosystem, a way to store/access public metadata such as profiles and social graphs, a way to associate your app’s data storage systems (i.e. SkyDB) to the user’s identity, a way to discover and import available third-party data sources for the user (even ones outside of the SkyDB ecosystem such as Filecoin files, TextileDBs, OrbitDBs, and much more!), and a way to publish schemas for your data so that others might easily make use of your application data within another application or&nbsp;context.</p><p>By design, IDX is completely agnostic as to which wallet users authenticate with and which backend configuration you choose to build with — including any blockchain and data storage system — so it easily integrates into the rest of your stack and allows you to build truly cross-platform interoperable applications. You can save data wherever you choose, and import data from other applications that may even be outside of the SkyDB ecosystem!</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">IDX: A Devkit for Open Identity</a></p><p>// Good luck to all the hackers!

   Get Started With Our Identity Platform as a Service Checklist&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Every organization is looking to transition from legacy systems to a more modern IT infrastructure by leveraging cloud for cost savings, better user experiences, new revenue streams, and greater employee productivity. Why then have only 25% of organizations achieved their initial IT modernization objectives?&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.insightcdct.com/getattachment/cf7658e2-9678-496b-96e4-534094f3ccb5/The-2020-IDG-survey-ebook.aspx">IDG survey</a>, “The State of IT Modernization 2020,” organizations struggle to modernize, in part because they lack a clear strategy. Figuring out the best path forward is complicated. Most likely you’ve got a combination of competing priorities, outdated processes and tools, aging infrastructure, lack of in-house expertise, insufficient budget, and operational limitations around application development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Modernizing your identity and<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management"> access management </a>(IAM) toolset is no exception. Determining the best strategy to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">modernize IAM</a> and leveraging a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud IAM platform</a> can also be a challenge. Identity drives user experiences, engagement, and productivity. If done right, you defend your organization and users — whether employees or consumers — against compromised accounts and data breaches, as well as differentiate your organization by providing exceptional user journeys. So what steps can you take to modernize IAM while taking infrastructure into account? You can start here by reading our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/your-iam-future-in-the-cloud-checklist">Identity Cloud Checklist: Top 10 Considerations and Best Practices to Strategize IAM in the Cloud</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Don’t Compromise when Modernizing IAM&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>When it comes to modernizing IAM, many organizations settle for one of the following:</p>

  Switch to a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/evolution-idaas-saas-delivered-iam">IDaaS</a>-delivered IAM model built on simplicity and ease of use but supports&nbsp; limited use cases and cannot adequately support legacy, on-premises IAM systems, applications, and things.&nbsp; 
	 Stick with a legacy on-premises identity solution that offers fuller feature sets, but is complex, difficult to maintain, and offers no clear roadmap to get you to the modern security and useability features and functionality you ultimately need.&nbsp; 
	 Build an in-house cloud or hybrid solution – that is, if you have the skill set to build it and then keep maintaining and tuning it.&nbsp; 
	 Acquire multiple point IAM solutions that can only address specific use cases with no feature parity across deployment models, be it on-premises, private cloud, public cloud, hybrid, or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/multicloud-hybrid-cloud-identity-solution">multi-cloud</a>.&nbsp; 
 <p>All these options have shortcomings, and none can provide the enterprise functionality that you need to support users and secure on-premises and cloud applications at scale. Additionally, as priorities and strategies shift, you need an IAM solution that can move with you. Cloud has played a significant role in how organizations modernize and secure user experiences but cloud is not a one size fits all solution. Many organizations operate in a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">hybrid</a> world today, yet traditional options don’t make it easy for you to modernize. In fact, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3985689/understanding-cloud-data-management-architectures-hybrid">Gartner</a> states the majority of enterprises using data in the cloud will be living in a hybrid — and likely multicloud — deployment world for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>

 Planning for the Future 

<p>If you haven’t already, you should start thinking about how to future-proof your IAM strategy. Look for an IAM solution that can be <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">easily deployed across any environment</a> to fit business needs as they evolve. You should also think about use cases and business outcomes. For example, you might find that initially you need to secure identity for employees, and, later, for your workforce, consumers, citizens, and things.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tailoring your IAM solution for your industry is also important. For example, if you are in a regulated industry, you will most likely need an identity cloud solution that can coexist with on-premises solutions, provide true <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/107430026/whitepaper/forgerock-identity-cloud-security-whitepaper.pdf">data isolation</a>, enable fine-grained transactional <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/authorization">authorization</a>, and integrate with leading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network#trust-network-frm">anti-fraud solutions</a>. If you are in healthcare, you will need to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">manage identity relationships</a> – such as parent and child and doctor and patient – and incorporate these relationships into <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/profile-and-privacy-management-dashboard">access and authorization decisions.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>And, of course, overall functionality, security, feature parity, availability, vendor support, and cost must also be taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s lots to think about. Fortunately, we’ve taken the guesswork out of what to consider as you either start or evolve your identity strategy with our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/your-iam-future-in-the-cloud-checklist">Identity Cloud Checklist</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are just a few examples of the ways in which businesses accelerated digital business to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">respond</a> in the early days of the pandemic.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37577"]</p>
<p>“The onset of COVID-19 spurred rapid action to get digital commerce; contactless, remote customer relationships; remote learning; and working from home up and running within days and weeks,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/15859">Kristin Moyer</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “As Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) put it, ‘We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months.’”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">Why Now Is the Time to Accelerate Digital</a></p>
<p>CEOs and boards want to accelerate digital business. Moyer says, “Great, there’s momentum. But I’ve never spoken with an executive leading digital business who says they’re trying to go as slow as possible. The real question is, how do you go faster?”</p>
<p>Gartner has identified four digital business accelerators that will help executive leaders make faster digital business progress through quick fixes, smart tactics and new directions.</p>
<p></p>
 Tactic No. 1: Win different 
<p>The pandemic uncovered new customers and sources of demand for businesses. Some organizations pivoted to new products and opportunities using existing systems. Now is the time to explore new business models, operating models and platforms to operationalize those opportunities. To win differently over the short-, medium- and long-term, executives should employ:</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/prioritize-digital-business-initiatives-to-accelerate-into-the-future/">Prioritize Digital Business Initiatives to Accelerate Into the Future</a></p>
 Quick fixes 
 
 Interview customers about their current challenges and needs 
 Speak directly to end users through the service contact center 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Drive deeper digitalization and intelligence into existing products 
 Enable more contactless customer interactions on a continuum of 100% digital to 100% human 
 
 New directions 
 
 Set up a strategy think tank to explore digital opportunities that are adjacent to their core market 
 Create a “virtual global tour” video of what’s going on digitally in their industry 
 
 Tactic No. 2: Unleash force multipliers 
<p>A force multiplier is an action that powers momentum. Multipliers can come through internal actions, such as a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">business model innovation</a> workshop. They can also come through external actions, such as an acquisition that enables moves into new geographic or product markets. Force multipliers can include:</p>
 Quick fixes 
 
 Ask every board member to bring an example of a digital business that impressed them to the next supervisory board meeting 
 Host product digitalization creativity workshops 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Launch an open <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/">innovation</a> challenge focused on new digital product opportunities 
 Sketch an “anti-strategy” — state what your company won’t do and what it won’t be 
 
 New directions 
 
 White-label a product or service from a digital-native partner 
 Empower business technologists (employees outside of IT who have technical skills) with self-service, automation and reuse 
 
 Tactic No. 3: Banish drags 
<p>A drag is a negative internal or external force that adds friction to the business. Examples of external drags are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-invest-in-your-supply-chain-before-its-too-late/">supply chain disruptions </a>or government shutdowns. Internal drags include outdated processes or legacy systems. Ideas to banish drag include:&nbsp;</p>
 Quick fixes 
 
 Cancel large-scale, pre-crisis, non-digital programs&nbsp; 
 Fortify digital productivity by using crisis culture hacks focused on hope, belonging, agency and pride 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Use robotic process automation (RBA) to drive even deeper back-office automation 
 Shorten the decision distance by removing steps and intermediaries that come between experts and decision makers 
 
 New directions 
 
 Embed work design assessments into talent management activities to better sync work design with how work gets done 
 Formalize how processes can flex by creating boundaries for autonomy and proceeding with consent rather than waiting for consensus 
 
 Tactic No. 4: Redirect resources 
<p>The majority of CFOs report delaying capital investments. At the same time, they hope to redirect pandemic-related savings from areas like travel and entertainment to growth-oriented programs. Executives can recapture resources and redeploy them using tactics such as:</p>
 Quick fixes 
 
 Shut down marginal and low-volume non-digital channels or initiatives 
 Freeze enhancements to programs that will be less essential in a COVID world 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Shift more work from complex sourcing providers to gig workers 
 Create a talent marketplace to match internal skills to the initiatives that need them 
 
 New directions 
 
 Rightsize real estate leases and assets for a hybrid workforce 
 Sell legacy assets or business units that don’t align with the company’s digital future 
 Shift travel and entertainment savings to SaaS and cloud acceleration

The team at Meeco is excited to announce we rolled out major releases to our sandbox environment, publicly available SDKs, and other tools at the end of October. And drumroll please: we have released the new version of the <a href="https://dev.meeco.me/">Developer Portal</a>!




 




Among the features we’re rolling out, some of the highlights are detailed below. But first, we wanted to chat with Meeco’s Chief Product Officer, Jan Vereecken on why we’re developing these tools, our roadmap and his longer-term vision.




 Why is Meeco building developer-centric tools? 




Jan: Storing, retrieving and sharing data in a secure way is not easy. Right from its inception, this has been one of the focal points for Meeco. First of all, there are technical issues to solve but as a company, we are always thinking about the user experience.




<blockquote>We’re always asking ourselves… “we have the technology but what are the consequences for anyone that will use our technology?” <p></p></blockquote>




How can we create applications that behave in a very similar way as they do today but where privacy and security are built-in from the very foundation? Where raw data is only ever visible as close to the user as possible, namely on a device or computer running the web browser. Over the years we have been active in this space, we’ve built many applications for a variety of use cases, each time expanding, improving and refining our personal data management tools and products.




 




Last year, we had the chance to build the <a href="https://www.kbc.be/retail/en/products/payments/self-banking/on-your-smartphone/mobile/digital-safe.html">Digital Safe</a> for the Belgian retail bank <a href="https://www.kbc.be/retail/en.html">KBC</a>, which was awarded the <a href="https://kbc.be/bestbank">Best Bank </a>award for the fifth consecutive time. Just last week, Meeco was awarded a <a href="https://thefinnies.org.au/2020-finnies-award-winners/">Fintech Australia Finnie for Industry Collaboration and Partnerships</a> for this solution.



This focus on enabling our partners was how the idea of opening up our tools emerged. We wanted to make our internal tools available and release libraries that make it possible for other developers to build front end applications. Being able to integrate this capability with all the possibilities that come with it means more collaboration and better outcomes for people.<br>




<blockquote>“We want to position Meeco as a set of components that you can use in your product and make a better value proposition.”

</blockquote>




For me, it’s really important to eat our own dog food. Everything we release on the developer portal is used internally. The <a href="https://docs.meeco.me">Meeco docs</a> for example, is the first thing a developer reads when joining the company as it introduces them to the terminology and enables them experiment and develop an general understanding of what we are doing really quickly.




 




For us as a company, it is also a really good way to understand where we are missing certain information or when something is out of date. The idea behind it is actually dead simple, what is usable for us, also is for other companies.<br>




<blockquote>“For me, it is really important to eat our own dog food. Everything we release on the developer portal is used internally.” 



</blockquote>




Since launching the Developer Portal earlier this year, we have been delighted by the increasing interest from organisations and developers to build on our platform. More and more we hear that it’s the fastest way to manage the complexity of data privacy and make it simple to get started. We’re inspired by the organisation that want to tackle this problem in earnest. In the same way as a lot of people nowadays don’t start building their own database, logging infrastructure or cloud infrastructure, we want to position Meeco as a set of components that you can use in your product to make a better value proposition for people without asking them to trade their privacy for convenience. With our tools, it is possible to have both.








 What does this release mean for Meeco? 





<blockquote>“In scope, this change was truly massive. The team has been hard at work to make this possible and I believe it gives us a solid foundation to build upon.”





</blockquote>




Jan: I think this release, which is the 4th generation of our platform, emphasises our desire to open up the platform and invite others. We have been building and improving the software for quite some time and as a consequence we have a lot of experience in this space. Now we are making it easy for others to unlock the potential of our secure data vault, encryption tools and UI components.




 




This release opens up all of these possibilities for other developers to explore our product, read (in detail) documentation and make use of our tools. I always like to advise someone new to, at least, do the 15 minute <a href="https://docs.meeco.me/getting-started/quickstart">quickstart</a>. It allows you to create a new user account and save your first item to the vault. This seems trivial but if you read what is needed, there is actually a lot going on. The information is there, the code is there, the next step is simply to build. In scope, this change was truly massive. The team has been hard at work to make this possible and I believe it gives us a solid foundation to build upon.




 What other features are on the roadmap for Meeco? 





<blockquote>“Always, increasing security whilst focussing on usability. This combination is exactly what we are good at.” 

</blockquote>




Jan: We have a few really exciting upcoming features we are working on, but the ones I would like to point out are Delegated access, Meeco Identity Provider (Meeco IdP) and Wallet.




 





  Delegated access is a feature that allows users to do certain actions in another users’ vault. The first use case which uses this feature is the upcoming <a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it platform</a>, where grown-ups take control over what happens in the vault of their children. For example, how can mum and dad, both control what happens inside the vault of their child, while ensuring that all data is only every decrypted and encrypted on their respective devices. The tricky part here is the key management. You see, all encryption keys need to be shared between these users, without a middleman knowing that secret.  





 





  Meeco IdP is a service that we’ll extract out of existing services into a separate component. The goal here is twofold. On one hand, we are trying to simplify, where you’ll only need one access token to access all our services (vault, keystore, downloader) instead of a separate access token per service. On the other hand, we are also looking at better enterprise interoperability and tools that help us tap into standard flows (e.g. <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>). In our “lab”, we are also experimenting with the <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop">Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider DID profile</a> (SIOP), a new way to authenticate yourself in a new, more decentralised, world.  





 





  We are seeing more and more use cases that can be powered by the use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">DIDs</a>. We are building a decentralised Wallet that stores, verifies and presents these credentials to interested parties. The accelerated adoption that we are seeing cause of what is happening in 2020 is something that we are investing in heavily. Our existing services, Vault and Keystore are also complimentary as we have observed in market that people want more possibilities, increased security but still with a focus on usability. This combination is exactly what we are good at.  





 





 What is your long term vision for the developer tools? 




Our personal data platform and developer tools are a core offering in Meeco. We want to make the components available and make it easy to use and integrate our tools to enable people and organisations to collect and protect data. First and foremost, we test everything by building with it first. If it helps us create better security, enable more user control, provide privacy by default or seamless enterprise integration, then it makes sense it will also help our partners. I am confident that others will also find them as useful once they invest a few hours and see what is possible.




 




We’ll keep improving the portal, tools and resources based on the feedback that we receive, so we would love to hear from you. We trust that these changes will bring lots of exciting possibilities for developers all over the world to enable everyone on the planet to collect, protect and permission their personal data.




 




You can see a list of the upcoming changes for the October 2020 release<a href="https://docs.meeco.me/releases"> here</a>  including a high-level summary of new and updated features such as:




 





  On-sharing – the ability to allow other users to share an item that has been shared with you if the item’s owner allows it. This includes a verification step to make sure the on-sharer has not modified the data.  





  Organisations – you can now create an account for your organisation and add members and services.  





  Accepting of shares – we’ve identified that sometimes the terms of a share need to be reviewed and explicitly accepted or rejected before seeing the data so we’ve now made this possible.  





  More efficient file attachments – we now have the ability to encrypt and upload an attached file one chunk at a time. This allows for handling of larger files, better performance on lower end devices, and even streaming of downloaded encrypted data into video players.  





  Improved Sharing – sharing is more streamlined, comprehensible and performant than ever before.  





  Sharing of encrypted files with other users.  





  Re-encrypting of shared data to cut down on the number of Encryption Keys needed to be stored/managed indefinitely.  




There are a range of other changes that will continue to be released between now and the end of the year. You will always find the latest information in our changelogs.




 




In the meantime, if you have any suggestions or queries please don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@meeco.me">info@meeco.me</a>, we look forward to hearing from you!

Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@louishansel?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Louis Hansel @shotsoflouis</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hammer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>Transmute builds solutions that solve real business problems. For this reason, we support a number of different decentralized identifier (DID) methods. While we are committed to providing optionality to our customers, it’s equally important to communicate the selection criteria behind these options so that customers can consider the tradeoffs of underlying DID-methods alongside the problem set they’re solving for. Essentially, we help them pick the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p> In the spirit of sharing and improving as an industry, here are the work-in-progress criteria we use to help customers assess what DID method is best for their use&nbsp;case:  Interoperability <p>This DID method meets the interoperability requirements of my business, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Other parties can verify my DID&nbsp;method.  I can switch out this DID method in the future if my business needs&nbsp;change.   Security <p>This DID method meets the security requirements of my business, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Approved cryptography for jurisdiction/industry  Ledger/anchoring preferences  Key rotation/revocation   Privacy <p>This DID method meets privacy requirements relevant to my use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Identifiers of individuals (data privacy and consent priorities)  Identifiers for companies (organization identity and legal protection priorities)  Identifiers for things (scaling, linking, and selective sharing priorities)   Scalability <p>This DID method meets the scalability needs of my business use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Speed  Cost  Stability/maturity   Root(s) of&nbsp;Trust <p>This DID method appropriately leverages existing roots of trust that have value for my business or network (or it is truly decentralized). For&nbsp;example:</p>  Trusted domain  Existing identifiers/ identity&nbsp;systems  Existing credentials  <p>We are currently using and improving these criteria as we co-design and implement solutions with customers.</p><p>For example, our commercial importer customers care a lot about ensuring that their ecosystem can efficiently use the credentials they issue (interoperability) without disclosing sensitive trade information (privacy). Government entities emphasize interoperability and accepted cryptography. Use cases that include individual consumers focus more on data privacy regulation and control/consent. In some instances where other standardized identifiers already exist, DIDs may not make sense as primary identifiers at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Examples of DID methods Transmute helps customers choose from today include: Sidetree Element (did:elem, Ethereum anchoring), Sidetree Ion (did:ion, Bitcoin anchoring), Sidetree Photon (did:photon, Amazon QLDB anchoring), did:web (ties to trusted domains), did:key (testing and hardware-backed keys), and&nbsp;more.</p> How do you think about selecting the right DID method for the&nbsp;job? <p>Let’s improve this framework together.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/did-customer-4ca8b7957112">did:(customer)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) promises to deliver innovation and value in every industry for a variety of use cases. It’s already picking up steam in financial services, healthcare, and government sectors around the world. But in order to get widespread adoption, sustainable business cases need to be developed—not just use cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our recent expert-panel webinar, “Making Money with SSI,” we dive in to the details of creating a business out of SSI from experts who’ve done it. Whether you missed the webinar or just want to refer back to the best parts, we’ve got you covered with a full recording.

			 Intro to the business of SSI 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Before we got into the meat of the webinar, Riley Hughes, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Trinsic, kicked us off by briefly defining <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) and discussing the business value of SSI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He began by simplifying human identity into two parts:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Intrinsic identity:&nbsp;This is what we see when we look in the mirror. It’s our gender identity, political identity, or cultural identity. It’s who we are in the context of our relationships with our closest confidants. It’s intrinsic to us and is the truest form of identity.  Extrinsic identity:&nbsp;This is how others, often institutions, identify us. A driver’s license is the most ubiquitous example. Although intended to prove your eligibility to drive on public roads, it is also how financial institutions, airports, and bars identify you. It works because institutions trust the DMV, and with a driver’s license, you always have the DMV vouching for you. And it isn’t limited to government ID—educational, professional, and membership credentials all work this same way.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Social sites, blogs, and other internet platforms help people express their intrinsic identity. However, up until now, there has not been a good way to share your extrinsic identity online. SSI is the answer to that problem because it reduces transaction costs of verification. Riley explains this concept in the video below.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today, Apple Music, Spotify and other online music services allow several members of a family to access the same service plan using their own individual accounts. Does it sound familiar to you? The “family model” is also seen in popular services such as Nintendo Switch Online, YouTube Premium, etc.</p>
<p>A clear benefit of the family model is that the members of the household don’t need to share an account and password. This frees you from many problems: have you ever started playing movies in Netflix only to notice later that you chose the wrong profile by mistake? The mess is done: you’ve mixed your preferences and viewing history with your kids. Not to mention the security risks of sharing passwords and account access, and the lost revenue from companies whose users share a single account. A well-designed family model delivers one of the principles of good Identity and Access Management: every member has their own user account and credentials to access your services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And family plans aren’t exclusive of pure-online services. Think of a traditionally offline business – an amusement park, determined to get 90% of their customers to use its brand new mobile app. A child will use the app, but naturally without the same full admin access as mum or dad, such as being able to buy services, delete the account.</p>
<p>Now you might be thinking, is the family model valuable for entertainment only? Certainly not. The family model can also work miracles for a utility such as electricity distribution, or a mobile operator. Some mobile network operators such as <a href="https://www.moi.fi/liittyma-lapselle">Moi</a> (Finland) and <a href="https://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/phones-tablets/bt-mobile-family-sim-controlling-your-sims-11364143992036">BT</a> (UK) offer family plans. Let’s say David pays the bill and uses a family manager user interface to create accounts for his wife and kids and assign them credits to spend.</p>
<p>In all the previous cases, the family manager created the other users’ accounts, assigned them a role, and gave them certain access authorisation or the possibility to use credits. Not money, but access to or credits for a paid service.</p>
<p>The family model is identity delegation in its most basic form. To see the full power of identity delegation, let’s imagine this. What if when you create an account, the assigned role allows the user to:</p>
 
 Collaborate on a highly-sensitive project 
 Exercise power of attorney 
 Order products on behalf of your employer (partners and suppliers) 
 
<p>Now I will share with you three core use cases of how digital services across different industries can unleash the power of identity delegation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 [1] Collaborate on a highly-sensitive project 
<p>Another high value activity is to work on a sensitive project online, which is protected. A team of entrepreneurs is building an innovative product; let us say a Water Purification System. All is going well but the next phase in their plan requires external funding, so the team will apply for funding from a governmental agency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The application is 100% online and every user must authenticate to “using a verified identity, with strong authentication. The entrepreneurs start filling in all the forms, but they soon realise they need an accredited environmental specialist as nobody in the team can do a mandatory assessment. When the team finds the suitable specialist, Mr Park, the CEO, Scott Long, uses StartupCashPortal to send him an invitation (‘Add new user’) to contribute to the project. First, Mr Park opens the email invitation and then uses bank authentication to prove his identity, then he has access to the system to modify only the section of the funding application that concerns him.</p>
<p>As you see, this B2B use case of identity delegation gets even more interesting, but there is not money involved yet. The main benefit is that the third-party individual gains access to collaborate on sensitive information in a secure way with a verified identity. Imagine if the wrong person gains access to other sensitive projects; the governmental agency could face lawsuits because of the data breach.</p>
<p>Two key elements made this use case possible:</p>
 
 Authentication with a verified digital identity (e.g. bank authentication, electronic national ID card, Mobile Connect) 
 Identity delegation, a building block of modern CIAM systems. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 [2] Exercise power of attorney 
<p>Taking a step forward, what would happen if a company offers delegation on its own platform in order to make monetary transactions?</p>
<p>Imagine that a few years back you inherited a house along with seven members of your family. Now you all want to sell the property, but everybody lives in a different city and it’s nearly impossible to meet and sign the agreement all together. Also, due to some force majeure one member of the family, Uncle Zach, can’t sign for himself and instead will need to give power of attorney to Beth.</p>
<p>Luckily Beth finds real estate agency RealtyPower. They have launched a digital service with electronic identity delegation, which allows the family to find the best buyer, sell the house and sign all documents (including showing Zach’s power of attorney to Beth) remotely, making the online transaction secure and seamless. Both the family and the real estate company saved time and money.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example 2 was a B2C case with a monetary transaction. The same scenario can become B2B if you replace members of a family with companies, all sharing a very valuable asset, as the ownership of an office building. As you can imagine, the biggest value is in full B2B use cases like the one that comes next – example 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 [3] Order products on behalf of your employer (partners and suppliers) 
<p>FairCrops, a company in the agriculture industry, has hundreds of partners and resellers and has a web service called AgroPortal, which gives “extranet” access to these companies. Bob is the CEO of one of these partners, Bob’s Corner, so he can log in, search for products on the AgroPortal database, and place a purchase order. As this order is on credit, AgroPortal must make sure that the user is indeed Bob, and so has rights to place an order.</p>
<p>One year later, Bob’s company experiences amazing growth and he hires two people to take care of orders: Purchasing Manager, Mary, and Purchasing Assistant, Fred. Both need different levels of purchasing rights, which starts to make things complex. Here, identity delegation comes in as the perfect solution. Bob assigns Mary an admin user role on AgroPortal, which allows her to create new users, delegate rights, assign roles, and revoke any permissions herself. Next, Mary digitally invites Fred to create an account with limited rights as the Purchasing Assistant. This advanced schema of identity delegation empowers the B2B customer and takes the heavy burden out of the agroindustry producer’s staff.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the portal should make a well-informed choice of authentication method to ensure a good level of security, appropriate to the situation. An easy approach would be identity federation using a business identity (e.g. AzureAD) between these two companies. If federation is not possible, a national identification or a biometric-based authentication service could be the next best choices.</p>



Company: FairCrops agroindustry producer
Partner: Bob’s Corner, chain of stores
e-service: AgroPortal, order products, get specialised customer service



<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Can you see your organisation embracing a variant of one of these use cases? Can you see it as part of the digital transformation you are working now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The nuts and bolts of identity delegation 
<p>One question you might be asking yourself is, ‘how do we implement identity delegation?’&nbsp; The brilliance of these use cases is that once launched they look so easy. However, the nuts and bolts of identity delegation lie on a deep expertise of:</p>
 
 Proof of identity. Every person using these digital services must have proved their identity to the identity provider (bank, government) first to enable the verified digital identity. 
 The selection of the right authentication method. Different methods are best for different industries and purposes. 
 A user has to obtain the right privileges to complete their task (e.g. sign an agreement) while sharing the minimum possible personal data with the digital servicebank, or the civil registry, has detailed personal data about you, but the online service (e.g. RealtyPower) only needs to know a few pieces of that data. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ubisecure has the most flexible, agile and proven identity delegation solution available today: Delegated Authority. Cybersecurity analyst, KuppingerCole, said “Ubisecure has demonstrated its value specifically in scenarios with complex B2B2C relationships, where its strength in delegating access is a differentiator to other providers in the market.” Find out more about Delegated Authority <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/delegated-authority/">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Midsize enterprise (MSE) CIOs began 2020 leaning in to the need to equip their organizations for digital business with modern infrastructure and strategic use of automation. They still are doing so, but with more urgency, as the pandemic economy forces them to make the most of their people, platforms and data, and still protect the enterprise from security threats.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technologies cited in this Hype Cycle offer MSE IT leaders a high degree of benefit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“MSE CEOs are looking to technology enablement from technology, automation, business intelligence, data and digital, as the No. 1 way to improve productivity/efficiency within their organizations, says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/43526">Mike Cisek</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “The technologies cited in this Hype Cycle offer MSE IT leaders a high degree of benefit and applicability.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>The 41 technologies in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Midsize Enterprises, 2020 reflect these complementary priorities in IT, with a focus on three particular themes driving CIO investments.</p>
 
 Data-driven culture: CIOs are delivering the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-4-data-and-analytics-trends-for-midsize-enterprises/">data and analytics </a>infrastructure and capabilities business leaders need to understand and act on <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/data-sharing-is-a-business-necessity-to-accelerate-digital-business/">data-driven insights</a>. 
 Risk-based security: Trends related to remote worker and edge infrastructure have accelerated the need to strengthen security and simplify how IT teams deliver it. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-balance-risk-trust-and-opportunity-in-an-uncertain-world/">Risk-based security</a> allows CIOs to focus on high-priority areas of risk in an efficient and cost-effective way. 
 Infrastructure utility: Modernizing legacy infrastructure is a high priority for MSEs to enable <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/mitigate-the-challenges-of-remote-work-for-an-mse/">remote work</a> and higher productivity. Infrastructure utility solutions support distributed workloads to securely navigate between on-premises infrastructure and cloud-native architectures.

<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1iM2E0OWMzZTE3YmUxMWViYTlmNDBhMGQ2NmZkZGI0Nw=="></a></p>
 Workplace analytics 
<p>What is it? Insights about employee experience, engagement, collaboration and productivity, based on data from workplace applications, network traffic, user devices and other sources.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? Workplace analytics provide one input on the state of individual and team productivity and collaboration. Workplace analytics can offer insights about, for example, the business impact of a new tool or policy, or which team members are overburdened or underutilized. Challenges remain with how analytics solutions access and integrate data, and employee concerns about privacy can delay adoption.</p>
<p>Time is short. Enterprises are still working out how to best use workplace analytics, but the potential benefits are high and will drive rapid adoption over the next two to five years.</p>
 Citizen data science 
<p>What is it? Tools that automate aspects of data preparation, exploration, pattern detection and modeling to enable business users to get value out of data assets without needing an expensive and high-demand data scientist to do the work.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-mse-cios-guide-to-citizen-it/">Citizen data</a> science makes data insights more accessible and applicable across the organization, while helping to optimize the value delivered by scarce specialty data scientists. Citizen data scientists also contribute domain expertise to ensure data initiatives align with the needs of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the next two to five years, citizen data science will become more widespread</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citizen data science is an emerging capability that should transform how businesses design and deploy next-generation analytics and machine learning. Over the next two to five years, citizen data science will become more widespread as BI and data science platforms add more augmented analytics capabilities.</p>
<p>Look for collaboration opportunities between specialist data scientists and citizen data scientists, and work to educate and advocate with business units about user enablement, responsible use, data ethics and other key issues.</p>
 Managed detection and response (MDR) 
<p>What is it? A 24/7 security threat monitoring, detection and response service that leverages advanced analytics, threat intelligence and human expertise to prevent or minimize security breaches. MDR technologies and deployments currently focus on network and endpoint security, as well as monitoring the cloud.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-9-security-and-risk-trends-for-2020/">Gartner Top 9 Security and Risk Trends for 2020</a></p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? MDR services allow enterprises to secure their networks and reduce the complexity of identifying and investing in the right mix of in-house people, processes and technology. MDR solutions<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-strategic-cost-optimization-action-items-for-security-leaders/"> provide particular value for organizations</a> that want a single, turnkey solution or that lack the internal resources to respond to threats when they occur. MDR may not be right for businesses that have already invested in point solutions for network security, such as endpoint detection and response.</p>
<p>MDR solutions will continue to mature and increasingly deliver high value over the next two to five years.</p>
 Firewall as a service (FWaaS) 
<p>What is it? A multifunction security solution delivered as a cloud-based service to protect multiple satellite offices or remote users. FWaaS provides a more flexible and centralized way to deliver enterprise firewall features to multiple locations.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? FWaaS gives distributed organizations an efficient way to deliver secure internet connectivity to all work sites (including remote work sites). FWaaS competes with secure web gateways and web application firewalls to achieve many of the same aims. Interest in FWaaS will grow over the next two to five years as solutions integrate more closely with SD-WANs and prove consistently good latency across all endpoints.</p>
 Hybrid cloud 
<p>What is it? A combination of integrated public and private cloud services that operate as separate entities. Distinct from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-organizations-choose-a-multicloud-strategy/">multicloud</a>, which is the use of two different cloud service providers, hybrid cloud includes some enterprise-managed infrastructure with the addition of service integration, cross-service security, availability/disaster recovery and other useful capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? Hybrid cloud theoretically combines the cost optimization and flexibility benefits associated with cloud with the control and compliance capabilities of private infrastructure. About 10% of MSEs have implemented hybrid cloud for availability/disaster recovery purposes, but that number is expected to grow rapidly. MSEs seek to optimize their resources as they explore new business opportunities that require flexible infrastructure. Expect high benefit from this still-immature technology.</p>
 Hyperconvergence 
<p>What is it? Designed for IT leaders who want simplified solutions, hyperconvergence is a building-block approach to deploying software and infrastructure. Hyperconvergence vendors use off-the-shelf infrastructure and packaged software, which they can deliver as a service or in a public cloud.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? Hyperconvergence is attractive to enterprises seeking IT management simplicity. Hyperconvergence allows IT teams to deliver or add functionality more frequently through modular solutions, instead of requiring business stakeholders to wait for less frequent but bigger upgrades.</p>
<p>The acquisition cost of hyperconvergence may be higher than for three-tiered compute, storage and networking implementations, but the management efficiency is often better, leading to faster response times. MSEs can eventually expect lower operational costs, especially if they standardize on hyperconvergence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This post was authored by Dev Bharel, who helps lead the SSI initiative at GlobaliD.</p>The opening circle at&nbsp;IIW<p>Last week, GlobaliD attended the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW), a longstanding biannual (un)conference that focuses on building collaborative environments where developers can share ideas and work on open industry standards together.</p><p>The idea of an unconference is a reference to the event’s unique format, where rather than having a set agenda, participants huddle together every morning to define the topics and sessions of the day (typically socratic style conversations).</p><p>Free of business interests, you’ll often see direct competitors collaborating on the latest and greatest standards in the industry. Talks can range from very technical machinations (such as of Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) to more socially focused talks about how to build a more Ethical Digital&nbsp;World.</p><p>All of which culminates in a highly influential gathering that has been the birthplace of frameworks such as OpenID Connect along with tons of other identity technologies.</p> GlobaliD and&nbsp;SSI <p>Attending on behalf of GlobaliD were myself, Dev Bharel, and Alexis Falquier. We are <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> architects who have been working on the initiative of migrating GlobaliD to open SSI standards, namely Hyperledger Aries and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> is an umbrella organization under the Linux Foundation that houses a number of open source projects. The two projects of note for identity are Indy, an identity specific blockchain and Aries, a framework to build cross-chain identity agents that interact with verifiable credentials and decentralized identity documents (DIDs).</p><p>Alongside Hyperledger, there are also a number of nonprofit organizations that participate in conversations involving these open standards — the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>, all of whom have hosted various working groups around the interoperability of these standards across the wider digital landscape.</p> GlobaliD’s open source SSI frameworks <p>GlobaliD led two sessions at IIW to showcase some select&nbsp;work.</p><p>In our first session, we open sourced our iOS and Android native Aries frameworks and donated them to the Hyperledger Aries project. These frameworks can be used by any organization to create mobile native Aries agents to receive and hold verifiable credentials. The frameworks are the result of months of intense work at GlobaliD to incorporate Aries agents into our platform.</p> GlobaliD Groups for SSI governance <p>In our second session, we unveiled our Dynamic Governance API using GlobaliD Groups. Employing GlobaliD Groups addresses the challenge of dynamic governance on an Indy-based chain. By dynamically managing membership lists using Groups, verifiers of credentials no longer need to worry about the nitty gritty of issuers within their organizations. All they need to know are the key parent organizations they want to accept credentials. This is especially helpful as issuer lists grow and as individuals join and leave those organizations.</p> Stay tuned for&nbsp;more! <p>We had a blast at IIW31. We’ll be publishing a series of blog posts in the coming weeks highlighting our time at the conference including a deep dive into Governance and Guardianship as it applies to self-sovereign identity.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7">GlobaliD shares SSI code at the Internet Identity Workshop</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Mike Kubzansky, CEO, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>2020 has challenged and consumed us — as individuals and as a society. From the pandemic to politics, to the severe economic downturn and the desperate cries for Black lives to matter; too many across the country and around the globe are struggling — financially, physically, and mentally.</p><p>We are at times scared, or angry, or resigned, and a pervasive sense of helplessness underpins so much of current daily life, across whole swathes of society. Yet so many people have remained remarkably resilient and resolute. We have donned our masks and taken to the streets to peacefully protest, help at food banks, or simply serve as poll watchers. We have prayed, meditated, eaten (and then tried to exercise) our way through this year of chaos and uncertainty. Several of us even got new kittens or&nbsp;puppies.</p><p>While everyone has different coping mechanisms, there is one thing I hope we all do:&nbsp;vote.</p><p>As political scientist Larry Sabato said, “Every election is determined by the people who show up.” Whether it’s by mail, drop box, in person, early, or on election day (masked, of course), we must all show up. We believe deeply in democracy. It is the bedrock of this nation, and it will only be of, for, and by all the people if we all vote. That’s why Omidyar Network signed <a href="http://adayfordemocracy.com/">A Day for Democracy</a> pledge to give our staff in the US time off to vote and do their civic&nbsp;duty.</p><p>And when voters do their civic duty, their votes must be counted. We are proud of the work of our sister organization, <a href="http://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>, and many of our grantees like <a href="http://communitychangeaction.org/">Community Change Action</a>, <a href="https://demosaction.org/">Demos Action,</a> <a href="http://citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>, and <a href="http://jwj.org/">Jobs With Justice</a> for their ongoing efforts to dismantle barriers to voting, so that everyone who is eligible can vote with ease — <a href="http://www.protecttheresults.org/">and can trust that election outcomes are legitimate</a>, so that we have genuine majority rule by a full and fully empowered electorate. It’s also why I signed on to <a href="https://medium.com/world-justice-project/a-joint-appeal-to-protect-the-rule-of-law-in-the-2020-u-s-elections-1f1f6876b351">World Justice Project’s letter</a>, along with a number of other foundation presidents, demanding that the rule of law is protected to ensure the security and integrity of the elections.</p><p>We cannot let expediency outweigh accuracy. We must be patient as election officials do their jobs and count every vote, even if it takes extra time before a winner is declared. Ensuring that every vote is counted will enhance the legitimacy of the election and strengthen our democracy.</p><p>While democracy is not a focus area for Omidyar Network — nor is improving its functioning our mission — it weaves through much of our work to strengthen technology and the economy. And pluralism, if true to its ideals, should have spillover benefits that improve democracy.</p><p>In Responsible Technology, we know that online platforms with outsized power can ravage our democracy by allowing unfettered hate, bigotry, racism, antisemitism, and disinformation to run rampant. We support organizations leading the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">#StopHateforProfit</a> campaign to call on Facebook to change its policies that inflame intolerance and undermine democracy. We also support <a href="https://graphika.com/">Graphika’s</a> investigations into domestic disinformation and potential foreign interference in the 2020 election, as well as its partnership with the <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/">Election Integrity Partnership</a>, which identifies instances aimed to “prevent or deter people from voting or to delegitimize election results.”</p><p>In our call to <a href="https://omidyar.com/our-call-to-reimagine-capitalism-in-america/">reimagine capitalism</a>, we recognize that democracy and the economy are fundamentally intertwined. We cannot address one without taking into account the other. Concentrated economic power too easily spills over into political power. That has resulted in policies that prevent the economic interests of the many from being fulfilled. We are working to address these imbalances, and support communities, working families, and small businesses to have greater power and voice in the economic decisions that impact their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>We also cannot reflect on American democracy without reflecting on race. The US is still not living up to its democratic ideal in which all people are created — and treated — as equal. In addition to the continued horror of the 164 Black individuals who have been killed by police through August, we see every day continued work <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/poll-prri-voter-suppression/565355/">to disenfranchise and suppress voting by Black and brown voters</a>. So it’s not surprising that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/us/election-nonvoters.html">some voters drop out of the system and choose to simply not participate</a> — real change has been too slow to&nbsp;come.</p><p>We know that change won’t always happen as quickly as we would like — or many times need — but it will happen. Voting is the first step on this journey toward a more just and equal&nbsp;future.</p><p>As President Obama said in Philadelphia at a rally last week, “Voting’s about using the power we have, and pooling it together to get a government that’s more concerned, and more responsive, and more focused on you and your lives and your children, and your grandchildren, and future generations. And the fact that we don’t get 100% of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we’ve got to vote, and then get some change, and then vote some more, and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it&nbsp;right.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/keep-voting-until-we-get-it-right-88e3cb4611ab">Keep Voting Until We Get it Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/schuetze">Christopher Schuetze</a></p><p>15 to 20 years ago, a virus scanner&nbsp;– or let me call it Endpoint Protection&nbsp;– on your private or corporate computer was standard. Today, you must also have something like a virus scanner on your endpoint device. But in 2020, is it sufficient to detect viruses, worms, and rootkits or botnets like we did in the past? There have been a lot of changes in the way attackers try to steal data, get access to your computers, or even block you from working with your computer. This evolution must be part of your strategy for protecting your endpoints. It is called Endpoint Protection, Detection and Response (EDPR) – adding Detection and Response to your virus scanner.</p>
 Scanning suspicious files based on a signature is dead 
<p>I hope you agree that when it comes to endpoint protection, a classic virus scanner alone is no longer enough in the fight against the "bad guys". Anti-malware is necessary, but you need a lot more besides. And yes, security for endpoint devices plays a central role in your overall security strategy – you might also call it “Zero Trust” strategy. Endpoints today are way more than traditional PCs and notebooks. It is any device you interact with, including computers, virtual desktops, servers, smartphones, tablets, and IoT or SCADA devices. They all must be part of your strategy to prevent harm to your organization.</p>
<p>Investing into a single tool that can detect malware based only on patterns is very outdated because attackers are now focused on collecting data from your organization or blackmailing you via a ransomware attack. Attackers are continually trying to trick your employees into clicking on links to enter their credentials on a manipulated website or to download malware to get access to your organization. Your strategy must cover this, and EDPR meets this requirement.</p>
 Protection means to detect before, during, and after the execution 
<p>Protecting an endpoint is a broad field, and with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, it is changing a lot. Real AI is much more efficient in detecting creatively implemented malware which might use exploits and change its signature frequently. Detection at runtime is essential, but difficult. Traditional tools focus more on pre-execution detection based on a static signature of a piece of malware.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Looking more at the behavior of a malware and having tools which help to detect an attack, even after it happened, is also important. If attackers are currently in your system and preparing a bigger attack by infecting your servers with ransomware, for example, this needs to be detected. This is called post-execution and typically involves forensic analysis to enable organizations to respond to an attack even after it has begun.</p>
 The focus of such tools must be understood 
<p>Defining the broad range of use cases to protect an endpoint can be overwhelming at first. In light of this, it could be useful to consider the following:</p>
 
 Protecting your endpoints with a combination of detection and prevention features. The local agent should be able to prevent an employee from executing a compromised file, as well as be able to detect malware post-execution, based on more complex detection mechanisms. 
 Threat intelligence features should detect threats based on the behavior of the threat and knowledge from other attacks and be able to respond automatically to such an attack to prevent further harm to your organization. 
 Advanced alerting and reporting mechanisms can help to identify the health state of endpoints on a central dashboard and be able to react to threats by collecting relevant information. 
 
<p>Do you use already use tools like this in your organization? Is the device you are currently using part of this protection strategy?

  <p>If you’ve been an engineer for any considerable time, you’ve probably made some mistakes that made you want to crawl under your desk and hide. You may have even considered packing up your desk!</p>

<p>In the spirit of the greatest holiday ever (Halloween), the Developer Advocacy group at Okta has shared some of their scariest engineering stories.</p>

 Exploit Explorer 

<p>Back when I still ran my own physical servers, 10 or more years ago, the word was going around about a new Linux kernel exploit that could be used to let a local user gain root privileges by running a carefully crafted binary. It turns out it affected many kernel versions and there was a good chance that any machine online at the time was vulnerable. It required local access to the machine, it wasn’t something that could be run remotely, but it was still a pretty big deal given how common it was for people to share access to physical servers.</p>

<p>I never liked dealing with kernel upgrades on my servers since it was a pretty lengthy process that inevitably resulted in more downtime than I would like, so I decided to check if my machines were vulnerable to this and only upgrade them if they were. In order to test if they were vulnerable, I decided to actually run the exploit proof of concept code, since that seemed to be the fastest way to find out, and since these were machines I already had root access on it seemed like a perfectly reasonable way to test this out. A couple of my machines were not vulnerable, the exploit code just failed silently (probably because I was a few kernel versions out of date and the bug hadn’t been introduced yet!), but on one of the machines I tried, it worked! My normal user account was suddenly logged in as root! Excited, I started writing up an explanation of what just happened, including all the commands and the console output as part of the process. I ran the exploit code again so I could get a clean screenshot, but this time instead of getting me root access, the entire machine crashed!</p>

<p>And that’s how I brought down several dozen production websites at an organization too large for me to be willing to name in this blog post.</p>

 Apologies for “HaHa”ing Up Your Desktop 

<p>When I was attending university, I lived on campus in the dorms and became friends with the group of guys that lived next to me. All of us were computer science majors and had a shared interest in computers, video games, etc. They were great!</p>

<p>At the time, I was writing a lot of software in AutoIt, a scripting language that allows you to build native Windows applications. One day, while working on a project and searching for information on developer forums, I stumbled across some cool information: Windows XP allowed you to automatically run software on a USB thumb drive or a CD-ROM when it was inserted by simply specifying what the file is.</p>

<p>In the spirit of chaotic fun, I wrote a simple AutoIt program that ran in the background and created millions of folders on the desktop titled “ha1”, “ha2”, etc. I then packaged this program up to run automatically on a USB thumb drive and shared it around the dorms with my buddies as a joke. They’d insert the USB drive, not notice anything happening, only to later discover their desktop was cluttered with empty folders that served no purpose.</p>

<p>I thought it’d be funny.</p>

<p>Little did I know, by inserting the thumb drive into their computer, not only would the program run automatically, but it also wouldn’t stop running unless the process was explicitly killed. Removing the thumb drive didn’t stop the process from executing.</p>

<p>Because of this, several of my friends continued using their computers like normal until eventually, they got a BSOD because their disk was so fragmented with hundreds of millions of 0-byte folders that NTFS broke and they had to completely reformat their computers 🙁</p>

<p>What started off as a stupid, innocent joke ended up being an absolute nightmare. It’s still something I regret to this day! I apologized right away, but still feel terrible that my stupid joke ended up costing my buddies so much time to recover from 🙁</p>

 It All Depends on the <code>/usr</code> 

<p>In 1995, I helped launch the SciFi (now Syfy) channel’s first website (earliest link from Internet Archive is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970106060027/http://www.scifi.com/">1997</a>). It was running on a Sun Sparcstation 20 knockoff, which sat on the edge of a desk connected to a 56k line.</p>

<p>It was very limited on space, so, in an effort to make more space available for content, I wanted to thin out the /usr folder, which had a lot of unnecessary, large files in it.</p>

<p>As the root user, I started with:</p>

   <code>mkdir /usr.new
cd /usr.new
cp -p -r ../usr .
</code>   

<p>(which, temporarily doubled the space <code>/usr</code> was taking up)</p>

<p>I pruned out everything that was unnecessary from /usr.new. Here’s what I wanted to do next:</p>

   <code>mv /usr /usr.orig
mv /usr.new /usr
</code>   

<p>Maybe it would have worked if I had done it as one command? Maybe not. Solaris was finicky in those days.</p>

<p>As soon as I did: <code>mv /usr /usr.org</code>, all hell broke loose.</p>

<p>This is because all the important stuff that made Solaris work was dynamically linked to libraries buried in /usr.</p>

<p>So, the (new) website was non-responsive. Basic commands like <code>ls</code> were non-responsive.</p>

<p>I had to quickly boot the machine into maintenance mode off of a number of floppies and restore <code>/usr</code>. Thus, was my first lesson in website downtime and not mucking around in production.</p>

 Somebody Get Me a Master Boot Record 

<p>In ancient times, people recognized that some parts of the world were best left alone. These places were described as “forbidden”, “haunted”, or “possessed” and rumored to be the domains of unseen spirits and mystical powers. Legends would tell of places where visitors would lose a sense of time, places that would slowly make people sick. I have spent a lot of time in some of those places. We know them today as “datacenters”</p>

<p>A data center is a building that is optimized for the comfort of computers and this makes for an environment that isn’t ideal for humans. Data centers are large, cavernous rooms, filled with row after row after row of computers. In most data centers, the rows will alternate between “cold” and “hot”. The computers face the cold rows and exhaust the air into the heated rows. It’s easy to lose track of time when inside a data center because they are lit only by artificial light. Also, because the temperature difference between the cold and hot rows can be so extreme, you can start to feel unwell if you keep moving between 70ºF and 90ºF every few minutes.</p>

<p>My story begins after I had been inside one of these timeless, sickening places. I had been spending several hours performing maintenance on some critical servers. The work I was doing was the critical, yet dull and forgettable kind of system maintenance work that everyone must do from time to time. It was dull enough that I don’t even remember precisely what I was doing. What I do remember is that at one point. I made a critical mistake. Instead of typing:</p>

   <code>dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdd
</code>   
<p>I had typed this instead:</p>

   <code>dd if=/dev/sdd of=/dev/sda
</code>   

<p>Did the mistake pop right out at you? It didn’t to me either. Not until a few seconds later when I was filled with a sharp sense of dread. Instead of making a backup of the boot drive (<code>/dev/sda</code>) to the backup drive (<code>/dev/sdd</code>) I had instead started copying the backup drive to the boot drive. I had canceled the operation fast enough that I knew that the data was still there. But the computer wouldn’t boot because I had overwritten the boot sector. I tried rebooting the machine to check. It didn’t boot. I started to panic. What was I going to do? Would I need to copy the entire hard drive somewhere else to recover the files? Where would I find a drive big enough to do that? How long would that take? I was already exhausted and unlikely to be able to spend several more hours working on the problem. Then it struck me: All of the servers started from the same image, so they all likely had the same boot sector.  All that I would have to do, in theory, would be to copy the boot sector from one machine to the one I had erased. After making some hasty calculations about how many bytes I’d need to copy, I once again used <code>dd</code> (very very carefully) to copy the boot sector of one computer to an external drive, then I used that external drive to copy the boot sector onto the computer that wouldn’t boot. I tried it, rebooted the machine, and waited anxiously. The computer booted just fine. I was free to return to the land of the living this time around.</p>

 Subversion is Maven Me Crazy! 

<p>About 10 years ago, I was performing a release on the Apache Maven Indexer project and I deleted the project. There was an issue with the release, so I rolled it back, in doing so I deleted the remote SVN directories. Don’t worry it’s source control, I could revert the change and push it back up. The problem with this is it would take a long time to copy from my computer. Luckily someone shared some “SVN-fu” with me, and I was able to restore the code with a remote copy within a few seconds.  I felt like a fool, but I learned a ton about Subversion that day, so it was a fair trade.</p>

  <p>The CEO of Australia's national science agency knows that innovation is the key to a post-pandemic future. COVID-19 accelerated&nbsp; digital business and transformed working habits.</p>
<p>“Australia has been at least 10 years behind the U.S. in digital,” said Dr. Larry Marshall, Chief Executive of CSIRO, <a href="https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2020/business-must-reinvent--not-just-recover.html">in a recent article</a>, “but I would argue that because of COVID, Australia has accelerated at least five years in the last five months.”</p>
<p>Despite the challenging environment, many organizations are capitalizing on changes made during COVID-19 to<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/"> reset long-held habits</a>, chase new opportunities or redesign their businesses.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>The 2020 Gartner CEO Survey showed that CEO priorities shifted this year due to the current climate, but<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ceos-look-for-growth-opportunities-in-2019-ceo-survey/"> growth remains at the top</a>. Technology is now seen as one of the key levers that CEOs will use to recover and grow in 2021.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scale up the digital mainstream, but don’t push experimental extremes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The majority of CEOs are expecting revenue levels to recover in 2021 or 2022,” said<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18594"> Mark Raskino</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst and Gartner Fellow, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/apac/symposium-australia/">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>“Even if demand for some products or services has risen as a result of the crisis, it’s often not the kind of growth that’s needed for stability, to reinvest or to give people raises. CEOs want to restore growth that delivers a good profit margin,” Raskino said.</p>
<p>CIOs can help their CEOs achieve their top priority in three ways.</p>
 No. 1: Accelerate smoothly 
<p>The Gartner CEO Survey found that the crisis has led 65% of CEOs to focus more on accelerating digital business transformation. However, they no longer aspire to be digital pioneers. Instead, they will focus on mainstream digital initiatives like e-commerce, e-service, digital payments and digital working.</p>
<p>“Scale up the digital mainstream, but don’t push experimental extremes,” said Raskino.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cios-ask-3-questions-before-updating-strategy-post-pandemic/"> CIO strategy</a> must also exploit factors that can<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/"> accelerate digital</a> business, including greater customer acceptance of digital, the pool of available dislodged talent; and more amenable workforces that are flexible to change.</p>
 No. 2: Nurture people 
<p>Keeping, developing and retaining the workforce is a top priority for 58% of surveyed CEOs to enable a strong recovery. CIOs must introduce agile learning into their organizations and invest time and resources in allowing people to grow.</p>
<p>CIOs should also empathetically help executive team colleagues to deliver on CEO demands. That means supporting:</p>
 
 The CFO by timing technology spend to aid cash flow 
 The COO with technology to improve productivity 
 The CHRO to develop a digitally savvy workforce 
 The CMO to execute technology-driven marketing campaigns 
 
 No. 3: Rebuild better 
<p>Sixty-four percent of CEOs surveyed will use the pandemic as an opportunity to redesign the business. CIOs need to know which path their CEO is on — restore or redesign — and ensure the IT strategy supports the new vision.</p>

<p>Enterprises across the globe have been trying to minimize and remove passwords for years. Security is an obvious reason why, as attacks featuring lost or stolen credentials account for<a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/2020/results-and-analysis/"> 80% of breaches</a>. Productivity also is a factor, since the amount of time your employees spend each year entering, resetting and keeping track of passwords wastes time and drains resources.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite such valid concerns, for many companies getting rid of passwords has been more a stretch goal than a reality—but that’s about to change. Passwordless adoption no longer requires a significant hardware investment to get started, with advancements in multi-factor authentication (MFA) device-level biometrics like facial and fingerprint recognition providing alternatives to passwords. And many employees who are familiar with these technologies outside of work are aware of their speed and ease-of-use benefits, and therefore are more receptive to using them in the workplace.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>WebSockets is a technology for communicating between the client and the server in a web application, where an open socket creates a persistent connection between the client and the server. This method of communication works outside of the HTTP request/response paradigm that has existed since the earliest days of the internet. Since sockets don’t use HTTP they can eliminate the overhead that comes with HTTP for low latency communications.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a small chat room web application that will keep track of the users in the room and send messages using WebSockets. For the server, you will use Express on Node.js. Node.js is an event-driven JavaScript runtime that has made JavaScript one of the most popular back end languages. Express is the most popular web framework for Node.js. You will also learn how to set up Okta for authentication. To authenticate the socket communication, you will issue a JSON Web Token (JWT) to the client, and validate it when the client attempts to open the socket.</p>

 Create Your Okta App 

<p>To use Okta for authentication, you will first need to set up a new application. (You will need a free <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer account</a> if you don’t already have one.) Head to the Okta Developer Console and select Applications then Add Application. On the next page, select Web and click Next. On the Application Settings page, give your application a meaningful name. I called my SocketDemo. For this application, you can leave everything else the same, as you will use port 8080 in your application. Click Done and you will be redirected to the settings page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make note of your Client ID and your Client Secret, since you will need this in your application.</p>

 Create Your Node.js Application 

<p>Start by opening your favorite IDE and use the command <code>mkdir</code> to create a folder for your project. Navigate to that folder and enter the command <code>npm init</code>. You will need to walk through the instructions that follow. Next, you will want to install your dependencies.</p>

<p>First, you will need Okta’s Node.js SDK and the OIDC middleware. These two packages make integrating Okta’s authentication into your application simple. It’s easy to configure the middleware, but you will do that later. For now, install the packages with the following commands.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/oidc-middleware@4.0.1
npm i @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@4.1.0
</code>   

<p>Next, install <code>dotenv</code>, which will store and retrieve sensitive configuration without pushing this information to your source code repository.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to install Express.</p>

   <code>npm i express@4.17.1
</code>   

<p>You will also need <code>express-session</code> to help manage your session state.</p>

   <code>npm i express-session@1.17.1
</code>   

<p>Next, install <code>jsonwebtoken</code> to help create JWTs that you will issue to your client.</p>

   <code>npm i jsonwebtoken@8.5.1
</code>   

<p>To manage the sockets, you will use <code>socket.io</code>. For validating the JWT in your socket management, you will use <code>socketio-jwt</code>. You will see later how these two connect to authenticate your socket requests.</p>

   <code>npm i socket.io@2.3.0
npm i socketio-jwt@4.6.2
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will need <code>pug</code>. Pug is a view engine that was previously known as Jade.</p>

   <code>npm i pug@3.0.0
</code>   

<p>Once you are all set up, add a new file to your root directory called <code>.env</code>. Add the following code to it. You can change your <code>JWT_TOKEN_KEY</code> to something more fitting if you wish.</p>

   <code>OKTA_BASE_URL={yourOktaUrl}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
APP_BASE_PORT=8080
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
JWT_TOKEN_KEY=someverylongandveryrandomandverysecretkey
</code>   

 Write Your Server Code 

<p>Now you are ready to begin writing your server-side code. First, add a file to your root called <code>index.js</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

require( "dotenv" ).config();

const server = require( "./server" );

const port = process.env.APP_BASE_PORT;

server.start( {
  port: port
} ).then( app =&gt; {
  console.log( "Application is now running on port " + port );
} );
</code>   

<p>This file serves as your entry point for the application. It starts the server by listening to the port defined in your <code>.env</code> file. It also calls the <code>config()</code> function on <code>dotenv</code>, which should be called as early as possible in your application.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>rooms.js</code>.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

module.exports = function () {
  let rooms = [];

  rooms.push( {
    name: "General",
    users: []
  } );

  rooms.push( {
    name: "Sports",
    users: []
  } );

  rooms.push( {
    name: "Music",
    users: []
  } );

  return rooms;
};
</code>   

<p>This file is just in-memory storage for your chatrooms. In a production application, you would want to connect this to some sort of persistent storage but this solution works fine for this demo. You start by providing three default rooms—General, Sports, and Music. Each room consists of a name and a list of users. The lists are empty when the application first starts but they will be populated as users visit each room. You could also keep a list of messages here so that new users could view the history.</p>

<p>Next, you can define your routes. Create a new file called <code>routes.js</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

module.exports = function ( app, opts ) {

  function ensureAuthenticated ( request, response, next ) {
    if ( !request.userContext ) {
      return response.status( 401 ).redirect( "/account/login" );
    }

    next();
  }

  app.get( "", ( request, response, next ) =&gt; {
    return response.render( "home" );
  } );

  app.get( "/dashboard", ensureAuthenticated, ( request, response, next ) =&gt; {
    return response.render( "dashboard", {
      user: request.userContext.userinfo,
      rooms: opts.rooms
    } );
  } );

  app.get( "/chat/:room", ensureAuthenticated, ( request, response, next ) =&gt; {
    return response.render( "room", {
      jwt: opts.jwt.sign( { user: request.userContext.userinfo, room: request.params.room }, process.env.JWT_TOKEN_KEY ),
      room: opts.rooms.filter( ( r ) =&gt; r.name == request.params.room )[0]
    } );
  } );

  app.get( "/account/logout", ensureAuthenticated, ( request, response, next ) =&gt; {
    request.logout();
    response.redirect( "/" );
  } );

  app.get( "/account/login", ( request, response, next ) =&gt; {
    return response.render( "home" );
  } );
};
</code>   

<p>As you can see we are defining a few routes here. First is the home page, second is the Dashboard page which will be the landing page for authenticated users. To ensure a user is authenticated you add the <code>ensureAuthenticated</code> middleware function to the route. This function is defined above and simply returns a 401 for unauthenticated users and redirects them to the login page. The chat route looks for a route parameter called <code>room</code>. This means a user who navigates to <code>~/chat/General</code> will land in the general chat room. This route also creates a JWT and passes it to the client, using the <code>jsonwebtoken</code> object that was injected into the routes. There is also a logout route for logging out. (The login route will be configured using Okta in the server setup later.)</p>

<p>Next, you need to set up your <code>socket.js</code> file to handle the socket communications. Create the file in your root and add the following code.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

const socketioJwt = require( "socketio-jwt" );

module.exports = function ( io, opts ) {

  io.sockets.on( "connection", socketioJwt.authorize( {
    secret: process.env.JWT_TOKEN_KEY,
    timeout: 15000 // 15 seconds to send the authentication message
  } ) ).on( "authenticated", function ( socket ) {
    socket.on( "entered", () =&gt; {

      let user = socket.decoded_token.user.name;
      let room = socket.decoded_token.room;

      opts.rooms.filter( ( r ) =&gt; r.name === room )[0].users.push( user );
      socket.join( room );

      io.to( room ).emit( "user entered", user );
    } );

    socket.on( "message sent", ( message ) =&gt; {
      let user = socket.decoded_token.user.name;
      let room = socket.decoded_token.room;

      io.to( room ).emit( "message received", user, message );
    } );

    socket.on( "disconnect", () =&gt; {
      let user = socket.decoded_token.user.name;
      let room = socket.decoded_token.room;

      opts.rooms.filter( ( r ) =&gt; r.name === room )[0].users.splice( user, 1 );

      io.to( room ).emit( "user exited", user );
    } );

    let users = [];

    users.push( {
      user: "test"
    } );

    socket.emit( "welcome", users );

  } );

};
</code>   

<p>Here you are using <code>socketio-jwt</code> to decode the JWT you passed to the client when the user enters the room. A JWT is a token whose payload holds some information representing claims to be sent to the server. The JWT can be signed or encrypted and then validated by the server to ensure their validity. Once established, the server can read the claims from the token and decide the proper course of action. You can send the JWT with the request to the server to ensure the sender of the request is authorized to perform the requested action.</p>

<p>(Note, you can read more about <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/07/17/secure-node-api-with-koa">an alternative approach using Okta as an authentication server a</a>, where you authenticate the user when they reach a room.)</p>

<p>The <code>socket.js</code> file also has the logic for receiving and sending messages as well as handling users entering and leaving the room. When a user enters or leaves, you add or remove them from the room’s user list and broadcast to the room that the user has left. The client side is responsible for displaying that information to the user.</p>

<p>Finally, to tie it all together you need to add a <code>server.js</code> file.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

const express = require( "express" );
const bodyParser = require( "body-parser" );
const path = require( "path" );

const ExpressOIDC = require( "@okta/oidc-middleware" ).ExpressOIDC;
const session = require( "express-session" );
let jwt = require( "jsonwebtoken" );

const routes = require( "./routes" );
const sockets = require( "./socket" );

const start = function ( options ) {
  return new Promise( function ( resolve, reject ) {
    process.on( "unhandledRejection", ( reason, p ) =&gt; {
      console.log( "Unhandled Rejection at: Promise", p, "reason:", reason );
    } );

    if ( !options.port ) {
      reject( new Error( "no port specificed" ) );
    }

    const app = express();
    const http = require( "http" ).createServer( app );
    const io = require( "socket.io" )( http );

    var rooms = [];

    app.use( express.static( "public" ) );
    app.set( "views", path.join( __dirname, "/public/views" ) );
    app.set( "view engine", "pug" );

    app.use( bodyParser.urlencoded( { extended: false } ) );

    app.use( function ( error, request, response, next ) {
      console.log( error );
      reject( new Error( "something went wrong" + error ) );
      response.status( 500 ).send( "something went wrong" );
    } );

    const oidc = new ExpressOIDC( {
      issuer: process.env.OKTA_BASE_URL + "/oauth2/default",
      client_id: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET,
      appBaseUrl: process.env.APP_BASE_URL,
      scope: "openid profile",
      routes: {
        login: {
          path: "/users/login",
        },
        callback: {
          path: "/authorization-code/callback",
        },
        loginCallback: {
          afterCallback: "/dashboard",
        },
      },
    } );

    app.use(
      session( {
        secret:
          "asd;skdvmfebvoswmvlkmes';lvmsdlfbvmsbvoibvms'dplvmdmaspviresmpvmrae';vm'psdemr",
        resave: true,
        saveUninitialized: false,
      } )
    );

    app.use( oidc.router );

    var rooms = require( "./rooms" )();

    routes( app, {
      rooms: rooms,
      jwt: jwt
    } );

    sockets( io, {
      rooms: rooms
    } );

    const server = http.listen( options.port, function () {
      resolve( server );
    } );
  } );
};

module.exports = Object.assign( {}, { start } );
</code>   

<p>This file does a lot of the legwork getting the application set up. When the server is started, it registers your various middleware and dependencies. This includes the Okta middleware, which uses the variables in your <code>.env</code> file. It will register the route <code>/users/login</code> as the login page.

</code>   

<p>You are importing Bootstrap because it is nice and easy to work with. There’s a login button that checks the view model for a <code>user</code> object. That object is populated on the server and passed to the view. If it doesn’t exist then the user is shown the login button.</p>

<p>Next, you can provide a landing page for your users. Add a new file to the <code>views</code> folder called <code>home.pug</code>.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Chat about Things'

block content

    p Hey there, in order to access this page, please
      a(href="/users/login") log in here.
</code>   

<p>Next, add a page called <code>dashboard.pug</code> to the <code>views</code> folder for authenticated users. This page will display a list of available rooms to the users.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Let's chat about something'

block content
  .row
    .col-lg-3
      h3 Chat Rooms
      ul.list-group
        each room, i in rooms
          li.list-group-item
            a(href="chat/"+room.name ) #{room.name}
    .col-lg-9
      .jumbotron
        h1 Join a chat room
        p.lead You can check out our chat rooms on the left
</code>   

<p>Finally, add your <code>room.pug</code> file to the <code>views</code> folder. This page will have the chat room itself along with any JavaScript you need.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Chat'

block content
  .row
    .col-lg-3
        h3 Users
        ul#users-list.list-group
          each user, i in room.users
            li.list-group-item #{user}
    .col-lg-9
        .row
            .col-lg-12
                table#chat-table.table.table-bordered
        .row
            .col-lg-10
                input#chat-message(type=text placeholder="enter a message").form-control
            .col-lg-2
                button#chat-button.btn.btn-primary Send


  script(src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.3.0/socket.io.js")
  script(src="..\\js\\room.js")
  script.
    start('!{jwt}')
</code>   

<p>You are using two JavaScript scripts on this page. The first is the <code>socket.io</code> client library. The second is a file named <code>room.js</code>. Add <code>room.js</code> to <code>public/js</code> and insert the following code.</p>

   <code>const socket = io.connect( window.location.origin );

function start( jwt ) {

  socket.on( "connect", () =&gt; {
    socket
      .emit( "authenticate", { token: jwt } ) //send the jwt
      .on( "authenticated", () =&gt; {

        socket.on( "user entered", ( user ) =&gt; {
          $( "#chat-table" ).append(
            "&lt;tr class=\"bg-info\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;" + user + " has entered the chat room. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"
          );

          let li = "&lt;li class=\"list-group-item\"&gt; " + user + " &lt;/li&gt;";
          $( "#users-list" ).append( li );

        } );

        socket.on( "user exited", ( user ) =&gt; {
          $( "#chat-table" ).append(
            "&lt;tr class=\"bg-warning\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;" + user + " has left the chat room. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"
          );

          $( "#users-list &gt; li:contains(\"" + user + "\")" )[0].remove();
        } );

        socket.on( "message received", ( user, message ) =&gt; {
          $( "#chat-table" ).append(
            "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"width:20%\"&gt;" + user + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;" + message + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"
          );
        } );

        $( "#chat-button" ).on( "click", function () {
          let message = $( "#chat-message" ).val();
          socket.emit( "message sent", message );
          $( "#chat-message" ).val( "" );
        } );

        window.onunload = window.onbeforeunload = () =&gt; {
          socket.close();
        };

        socket.emit( "entered" );
      } )
      .on( "unauthorized", ( msg ) =&gt; {
        console.log( `unauthorized: ${ JSON.stringify( msg.data ) }` );
        throw new Error( msg.data.type );
      } );
  } );
}
</code>   

<p>This file manages all the user connections and messages between clients. When a remote client performs an action in the room, it’s broadcast to each other client. <code>socket.on</code> will take care of these messages and manipulate the client in whatever way you see fit. When you want the server to be made aware of an action this client took, you use <code>socket.emit</code> to broadcast the message back to the server. Of course, right when the page loads, you are authenticating the user with the JWT you supplied earlier. This ensures the socket communication is secure.</p>

 Test Your Application 

<p>Your application is complete and ready for the first test. Use the command <code>node index.js</code> to start your server and navigate to localhost:8080 to see your home page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log in using Okta and navigate to a room of your choice. You can open another instance of the browser and log in to see your second user enter the chat room. You can send messages back and forth and see how each room will handle them.</p>

<p></p>

 Summary 

<p>WebSockets provide exciting new opportunities for web applications by bucking the age old request/response paradigm. But with this new technology, developers need to continue practicing secure coding techniques. By combining JWT with Okta’s secure and easy single sign-on ecosystem, you can ensure the safety of your users without inflating your development time.</p>

<p>We will not return to pre-COVID ways of working</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Empty office space is a stark example of the long-term impact that COVID-19 will have on workplaces globally, said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/38244/Gavin-Tay">Gavin Tay</a>, Gartner VP, Analyst during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/apac/symposium-australia">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“We will not return to pre-COVID ways of working,” said Tay. “CIOs need to decide what the future digital workplace will look like and ensure that their organization has the technology foundation to support it.”</p>
<p>The future of work demands our attention in three interconnected areas.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-trends-on-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-the-digital-workplace-2020/">6 Trends on the Gartner Hype Cycle for the Digital Workplace, 2020</a></p>
 The hyperautomation of routine work 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021/">Hyperautomation</a> is the idea that any processes that can be automated should be automated.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has accelerated the notion of using algorithms or "<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/robobosses-enhance-management-capabilities/">robobosses</a>" to automate management activities including task assignment, collecting feedback determining performance ratings. Gartner predicts that 69% of what a manager currently does will be fully automated by 2024.</p>
<p>Ride-sharing platforms like Uber, Grab and DiDi already allocate tasks to drivers and collect customer ratings to measure performance, automatically determining rewards or sanctions if required.</p>
<p>“In the future only two sets of tasks will remain for managers: Strategy setting, which requires creativity; and advanced team management, which requires social skills,” said Tay.</p>
<p>Unilever has been<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/25/unilever-saves-on-recruiters-by-using-ai-to-assess-job-interviews"> hiring entry-level employees using artificial intelligence</a> (AI) to analyze responses to preset interview questions using keywords and body language, saving more than 100,000 hours of interviewing time and roughly $1 million in recruitment costs.</p>
 Digital dexterity becomes critical 
<p>Many employees prefer to use familiar tools like email. They know how to create documents using an office suite of tools and store them on their local drive. New systems cause them stress, so they often end up using old tools to solve new problems.</p>
<p>Continuous technology change leaves workers no time to learn new systems. AI can help to bridge the digital dexterity gap with just-in-time learning on the job.</p>
<p>In 2015,<a href="http://www.hitachi.com/rev/archive/2016/r2016_06/pdf/r2016_06_106.pdf"> Hitachi introduced AI in its warehouse operations</a> to guide workers and aid continuous personal improvement, a concept known as "<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/kaizen">kaizen</a>" in Japan.</p>
<p>“If you understand how employees like to learn, you can reduce stress and increase productivity, which has a direct impact on corporate revenue,” said Tay.</p>
<p>Read more:<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-ways-cios-can-foster-digital-dexterity-infographic/"> 4 Ways CIOs Can Foster Digital Dexterity</a></p>
 The on-demand workforce becomes the norm 
<p>Circumstances have made remote work a basic requirement for almost all organizations, whether they planned to embrace it or not. In the future of work, CIOs will need to consider how technology can sustain a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/master-a-distributed-workforce-for-digital-transformation/">distributed workforce</a> model that reaches beyond the restrictions of a traditional office environment and may be dispersed across geographies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaders must be prepared to change hard-wired processes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of taking weeks or months to find the right skills, organizations will need the ability to dynamically assemble teams at short notice, matching tasks with the required knowledge, experience, skills and competencies. Samsung, for example, piloted the use of online freelancing platforms to assemble project teams in as little as two days.</p>
<p>“An on-demand workforce will become the norm,” said Tay. “Leaders must be prepared to change hard-wired processes to derive maximum value.”</p>

  <p>Earlier in 2020, the European Union published “A European Strategy for Data” outlining its vision for a connected single digital market where the benefits of the digital economy could enhance the lives of its citizens, residents and trade partners.</p>
<p>However, we now find ourselves at a very real crossroad. A post-pandemic world will be a new type of normal. Amidst the tragic loss of lives there have been breakthroughs in science, new ways of working along with embracing new digital tools.</p>
<p>We are at the beginning of a new design and architectural phase where just because technology can, doesn’t mean it should. Personal data linked to identity, fuelled by AI sits at the centre of these decisions.</p>
<p>Enabling citizens, students, patients, passengers and consumers to more equitably join the value chains fuelled by data will ultimately lead to greater trust and personalisation, resulting in a more prosperous society. However, this will require new commercial models, enforceable regulation and the digital tools to transform our connected society.</p>
<p>This session will focus on the implementation of real-world case studies including standards, commercial models and technology choices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_21_dow"></a>

<p>At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Province of New Brunswick in Canada needed to enable digital access to COVID-19 test results. Simeio, working with New Brunswick’s Provincial healthcare arm MyHealthNB delivered a digital identity solution. This enabled secure access which was validated against authoritative data sources to proof identity. This also allowed New Brunswick citizens to stay safe and practice social distancing by obtaining results securely and confidentially. <br> <br> COVID-19 has driven healthcare organizations to enable virtual support and digital tools in a short window. For the foreseeable future in a world of physical distancing, the need for digital services will drastically increase. Digital Identity is at the core of enabling this shift as it facilitates secure access.</p>




<p>Healthcare organizations are the most vulnerable from a modernization perspective due to years of lack of investment and focus. The COVID-19 pandemic has put added strain for hospital organizations to modernize and shift their mode of delivery to virtual care. This session will speak about a use-case that highlights challenges a Canadian Province faced and what tools and solutions were developed to deliver expedited access the COVID-19 test results in 18 days.</p>
<p><br> Participants will learn:<br> 1. How COVID-19 has driven healthcare organizations to enable virtual support and digital tools <br> 2. How the Province of New Brunswick in Canada enabled digital access to COVID-19 test results<br> 3. How Simeio worked with the Province to deliver a digital identity solution which deployed secure access to COVID-19 results in 18 days</p>

   The Role of KYC for CIAM and Where Learning From KYC Will Help You in Getting Better in CIAM 
<p><br>Many solutions in CIAM focus on authentication, while others have their strengths in integrating with marketing automation. However, there is an additional angle, relevant for both highly regulated industries but also any other industries. It is the onboarding process, regardless of whether specific KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements must be formally met or not.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger will talk about the role and approaches of Identity Verification in the context of CIAM and how this maps to the entire onboarding process as well as recurring authentication. He will look at new technologies such as DID (Decentralized Identity), but also discuss how registration can be simplified if lesser requirements apply – e.g. by rethinking the flow and putting registration and verification to the end (or even further back – think about using the first successful shipping as part of verification).</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_21_kuppinger"></a>

   A Flexible, Adaptable Architecture Framework to Meet the Accelerating Demands of a Digital Enterprise 
<p>Consumer identity and access management (CIAM) has arrived in the business processes of digital enterprises. Customers, prospects, devices, things and their relationships are becoming increasingly important. At the same time, the innovation cycles for customer-oriented applications are becoming shorter and shorter. And CIAM itself is facing continuously changing challenges.</p>
<p>The service-oriented paradigm of the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric provides the perfect foundation for a steady evolution. This applies both to the CIAM system itself and to CIAM as a building block of a company-wide identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>Thus the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric serves as the umbrella for an entire IAM architecture. It supports distinctive features for CIAM where required, while ensuring efficiency and reuse wherever possible.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_22_reinwarth"></a>

 The GiD Report#132 — Facebook antitrust, the fight against end-to-end encryption, and crypto goes mainstream <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-131-filecoins-launch-what-the-original-iphone-teaches-us-about-innovation-a29d7bbe3584">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p>  Facebook antitrust lawsuit&nbsp;incoming  The fight against end-to-end encryption  Crypto goes mainstream in&nbsp;2020  Stuff happens   1. Hot on the heels of the Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google, state and federal investigators are now setting their sights on Facebook. <p>The Washington Post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/23/facebook-ftc-states-lawsuit/">reports</a>:</p><blockquote>State and federal investigators are expected to file antitrust charges against Facebook as soon as November, according to four people familiar with the matter, embarking on a massive legal challenge against the tech giant and its perceived ironclad grip over social&nbsp;media.</blockquote><blockquote>The timing reflects a frenzy of recent activity on the part of the Federal Trade Commission, which met privately Thursday to discuss the probe, and state attorneys general, who under the leadership of New York’s Letitia James have been scrutinizing Facebook for potential threats to competition, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a law-enforcement matter.</blockquote><p>Some context:</p><blockquote>Federal officials initiated their antitrust probe into Facebook last year after the company agreed to pay $5 billion to settle a government probe over a series of privacy scandals. The FTC, one of the country’s two competition enforcement agencies, specifically set its sights on Facebook’s purchase of its past rivals — Instagram, a photo-sharing app, and WhatsApp, a messenger service — and the extent to which the tech giant’s sprawling corporate footprint has come to violate antitrust laws.</blockquote><blockquote>State investigators revealed their own plans last October: James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, said at the time she would lead 46 other states and territories in a bipartisan, wide-ranging antitrust inquiry targeting Facebook. James said in a statement then that state enforcers had grown “concerned that Facebook may have put consumer data at risk, reduced the quality of consumers’ choices, and increased the price of advertising.”</blockquote><blockquote>Since then, Facebook has faced a slew of criticism from regulators nationwide who believe it brazenly has sought to expand its digital empire in a way that undermines competition and leaves its billions of users with worse service, including fewer privacy protections. A probe conducted by House lawmakers, concluded earlier this month, appeared to furnish fresh evidence of the company’s brass-knuckled tactics — illustrating for members of Congress the extent to which Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had sought to neuter potential rivals before they could mount a serious challenge.</blockquote><p>In our current divisive political landscape, Big Tech is becoming bipartisan low hanging fruit, <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201023&amp;instance_id=23425&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=42074&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fe82c0355-0059-55c1-8125-cef5ea7c4ef8&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">per the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/business/us-economy-coronavirus/reactions-to-google-news-what-business-leaders-policymakers-and-antitrust-experts-are-saying?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201026">applauded the Justice Department’s lawsuit</a> this week accusing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201026">Google of illegally protecting its monopoly</a> over search and search advertising.

The Markup has a plan (and a browser) to wrap its arms around&nbsp;it</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/pstav">/paul</a>— <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-instagram-eu-investigation-allegedly-exposed-data-underage-users-2020-10?utm_source=reddit.com">The EU is investigating Instagram for allegedly exposing the contact data of up to 5 million underage&nbsp;users</a>   2. Big Tech has gotten so big and powerful and has swallowed up so many rivals and upstarts that we’re going to need some government action to help ensure a more competitive and innovative digital landscape. But it’s also not the type of thing we can completely rely on the government for. <p>For one, the solutions aren’t very obvious and getting to any sort of constructive outcome will be a long, embattled process.</p><p>Then we have to consider why governments are ticked off at Big Tech in the first place. On the one hand, there are good intentions. We want to ensure fair competition and marketplaces and we want to create an environment that fosters real innovation.</p><p>On the other hand, this is also a question of power and who wields it. Because in some ways, it’s about Big Tech stepping on Big Government’s toes.</p><p>We’re seeing this kind of dynamic play out in the government’s fight against end-to-end encryption.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">the EFF</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/ctomc">/ctomc</a>):</p><blockquote>The last few months have seen a steady stream of proposals, encouraged by the advocacy of the FBI and Department of Justice, to provide “lawful access” to end-to-end encrypted services in the United States. Now lobbying has moved from the U.S., where Congress has been largely paralyzed by the nation’s polarization problems, to the European Union — where advocates for anti-encryption laws hope to have a smoother ride. A series of leaked documents from the EU’s highest institutions show a blueprint for how they intend to make that happen, with the apparent intention of presenting anti-encryption law to the European Parliament within the next&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>The public signs of this shift in the EU — which until now has been largely supportive toward privacy-protecting technologies like end-to-end encryption — began in June with a speech by Ylva Johansson, the EU’s Commissioner for Home&nbsp;Affairs.</blockquote><blockquote>Speaking at a webinar on “Preventing and combating child sexual abuse [and] exploitation”, Johansson called for a “technical solution” to what she described as the “problem” of encryption, and announced that her office had initiated “a special group of experts from academia, government, civil society and business to find ways of detecting and reporting encrypted child sexual abuse material.”</blockquote><p>Which goes back to the problem of there being no obvious solutions — since much of the discussion around a “technical solution” essentially amounts to a backdoor.</p><p>(There have been some more creative solutions discussed during our open mic sessions such as the inclusion of bots in certain Group&nbsp;chats.)</p><p>But this is generally the classic type of situation that we already see in the world of money laundering and terrorist funding — whereby efforts to tackle really bad problems end up hurting the general populace (in this case, sacrificing their right to privacy on mainstream platforms) while doing little to catch the bad guys (who will find alternative solutions anyway).</p> 3. The public narratives about Bitcoin went mainstream this year (in a positive&nbsp;way) JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Photo:&nbsp;Fortune<p>Now just to be clear, this isn’t really the type of place where we talk about crypto prices and whether they’re going up or down. There’s plenty of outlets for that elsewhere.</p><p>The main point here is how the narratives have truly shifted in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Wall Street’s biggest banks have been long term skeptics of cryptocurrency with JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon a notable naysayer not many years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Here’s JPMorgan — one of Wall Street’s premier institutions — <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-gold-millennials-jpmorgan-price">now</a>:</p><blockquote>Writing to clients in “Flows &amp; Liquidity,” one of JPMorgan’s flagship publications, the authors said that characterizing bitcoin as a “risk” asset rather than a “safe” asset is “more appropriate” based on the leading cryptocurrency’s increased positive correlation with the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index since&nbsp;March.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoin’s function as a risk asset is “likely more of a reflection of a need for an ‘alternative’ currency rather than a need for a ‘safe’ asset or ‘hedge’.”</blockquote><blockquote>“To some extent, this is also true with gold,” the authors add, although the yellow metal’s volatility is notably lower than bitcoin’s.</blockquote><blockquote>How investors currently perceive bitcoin’s value implies that it could “compete more intensely” with gold as an “alternative” currency over the coming years, the analysts wrote. Bitcoin’s role as a gold competitor is amplified by millennial investors’ interest in cryptocurrency, according to the note, and the inevitability of the younger investor demographic becoming “over time a more important component” of the investor universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoin’s market capitalization would have to increase by a factor of 10 before it could match the total private sector investment in gold, the author’s note, adding that “even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from&nbsp;here.”</blockquote><blockquote>“In other words, the potential long-term upside for bitcoin is considerable.”</blockquote><p>So yeah, the tune has&nbsp;changed.</p><p>And unlike gold, this is something young people are excited about. It’s not just about Bitcoin. It’s about what it represents and the innovative potential of the blockchain space at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Young people are particularly attuned to the concept that our lives will become increasingly digital and crypto is really the next step in that evolution in terms of digital value. (The same could be said about digital identity, self-sovereign identity, and digital&nbsp;trust.)</p><p>In any case, another company pledges to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/uk-listed-firm-mode-putting-10-of-cash-reserves-into-bitcoin">hold a portion of its cash reserves in&nbsp;crypto</a>:</p><blockquote>In a press release on Wednesday, the fintech group said it will convert up to 10% of its cash reserves into the cryptocurrency as part of a long-term strategy to “protect investors’ assets from currency debasement.”</blockquote><blockquote>With interest rates in the U.K. at a record low of 0.1%, Mode said it would also seek to diversify away from low-interest money market instruments to maximize the value of returns from its recent initial public offering.</blockquote><blockquote>“Faced with the challenges of COVID-19 and with U.K. interest rates at the lowest level in the Bank of England’s 326-year history, our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin has only increased,” said Jonathan Rowland, Mode’s executive chairman.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency">PayPal Launches New Service Enabling Users to Buy, Hold and Sell Cryptocurrency</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-new-york-conditional-bitlicense-paxos-cryptocurrency">PayPal Embraces Crypto, Igniting Market as Mainstream Adoption Inches Closer — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/uk-listed-firm-mode-putting-10-of-cash-reserves-into-bitcoin">UK-Listed Firm Mode Putting Up to 10% of Cash Reserves Into Bitcoin — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fedtakes-cautious-approach-to-possibly-issuing-digital-currency-11603132490?mod=hp_lista_pos2">Fed Takes Cautious Approach to Possibly Issuing Digital&nbsp;Currency</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/new-bretton-woods">Does the IMF Want a New ‘Bretton Woods’ Moment? — CoinDesk</a>   4.

<p>Being able to use Ceramic directly from the convenience of your web browser is one of the core functionalities required to fulfill the vision of a permissionless dataweb. <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> enables this by providing a sandboxed IdentityWallet instance which users can authenticate to using any of their existing Ethereum wallets, and soon other Blockchain wallets as well. This tutorial will show you how to combine 3ID Connect with Ceramic in order to start building your app using dynamic, tamper resistant documents!</p> Using Ceramic on the&nbsp;web <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Typescript Ceramic implementation</a> provides two main ways to interact with the ceramic network, Ceramic Core and Ceramic http-client. The former implements the entire protocol and relies on a js-ipfs instance to be available, the latter relies on a Ceramic Daemon which you can run from your terminal. Both of these implementations consume a DID Provider which is used to communicate with a wallet with DID support (see <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP2844</a>). In the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Building on Clay tutorial</a> we described how to use the http client together with an instance of <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a>. This is good if you want to dive into fundamentals, but 3ID Connect enables us to connect to a DID directly from the comfort of your Ethereum wallet. This DID will also be linked together with the ethereum address using&nbsp;<a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>.</p><p>In this tutorial we will be using Ceramic Core, which means that we’re running the entire Ceramic protocol inside of the&nbsp;browser!</p> Setup 3ID Connect with&nbsp;Ceramic <p>First let’s install the needed packages. Currently the 3ID Connect version with Ceramic support is available using the next flag. In the example we will be using ceramic-core, but you can use ceramic-http-client as&nbsp;well.</p> $ npm install --save 3id-connect@next @ceramicnetwork/ceramic-core <p>Using 3ID Connect to authenticate to Ceramic is fairly straight forward once the basic flow is setup. In the example below we use an “injected ethereum provider” that’s available on window.ethereum. You can of course use any ethereum provider that you&nbsp;like.</p> import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'  const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()  // Usually the following three steps are taken when<br>// a user choose to connect their wallet<br>const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()<br>// Create 3id connect instance<br>const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])<br>await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)  // create a Ceramic instance<br>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-core'<br>import IPFS from 'ipfs'  const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()<br>const ipfs = await IPFS.create()<br>const ceramic = await Ceramic.create(ipfs, { didProvider })  Create documents in the&nbsp;browser <p>We can now start using Ceramic directly in the browser! Below are just some examples that you can also try out on the <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">Web Playground</a> which comes with 3ID Connect and Ceramic already set up. First, open the developer console and then click connect. The 3ID Connect modal will appear, and once approved, you will see “Connected with DID: did:3:&lt;yourDID&gt;” in the console. Once this appears, then you can run the below commands directly in the console. Note, if you’d like to reset the 3ID Connect iFrame state, clear application data for 3idconnect.org from localStorage.</p> const jsonSchema = {<br>  "type": "object",<br>  "$schema": "&lt;http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#&gt;",<br>  "required": [<br>    "title",<br>    "description"<br>  ],<br>  "properties": {<br>    "title": {<br>      "type": "string"<br>    },<br>    "description": {<br>      "type": "string"<br>    }<br>  },<br>  "additionalProperties": false<br>}  const doc1 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', { content: jsonSchema })  // This will throw an error because it's missing the "description":<br>const doc2 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', {<br>  metadata: { schema: doc1.id },<br>  content: { "title": "Client Document" }<br>})<br>// Uncaught Error: Validation Error: data should have <br>// required property 'description'  // We can create the document if we provide all required fields:<br>const doc3 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', {<br>  metadata: { schema: doc1.id },<br>  content: {<br>    title: "Client Document",<br>    description: "A Ceramic Document created from the browser."<br>  }<br>})  // Now we can of course also update the document:<br>await doc3.change({<br>  content: {<br>    title: 'Client Document',<br>    description: 'This document has now been updated from the browser'<br>  }<br>}) <p>That’s it for this tutorial!

			<p>At ForgeRock we take the security and protection of our customer’s personal data seriously. We know staying abreast of shifting <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">privacy </a>laws can be challenging, which is why we have a dedicated team of experts monitoring the landscape to ensure our services help you stay compliant.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>An area we continue to watch closely is the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling from July 16, 2020 regarding the transfer of personal data. As part of the ruling, the court confirmed that the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses (SCCs) remain a valid and lawful method for transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States and other countries. At the same time, it decided to invalidate the EU-US Privacy Shield framework.</p>

			<p>The Swiss data protection regulator has followed the CJEU’s ruling and deemed the Swiss-US Privacy Shield framework inadequate for protecting Swiss/US data transfers.&nbsp;</p>

			 What is the impact?&nbsp;&nbsp; 

			<p>For ForgeRock customers, none. The continued support of SCCs means there is no disruption to the way we do business with you.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>ForgeRock was never certified under the EU-US or Swiss-EU Privacy Shield frameworks. We have always relied on SCCs to safely and legally transfer customer’s personal data from the EU and Switzerland to our services.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>This means our customers can be assured that they may continue to use ForgeRock’s services by relying on the SCCs that are currently in our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/99022421/legal-document/ForgeRock%20Data%20Protection%20Addendum.pdf">Data Protection Addendum</a>.</p>

			 What are SCCs?&nbsp; 

			<p>The SCCs are a set of standard contractual terms providing sufficient safeguards for the protection of personal data of EU individuals, when transferred from Europe to the US and other countries.

 Ocean V3 Is Now&nbsp;Live  One Step Closer to an open Data&nbsp;Economy <p>Ocean Protocol was conceived in 2017 as a trustless, decentralized data and AI sharing service. We took all our learnings from four years in blockchain and melded the concepts of big data and AI to paint a vision of how a new Data Economy could arise if data could be shared freely, while protecting privacy and giving the data owners control. From 2017 until now, we worked tirelessly to realize the vision outlined in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/tech-whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> and adhere to the timelines and scope of the&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/roadmap">roadmap</a>.</p><p>Today, with the release of Ocean V3, we celebrate another milestone in the journey to give people back power and control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Ocean V3 is a core piece needed to unlock a new Data Economy. The logic and functionality for access control for Ocean V3 has been rebuilt from the ground up to simplify the on-boarding for Web3 natives, leverage the Ethereum network’s decentralized trust architecture, removing technical complexity inherent in a Proof-of-Authority network and integrate with state-of-the-art tooling for decentralized finance (#DeFi) that has appeared and matured during&nbsp;2020.</p><p>A core component of Ocean V3 is the datatoken. Datatokens are ERC20 tokens that represent both the value of the data asset and provide the access control to the data asset. We proposed the idea of a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-tokens-1-data-custody-1d0d5ae66d0c">datatoken in November 2019</a>, and since then we have made it the heart of Ocean V3 because it radically simplifies the user interaction for data sharing, while leveraging existing Web3 mental models for custody, wallets, liquidity, staking and&nbsp;farming.</p><p>With Ocean V3, we also introduce Ocean Market, an open data marketplace for the community. It is built on the foundation of datatokens. As a first example of Ocean V3’s composability, Ocean Market directly leverages Balancer DEX technology for staking, automatic pricing of data, and data curation.</p><p>Leading up to Ocean V3, we explained various relevant concepts:</p>  the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/should-product-market-fit-come-before-tokens-6c542a75c8dc">interplay</a> between product/market fit and&nbsp;tokens,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">verification</a> of token models using Token Engineering concepts,  impetus for the Ocean <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-swap-completed-new-contract-live-f0768423b3e1">token&nbsp;swap</a>,  the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">Ocean token</a>&nbsp;model,  the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">sustainability loop</a> for Web3 projects, including Ocean,  the simplified technical <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-architecture-overview-9f2fab60f9a7">architecture</a> in Ocean&nbsp;V3,  how to re-purpose <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">#DeFi building blocks</a> for data (datatokens)  an introduction to the community-targeted <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>  Ocean <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data&nbsp;Farming</a>,  the role of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">staking</a> on&nbsp;data,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-selling-data-in-ocean-market-9afcfa1e6e43">selling</a> data in the Ocean&nbsp;Market.  <p>We opened up our channels to guest contributors, to hear broader perspectives about an emerging Data&nbsp;Economy:</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-data-economy-alex-svanevik-daos-as-business-a43cd6f5dcd7">Alex Svanevik</a> and his perspective as a data scientist,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-data-economy-silvan-jongerius-gdpr-ce14db0ff2d">Silvan Jongerius</a> — GDPR and&nbsp;data,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-the-data-economy-robert-miller-healthcare-data-be78e2c19c84">Robert Miller</a> — healthcare data,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/a-privacy-preserving-public-private-statistics-ecosystem-for-europe-cdc3b67a6614">Andreas Fauler</a> — governments and&nbsp;data.   A Call to Action — Ocean V3 is now fully available to the community <p>Ocean V3 takes to heart the start-up and Web3 principles to launch products early and incorporate the feedback of users as soon as possible. The team has contracted security audits, updated the libraries, updated documentation, revamped the website and tested the user flows in the Ocean Market. Now the community can play an even more active&nbsp;role.</p><p>Ocean V3 is fully functioning, but there’s a lot of work to be done to improve the user flows and add features in the Ocean Market, dozens of integrations are needed to weave Ocean into the fabric of business, and vulnerabilities may exist and need to be&nbsp;fixed.</p><p>The Ocean Market is a blank slate. It needs to be filled with valuable and relevant data that can be shared and monetized. For this, we ask the community to step in and find new data to fill the Ocean. The upcoming Data Economy Challenge will have a special emphasis — where teams and individuals can earn bounties and grants on filling the Ocean with high-quality data.</p> Looking Ahead <p>The final milestone to be accomplished from our original vision is to increase the control of the community over the protocol. For this, we will activate the OceanDAO and reduce the ability of the Ocean core team to intercede into the Ocean token contract, the Ocean smart contracts and community funding.</p><p>In 2021, all community efforts will be on raising awareness and encouraging adoption of Ocean Protocol as the de facto standard for the Data Economy. We will be asking for community support with integrations with other Web3 tools and services, porting Ocean smart contracts to other L1 technologies such as Polkadot, xDAI, Binance Smart Chain and others, and of course filling the Ocean with data and AI services.</p><p>We would like to thank all the community members for joining into the vision and helping to make it your own and to the countless contributors throughout this four year journey that have made Ocean Protocol, a community project for everyone. With our foundation of state-of-the-art technology and the rapidly growing Ocean community, let’s spread the message that it’s now possible to truly own our&nbsp;data.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Ocean Protocol Network Deployments Past, Present, and&nbsp;Future <a href="http://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> *&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean</a> One-Liner <p>Ocean Protocol V3.0 is now deployed to Ethereum mainnet. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/tree/master/docs/deployments">Here</a> are the addresses.</p> Summary <p>Towards a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-data-economy-b6fd8ecac4c4">Web3 Data Economy</a> for the planet, we envision Ocean deployed as a thin data asset layer for many blockchain networks. It starts with a single deployment, and expands pragmatically. Here’s the&nbsp;summary.</p><p>Ocean V1 (and V2) was deployed decentralized and permissioned:</p>  Network. Ocean smart contracts run on a dedicated <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">permissioned</a> <a href="https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e">EVM</a>&nbsp;network.  Contracts. A small group of people can <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/making-ocean-protocols-smart-contracts-and-it-s-governance-unstoppable-45cf99dc1b65">upgrade the smart contracts</a>, in a multi-sig setting.  <p>As of Ocean V3.0, Ocean will be decentralized and permissionless:</p>  Network. Ocean smart contracts are deployed to <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a> — the leading permissionless smart contract network. For testing, they’re also on Rinkeby. Specific deployment addresses are listed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/tree/master/docs/deployments">here.</a>  Contracts. The aim is to move away from a small handful of gatekeepers. Here’s how: contracts will not have upgradeability built in. Therefore the only way to upgrade contracts is by community consensus to use a new set of smart contracts. Sometimes, less is&nbsp;more.  <p>Then, Ocean V3.x will deploy to one EVM-compatible chain as a “sister” deployment to Ethereum mainnet. Thus, users can choose between low gas costs (sister chain) or high security (Ethereum mainnet).</p><p>After that, we envision community-driven Ocean deployments to many more chains. The rest of this article elaborates.</p> Decentralized, Consistent, Scalable. Pick Any&nbsp;Two. <p>The ideal blockchain network is Decentralized, Consistent, and Scalable&nbsp;(D,C,S):</p>  Decentralized means no single point of failure, the ideal version being permissionless (no gatekeepers)  Consistent means prevents double-spends, and sufficiently secure.  Scalable means it can serve planet-scale needs.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.bigchaindb.com%2Fthe-dcs-triangle-5ce0e9e0f1dc">We discovered in 2016</a> that it’s hard to get all three (D,C, S) at once. You can get two, but not three. A bit later, others <a href="https://github.com/taoeffect/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/c375e1f42f871463c80daa68ca0120993936a8c4/topics-and-advance-readings/Slepaks-Triangle.pdf">also</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311180536/https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ">realized</a> this. This challenge is now commonly known as the Scalability Trilemma.</p> Ocean V1 &amp; V2: Decentralized &amp; Permissioned <p>In fall 2018, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">underwent a process</a> to decide where to deploy Ocean contracts. At the time, no network in production met all three (D,C,S). Therefore, something would have to hold us over until full D,C,S solutions came&nbsp;along.</p><p>These were the most realistic options:</p>  <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>. It’s permissionless-Decentralized and Consistent. Scalability was our biggest concern, especially for data science users who expect performance. Nonetheless, we test-deployed Ocean contracts to Ethereum mainnet. Ocean V1 contracts were complex, so it took about 2 days to successfully deploy them 😬. This would have been a recurring problem, as we had a steady stream of upgrades planned. Second, each data purchase involved several wallet confirmations, which would have been painful for&nbsp;users.  <a href="https://www.poa.network/">POA Network</a>. While Consistent and Scalable, it was permissioned (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_authority">Proof-of-Authority</a>), not permissionless Decentralized. It has a sneaky ninja trick to avoid extra layer of legals to bound liability for node operators: each node operator must be a <a href="https://www.poa.network/features/known-validators">US public notary</a>, and US public notaries have sworn to be “of public service”. The engineer in me adores the elegance of this. However it also means that each operator must be in the US. Being confined to a single jurisdiction — and one without great regulatory clarity — was a showstopper for&nbsp;us.  Dedicated Ocean network, to start. Like POA Network, it would be Consistent and Scalable, and only permissioned Decentralized. It meant extra devops work and legal work. But there were no showstoppers.  <p>Given the tradeoffs of the other choices at the time, we selected “Dedicated Ocean network”. We created a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">permissioned</a> EVM network called <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/pacific-network/">Pacific</a>, and deployed Ocean smart contracts to it. For security, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN tokens</a> live on <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>, and connect to Pacific with an <a href="https://medium.com/poa-network/introducing-the-erc20-to-erc20-tokenbridge-ce266cc1a2d0">ERC20 Token Bridge</a>. Creating and maintaining this dedicated network and bridge was a lot of extra devops work and legal&nbsp;work.</p> Ocean V3.0: Permissionless <p>Ocean V3 contracts are <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-architecture-overview-9f2fab60f9a7">much simpler</a> than the V1 and V2 contracts due to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837?source=---------3----------------------------">datatokens</a> architecture. This includes lower gas usage, and fewer Ethereum transactions for equivalent actions. Finally, we have realized that data scientists are accustomed to some latency with Web2 payments; we don’t need to be radically better than that. (Ethereum mainnet latency is within those&nbsp;bounds.)</p><p>In short, the constraints that prevented us from deploying Ocean to Ethereum mainnet for Ocean V1 and V2 are no longer&nbsp;present.</p><p>We can deploy Ocean to Ethereum Mainnet now. So, we are. Ocean V3.0 is deployed to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>This means that Ocean V3 also meets the Ocean “V5” target of being permissionless, specified in the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-roadmap-setting-sail-to-2021-70c2545547a7">Ocean</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">roadmap</a>. We’ll also be retiring Pacific, and rescinding pause in Ocean&nbsp;tokens.</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN tokens</a> remain on <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>; therefore no bridge to Ethereum mainnet is needed for utility of Ocean smart contracts.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that Ethereum’s scale issue is solved, of course. It just means that it’s finally feasible for Ocean to be on Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p> Ocean V3.x Deployment to a Sister&nbsp;Chain <p>In the months leading up to Ocean V3 release (during Q3 2020), Ethereum gas costs have greatly risen with the rise of&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://trent.st/content/2014-10-28%20mcconaghy%20-%20blockchain%20big%20data.pdf">Since 2014</a>, we’ve been interested in blockchain scalability. We built <a href="http://www.bigchaindb.com">BigchainDB</a> as a scalability solution for database-style blockchains. I wrote the <a href="https://blog.bigchaindb.com/the-dcs-triangle-5ce0e9e0f1dc">DCS article</a>. And we’ve kept a close eye on scalability solutions.</p><p>We’ve been especially interested in ones that minimize changes to Ethereum mainnet. There are several EVM-compatible chains that solve DCS now. These include <a href="https://www.xdaichain.com/">xDai Chain</a> (via <a href="https://forum.poa.network/t/posdao-white-paper/2208">POSDAO</a>), <a href="https://www.parity.io/substrate-evm/">EVM on Substrate</a>, and <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698">rollups</a>. They can all be viewed as a “sister” chains to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>We plan a “sister” deployment of Ocean to xDai Chain for Ocean v3.x. This will likely be V3.1, depending on priority to other&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Each chain has a way to connect to Ethereum mainnet, for a flow of OCEAN token and datatokens to and from the sister chain. For example, xDai uses <a href="https://docs.tokenbridge.net/amb-bridge/about-amb-bridge">Arbitrary Message Bridge</a>&nbsp;(AMB).</p><p>It’s acceptable if the sister chain has a lower security, since users would have the choice between higher security (Ethereum mainnet) or lower gas costs (the sister, at potentially lower security). Then:</p>  Data assets that start high value or need high security can continue to deploy directly to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.  And, lower-value data assets can first get deployed to the sister network, then “graduate” to Ethereum mainnet if they increase sufficiently in value&nbsp;[1].  Ocean bridge.&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.pickpik.com/baltic-sea-bridge-denmark-sea-bridge-sunset-abendstimmung-93785">Image</a>] Multi-Network Deployment <p>Over time, we envision every blockchain network to have an Ocean-powered data resource permissioning layer. We envision them being interconnected with datatokens and OCEAN flowing everywhere.</p><p>We envision Ocean as an add-on library in <a href="https://www.parity.io/substrate/">Parity Substrate</a> and <a href="https://cosmos.network/sdk">Cosmos SDK</a>, making it only an “import” away for <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> and <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> blockchain families respectively [2]. It would support EVM, and eventually WASM directly. We’re particularly excited about <a href="https://www.parity.io/substrate-2-0-is-here/">Substrate 2.0</a>’s support for off-chain data integration.</p><p>We see integrations with <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698">rollups</a> technologies, including <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK variants</a> and optimistic variants (e.g. <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/optimistic-virtual-machine-alpha-cdf51f5d49e">OVM</a>). Each can be seen as a layer 2 solution. Or it can be seen as its own chain, that happens to inherit Ethereum mainnet’s security (but with other tradeoffs).</p><p>We expect to see deployment to other EVM-based networks such as <a href="https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain">Binance Smart Chain</a>, <a href="https://matic.network/">Matic Network</a>, <a href="https://skale.network/">SKALE Network</a>, <a href="https://near.org/">NEAR Protocol</a>, and <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>; each with their respective bridges.</p><p>We envision deployment onto federated networks for consortia like <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Energy Web&nbsp;Chain</a>.</p><p>Finally, we eventually see deployment to non-EVM blockchains, especially ones that can hold a lot of data like <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">arweave</a>, or ones with built-in oracles like <a href="https://aeternity.com/">aeternity</a>.</p><p>Going onto all these networks will be a process that will take multiple years. But over time, Ocean will become a ubiquitous access control layer across the entire Web3 ecosystem, aka the new internet. We see this as crucial towards global data sovereignty for individuals, companies, cities and&nbsp;nations.</p><p>In all these deployments, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN tokens</a> will remain on <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>, and bridged to other networks.</p><p>We will be encouraging the broader community to do each of these deployments, with funding from <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">OceanDAO</a> or the respective chain’s grant mechanisms.</p><p>In each of these deployments, with the interest of Ocean sustainability (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">as described here</a>), there will be <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3?source=user_profile---------0-----------------------">small transaction fees</a> that go to the Ocean community via a&nbsp;bridge.</p>Each network is its own island. We envision a future where every network has Ocean — and they’re all connected.

For V3.x, Ocean will get a “sister” deployment. Beyond, it will deploy to even more networks, towards ubiquity.</p>Ocean, covering everything.

  <p>It’s often said that “you can’t cut your way to growth,” but you can cut your way to survival.&nbsp;There are many reasons why an organization may need to make immediate spending cuts to survive, from natural disasters and terrorist attacks to a tanking economy or an aggressive new competitor — or a global pandemic.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has transformed how people are spending their money, and many businesses such as airlines, cruiselines and cinemas simply have no choice but to cut costs,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/88332">Chris Ganly</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner, during his presentation at virtual<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/apac/symposium-australia/"> Gartner Symposium IT/Xpo® 2020</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Difficult times call for difficult actions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“When faced with the challenge of immediate cost savings, CIOs need to determine how to approach cost cutting in the least damaging way to the mid- and long-term health of the business,” said Ganly.</p>
<p>[swg_ad] </p>
<p>Gartner recommends taking a structured and programmatic approach to<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-cios-can-optimize-it-costs/"> cost optimization</a>. Research shows that organizations that continue to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-gartner-2020-cio-agenda-winning-in-the-turns/">invest strategically in tough times</a> are more likely to emerge as leaders. But sometimes, difficult times call for difficult actions. </p>
<p>Cutting or stopping projects or services where costs have already been spent or incurred are of limited value. Cutting things that can’t be restarted, that have already been invested in or are ready to deliver will hurt when the organization is<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/act-now-to-fund-innovation-and-growth/"> ready to accelerate again</a>.</p>
 10 rules for rapid IT cost reduction 
<p>Assess your <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-kick-off-initiatives-for-cost-optimization/">IT cost reduction</a> options with these rules in mind.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 1: Target immediate impact 
<p>Eliminate, reduce or suspend items that will impact in weeks or months, not in years. Examples include expenses that are incurred and paid monthly or quarterly on a “pay as you go” basis, rather than annually.</p>
 No. 2: Reduce, don’t freeze 
<p>Focus on costs that can truly be reduced or eliminated, not just frozen for the current period, only to reappear again further down the line.</p>
 No. 3: Cash is king 
<p>Target those items that will have a real cash impact on the profit and loss statement rather than noncash items like depreciation or amortization. For example, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/best-practices-for-cloud-negotiation/">cost savings in cloud services</a> have a real cash impact, as opposed to reducing on-premises software licenses or owned assets like hardware. Selling and leasing back assets can provide real cash savings as well.</p>
 No. 4:&nbsp;Plan to do it once 
<p>Most organizations don’t cut deeply enough the first time, which means they often need to revisit costs and do it again. This creates a destructive and unproductive cycle of uncertainty, effort and lost productivity. This is particularly relevant for staff cuts, where cycles of ongoing reductions can be especially dangerous.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz0zMzQ2ZGRhMDEzMWMxMWViYjBiZTBhYWYwODQ4M2M2Yg=="></a> </p>
 No. 5:&nbsp;Carefully inspect accounts 
<p>Work with your finance partner to obtain a solid view of the expense-level detail, such as expense accounts, and key balance sheet accounts, including expense accruals and prepayments. Use this view to identify specific cash reductions that will immediately have an impact.</p>
 No. 6:&nbsp;Target unspent and uncommitted expenses 
<p>Unless payments (or commitments) can be recovered or prepayments returned, the most immediate impact will be on unspent or uncommitted payments. Evaluate contracts for renegotiation and termination clauses.</p>
 No. 7: Address capital 
<p>Typically, operating expenditures (opex) are the easiest to impact, but capital expenditures (capex) can also be reduced. Gartner IT Key Metrics Data shows that 25% of the average IT budget is spent on capital, so ensure that the complete range of IT spend is considered for rapid reductions.</p>
 No. 8: Sunk costs are irrelevant 
<p>When it comes to saving money, it is commonly said that “sunk costs are irrelevant,” meaning that future spend should be considered without relation to past spending or “sunk costs.” From a rapid cost reduction standpoint this is true, but it’s still worth considering whether the saving will be more than the benefit that can and will be delivered by continuing.</p>
 No. 9: Address discretionary and nondiscretionary cost 
<p>Discretionary spending, such as for new projects, additional capability or services, is often a seemingly easier place to cut. However, even nondiscretionary “run the business” expenses such as IT infrastructure and operations can be cut by reducing usage or service levels.</p>
 No. 10: Tackle both variable and fixed costs 
<p>Fixed costs are expenses that remain constant, regardless of activity or volume, such as office rent, subscriptions and payroll. For fixed costs, focus on elimination. Variable costs change with activity or volume; for example, telecommunications, contractors and consumables. For variable costs, focus on both reduction and elimination.</p>

<p>CIAM (Customer Identity &amp; Access Management) helps organisations improve customer experience by bringing together capabilities for next-level UX, security, and customer analytics in a single solution. CIAM is deployed either as-a-service or on-premises and embeds into applications and web services via interconnected Identity APIs.</p>
<p>Below, we’ll summarise how a modern CIAM solution positively impacts your customers to drive both the top-line and bottom-line.</p>
 CIAM from the perspective of your customer 
<p>CIAM, at its simplest, is about driving revenue. New revenue requires new customer conversions and deeper customer engagement, starting with the first time a customer uses your services.</p>
 Registration-as-a-Service 
<p>CIAM provides templated registration and login forms, usually supporting streamlined registration with support for pre-integrated digital Identity Providers like Facebook, Bank IDs, Government IDs, and more. Registration-as-a-Service makes it easy for developers to quickly build best-in-class forms and reduce the usual friction associated with signing up for new services.</p>
 <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-signup-ciam.png"></a> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Single identity across all your applications 
<p>Consider that your customers already have account and password fatigue before requiring them to create yet another account. By enabling Single Sign-On (SSO), your customers need only a single account and a single set of credentials to automatically login to all your services. Moving between applications becomes faster and easier, and customers can engage more deeply with your services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/customer-iam-benefit-sso.png"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Empower customers to own their identity data 
<p>CIAM allows customers to reset their passwords and manage their identity data and consent preferences. Not only does CIAM ensure identity data attributes stay up to date across all connected applications, it helps ensure your customer benefits from the privacy and consent regulations introduced in GDPR and the CCPA. Customers expect you to be a responsible steward of their identity data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 CIAM from the perspective of your organisation 
 Capture, proof &amp; convert 
<p>CIAM solutions should support the use of existing digital identities from the dozens of Identity Providers (Google, Facebook, enterprise IDs, Bank IDs, Government IDs). Form abandonment will be reduced when customers use the ‘sign in with…’ capability, and depending on the assurance strength of the ID, the service provider can trust that a new customer is who they say they are.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-idp-ciam.png"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For situations that require the proofing of customer identities but the customer does not have an appropriate existing digital identity, CIAM should also support real-time verification of real-world identities.</p>
 <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Onfido-integration.png"></a><p>The Ubisecure-Onfido alliance delivers real-time identity verification to CIAM customers</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Authenticate your customers and permit access to the right resources 
<p>Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) builds on the traditional username and password method of authentication by requiring successful verification of additional form factors such as TOTP (time-based one time PINs sent to the customer’s mobile device) or biometric credentials. MFA is increasingly required by many online service providers, partly driven by the need to reduce identity fraud and meet compliance regulation, and partly due to the improved usability of modern MFA solutions. CIAM supports many MFA form types from multiple specialist vendors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ubisecure-authn-fp.png"></a></p>
<p>Once authenticated, CIAM can manage the many authorisation rules that control who can access what resource (and potentially when).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Get a better view of your customer 
<p>CIAM helps organisations eliminate risky, overlapping identity data silos by using scalable and secure storage solutions for customer identity data and associated attributes, either in the cloud or on-premises. This centralised view of identity data, consent choices, and custom preferences offer deep analytical insight via integrated BI tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digitise expensive, resource-heavy workflows 
<p>Customer IAM capabilities such as credential self-management, i.e. allowing customers to reset their own passwords and keep their own identity data attributes up to date, dramatically reduce the burden on the helpdesk and keep contact data across connections applications fresh and accurate.</p>
<p>Organisations should digitise complex admin-based workflows to make an improved impact on bottom-lines. CIAM solutions that support multi-level delegation of authority allow admin actions to be delegated onwards to other individuals (and even other organisations). Digitising such workflows can reduce costs by as high as 99%.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ub-delegated.png"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Scale, scale, scale 
<p>Enterprise, or workforce IAM, solutions are used to manage thousands of employees. CIAM solutions need to manage millions of customers. Modern CIAM solutions are designed to do exactly that – manage millions of users securely and without performance impact across many different business use cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ciam-use-cases-2.png"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Get applications to market faster, make them smarter 
<p>Any identity management solution should support essential identity standards like OAuth, OpenID Connect, SAML, and others. Building standards-based solutions with their regional nuances can be complicated, with steep learning curves for developers. Embedding capabilities from a proven CIAM solution reduces the time developers need to understand and implement identity management. This helps keep developers focused on the core business and gets the application to market faster.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/customer-iam-benefit-developer.png"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 In summary, CIAM Business benefits  
 
 Delivers outstanding customer experiences 
 Avoids identity data breaches 
 Reduces operational and support costs 
 Keeps your development team focused 
 
<p>Today, CIAM has become much more than just Identity &amp; Access Management for customers. It’s become an essential business tool that will protect your business and give you a competitive advantage. It will win you more customers, give you valuable insight into buyer behaviours, protect valuable identity data, and scale to millions of customers. </p>

					  26.10.2020. In diesem Jahr ist alles anders. So fand auch das Digital Trust &amp; Identity Forum des bitkom heute virtuell statt. Mehrere hundert Teilnehmer verfolgten die spannenden Diskussionen und Vorträge rund um alles was in den Themen digital Identity, Vertrauensdienste und die Umsetzung der eIDAS-Verordnung als Basis für eine europaweite, elektronische Kommunikation und sichere Identifizierung aktuell wichtig ist. <p>Dominik Deimel engagierte sich mit dem Vortrag “comuny Trust Service Ecosystem – die Zukunft liegt in der Kollaboration!”. Er beschrieb, warum digitale Services von Unternehmen in regulierten Märkten verifizierte Kundendaten benötigen – egal ob bei Kontoeröffnung, Zugang zur elektronischen Patientenakte oder auch beim voll digitalen Abschluss eines &nbsp;Versicherungsvertrags. Die Anzahl der Use Cases steigt kontinuierlich und für Unternehmen zählt Flexibilität in der Prozessgestaltung und Einfachheit in der Umsetzung als Top Prio bei der Auswahl passender Lösungspartner. Doch aktuell ist kein Dienstleister in der Lage, diesen Anspruch übergreifend zu erfüllen ohne klassische Lock-In Effekte.</p><p>Die Antwort auf dieses Dilemma heißt Kollaboration der Anbieter in Ecosystemen, die ausreichend Spielraum für eigene unternehmerische Freiheitsgrade und gleichzeitig Transparenz bei der Anbieterauswahl für den Kunden gewährleisten. Über einen solchen Ansatz lassen sich sehr flexibel Use Cases und Branchenlösungen erzeugen, die dann optimalerweise als in sich gekoppelte As-a-Service-Leistung zum attraktiven Preis am Markt angeboten werden. In dem Vortrag wurde das Geschäftsmodell und die technische Lösung des comuny Trust Ecosystems Ansatz und die Möglichkeiten der Use Case Generierung am Beispiel des Gesundheitswesen aufgezeigt und diskutiert.</p><p>#eIDAS #bitkom #speaker #event #comuny #Kollaboration #future-of-trust #ecosystems #trust-services</p><p><a title="https://eidas-summit.de/eIDAS-Summit-Programm" href="https://eidas-summit.de/eIDAS-Summit-Programm">https://eidas-summit.de/eIDAS-Summit-Programm</a></p>

<p>If you’re a Java developer like me, you like to crank out code and get shit done. I like many things about IntelliJ IDEA, but I thought it’d be fun to write about the ones that make me most productive. First, a bit of my development history.</p>
 
 
<p>When I first started doing Java development in the late 90s, I used HomeSite as my editor. HomeSite was an HTML editor initially developed by Nick Bradbury. I liked it because it defaulted to a view of your code rather than being WYSIWYG like Dreamweaver and FrontPage. It’s funny to look back now and laugh about how inefficient I was: I used to google for import statements, then copy/pasted them into the editor.</p>
 
 
<p>In the early 2000s, I tried a few other IDEs, but they always seemed to be memory hogs and never felt quite as good as HomeSite to me. Then, along came Eclipse. When I first used it, I fell in love. Not only did it have a native look-and-feel, but it was fast and efficient.</p>
 
 
<p>I stayed in love with Eclipse until I started migrating AppFuse to Maven in 2006. IntelliJ IDEA’s Maven support for multiple modules was so much better than Eclipse’s m2e, I switched. In 2008, I started doing more web development and found that IDEA had excellent HTML, JavaScript, and CSS support. I haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: as a Java Champion, I get a free license to IntelliJ IDEA. If I didn’t, my company would gladly pay for it.</p>
 
 






I used IDEA 2020.2.3 (Ultimate Edition) for this blog post.



 
 
 

 
 
 
 Run Your Java Apps from IntelliJ IDEA 
 
 
<p>I used to prefer running my apps from the command line with Ant or Maven. Then, along came Spring Boot. Spring Boot is a plain ol' Java application with a <code>public static void main()</code>. This makes it a lot easier for Java IDEs to run apps since this is a standard part of any Java app.</p>
 
 
<p>In fact, if you go to File &gt; New &gt; Project, you’ll see IDEA supports many popular Java frameworks like Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, and MicroProfile.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you select any of these frameworks, a multi-step wizard will guide you through options.</p>
 
 
 Run Spring Boot Apps in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
<p>If you select Spring Boot, it’ll even create a run configuration for you with the name matching your main <code>Application</code> class. In the screenshot below, the buttons are as follows:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
<p>The hammer icon on the left will build your project</p>
 
 
<p>The play icon will run your project</p>
 
 
<p>The bug icon will run your project in debug mode</p>
 
 
<p>The far-right icon will run with code coverage</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>If you’re doing microservices with Spring Boot, there’s also a run dashboard you can use to start/stop/monitor all your services. To demonstrate what it looks like, you can clone the example code from <a>Secure Reactive Microservices with Spring Cloud Gateway</a> and open it in IDEA:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/spring-cloud-gateway
idea .</code> 
 
 
 
<p>After downloading dependencies and initializing the project, you’ll see a Services popup in the bottom right corner.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Click on it and it’ll expand to give you a couple of options. Click on the first one to show run configurations.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>This will show the run dashboard and you’ll see all your apps listed. You can click on the Not Started element and click the play icon to start them all.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Pretty cool, eh?!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Run Micronaut Apps in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
<p>Micronaut is similar to Spring Boot in that it has a <code>public static void main()</code>. When I created a new app using IDEA’s Micronaut wizard, it did not generate any run configurations for me. However, when I clicked on the play icon next to the <code>main()</code> method, it allowed me to easily create one.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Run Quarkus Apps in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
<p>Quarkus is a bit different—it has no <code>main()</code> method. You have to run the <code>quarkus:dev</code> Maven goal to start the app. The good news is you can create a run (or debug) configuration from this by right-clicking on the goal in the Maven tool window and selecting the second option.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Configure Environment Variables 
 
<p>You might be wondering, "why do I need a run configuration?" First of all, it’s nice to click a button (or use a keyboard shortcut) to start and re-start your app. Secondly, it provides a way for you to configure JVM options and environment variables.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, if you’re using Spring Boot with Okta’s Spring Boot starter, you’ll want to use environment variables rather than putting a client secret in your source code.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Debug Your Java Apps 
 
 
<p>Setting breakpoints in apps and debugging them is a valuable skill for software engineers, regardless of language.</p>
 
 
<p>In IntelliJ IDEA, you can click in the left gutter next to the line you want to debug. Then, run your app with a debug configuration, and it’ll stop at your breakpoint. Then you can step into, step over, etc.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 Debug via Maven in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
<p>If you start your app with Maven, you can debug it too. Let’s use Micronaut in this example. If you run <code>mvnDebug mn:run</code>, it’ll wait for you to attach a remote debugger on port 8000. To create a remote debugging configuration in IntelliJ IDEA, go to Add Configuration &gt; + &gt; Remote and give it a name. Then change the port to <code>8000</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Debug via Gradle in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
<p>Gradle has a similar ability. For example, if you created a Spring Boot app with Gradle, you could start it with the following command to run in debug mode.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gradle bootRun -Dorg.gradle.debug=true --no-daemon</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In this case, Gradle will listen on port 5005 by default, so you’ll need to modify your remote configuration to listen on this port.</p>
 
 
<p>Confession: I was a Java developer for over five years before I learned <a href="https://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/remotely_debug_your_app_in">you can remotely debug any Java application</a>. All it takes is starting your Java app with some extra arguments, and it’ll wait until you attach to it. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005 -jar path/to/jar.jar</code> 
 
 
 






IntelliJ IDEA also supports <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-javascript-debugger.html">debugging JavaScript apps</a>.



 
 
 
 
 
 Run Your Java Tests from IntelliJ IDEA 
 
 
<p>When I run tests from the command line with a Java build tool, I often run all the tests.</p>
 
 
 
 <code># Maven
mvn test
# Gradle
gradle test</code> 
 
 
 
<p>When a test fails, I know I can run it as an individual test by adding extra parameters to the command, but I prefer to iterate on tests in IDEA.</p>
 
 
<p>IntelliJ has excellent testing support. When you open a Java test in the editor, there will be a play icon next to your test class and individual methods. Click it and you’ll get the option to run, debug, run with coverage, or edit the configuration.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>I use this support a lot to run and debug individual tests.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also run them at a package level by right-clicking on the page and selecting the Run Tests option.</p>
 
 






You might notice I’m using <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> for my JDK installation. IDEA pairs well with SDKMAN (which is very useful when testing with different vendors/versions).



 
 
 
 
 My Favorite Keyboard Shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
 
<p>I’m a big fan of keyboard shortcuts because leaving my hands on the keyboard makes me more efficient. Since I do a lot of presentations and use keyboard shortcuts, I use <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7345-presentation-assistant">Presentation Assistant</a> for showing commands during presentations (and learning Windows/Linux commands).</p>
 
 
<p>I also recommend using <a href="https://www.shortcutfoo.com/">ShortcutFoo</a> to learn and practice shortcuts for your favorite IDEs. I learned about this site from <a href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s">Venkat Subramaniam</a> a few years ago.</p>
 
 
<p>Below are some of the IntelliJ IDEA keyboard shortcuts I use daily.</p>
 








macOS Shortcut
Windows/Linux

<p>⌘+Shift+N</p>
<p>Ctrl+Shift+N</p>

<p>Press Ctrl twice</p>

<p>Run Anything (e.g., <code>mvn compile</code>)</p>



 






How cool are Asciidoctor’s <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#ui-macros">UI Macros</a> for keyboard shortcuts?!



 
 
<p>You can also use ⌘+Shift+A to pop an actions dialog and search for commands. Heck, you can even create your own shortcuts!</p>
 
 
<blockquote><p>Assign shortcuts to frequently used actions, menu items or features, if they don't already have one. Use Project Settings -&gt; Keymap, or Find Action -&gt; Alt+Enter. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IntelliJTopShortcut?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IntelliJTopShortcut</a> <a href="https://t.co/uv8Joj2fHT">pic.twitter.com/uv8Joj2fHT</a></p>— JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (@intellijidea) <a href="https://twitter.com/intellijidea/status/1318461975844724736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2020</a></blockquote> 
 
 
 
 
 IDEA’s Command-Line Launcher 
 
 
<p>Did you know you can install a command-line launcher (Tools &gt; Create Command-line launcher) and open projects from your terminal? For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># Maven
idea pom.xml
# Gradle
idea gradle.build
# Figure it out for me
idea .</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-the-ide-features-from-command-line.html#arguments">IDEA CLI has other commands</a> like <code>diff</code> and <code>format</code> too, but I’ve never used them.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Markdown and AsciiDoc Support 
 
 
<p>I write blog posts like this one as much as I write Java code. I was a big fan of writing HTML until I spent a year writing mostly Markdown. Now, I prefer Markdown over HTML, and
AsciiDoc is even better!</p>
 
 
<p>I like AsciiDoc because it supports things like table of contents, code blocks with callouts, admonitions (tip, note, etc.), and I used it (along with Asciidoctor) to write the <a href="http://www.jhipster-book.com/">JHipster Mini-Book</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>IntelliJ IDEA bundles Markdown support, and it works "good enough" when I have to write in Markdown.</p>
 
 
<p>I use the <a href="https://intellij-asciidoc-plugin.ahus1.de/">IntelliJ AsciiDoc Plugin</a> for AsciiDoc authoring. This plugin has gotten so good over the past few years, I do almost all my authoring in IDEA and only render it via build tools as a QA process.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Local History is Fantastic! 
 
 
<p>IntelliJ’s Local History support can be a lifesaver. I try to edit all text-based files in IDEA because of this feature. If things crash or I want to go back to what I’d written before, local history works excellent for that.</p>
 
 
<p>Simply right-click on a file or directory and go to Local History &gt; Show History.</p>
 
 
 
 
 IntelliJ Live Templates 
 
 
<p>An awesome way to pre-record code snippets for demos and increase your productivity is to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-live-templates.html">Live Templates</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>For Java, some built-in ones are <code>sout</code> and <code>fori</code>. You type those characters, hit tab, and it expands to the code you want.</p>
 
 
<p>I use live templates for almost all my screencasts and keep them updated at <a href="https://github.com/mraible/idea-live-templates">github.com/mraible/idea-live-templates</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, here’s my <code>ss-resource-config</code> shortcut that configures Spring Security to be an OAuth 2.0 resource server.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import com.okta.spring.boot.oauth.Okta;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        // @formatter:off
        http
            .authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        // @formatter:on

        Okta.configureResourceServer401ResponseBody(http);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To add new live templates, select the code you want to save, then go to Tools &gt; Save as Live Template. You can also use variables in your template that you can tab to change after you expand it.</p>
 
 






Make sure you test your templates before doing a demo because sometimes they get saved for the wrong context!



 
 
 
 
 Web Framework Support 
 
 
<p>If you’re a hard-core Java developer, you might not care about web framework support. That is, unless your web framework requires Java code, like Wicket or GWT. Personally, I’m a fan of JavaScript and don’t trust Java developers to write my JavaScript for me. I’m a full-stack developer, and I ❤️ <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a>! 🤓</p>
 
 
<p>I first switched to IntelliJ IDEA in 2006 because of its Maven multi-module support. I stuck with it because I switched to mostly front-end development in 2009. I found that IDEA’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript support is excellent. It picks up my ESLint settings automatically and just works.</p>
 
 
<p>Support for Angular is bundled, and there are lots of React plugins. I’ve never installed any because I haven’t had a need. As far as Vue is concerned, there’s a <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9442-vue-js">Vue.js plugin</a> from JetBrains.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn More About Java and IntelliJ 
 
 
<p>I’ve heard from many developers that they prefer to use Eclipse or NetBeans because they’re free. If you were a carpenter, would you look around for free tools, or would you buy new fancy tools that make you a better carpenter? 😏</p>
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed reading about why I love IntelliJ! If you’re curious about IDEA’s support for specific Java frameworks, see the following links. Note that these are all features of the Ultimate edition.</p>

<p>This past week was the <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a>.

<p>We are often asked by prospects evaluating open source identity and access management platforms about the difference between the Gluu Server and Keycloak.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, we have not deployed or operated Keycloak. However, at a high level, we can offer a few points of differentiation between the two platforms.</p>
 Product vs. Project 
<p>There is a big difference between a project and a product. There are long term and short term projects, but by nature projects are temporary and are often not suitable for mission critical production environments. Products, on the other hand, need to live in production for many years.</p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the Keycloak website (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RH-SSO product derives from a specific version of the Keycloak community and is maintained, patched, and supported by Red Hat commercially for as long as the terms of your support contract. The Keycloak community project, on the other hand, is never patched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, by RH’s own admission, Keycloak open source offering is a bleeding edge project that is never patched.</p>
<p>The Gluu Server Community Edition, on the other hand, is a product that is in production at many organizations.</p>
 Niche vs. Pure Play 
<p>Choosing an IAM platform is a long term decision. Once you start building the platform into your larger enterprise architecture, the switching costs become extremely high.</p>
<p>Keycloak and RH SSO contribute no meaningful amount to RH’s bottom line, and RH may or may not continue to invest in the software. We’ve seen in the past RH say “the liability of the product exceeds the revenue opportunity.” It’s not enough to patch a server. The SSO market is moving fast as new vulnerabilities and application development paradigms emerge. Is RH committed for the long term to not only support, but to innovate?</p>
<p>Gluu’s whole business is built around the Gluu Server. Gluu will never stop innovating (or end of life) our flagship product.</p>
 Support 
<p>Red Hat does not provide commercial support for Keycloak. They instead derive product offerings (i.e. RH SSO) from community projects (i.e. Keycloak) which are branded and maintained separately.</p>
<p>Gluu, on the other hand, makes a large investment in supporting our customers and the open source community alike. We do not hold back features for a commercial version. Everyone gets the same Gluu Server software bits.</p>
<p>We rely on large organizations with mission critical requirements to <a href="https://gluu.org/pricing">pay for support</a>, but that doesn’t stop us from helping the open source community of DIYers and small (and large!) businesses adopt and use this critical security tool.</p>
 OS specific 
<p>Gluu is committed to building packages for many popular Linux distributions, currently Red Hat, Centos, Ubuntu, and Debian.</p>
 Team vs. Company 
<p>Our experience is that developers ask a lot of hard questions, the criticality of support is high, and a fast response time is critical. As Keycloak / RH SSO is a small part of RH’s business, it may take time for Redhat to get the right team engaged on a production (or development) issue.</p>
<p>Gluu’s whole company is focused on the Gluu Server, and our business, support and developer staff is engaged in supporting and extending the product each and every day.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>As a pure play IAM vendor, Gluu will never end-of-life the Gluu Server, or waver from its commitment to support and innovate our open source platform.</p>
<p>Options are good for consumers, and we like to see other organizations offer open source identity and access management tools to the community. In fact, we make use of the good ones (like Shibboleth) in our stack!</p>
<p>Our recommendation: use Keycloak at your own risk… you may be locked into an obscure, end-of-lifed product in the not too distant future.[:]</p>

 The future of Web3 identity has&nbsp;arrived <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a brand new SDK for building with decentralized identity and user-centric data from the 3Box Labs team. IDX is in alpha but if you’d like to start experimenting, <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">join our discord</a> and jump into the&nbsp;<a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">docs</a>.</p> A new era for Web3 development <p>The Web3 vision for an internet that is open and interoperable, where users control their information requires a decentralized, cross-platform identity system. To this end, IDX is an open source JavaScript/TypeScript library that exposes high-level developer APIs to various meta-protocols and standards for decentralized identity. Not only is IDX powerful and flexible enough to meet all of your user and data management needs, but it wraps everything in an easy-to-use package that makes decentralized identity accessible to all Web3 developers.</p><p>Designed to be cross-platform and highly configurable, IDX is compatible with all blockchains, wallets, and a wide variety of user and application data storage options including <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, <a href="https://textile.io">Textile</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org">OrbitDB</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://sia.tech">Sia</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/">Secure Data Stores</a> — so you can seamlessly integrate decentralized identity with the rest of your Web3 tech stack. With IDX, developers can now build much more sophisticated and powerful Web3 applications that rival and even exceed what’s currently possible on&nbsp;Web2.</p> Why decentralized identity? <p>If you’ve ever asked yourself any of these questions, then you should definitely consider adding a decentralized identity system to your development stack.</p>  How can I create a universal identifier to associate data resources from a variety of platforms to a single&nbsp;user?  How can I improve my user experience with decentralized social profiles?  How can users create a unified Web3 identity that links many different accounts within and across various blockchain platforms?  How can users establish trust and reputation by connecting their Web3 identity to existing Web2 social accounts (i.e. Twitter), various anti-sybil systems (i.e. <a href="https://brightid.org">BrightID</a>), domain names (i.e. DNS, <a href="https://ens.domains">ENS</a>, <a href="https://handshake.org/">Handshake</a>), and identity verification services (i.e.&nbsp;KYC)?  How can users create a universal and portable social graph of followers, friends, and contacts?  How can I store user and application data in various centralized and decentralized data storage technologies in a way that isn’t siloed to my application, gives users ultimate control and portability over their data, and works with all of their existing wallets/accounts?  How do I discover and import data that a user has created on another application, platform, or network so that I can use it inside my&nbsp;app?   IDX: An open identity framework for&nbsp;Web3 <p>Decentralized identity and user-centric data management are complex, broad-ranging capabilities that touch almost every other aspect of your app architecture. IDX removes the all of the guesswork from implementing these in a scalable and future-proof way.</p> Build with unified digital identities <p>Using IDX, all applications can access a shared, globally-available identity layer that contains unified users identities. Built 100% on permissionless protocols, IDX enables users and their most important information to seamlessly flow and interoperate across platforms, while giving users the ownership and control they demand. In a way, the identity capabilities offered by IDX sort of function as a decentralized Keybase but with much greater flexibility and decentralization.</p>A unified digital footprint!<p>The core of each identity consists of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> which acts as a globally-unique ID and an <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/cip/idx/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">identity index</a> which keeps track of an identity’s information. IDX allows developers to deploy identities as well as create, read, update, and delete a variety of metadata and information related to the identity, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Multiple user profiles for different contexts or applications  Portable social graphs, from followers to contacts and&nbsp;family  Links to multiple blockchain accounts from different protocols (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, NEAR, Flow,&nbsp;etc)  Links to existing social accounts (Twitter, Github, Discord, Matrix,&nbsp;etc)  Links to domain names (DNS, ENS, Unstoppable, Handshake, etc)  <p>All DIDs, identity indexes, and metadata are securely stored on Ceramic’s permissionless document management network. Because all information is publicly available (but optionally encrypted) and linked via the identity index, any bit of information can be cross-resolved by querying based on any other information. For example you could lookup a user’s profile based on their DID, their Ethereum account, or their Twitter handle; or you could lookup a user’s Filecoin account based on their Polkadot account. We are working with <a href="https://thegraph.com">The Graph</a> on indexing these identity structures which will open up many new opportunities in this&nbsp;realm.</p> Integrate with data storage solutions <p>Unified identities are the gateway to a world of additional functionality for your application. If you also need a way of storing and managing user data, you have three main&nbsp;options.</p>  Use the IDX library to directly store documents on the Ceramic Network and add references to those documents in the user’s index. For this option, no additional software is needed; it works out of the box with&nbsp;IDX.  Store data in alternative data storage systems such as Filecoin, IPFS, Sia, Arweave, Textile, OrbitDB, Secure Data Stores, or Ethereum contracts and use IDX to add references to this data in your user’s index. For this option, you would need to separately install these technologies in your app alongside IDX.  Use a combination of the different data storage solutions above for your application, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, while mapping everything in your user’s&nbsp;IDX.  <p>Whichever data storage configuration you choose, IDX allows all data to be controlled by the user, discoverable by others, and portable across platforms. This is true regardless of where the data resides (servers or decentralized networks) or which application first created the&nbsp;data.</p>The identity index contains mappings to various data&nbsp;sources Share data across applications and&nbsp;silos <p>As described above, the key aspect of IDX that de-silos information, promotes interoperability, and enables user control is the identity index. It provides a standard interface which allows any application or developer to set and query all available data that belongs to a user so that they might make use of it within their application. The identity index serves as the information root for each user and makes everything discoverable.</p><p>To further promote interoperability, the identity index allows developers to:</p>  Publish schemas, names, and descriptions for data points they are adding to the index, so others can more easily consume this information  Publish endpoints for where this information can be found, whether a DocID on Ceramic, a CID on IPFS/Filecoin, a contract on Ethereum, or an endpoint for a hosted&nbsp;service  Request permission to access encrypted data points in the&nbsp;index   Developing with&nbsp;IDX <p>The following section outlines how to get started building with IDX. For more supporting materials, <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">read the&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> Installation <p>First, we’ll need to install the main IDX library and associated dependencies:</p> npm install @ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client @ceramicstudio/idx @ceramicstudio/idx-constants  Query an&nbsp;identity <p>Then we can use these libraries to connect IDX to a Ceramic network and interact with the documents associated to a given DID. This example shows how to simply query the basic profile for a given&nbsp;user.</p> import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client'<br>import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'<br>import { definitions } from '@ceramicstudio/idx-constants'  // Use Ceramic devnet<br>const ceramic = new Ceramic('&lt;https://ceramic.3boxlabs.com&gt;')  // Use IDX-provided definitions aliases<br>const idx = new IDX({ ceramic, definitions })  // Get the basic profile of a known DID supporting IDX<br>async function getProfile(did) {<br>  return await idx.get('basicProfile', did)<br>}  Save data <p>More advanced examples involving authentication and setting content can be found in the <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/guide-authentication">IDX documentation</a>.</p><p>Remember, IDX is still in alpha. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on what we’ve built or how to use it, please <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">reach out on&nbsp;Discord</a>.</p> About <p>IDX is an open source library that is built and maintained with 💜 by the 3Box Labs team, creators of <a href="https://github.com/3box/3box-js">3Box.js</a>, a leading decentralized identity and data storage solution for Ethereum that has been used by 30,000+ users and 1,000+ projects. IDX is a smarter, mature evolution of 3Box.js. All DIDs and profiles created using 3Box.js will be automatically migrated to IDX once the library goes into production. We are working on various solutions to migrate user data that has been saved in spaces and threads to other IDX compatible data storage systems including Ceramic, Textile, and OrbitDB.

<p>We are delighted to announce that we are building on <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot,</a> a sharded blockchain that seamlessly connects multiple chains together in a single network with the aim of accelerating the integration of both ecosystems and increasing levels of trust and data sovereignty for users across the industry. Parity Technologies, one of the drivers behind the Polkadot ecosystem, will provide Ontology with technical support to integrate its Decentralized Identity (DeID) solution, making it available on a range of other blockchains within the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>The integration of Ontology’s DeID is part of a wider effort for Ontology to build a parachain on Polkadot. We envision that the parachain will provide a series of credit-based services on decentralized identity and cross-chain communication. These credit services will include OScore as well, our newly launched credit scoring system designed to seamlessly accelerate the potential to borrow or lend based on a user’s cryptocurrency transaction and asset management history.</p><p>In addition, this parachain will bring cross-chain liquidity to the Polkadot network. Through this, we wish to further accelerate the development of the DeFi ecosystem and lower the barrier of entry for developers. An example of how this is implemented in the DeFi space is the recently launched Wing platform — a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi platform purely dedicated to the practices of lending digital assets governed by the Wing DAO community. This will in turn boost the liquidity of digital assets such as ONT, ONG and DOT. Ontology plans to bid on a parachain slot and create one of Polkadot’s first Initial Parachain Offerings (IPO).</p><p>Eric Wang — the Ecosystem Development Lead at Parity, stated that “Ontology is an industry leader in the development and deployment of decentralized identity solutions. We look forward to working closely with the Ontology team to increase the use of ONT ID 2.0 through Polkadot to realize the benefits of digital identity, privacy for DeFi projects and&nbsp;beyond”.</p><p>Parity’s Head of Engineering in Asia, Yaoqi Jia said “the Parity Asia team consists of talented engineers who are very excited to provide support to help guide Ontology in creating a truly impactful parachain.”</p><p>Developed over the past couple of months, the Ontology <a href="https://github.com/siovanus/DID-substrate">parachain</a> currently consists of a DID Substrate pallet, with plans for further integration of other custom components. Further plans for the Ontology parachain include:</p>  Ontology OScore — an off-chain DID authorization mechanism to manage wallet-identity relationships and provide ID-based credit scores for on-chain actions related to digital&nbsp;assets.  The integration of Ontology’s distributed data exchange framework (DDXF), permitting both token association and data tokenization.  Expanding DID’s use cases from users to also include data and resources, providing authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for DID based resource instances via on-chain data access control with data-tokens (tokenization), and association of its value. DDXF provides on-chain AAA for data interoperability cross&nbsp;systems.  <p>Through the integration of our bespoke digital identity and credit-based solution into the Polkadot ecosystem, along with the help of Parity’s leading engineering team, this collaboration will further accelerate user trust, privacy, and data sovereignty, as well as empower the development of the broader DeFi sector. Ontology looks forward to joining forces with more ecosystem allies to redefine trust and connect the missing pieces of a decentralized financial ecosystem.</p><p>About Polkadot</p><p>Polkadot is a sharded blockchain that seamlessly connects multiple diverse chains together in a single network, allowing them to exchange data securely and process transactions in parallel. In this way, Polkadot solves major scalability issues that have impeded blockchain development. Polkadot has also introduced a highly advanced open governance system that will allow the network to innovate and grow at a much more rapid pace than legacy networks. Applications from decentralized finance and energy to IoT and gaming will thrive on Polkadot, challenging the centralized platforms of Web 2.0.

 Earning Opportunities — and Risks — in Ocean’s Community Marketplace Ocean Workers. [Image: <a href="https://techthelead.com/lab-grown-baby-corals-might-just-save-the-great-barrier-reef-from-climate-change/">AIMS</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en">CC-BY-3.0 AU</a>] Summary <p>The upcoming <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">Ocean Market</a> app enables people and organizations to earn by staking / curating on data and by selling data. This article focuses on staking on data. (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-selling-data-in-ocean-market-9afcfa1e6e43">This one</a> focuses on selling.)</p><p>In staking, you earn a cut of the transaction fees as a liquidity provider (LP). Staking is a curation signal tending towards higher quality datasets. Stakers will earn additional rewards from <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Ocean Data Farming</a> program, when it launches.</p><p>Staking incurs these risks, which cannot be&nbsp;ignored.</p>  Staking incurs the risk of impermanent loss (IL) — when the pool’s ratio of OCEAN to datatokens changes, compared to when you initially staked.  Staking also has the risk of a rug pull. This is is typically when a datatoken publisher pulls out their stake, in OCEAN. Therefore, remaining stakers’ OCEAN holdings in the pool drops, causing a&nbsp;loss.  <p>The rest of this post elaborates.</p> Datatokens &amp; Ocean&nbsp;Market <p>Each data service gets its own Ocean datatoken. A datatoken is an ERC20 token that wraps access to a dataset or a compute-to-data service. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">This blog</a> introduces Ocean datatokens.</p><p>The Ocean Market app makes it easy to create a datatoken for a given data service, and to consume a datatoken to access that service. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">This blog</a> introduces Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> Automated Market Makers&nbsp;(AMMs) <p>An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a robot that’s always ready to buy or sell. An AMM is a pool holding two assets, let’s say TOK1 and TOK2 tokens. Anyone can add TOK1 or TOK2 tokens to this pool. If you buy TOK1 tokens from the pool, its price (in terms of TOK2) is the based on the ratio of # TOK1&nbsp;: # TOK2 tokens. And, vice versa for buying&nbsp;TOK2.</p><p>AMMs are the heart of modern decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like <a href="http://www.balancer.exchange">Balancer</a> and <a href="http://uniswap.exchange">Uniswap</a>. To learn more about AMMs, <a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/background">here’s</a> a&nbsp;start.</p> OCEAN-Datatoken Pools <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/lets-talk-about-data-pricing-part-i-bbc9cf781d9f">Pricing</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/value-of-data-part-two-pricing-bc6c5127e338">data</a> is traditionally hard; automated price discovery promises to make this&nbsp;easier.</p>  An order book approach to auto-pricing requires many actors to place bids and asks, which would not be feasible when launching a new data&nbsp;asset.  AMMs also do auto-pricing. Unlike order books, they don’t many actors to function well. Due to this, Ocean Market uses AMMs to auto-price datasets.  <p>Ocean Market makes it easy to create an OCEAN-datatoken AMM pool, and to buy and sell datatokens for OCEAN. True to form, the AMM auto-adjusts the price as datatokens are bought and&nbsp;sold.</p> Staking in Ocean with OCEAN-Datatoken Pools <p>OCEAN-datatoken pools are the basis for staking in&nbsp;Ocean:</p><blockquote>OCEAN staking is the act of adding liquidity to an OCEAN-datatoken AMM pool. By staking, you become a liquidity provider&nbsp;(LP).</blockquote> Staking Rewards from Transaction Fees <p>When you stake on a datatoken pool, you earn staking&nbsp;rewards:</p>  From transaction fees for sales (buying &amp; selling datatokens) in that&nbsp;pool  From Ocean Data Farming rewards (when it launches).  <p>This section elaborates on (1); the next section on&nbsp;(2).</p><p>The creator of the OCEAN-datatoken pool sets the transaction fee going to stakers. This fee is a percentage of sales volume. The higher the sales volume, the more you earn. The default fee is 0.1%, but it could be 1% or 5% or&nbsp;more.</p><p>Stakers get paid proportional to how much liquidity they have provided, compared to other&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>For more revenue, a good strategy is to stake on data assets with high sales volume, especially “undiscovered gems” with little stake so far by others. This will give you a greater cut of the transaction fee&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>Staking rewards from transaction fees flow immediately into the pool. Therefore all the pool’s stakers collectively get more OCEAN liquidity with each&nbsp;sale.</p><p>You can always increase or decrease the total amount staked in a pool, via the “add liquidity” and “remove liquidity” actions. You can un-stake anytime; the funds enter your wallet immediately. Withdrawal includes the portion of staking&nbsp;rewards.</p> Staking Rewards from Data&nbsp;Farming <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Ocean Data Farming</a> is an upcoming program to reward stakers further. The amount of rewards will be a function of stake in the pool, amount of consumption of a data asset, and likely more factors. Time is a possible factor. We will release more information when the program launch&nbsp;nears.</p> Risk: Impermanent Loss <p>Staking in OCEAN-datatoken AMMs has potential to earn transaction fees and data farming rewards. However, like all AMMs, there is also the risk of impermanent loss (IL). IL occurs whenever the ratio of (# OCEAN)&nbsp;: (# datatokens) diverges from when you initially staked (value of&nbsp;1.0).</p><p>So, if OCEAN goes up relative to the datatoken value, or if the datatoken goes up compared to the OCEAN value, then you have impermanent loss.</p><p>The image below illustrates.</p>  The blue curve is the value of your holdings in the OCEAN-datatoken AMM, as a function of price&nbsp;ratio.  The orange curve is the value of your holdings if you simply held OCEAN and datatoken separately, without them being in AMMs. (With all else being equal, and with zero fees and rewards.)  [Image: University of&nbsp;Orleans]<p>The loss is called impermanent because if the ratio reverts to 1.0, then IL = 0.0. But don’t let this lull you into a false sense of security: that 1.0 ratio may never come back, and loss becomes permanent as soon as you withdraw.</p> Rug Pulls <p>A rug pull is an attack that results in stakers losing funds. Here are some ways it might&nbsp;happen:</p>  A pool publisher creates a pool and adds initial liquidity (thereby having 100% initial stake), waits for others to stake in OCEAN, then withdraws their stake as&nbsp;OCEAN.  A pool exists and many have staked OCEAN into it. The publisher mints a lot more datatokens into the pool, thereby gaining a much larger % stake, then withdraws their stake as&nbsp;OCEAN.  <p>Here’s the mechanics.</p>  If one stakes just in datatokens, part of those datatokens are swapped for OCEAN already in the pool. Similar for OCEAN: if one stakes just in OCEAN, part of that OCEAN is swapped for datatokens already in the pool. The pool maintains its weight ratio (e.g. 10% OCEAN - 90% datatokens or <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1322134558121336837">50%-50%</a>).  In both cases, the staker receives BPT tokens, which represent % stake in the pool’s holdings (of datatokens and OCEAN). BPT tokens don’t represent % stake in just OCEAN or just datatokens; they represent stake in both according to the pool’s weight&nbsp;ratio.  It’s the publisher who tends to have more supply of datatokens (at first, as well as the potential to mint more later). Others only initially start with OCEAN because they have to purchase datatokens, or stake into the pool to get both. But when they stake, they get BPTs which represent ownership in both&nbsp;tokens.   A Quirk of OCEAN-Datatoken Pools <p>This is a quirk that is neither good nor bad, but useful to understand. When an OCEAN-datatoken pool is first created, the only person able to add datatoken liquidity to the pool will be the publisher of the datatoken. Anyone else can then add OCEAN. For the non-publisher to add liquidity, someone needs to first buy the datatoken and then they be able to add liquidity for that datatoken.</p><p>This means that we can expect that when a new OCEAN-datatoken pool is first released, with OCEAN staked by others, the price of the datatoken will go up at first (as denominated in&nbsp;OCEAN).</p> On Being Profitable <p>To put it all together:</p><blockquote>profit = (transaction fees) + (farming rewards) - (impermanent loss) - (rug pull&nbsp;loss)</blockquote><p>Rug pulls can be viewed as a special case of IL, but to make the risk more clear, we provide it as a separate term. Risk of rug pull is&nbsp;real.</p><p>We want profit to be &gt;0, of course. What can help is to increase transaction fees, and to reduce IL. Let’s explore each&nbsp;further.</p><p>Here are tactics to increase transaction fees:</p>  Choose OCEAN-datatoken pools to maximize (# sales transactions) * (% fee in pool). This means finding ways to increase sales transactions, or simply increasing % fee. For the latter, fees that are too high may hurt transaction volume; but we do not yet know the sensitivity of fee to&nbsp;volume.  <p>Here are key tactics to reduce impermanent loss (IL) and rug&nbsp;pulls:</p>  First, improve your understanding of AMMs, IL, and rug pull mechanics. This will help you to better understand the risk-reward tradeoff and tactics. We link to some starting points&nbsp;below.  Second, avoid OCEAN-datatoken pools with a high chance of rug pull. You need to use your own judgement on this. Reputation is a key factor. Higher-reputation parties may be less likely to do a rug pull because they’ll want to maintain their reputation. Pseudonymous accounts will be less trustworthy and will need to build up a reputation over time. There are opportunities for the Ocean community to collectively build up knowledge of actors’ behavior over time and make assessments of reputation, to help in decisions of where to&nbsp;stake.  Another tactic to address IL is to monitor the price ratio, then pull out if the ratio changes by more than 10% or so. The exact number depends on the tradeoff to earning potential by transaction fees.  <p>Here are a couple more&nbsp;things.</p>  OCEAN-datatoken pools are powered by Balancer tech. This tech only lets LPs withdraw 1/3 of liquidity in any given transaction. This softens potential rug pull effects, but only a bit since an attacker could do several transactions in a row to remove most liquidity.  Finally, builders of AMM technology are working on various mechanisms to reduce the ill effects of impermanent loss. Balancer V2, Bancor V2, Uniswap V3 and others will have mechanisms to help. These will be released in coming&nbsp;months.  <p>Everyone using this technology must understand that they are using it at their own risk. And there are risks. Some may be uncomfortable adding liquidity due to the risk of impermanent loss or rug pulls. That’s ok. There’s definitely a risk-reward tradeoff. For those who with lower risk tolerance, another way to earn in Ocean is by finding and selling data itself. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-selling-data-in-ocean-market-9afcfa1e6e43">Here’s more info</a>. Second, we anticipate that tools and monitoring will improve over time, to make staking easier and less&nbsp;risky.</p> Learning More <p>To learn more about AMM pools, here are a couple places to&nbsp;start:</p>  Balancer documentation on AMMs&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/background">here</a>.  Uniswap documentation on AMMs&nbsp;<a href="https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works/">here</a>.  <p>To drill more into impermanent loss, these references are&nbsp;useful:</p>  “What is Impermanent Loss?” video at finematics.com, <a href="https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/">here</a>.  Cointelegraph article&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-impermanent-loss-on-uniswap-and-other-amms-is-always-permanent">here</a>.  Bancor article&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22">here</a>.  <p>Finally, there’s nothing like actually using the tools to gain intuition. We encourage you to play with adding liquidity on Balancer and Uniswap, e.g. to add and remove liquidity on OCEAN-ETH pools. Pay particular attention to the transaction fees earned, the liquidity mining earnings (BAL via <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-liquidity-mining-begins-6e65932eaea9">Balancer’s program</a>, <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/">UNI via Uniswap’s</a>), and the Impermanent Loss.</p>  <a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xa6cf0a736fbb441b3cd39a476699eeec4737f28e/">Here’s</a> the OCEAN-ETH pool on Balancer.  <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x9b7dad79fc16106b47a3dab791f389c167e15eb0">Here’s</a> the OCEAN-ETH pool on&nbsp;Uniswap.   Conclusion <p>This brief post described how staking in Ocean Market: balancing the earning opportunities with the risks towards profitability.</p><p>AMMs are powerful tools with pros and cons. We can expect that the pros and cons will emerge for OCEAN-datatoken pools too. We encourage everyone to take the time to understand AMMs, IL, and rug pulls.

Privileged accounts have traditionally been given to administrators to access critical data and applications. But changing business practices and upgrades to IT including cloud and other trends has meant that users of privileged accounts have become more numerous and widespread. An area in sharp focus is agile development teams such as DevOps and others that need secure access to privileged resources in the cloud; support for these has become essential to many organizations. Such teams need rapid access to privileged accounts, credentials and protected data, and PAM vendors are responding to this demand.</p>

With threats caused by compromised and weak credentials still rising by the day, one thing is clear: passwords are no longer able to fulfil the simple role they were designed&nbsp;for.</p> The problem with passwords  1. Stolen passwords are a top attack&nbsp;vendor <p>Stolen and weak passwords are one of top tools that criminals use when attempting to breach corporate networks. According to Verizon, stolen credentials and phishing attacks were the top cyberattack vendors last year, with at least <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/80-of-hacking-related-breaches-leverage-compromised-credentials/">eight in ten hacking incidents being tied back to compromised credentials.</a></p>Research from the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report 2020 found that stolen credentials and phishing attacks are still one of the top methods used by hackers to launch attacks on businesses. 2. Complex password policies are disregarded <p>To make matters worse,<a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/infographic-95-percent-share-6-passwords-with-friends.html"> employees often disregard password policies altogether,</a> with password sharing and reuse rampant in organizations. Unsprisingly, password sharing makes malicious actors coming across a set of company credentials extremely likely, giving them the power they need to launch large-scale attacks.</p> 3. Password costs skyrocketing <p>Organizations spend millions every year in a futile attempt to bolster the password. According to the World Economic Forum, a company with just 15,000 employees will spend <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">$5.2 million per year</a> for password resets alone, or a shocking $346 per employee.</p> There is good news: 99% of all hacks can be eliminated with multi-factor authentication — <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/">Microsoft</a> <p>Yet according to a study by LastPass, only <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/57-percent-of-businesses-use-multi-factor-auth-mfa-says-lastpass/">57% percent of companies have implemented some form of multi-factor authentication.</a></p> Why are companies resisting strong authentication? <p>Multi-factor authentication solutions are not as widely adopted as they should be because legacy market solutions are too cumbersome on users and/or too expensive to deploy at scale.

   Learn why the backbone of your IT stack may be overdue for an upgrade before it slows down productivity 

<p>The beautiful thing about IT is that it just runs. You open up your laptop, access your applications, and stay productive and focused throughout your day. The technology that goes on behind the scenes is somewhat irrelevant to your average user.</p>

<p>So when I say “directory services,” you may be tempted to move on and watch some cat videos on YouTube. Stay with me, humble reader, for herein lies an important message.</p>

 What are directory services? 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/directory-services">Directory services</a> are the databases that store some of the most essential information you need to do your job. They are often referred to as data stores, LDAP, and directories. The information stored in these vessels include your username, password(s), authentication preferences and enrollments, user preferences, application data and, more recently, information on devices such as mobile and Internet of Things (IoT). As you can see, much of this information is identity related.</p>

<p>What happens when you fire up an application? Whether it’s a cloud, mobile, or traditional application, and whether you’re using it for work or otherwise, the application is going to reach out to the one definitive source of identity truth in your organization – the directory. This is to validate that you’re still a legitimate user of the organization, that you’re authorized to access the application and to find out what you can do with it. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>But these days, directory services are under siege. Many organizations deployed their directory services many years ago, in the pre-cloud years, so they are running what we call “legacy” directories. While they still “work” in the traditional sense, there are reasons – both technical and non-technical – to believe we’re headed for a directory slow down.</p>

<p>The first reason is that the amount of information being put into directories is multiplying exponentially. Consider the “Things” in the Internet of Things (IoT). Estimates are that, in 2020 alone, the number of deployed Things will reach <a href="https://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/01/13/The-IoT-Rundown-for-2020.aspx?Page=1">31 billion</a>! That’s at least four times the number of people on the planet. And all this <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">IoT</a> data is being registered in directories.</p>

<p>The second reason directories are slowing down has to do with the ubiquitous nature of our work and home environments. Where do you work? If you’re like me, your work is anywhere you are. It’s certainly no farther away than your mobile phone or laptop in our hyper-connected world. This reality means directory services need to be distributed and highly available so that you can access the apps and services you need quickly. A slow link or an overwhelmed legacy directory sifting through millions of entries means you’ll wait to be authenticated and connected. Waiting is costly. Waiting is time. The result? Lost customers, decreased productivity for your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce</a> users, unhappy application owners, and a situation that will only get worse if not addressed quickly.</p>

<p>Directory services – the old iron of the business – need to go the way of the mainframe and green screen applications. They need to modernize!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that’s easier said than done. Modernizing directory services is probably not high on the list of projects for your IT database administrator this year. Or next year.</p>

<p>But there is a pathway, and real ROI to be realized by modernizing your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a> (IAM) solutions. It doesn’t have to be painful. ForgeRock has Accelerator toolkits that help organizations upgrade <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">legacy IAM</a> solutions in a prescribed way, so they can go at their own pace. Accelerators are a complete kit of everything you need to get started. They include documentation, reference architecture, and step-by-step processes that allow you to migrate one app at a time or 10 at a time, or many more.</p>

<p>Using a coexistence or just-in-time (JIT) strategy, you can run ForgeRock IAM alongside your existing directory to make sure there is no loss of data or lack of availability to applications. When you’re ready to cut the cord and move to modern IAM, you can disengage your legacy directory and say goodbye to those hefty maintenance costs.</p>

<p>ForgeRock has one of the few directory services on the market today that offers a deployment option to run in containers. A container is a ready-to-run software package that includes everything you need to run your directory service in a Kubernetes or Docker pod. They can run any cloud (or on premises) and use vastly fewer IT resources in your data center.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock</a> also natively supports all the apps you want, provides greater security, offers more fine-grained access control, and works both within and across your data centers.</p>

<p>For organizations to stay agile and productive, your directory services need to keep up with the growing needs or your users and customers. To learn more visit us online<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam"> at https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam</a>.</p>

<p>Digital identity innovation transpires in mysterious ways – and none seem as interesting as the recent conclusion of the 90-day experiment that the National Basketball Association ran to complete its season, popularly termed the “bubble”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some individuals (namely, fans of a historic franchise‚ it marked the joyous celebration of its first championship in ten years; for others, it was a somber day (i.e. game 5 Jimmy Butler hopefuls). For this OWI writer, it was mainly an opportunity to reflect upon the unique way in which the NBA chose to leverage digital identity — in particular, physical identity and access management (PIAM) — as well as the broad impact that the bubble will have on the sports industry and digital identity practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/07/16/nba-2020-return-disney-world-bubble-safety-aided-technology/5448594002/">A host</a> of <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/national-sports/sns-nyt-nba-bubble-life-coronavirus-20200806-qrby36mvffhlnkyot45hk7hqha-story.html">technologies</a>, designed to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spreading amongst the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29320883/inside-nba-100-page-safety-plan-big-questions-key-details">814 or so</a> NBA players, staffers, and coaches holed up in Orlando, were crucial to the bubble’s success. While among these, the most eye-catching tech may have been Oura, a $300 smart ring, (with a purported <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-bubble-oura-smart-ring-used-by-quarter-of-campus-2020-8">25%</a> of players, coaches, and staff wearing it), the wearable only acted as a small, optional asset to the larger system of physical identity and access management the NBA had set up in conjunction with Disney. In fact, I’d argue that the more important (and overlooked) technology, with broad ramifications for digital identity in everyday life, were the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2020/07/10/phoenix-suns-monty-williams-explains-essential-gadget-functions-orlando-bubble/5418966002/">Disney MagicBand </a>systems. Not only was it mandatory for every individual in the bubble to possess one, the bands were synchronized against <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/07/16/nba-2020-return-disney-world-bubble-safety-aided-technology/5448594002/">an individual’s health readiness</a> (i.e. forgetting to fill out symptom self-assessment denies entry) to allow entry to different access points. In essence, the NBA bubble created a stunningly successful PIAM system that managed and protected sensitive information and physical resources with appropriately tiered access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There and Back Again: Mapping OWI Predictions to the Present Moment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of our <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/product/the-perimeter-is-dead-148b-physical-access-market-to-lead-iam-growth/">predictions in 2018</a> about the PIAM market — including that border protection and terrorism/physical security would be tantamount as drivers for the market — may persist in being important for the general market. However, one might fairly conclude that during a pandemic seemingly without end in sight, PIAM’s future more closely resembles the NBA bubble: with digital credentials and wearables increasingly being leveraged against physical characteristics to broker access. Part of this shift has already happened with the introduction of old technologies in familiar places, such as <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2020/4/20/21228219/temperature-checks-coronavirus-testing-nyc-restaurants-reopening">temperature checks</a> for restaurants. Other parts of this shift have instead synthesized familiar products with newer contexts, including the use of <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/investigations/nbc-7-responds/artificial-intelligence-is-helping-usd-fight-the-pandemic/2424230/">facial recognition</a> alongside temperature checks to monitor mask usage and to <a href="https://www.usar.army.mil/News/Article/2381059/new-terminal-scanner-screens-temperatures-faces-to-improve-safety-at-usarc-fors/">trace the disease</a> across people to a limited capacity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, such a conclusion willfully ignores what is arguably the largest factor in determining PIAM’s growth – privacy. This concern is especially evident when observing the two technologies that have emerged as predominant modalities for access management: facial recognition and location/contact tracing. Facial recognition has long been somewhat of a hot-button topic for PIAM, and will likely be a bellwether for lasting change to PIAM adoption and public sensitivity. When, for example, Ticketmaster announced in 2018 that it had <a href="http://s1.q4cdn.com/788591527/files/doc_financials/2018/Q1/1Q18-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf">invested</a> in startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17329196/ticketmaster-facial-recognition-tickets-investment-blink-identity">Blink Identity</a> — which claims to be able to identify people walking by in “half a second” — musicians and fans alike were outraged. Numerous of the former called for a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/59n9yb/musicians-demand-ticketmaster-ban-facial-recognition-at-concerts">ban on the technology</a> at live events. &nbsp;Taylor Swift made headlines that same year for leveraging <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/13/taylor-swift-facial-recognition-stalkers-rose-bowl-concert">facial recognition</a> of concert attendees against a database of her known stalkers to administer stadium access. In the present moment, for school systems such as New York, <a href="https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/blog/data-privacy/2020/08/20/new-york-state-suspends-use-of-facial-recognition-in-public-schools">facial recognition technology</a> was placed under a moratorium to preserve privacy where possible. Similarly, contact tracing – spearheaded by nearly four dozen countries and large tech corporations to mitigate COVID-19 spread — has <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/17/contact-tracing-privacy-coronavirus-google-apple/">received significant backlash</a> in the United States for what some perceive to be privacy concerns around the government tracking their location or improper use of collected data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OWI Take</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve noted in our previous analysis that privacy will likely be an enduring issue for both vendors and regulators alike, and we anticipate this to persist even in light of COVID-19. The pandemic shift towards remote onboarding and digitized access has not offset any consumer sensitivity around data misuse or location tracking that have persisted with traditional PIAM products. With the bubble, residents were locked into participating for a few months and were more willing to shed concerns around potential privacy loss. PIAM enhancements were more easily accepted because residents bought into the integrity of the system and into the belief that the system was necessary as the best way to mitigate risk. And for those 90 days, the experiment worked to a tee. For many consumers in their day to day lives, however, the benefits aren’t as clear; some may even feel that because of their perceived ability to choose to engage with high risk environments (e.g. the grocery store), they don’t need enhanced PIAM as the best way to mitigate risk. As a result, consumers will likely continue to be guarded when it comes to their privacy, and the risk-benefit tradeoff for physical access — even during the pandemic — will not shift significantly.</p>

<p>By Jesús Salas, Associate, Responsible Technology</p><p>American consumers are increasingly concerned about privacy and data security when purchasing new products and services, which may be of a competitive advantage to companies that take action towards these consumer values, a new Consumer Reports (CR) study&nbsp;finds.</p><p>The new <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/downloads/CR_PrivacyFrontAndCenter_102020_vf.pdf">study,</a> “Privacy Front and Center: Meeting the Commercial Opportunity to Support Consumers Rights,” from CR’s Digital Lab with support from Omidyar Network, looks at the commercial benefits for companies that differentiate their products based on privacy and data security.</p><p>The report lays out a succinct timeline for the evolution of consumer attitudes toward privacy that culminates with a clear call to action for innovators. Through their comprehensive research methodologies, CR has been able to draw out the nuance around when, why, and how much privacy and security features matter for individuals looking to use and buy security cameras, connected cars, smart speakers, and other products. The report also contextualizes the role that both rule-making through regulation and the supply of better products can have to meet the growing market&nbsp;demand.</p><p>“This study shows that raising the standard for privacy and security is a win-win for consumers and the companies,” said Ben Moskowitz, the director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. “Given the rapid proliferation of internet connected devices, the rise in data breaches and cyber attacks, and the demand from consumers for heightened privacy and security measures, there’s an undeniable business case for companies to invest in creating more private and secure products.”</p><p>Here are some of the key findings from the&nbsp;study:</p>  According to CR’s February 2020 nationally representative survey, 74% of consumers are at least moderately concerned about the privacy of their personal&nbsp;data.  Nearly all Americans (96%) agree that more should be done to ensure that companies protect the privacy of consumers.  A majority of smart product owners (62%) worry about potential loss of privacy when buying them for their home or&nbsp;family.  The privacy and security conscious consumer class seems to include more men and people of&nbsp;color.  Experiencing a data breach correlates with a higher willingness to pay for privacy, and 30% of Americans have experienced one.  Of the Android users who switched to iPhones, 32% indicated doing so because of Apple’s perceived privacy or security benefits relative to&nbsp;Android.  <p>The study draws from a nationally representative CR survey of 5,085 adult U.S. residents conducted in February 2020, a meta-analysis of 25 years of public opinion studies, and a conjoint analysis that seeks to quantify how consumers weigh privacy and security in their hardware and software purchasing decisions.</p><p>Omidyar Network is honored to support this endeavor to both understand and inform the commercial case for investments in security and privacy-enhancing technology. While privacy should not be turned into an out-of-reach luxury, these findings do present an opportunity for companies to be among the first to differentiate and capture market share or leverage consumer’s willingness to pay in the short-term. Over time, we expect many privacy and data security features to become “table stakes,” in which case first movers will innovate and raise standards further.</p><p>Supporting efforts like this is key to our vision of enabling responsible technology that promotes well-being and individual liberty. To accomplish this, we support different levers that drive competition and innovation while safeguarding to manage risks and unintended consequences.</p><p>CR also recently launched an updated and expanded website for the <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard</a> with Omidyar Network joining as a strategic partner. The Digital Standard is an evolving, open source framework used by independent testing organizations, researchers and product teams to evaluate how technologies respect consumers’ privacy and security interests. It serves as a resource for companies looking to implement and take action on stronger privacy and security, as well as ownership and governance.</p><p>We encourage innovators to leverage and enhance this tool to collectively raise the standard on technology, and grow a culture of responsibility within companies overall.</p>

<p>The MATTR team is excited to announce a critical new addition to our product capabilities. We’re continuing to build out an extensive suite of features to support the exchange of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs), leveraging the best efforts of the open-source community along with a number of distinct product innovations. These innovations include our recent work related to using <a href="https://mattr.global/using-privacy-preserving-zkp-credentials-on-the-mattr-platform/">BBS+ signatures for privacy-preserving selective disclosure</a> and our earlier work on the<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/"> OIDC Credential Provider spec.</a> We’ve also been busy sharing new tools for <a href="https://mattr.global/new-to-json-ld-introducing-json-ld-lint/">checking the syntax of a JSON-LD credential</a> during development.</p><p>In this product release, we are focused on one of the fundamental capabilities in any credential-based system: the ability to provably revoke a credential when it’s no longer valid. Using verifiable data in combination with open standards not only improves the quality of the data exchanged in an ecosystem, it also enables the authority (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer">issuer</a>) on any piece of information to maintain that data throughout its lifecycle. In practice, this means that credential issuers can manage the status of a credential directly, using the same general mechanism as the one used for issuing&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Credentials are typically stored by the user (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject">subject</a>) in some kind of digital wallet where they are able to manage their credentials and control when and how to share their data. When accessing services, the user may consent to present their VCs to a relying party (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifier">verifier</a>). The relying party needs to be able to be able to verify the credential is genuine and tamper free. They also need to be able to easily validate whether a presented credential has been revoked or&nbsp;not.</p><p>For example, say you’re issued a digital driver’s license, then you go and get several speeding tickets. The department that issued your license determines you have breached the terms of your license and consequently, suspends your license. In doing so, the credential status is changed, and next time a relying party checks the status they will be able to see that you are no longer entitled to drive. If a car rental office is checking your driving status in order to loan you a vehicle, they’d like to be able to verify if the digital license is still valid and legitimate.</p>User journey viewing a credential &amp; presentation request with a revoked credential.<p>In general, we want to accomplish all of these goals while minimizing the burden on data issuers and verifiers, and preserving the autonomy of credential holders in deciding how to store and disclose their data. We also want to remain flexible around where the revocation list is stored and managed, so we opted to implement an approach that’s extensible to different types of infrastructure supported by the issuer. The resulting solution contrasts with others that have tended to be tightly coupled with a particular kind of infrastructure such as a distributed ledger. We believe revocation should be built in a simple, transparent, and standardizable manner, which is why we built our approach on the W3C CCG’s <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-rl-2020/">Credential Revocation List</a>.</p><p>Practically, the information regarding whether a credential has been revoked is represented in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status">credential status</a> property of a VC, as defined in the W3C spec. When a credential is first created, the issuer can include in the credential status field a reference to a publicly available revocation list. This list can be updated by the issuer at any time, so resolving this reference will always get you the latest revocation status. The retrieved revocation list is in the form of a <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> based verifiable credential, making it straightforward to validate. Holders and verifiers can simply check this revocation list to determine if a specific VC has been revoked or not. Since the revocation list contains the revocation status of many credentials, credential subjects get “herd privacy” with regards to the issuer, meaning the issuer doesn’t know where an issued credential is being used. This protects the holder against one form of surveillance and potential leakage of their personal data. Some use cases will require solutions that offer an even greater level of privacy for credential subjects, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(cryptography)">cryptographic accumulators</a>. We are actively working on a number of improvements in this area which will offer enhanced privacy for credential holders when it’s required and simplify the process of relying parties validating a credential’s status.</p><p>We’ve implemented this functionality using a simple optional flag on our VC issuance API, allowing issuers to toggle between credentials that support revocation and those that don’t. On the holder side, our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet App</a> automatically checks the revocation status when opened, alerting the user of any changes and giving them a warning if it’s revoked. For verifiers, validating credential status is a standard part of our VC verification API, so validation will automatically fail if the credential is&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>Integrating revocation into our platform brings us one step closer to building a fully realized verifiable data ecosystem, an environment where verifiers can have more confidence and trust in the decisions they’re making and people can participate in the sharing and exchange of information without eroding their basic privacy. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the community and gathering feedback from industry to enhance and extend different ways to accomplish revocation while respecting users’ digital rights. <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">Sign up</a> on our website to get access to our platform and check out <a href="http://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/revocation/revocation-overview">MATTR Learn</a> to start issuing revocable credentials.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-support-for-revocation-of-verifiable-credentials-2342b66b0997">Adding support for revocation of Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Omidyar Network’s Statement on US v. Google, Filed Today by the US Department of&nbsp;Justice <p>Today marks a new chapter in the long history of US enforcement of antitrust law. The filing of this lawsuit is recognition that digital platforms, namely Google, have used illegal and improper means to maintain their dominance.</p><p>Over many years, Google has exercised tremendous control over the marketplace of online search. This complaint makes a strong case for how Google manipulated the online search market by paying billions to secure default positions on browsers and mobile handsets to exclude rivals, by denying interoperability to challengers, and by preferencing its own products and services in search&nbsp;results.</p><p>The DOJ did not sue Google because it has grown large or successful. Rather, the investigation yielded sufficient <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">evidence</a> to show Google has violated US antitrust law — a set of rules that apply to everyone, and are designed to make sure all of us benefit from free markets and fair competition.</p><p>The ideal outcome of this lawsuit is the restoration of competition and safer, more innovative choices for consumers in the online search market. We know that Google’s profit motive influences the content they deliver. Google searches often lead people to Google’s own goods and services, to those who pay Google for our attention, and down rabbit holes of misinformation, hate, and extremism. All of these “results” bolster time spent on the platforms and Google’s revenues. Surely, other search engines, if not excluded from the market, could design algorithms that were safer and more consistent with society’s values.</p><p>Today’s filing is an important first step in enforcing existing laws governing Google’s improper past conduct. But this journey is not over; the legal process could take many years to resolve, and other concerns will need to be addressed. For example, Google also used its online search dominance to develop another illegal monopoly in the digital advertising market. Americans deserve and expect that Google will be held accountable for all of its anti-competitive and otherwise harmful conduct as well as prevented from engaging in similar abuses in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Consumers, competition, our economy, and our democracy have already paid too high a price for what are seen as “free” services. Undoubtedly, Google has provided valuable, innovative services that have become essential to everyone’s lives, creating the foundation for how we live, work, and play. And like other necessities that are embedded in our lives — power, water, cars — technology companies should be held to the highest standards. However, if left <a href="https://omidyar.com/uncheckedpower-the-root-of-big-tech-issues/">unchecked</a>, Google’s practices will continue to create serious consequences for advertisers, publishers, foreclosed technological rivals, and the&nbsp;public.</p><p>To that end, and alongside this case, we call for federal attention toward the ad-tech stack and support for state-level antitrust cases directed at other aspects of Google’s sprawling businesses. Because antitrust action alone will not restore competition to these markets, Congress should also continue to pursue the development of <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3429">new laws and&nbsp;rules</a>.</p>

Stay tuned for a full&nbsp;recap!</p>#IIW31 with nearly 250 participants from around the&nbsp;world  Filecoin launch  WIRED on online&nbsp;parks  What the original iPhone teaches us about networks and innovation  Satya Nadella on Microsoft’s SSI initiative  Stuff happens   1. Filecoin’s hotly anticipated mainnet launched last week on Oct.&nbsp;15. Filecoin and IPFS creator Juan Benet, Photo: Protocol&nbsp;Labs<p>If you’ll recall, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> was one of the hottest ICOs of 2017, raising $205 million in its token sale. The vision was a decentralized storage alternative to centralized cloud solutions like Amazon Web Services built around the Interplanetary File System or IPFS protocol.</p><p>And though there were some early hiccups since the launch <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-price-first-trading-futures">around price volatility</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-miners-go-on-strike-one-day-after-mainnet-launch-prompting-early-reward-release">mining economics</a>, as you might expect with a much hyped release, Filecoin is now&nbsp;live!</p><p>If you’re curious about how IPFS works, Hacker Noon <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f">has a useful beginner’s guide</a>.</p><p>First off, the way we manage our data hasn’t really changed much since the birth of the&nbsp;Web:</p><blockquote>HTTP is great for loading websites but it wasn’t designed for the transfer of large amounts data (like audio and video files). These constraints possibly enabled the emergence and mainstream success of alternative filesharing systems like Napster (music) and BitTorrent (movies and pretty much anything).</blockquote><blockquote>Fast forward to 2018, where on-demand HD video streaming and big data are becoming ubiquitous; we are continuing the upward march of producing/consuming more and more data, along with developing more and more powerful computers to process them. Major advancements in cloud computing have helped sustain this transition, however the fundamental infrastructure for distributing all this data has remained largely the&nbsp;same.</blockquote><p>IPFS looks to change&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>IPFS attempts to address the deficiencies of the client-server model and HTTP web through a novel p2p file sharing system. This system is a synthesis of several new and existing innovations. IPFS is an open-source project created by Protocol Labs, an R&amp;D lab for network protocols and former Y Combinator startup. Protocol Labs also develops complementary systems like IPLD and Filecoin, which will be explained below. Hundreds of developers around the world contributed to the development of IPFS, so its orchestration has been a massive undertaking.</blockquote><p>The end&nbsp;result?</p><blockquote>IPFS provides high throughput, low latency, data distribution. It is also decentralized and secure. This opens up several interesting and exciting use cases. It can be used to deliver content to websites, globally store files with automatic versioning &amp; backups, facilitate secure filesharing and encrypted communication.</blockquote><p>Where Filecoin comes into&nbsp;play:</p><blockquote>Filecoin is a separate protocol designed to add economic incentives to file storage on IPFS, and foster a distributed storage market that rivals enterprise cloud storage (like Amazon S3, etc). Instead of centralized infrastructure with fixed pricing, IPFS + FileCoin offers storage on a global network of local providers who have the freedom to set prices based on supply and demand. Instead of a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm like Bitcoin, Filecoin uses Proof-of-Storage to ensure security and reliability. So anyone can join the network, offer unused hard drive space on their computing device, and get rewarded in Filecoin tokens for data storage and retrieval services.</blockquote><p>All of which is really neat and a reminder that there is a ton of really cool innovation continuing to happen in the space. What also sets Filecoin apart is how successfully they’ve been at getting the word out and drumming up interest in the project. At the time of this writing, their newly launched token has a market cap north of around $600&nbsp;million.</p><p>And as Greg Kidd has noted, you could see a future where GlobaliD employs Filecoin for our self-sovereign storage solution.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-mainnet-launch">Filecoin Confirms Long-Awaited Mainnet Launch for Next Month — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f">A Beginner’s Guide to IPFS | Hacker&nbsp;Noon</a>   2. So Filecoin is a really cool idea with a ton of potential. And in time when more and more of our lives happen online, we need more cool ideas. WIRED’s idea? We need more and better online&nbsp;parks. <p>It’s how we could fix the “broken internet,” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/to-mend-a-broken-internet-create-online-parks/">WIRED suggests</a> (via&nbsp;Mitja):</p><blockquote>We need public spaces, built in the spirit of Walt Whitman, that allow us to gather, communicate, and share in something bigger than ourselves.</blockquote><p>And private parks won’t do the&nbsp;trick:</p><blockquote>MUCH OF OUR communal life now unfolds in digital spaces that feel public but are not. When technologists refer to platforms like Facebook and Twitter as “walled gardens” — environments where the corporate owner has total control — they’re literally referring to those same private pleasure gardens that Whitman was reacting to. And while Facebook and Twitter may be open to all, as in those gardens, their owners determine the&nbsp;rules.</blockquote><blockquote>Venture-backed platforms make poor quasi-public spaces for three&nbsp;reasons.</blockquote><blockquote>First, as the legendary venture capitalist Paul Graham put it, “startups = growth.” The focus on growth — of users, of time spent, and then of revenue — is the defining trait that has made Facebook a $750 billion company. And the key to rapid growth is optimization to create a “frictionless” experience: The more relevant the content you see, the likelier you are to click, return to Facebook, and bring your&nbsp;friends.</blockquote><blockquote>But friction is essential to public space. Public spaces are so generative precisely because we run into people we’d normally avoid, encounter events we’d never expect, and have to negotiate with other groups that have their own needs. The social connections that run-ins create, social scientists tell us, are critical in binding communities together across lines of difference. Building a healthy community requires the careful generation of this thick web of social ties. Rapid growth can quickly overwhelm and destroy it — as anyone who has lived in a gentrifying neighborhood knows.</blockquote><p>Also, the challenges (the first of which is funding):</p><blockquote>Second, there’s a talent and research problem. People outside of tech generally underestimate how hard it is to build something seamless, intuitive, and irresistible that allows millions of people to interact. We need to rally a diverse, representative generation of builders to this cause. And given that digital products live and die by metrics, we need to identify signals that correspond to flourishing public digital&nbsp;spaces.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, there’s a problem of public imagination. Fixing our ability to connect and build healthy communities at scale is arguably an Apollo mission for this generation — a decisive challenge that will determine whether our society progresses or falls back into conspiracy-driven tribalism.

 What prevents public statistics to be a competitive advantage for the&nbsp;EU? <p>Statistics and research are relying on huge amounts of data from different sources. Being able to provide current, detailed, segmented and broadly supported statistics is a key source of evidence-based research and decision&nbsp;making.</p><p>Sources can vary from public administrations, businesses or any organization or individual aggregating data of public or collaborative interest.</p><p>Currently the “statistics departments” of public administrations are creating reports based on limited data and detail (e.g. in regards to segmentation) periodically with longer timeframes. Data collection is in part mandatory and data providers do not have intrinsic motivation to provide data. The whole reporting structure is pretty static and is not very adaptive to growing needs and possibilities for data consumers.</p><p>Examples for reporting “services” provided by public administrations are statistics about economy and trade, environment, government and labour. And there are some statistics around currently important topics like on COVID-19.</p><p>That means there are existing structures and expertise in public administrations and research that have data science capabilities and procedures that are providing value to the&nbsp;public.</p><p>Our goal is to expand these data capabilities (especially unlock more data) and better enable collaboration with private players (serve their needs and make it a competitive advantage), be it as data providers or data consumers. We believe the untapped potential in this space is huge and could be quite easily unlocked.</p><p>With this post we want to present an approach that could unlock the full potential, foster focussed collaboration between public and private bodies and create a self-governing ecosystem on the Ocean Protocol Open Source Web3 Platform.</p><p>We start with the main unsolved challenges we believe prevent mentioned actors so far from better collaboration.</p> Challenge 1: Confidentiality, privacy and fear of&nbsp;misuse <p>Making data available for the purpose of state-curated statistics and reporting is pretty difficult today as required data might be confidential or there might be concerns of sharing data permanently due a fear of misuse, data leaks or permanent loss of control. This is true for understandable reasons and there should be no compromise of data privacy, data confidentiality and data availability. We should not reduce the level of data privacy regulation and enforcement for the purpose of making data more available. And we should empower citizens, businesses, public administrations and any organization to become as data sovereign as possible. Especially in this area Europe is in the lead from a regulatory, mindset and technology perspective.</p> Challenge 2: Lack of incentives and difficulty to bootstrap the data ecosystem <p>Even if challenge 1 can be solved, which is the biggest hurdle, there needs to be incentives for organizations to participate in a broader data exchange. As we expect data network effects in many areas, we are presented with a typical bootstrapping problem. In this case a critical mass of data is needed, not money. Once the ecosystem has achieved this critical mass, it is providing more value to the members in the form of compute outcomes and insights than they put into the system. Bootstrapping could be orchestrated or at least supported by public administrations providing data.</p> Challenge 3: Lack of participatory decision making and user-inspired continuous innovation <p>Data providers and other actors who add value should have a say in what happens with the data they provide access for public authorities or any entity making sense of decentral datasets. In addition in many cases data providers can also be data consumers of compute outcomes (reports, statistics, forecasts or benchmarks). But how can it be decided what kind of outcomes are of value? This points to a coordination problem that should involve and engage the whole data ecosystem for decision making, especially the private “users” of the compute outcomes. As one purpose of public statistics is to form a valuable source of better decision making in the whole ecosystem and whole&nbsp;society</p> Establishing a Public-Private Data Ecosystem with Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Besides mandatory reporting obligations of public administrations, businesses and organizations, we believe — with the right level of privacy and incentivisation — there is a chance to bootstrap a public-private data ecosystem to cater joint statistical, reporting, forecasting and benchmarking requirements for the good of the whole ecosystem and society. There are three steps on the journey to a public-private data ecosystem that address the main challenges.</p> Step 1: Compute-to-data <p>Organisations could opt-in to the service and provide datasets for statistical analysis and&nbsp;beyond</p>  without ever losing control about the data&nbsp;and  without anybody getting direct exposure to the&nbsp;data  <p>via the privacy-preserving compute-to-data approach of Ocean Protocol. That means data resides on the system of the data provider and the data provider keeps control about the data at any time. Ocean Protocol orchestrates the compute needed to leverage the data for e.g. statistical, data science for AI purposes.</p><p>Since, data providers never have to give access to their data (but only provide access to compute resources that use these data internally and within the data provider’s premises), data privacy and data ownership issues are solved. Also, data providers get to validate the algorithms before they can be allowed to train on the private&nbsp;data.</p><p>The data providers would <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/setup/compute-to-data/">setup compute infrastructure</a> using Ocean Protocol. This setup enables data providers to allow the data consumer (or any non-trusted third party) to get access to compute on their data. In this case data is still sitting in the data provider’s database or data repository, but the data consumer can now send their algorithms to train on these datasets.</p><p>This approach is not only GDPR compliant but even fully preserves privacy of the input data. No data pooling or data transfer is needed which would require other mostly organizational measures to keep as much privacy as possible but would mean the data provider to effectively lose control. For more information on Ocean Protocol Compute-to-Data Approach please have a look at this <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/v2-ocean-compute-to-data-guide-9a3491034b64">Blogpost</a>.</p> Step 2: Compute Outcomes as Incentivisation <p>To allow access to compute on these datasets, data providers may also be incentivized using Ocean Protocol’s data incentivisation features.</p><p>Incentivisation can be established in the form of preferred access to compute outcomes, e.g. governed by datatokens. In the case of this scenario compute outcomes can be aggregated data, statistics, forecasts and benchmarks. Even monetizing access and marketing specific compute outcomes to the public or specific target groups would be possible when conforming to the chosen data governance.</p><p>In addition to incentivizing data providers for giving privacy-preserving access to their data there is also the possibility to provide scientists and developers with incentives for providing algorithms like prediction models or forecasting algorithms</p><p>Fair Incentivization of every actor in the data value chain is crucial to unlocking more data. Establishing an incentivisation mechanism is a prerequisite to create a positive feedback loop (flywheel) and to grow the ecosystem in members and depth of&nbsp;data.</p> Step 3: Collaborative Data Governance <p>Data governance in the described context currently is done centrally by public administrations and is pretty static. Giving especially data providers the opportunity to also become preferred data consumers to fuel benchmarking and their own planning and decision processes would be a huge advantage for the ecosystem. In addition letting these participants jointly decide what kind of input data and compute outcomes are of interest for them would be helping to continuously advance the ecosystem and adapt to external and internal change based on members’ preferences and&nbsp;needs.</p><p>The governance bodies could be established as data trusts, data cooperatives or as DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organisation). In general every decision that is related to the jointly created data assets could be taken by this entity, including decisions about what compute outcomes should be public and what are available exclusively only to members or groups of members. But it could also include decisions about which kind of additional compute outcomes should be jointly&nbsp;created.</p> A phased approach to implementing a Public-Private Statistics Data Ecosystem <p>The three Ocean Protocol functionalities described above are functional independently and can be implemented subsequently.</p><p>Compute-to-Data is the foundation. In addition the level of change of an implementation is&nbsp;limited.</p><p>Growing to Incentivization would be a logical second functional implementation step being able to especially fuel availability of data by creating additional value for the data ecosystem.</p><p>Fostering a sustainable data ecosystem requires not only effective and fair incentization but also participatory governance mechanisms. So data governance would mark the third implementation step. However achieving this will require new forms of collaboration and significant change to the status quo. Of the numerous initiatives attempting to solve this two of the most promising include the EU Data Strategy and&nbsp;GAIA-X.</p> EU Data Strategy and&nbsp;GAIA-X <p>The EU Data Strategy aims to create industry data spaces as a basis for better collaboration within industries. This could mean any data that is of relevance for industry participants and especially aims at supporting the data hungriness of AI and data science. There is the goal to experiment in that space and gain important insights in the area of how to make data available while keeping high levels of data privacy e.g. by establishing data intermediaries like data trusts or data cooperatives. The focus is on data regulation that effectively supports data-related values and goals of actors in the EU. In other words, finding the “EU way for&nbsp;data”.</p><p>GAIA-X starts from three perspectives: (1) use cases or business challenges of users and (2) a technology foundation which includes standards, APIs and other building blocks in order to allow for composability and compliance and (3) a regulatory framework. So GAIA-X brings together all kinds of actors to create an ecosystem of technology providers, technology adopters and the regulatory authorities. There are many projects ongoing to implement use cases on the basis of the GAIA-X framework.</p><p>Both are aiming for more digital and data sovereignty not only for businesses.</p> Innovating with immediate impact — Four possible MVEs (Minimal Viable Ecosystems) <p>Bootstrapping data ecosystems is a two-sided challenge, as data providers are required to provide data and data consumers are needed to make sense out of data. As soon as these two roles are separated, coordination is required and it becomes more difficult to bootstrap such an ecosystem. In our example scenario in some cases data providers providing their datasets could be incentivized by (1) receiving access to compute outcomes and (2) a voice in governing the data ecosystem. Making a one-sided ecosystem out of the originally two-sided ecosystem.</p><p>This structure simplifies bootstrapping, but still requires a minimal set of initial participants (critical mass) to form the minimal viable ecosystem (MVE).</p><p>We think the below mentioned use cases might be a good starting point for this reason, but also because they are purpose-led (purpose-defined) data ecosystems, that align a diverse group of members to a joint&nbsp;goal.</p><p>In addition we expect an immediate high impact, existing structures to build on and/or first steps already undertaken in the direction of data ecosystem thinking.</p> MVE 1: COVID-19 Protection and Relief Data Ecosystem <p>COVID-19 remains a challenge for our societies, both from a health perspective as well as an economic perspective. Protecting citizens effectively is a joint effort from different countries but also many different actors in the health sectors, public sector, research institutions and businesses. Allowing for better data collaboration and making as much relevant data available as possible could be making a difference.</p><p>There are already COVID-19 statistics available by Eurostat. With the outlined approach these could be extended e.g. by the questions of effectiveness of health protection, curation and of economic stimulus programs. In order to really increase the effectiveness of these measures much broader and much more granular information of healthcare providers, public administrations and businesses would be&nbsp;needed.</p> MVE 2: Enriched Economic Forecasting <p>Assessing the economic situation and economic forecasting is a regular and extensive task done by governments but also to some extent for every business. Having access to more data sources would be a game changer for providing more accurate and granular information.</p><p>Joining forces not only on providing and consuming data but also on governance of the process and content would unleash the joint power of data and talent. Businesses and public administrations would not only provide data but also would consume the jointly created aggregated views and datasets. These could feed in decision making and insights on every level of hierarchies.</p> MVE 3: “Digital made in de”&nbsp;V2 <p>The German Federal Government has shipped a service called “digital made in de” recently. It is a dashboard about the progress of digital transformation mainly aggregating data from public administrations and governments. It is very comprehensively showing statistics, project stati and explainers on the presented information. This dashboard could be subsequently enriched with more reports and a higher granularity of reports. What would you like to see in such a dashboard?</p> MVE 4: Interplanetary People Data Cooperative <p>Workforce and people data resides with businesses and organizations, public labour and education administrations and the workers itself. Data exchange is limited to mandatory processes and there is no oversight or systematic approach to improving workforce and labour decisions at all of these entities based on evidence and data. If you compare this to how financial reporting and decision making is professionalized within organisations and with finance, tax and other administrations we are sure there is huge potential for businesses, individuals and economy and society as a whole. Workforce data offers a high level of standardization and is relevant for everybody and every organisation, with better accuracy, timeliness and segmentation a people data cooperative could lead to better evidence- and data-based work-related decisions</p><p>Besides workforce and educational data, there might be citizens and other data to be included at a later&nbsp;stage.</p> Conclusions <p>Most of the currently most successful businesses are bigtechs championing the aggregation and consumption of data (via data science and AI) in a web2 setup at the same time. This not only means data providers losing control and sometimes privacy of the data permanently but also that they are not fairly participating in the value creation by the data consumers.</p><p>Therefore the above mentioned initiatives aim to create new forms of data consumption that guarantee data sovereignty and fair value sharing and at the same time make more data available for the right usage. What the “right usage” is should be decided by the data providers and other value creating participants in the data value chain (e.g. data curators) via a governance mechanism. These decisions should be in full control of the governance mechanism the data providers have chosen and should be self-enforcing ideally without the need of any institution or intermediary. In addition data providers should be fairly participating in the value creation resulting from the data consumption. This could be monetary incentives or exclusive access to outcomes of the data consumption process. In our case the compute outcomes are statistics, reports, forecasts and benchmarks.</p><p>We believe the potential of these community-owned data ecosystems is similar if not bigger than the one big techs have created. And we believe the time is now to bootstrap the first EU-style data ecosystems to showcase the power for the members of these ecosystems.</p><p>We suggest to further investigate the above mentioned “privacy-preserving private-public statistics ecosystem” as we are sure it can unlock value immediately and could grow consistently based on concrete requirements of ecosystem members. Public administrations could be integral in data bootstrapping this ecosystem but also should be complemented with data from any business or organization soon after an initial&nbsp;release.</p><p>Terms:</p><p>Data Provider: An individual or organization in legitimate control of data, that shares this data under specific conditions.</p><p>Data Curator: An individual or organization that adds value to a dataset e.g. by assessing, labelling or enriching the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Data Consumer: An individual or organization making sense of datasets, e.g. by leveraging data science or AI techniques to create aggregated data (data outcomes) or simply consuming the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Privacy-Preserving Compute: Making use of data without exposing data itself to the data consumer, which means preserving the privacy of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Compute Outcomes: Substrates of newly created data and datasets by applying “compute” (algorithms) that do not allow to determine back the original data inputs, but are based on all of input data. These could be compute outcomes like statistics, repotts, benchmarks and forecasts, but also more sophisticated outcomes like AI-trained neural networks.</p><p>Datatokens: Datatokens are a new asset class, technically they are fungible tokens that provide rights about datasets. These rights could be access rights or the right of participating in the monetization by the dataset. But these rights are not limited to that, especially based on the composability of the ethereum blockchain datatokens might also be used as a collateral for a loan, may be traded on exchanges or act as a right to vote in a DAO or other form of decision making or&nbsp;voting.</p><p>Bootstrapping: In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input at some point in time. In some cases this process needs to be consciously planned e.g. by acquiring early members or customers. We use it in the context of the data ecosystems, where there needs to be “enough” data available to really be able to create value for data consumers. We assume once critical mass is achieved positive data network effects allow for non-linear/exponential value creation.</p><p>Minimal Viable Ecosystem (MVE): We have created this expression in the context of the term minimal viable product (MVP). This refers to a first version or release of a software that is only providing the minimal functionality needed to create “enough” value for the users to make them adopt the software permanently. Typically the functionality and value increases over time attracting more and more users. At the same time MVE resonates with the idea of experimentation and the goal of feedback in order to continuously improve the system. Including technological, organisational and regulatory aspects.</p><p>Sources and References:</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/v2-ocean-compute-to-data-guide-9a3491034b64">Ocean Protocol V2 Compute-to-Data</a></p><p><a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/_node.html">Statistics of the Statistische Bundesamt in&nbsp;Germany</a></p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/covid-19/overview">Eurostat Statistics about&nbsp;COVID-19</a></p><p><a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Dossier/economic-development.html">Economic situation and cyclical development in Germany in October&nbsp;2020</a></p><p><a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/">GAIA-X — A federated Data Infrastructure for&nbsp;Europe</a></p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en">European Data&nbsp;Strategy</a></p><p><a href="https://www.digital-made-in.de/">Digital made in&nbsp;de</a></p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

					 <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) has largely developed and matured thanks to the rich conversations at the semi-annual <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW)—one of the most important user-centric digital identity events on earth. Not only does IIW act as a place to iron out specs and bring communities together, but it acts as a forcing function for implementors to demonstrate the solutions they’ve built over the last six months. IIW’s unique focus on community drives vendors to emphasize interoperability in their demonstrations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxi-31-2020b-tickets-113035646662">IIW #31</a> starting this morning, it’s the perfect time to reflect on how IIW continues to be a part of the interoperability story of the SSI community.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Trinsic's interoperability story 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Interoperability has always been of paramount importance to Trinsic. That story begins at an <a href="https://vonx.io/how_to/iiwbook">IIW #28 demo</a> with the Government of British Columbia where we demonstrated the first mobile app and enterprise SSI platform to comply with the Hyperledger Aries RFCs, achieving interoperability with the open source ariescloudagent-python. This was the first time two separate codebases demonstrated true interoperability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the Trinsic Wallet has been a standard tool for Aries developers to test the agents they’re building. In the Aries community, Trinsic became a leader of interoperability efforts, helping others debug when their implementations didn’t work with our wallet. In our view, spending time helping others in the community achieve interoperability was time well-spent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But this ad-hoc interoperability testing done via direct messages in RocketChat wasn’t scalable. As the number of Aries-based implementations grew, so too did the burden of maintaining and promoting interoperability. We are happy to say that only three IIW’s after the community’s first display of interoperability, a growing group of SSI vendors have convened to collaborate and hold each other to a high standard of interoperability through the formalization of vendor-to-vendor solution testing.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Formalizing interoperability between vendors 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>We are proud to work with the tremendous teams in our community to <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2020/10/19/trust-over-ip-foundation-introduces-a-new-tool-for-interoperable-digital-trust/">formalize vendor-to-vendor solution testing</a> according to test suites and interoperability profiles in the Technical Stack Working Group at the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a>. This group has been meeting weekly for several months, and we look forward to this group continuing to improve the interoperability requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meeting weekly for the last several months, we’ve formally tested the Trinsic platform with the products developed by the following projects. That means any developer that uses the Trinsic platform—including <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">Trinsic’s APIs</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>, and the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>—will inherit interoperability with solutions built using the following products:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a>  <a href="https://esatus.com/?lang=en">esatus AG</a>  <a href="http://doc.ibmsecurity.verify-creds.com/whats_new/">IBM</a>  <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a>  <a href="https://idramp.com/">idRamp</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Aries Cloud Agent Python</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .Net</a>  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you plan on attending IIW #31 this week, be sure to attend the session on ToIP interoperability profiles to learn more. As always, we encourage other vendors to join the cause with us so that three IIW’s from now, we will see dozens of interoperable SSI implementations that comply with the ToIP interoperability profiles.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Future interoperability efforts 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Our current and future interoperability efforts expand beyond the amazing work happening at the ToIP Foundation. We’re actively engaged in developing next-generation technologies including new zero-knowledge proof capabilities at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF), support for additional DID methods, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> compliant JSON-LD credentials. We will be leading a session this week at IIW #31 on some of our next-generation interoperability efforts, so stay tuned!</p>

					 <p>Each of Trinsic’s products are powered by the same interoperable core. With the Trinsic Studio, Trinsic Wallet, or our developer platform of 3 APIs, robust documentation, and SDKs in popular languages, your team can rest assured your implementation is powered by a company that prioritizes interoperability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Trinsic Studio:&nbsp;An easy-to-use web interface for managing credential exchange with no code. Also serves as the mechanism to acquire API keys and manage billing for paid plans.&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Try it for yourself completely free</a>, and issue a credential in less than 5 minutes!  Provider API:&nbsp;Our newest API enables developers to programmatically provision issuer and verifier cloud agents. Learn more about the provider API in the recent launch&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/">announcement</a>.  Credentials API:&nbsp;Our core API enables developers to have a turnkey way to issue, verify, and manage verifiable credentials on any Hyperledger Indy network. Check out our&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/">documentation</a>&nbsp;or one of our&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/streetcred-id/issuer-reference-app">reference</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/streetcred-id/verifier-reference-app">applications</a>&nbsp;to get started.  Wallet API:&nbsp;An API for creating and managing cloud wallets on behalf of credential holders. It’s the backend of our Mobile SDK, which you can read more about in our recent&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-wallets-3-decisions/">post</a>&nbsp;about building your own SSI wallets. Get started with the API by checking out the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/">documentation</a>.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Focusing on interoperability has been at Trinsic’s core since we began, because we want to ensure that verifiable credentials are as accessible and useful as possible to people everywhere. Making sure that SSI vendors’ solutions are interoperable with one another is one of the major steps to achieving that vision.</p>

News reports, heated policy debates, and perhaps especially our daily interactions with gig workers, freelancers, and virtual e-commerce storefronts all underscore a growing awareness that there is something essential and different about finding one’s way and earning a living in the platform&nbsp;economy.</p><p>This year, Caribou Digital has been working with <a href="https://qhala.com/">Qhala </a>and with the support of the <a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/">Mastercard Foundation</a> on a project exploring the “<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/segment-insights/">Quality of Youth Digital Livelihoods</a>” in Kenya. That research, with its particular focus on how young women in Kenya experience platform work and platform sales, is well underway.</p><p>As a way to connect to the ongoing research and policy discussions, and to help create our interview guide, we read everything we could — 75+ primary research studies of platform work and platform sales in the Global South. We excited to report that Caribou Digital and Qhala have just released v1.0 of that review in a <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QYDEL-v1.1.pdf">PDF</a>, and in a searchable, filterable, online resource in the form of an <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/evidence-gap-map/#tab-egm">evidence&nbsp;map</a>.</p><p>Underpinning these new resources is an emerging overarching framework for understanding platform livelihoods, our term for the broad umbrella encompassing both platform work and platform sales. This post, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">also a page on the platform livelihoods website</a>, is our most succinct (October 2020) version of the platform livelihoods framework.</p><p>More specifically, we define platform livelihoods as</p><blockquote>active human efforts, sometimes combined with tools or assets, deployed to create value outside of the constructs of a stable employer-employee relationship, mediated by the infrastructure and accompanying logic of digital platforms.</blockquote><p>From this definition, and drawing on that detailed literature review of 75 studies of platform livelihoods in the Global South, this framework addresses three broad questions for the digital development community:</p> What are the experiences of people with platform livelihoods? <p>We identify twelve elements — the kinds of experiences that individuals share and value when discussing their livelihoods with friends, family, and even the occasional researcher. They are a mix of economic, subjective, and broader human development experiences.</p>Platform Livelihood Experience Elements What are similarities and differences between platform livelihood types? <p>In the review, we offer a landscape of nine illustrative types of platform livelihood. Note that these are roles that individuals or small enterprises can fill, rather than “business models” or the names of specific platforms.</p><p>These are not the only roles that platforms are transforming or enabling, but these nine represent enough of the diversity in platform livelihoods to make two key distinctions. These types mix local and global (digital only) markets. Some of these roles are for individuals seeking work and offering their labor. Some of these roles are for small enterprises and even small farms, looking for new sales channels and new ways to connect with&nbsp;markets.</p><p>The early research and policy literature has been concentrated in platform work, especially ride-hailing, freelancing, and microwork. We feel strongly that platform work needs continued research and policy attention, as millions turn to platform labor amidst changing economies and a global pandemic.</p><p>At the same time, and in the longer run, platform sales (whether via marketplaces, social commerce, or search and discovery) may end up altering the livelihoods of millions&nbsp;more.</p><p>This lens suggests that these two growing domains, platform work and platform sales, are supported by overlapping affordances of platformization — indeed it is often the same platforms supporting job seekers and microentrepreneurs alike. The lens invites synthesis of insights for policy and practice that draws on both domains, while retaining space for more comparative or specific inquiry into one livelihood type at&nbsp;time.</p>Platform Livelihood Types What kinds of technologies and business models support platform livelihoods? <p>Individuals and small enterprises use a mix of platform services and approaches to pursue their livelihoods.</p>  The most easily recognizable way via formal digital marketplaces — the formal “multi-sided markets” in labor, goods and services, though with individuals and small firms can find customers.  Informal social commerce — selling goods, services and even ‘influence’ via personal Facebook pages, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. is also growing in popularity and impact, even if the research literature here is still&nbsp;sparse.  And there is often (still), search and discovery. Millions of small businesses pay for advertising on Facebook and Google and other social media platforms, Many work to refine how they appear on maps or other digital databases and apps. Some have websites or social media pages or storefronts of their own. These activities, too, support platform livelihoods.  <p>These activities and services blur and intersect as digital platforms continually slice and recombine, mediating the connections between sellers and their markets in ever-changing ways.</p><p>One the one hand, the digitalization and platformization of economies seems to reward sellers and workers who have developed capabilities in more or more of these than one approaches.</p><p>On the other hand, it is simultaneously a critical matter for inclusive digital development policy that these mediated connections do not divide, dissuade, or discriminate against small scale sellers and the self-employed.</p><p>In the longer run, we may update the online evidence map and accompanying discussion with a per-technology filter to better reflect differences and similarities (in practice and in policy) across these technological approaches.</p>Platform Livelihood Practices How to use this framework <p>By providing a common language framework, and a map of several kinds of platform livelihoods, this framework can help uncover many trends and cross cutting issues. For example, In this first iteration of the literature review we used the framework to explore four durable themes: <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">gender</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/rurality/">rurality</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/youth/">youth</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19/">COVID-19</a>. We also outline four emergent dynamics worthy of scrutiny: <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/fractional-work/">fractional work</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/amplification/">amplification</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/hidden-hierarchies/">hidden hierarchies</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/contestation/">contestation</a>.</p><p>We hope that you might and use this framework in your own research, design, or policymaking activities.

 Selling Your Proprietary Data, Others’ Proprietary Data, and Value-Adds to Open&nbsp;Data Ocean worker.&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.pikist.com/free-photo-spnja">Image</a>] Introduction <p>The upcoming <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">Ocean Market</a> app enables people and organizations to earn by staking / curating on data and by selling data. This article focuses on selling data. (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">This one</a> focuses on staking.)</p><p>Publishing and selling data in Ocean Market takes more effort than staking, but has more earning potential. In selling data, one is earning the sale value of the data asset itself, rather than a cut from transaction fees like in&nbsp;staking.</p><p>Here are three types of data that you might&nbsp;sell:</p>  Your proprietary data  Others’ proprietary data that you’ve acquired the rights&nbsp;to  Open data that you’ve added value&nbsp;to  <p>The rest of this article explores each in more&nbsp;detail.</p> 1. Selling Your Proprietary Data <p>Here, you create or dig up your own datasets, then post them for sale on Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>What might that data&nbsp;be?</p>  As an individual, it can be of personal data, such as your location data, browser history, or data you’ve exported from Facebook or&nbsp;23andme.  As a business, nonprofit, or city, it can be data that your organization has accumulated over time, which might be of value yet is sitting&nbsp;latent.  <p>If you’re worried about privacy or control of your data, consider using Ocean <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/how-ocean-compute-to-data-relates-to-other-privacy-preserving-technology-b4e1c330483">Compute-to-Data</a> rather than making the data downloadable.</p> 2. Selling Others’ Proprietary Data <p>A second approach is to sell data that others have the rights to (with their permission, of&nbsp;course).</p><p>Here, you find a data rightsholder, then act on their behalf to sell their data in Ocean Market. Compute-to-data can allay concerns of privacy or control. In this case you are playing the role of data&nbsp;broker.</p><p>A variant here is to create a “remix rights” contract with the data rightsholder, where you would add value to the data in some way, sell this value-added data, and give them a&nbsp;cut.</p> 3. Selling Value-Added Open&nbsp;Data <p>People who want to use open datasets can simply download them directly from a browser. For this variant, there is no need for Ocean! It would simply get in the way. And it would be silly to pay for&nbsp;it.</p><p>However, there is a way for you to earn from open datasets: add value to them, then sell the value-added datasets.</p><p>Here are some ways that you can add&nbsp;value:</p>  Tag or label data. For example, transcribing audio, or assigning bird species to bird photos. This helps for AI “supervised learning”.  Clean the data to make it easier to consume. For example, scrape public websites and put the information into a format that’s easy to for AI &amp; analytics tools to&nbsp;consume.  <p>If you’re a data scientist, you have more opportunities yet, including:</p>  Feature-engineer data to make it more tractable for others to model&nbsp;on.  Sell synthetic data. Get access to private data, use Compute-to-Data to calculate the synthetic data, and sell&nbsp;it.  Sell your trained AI&nbsp;models.   Conclusion <p>This brief post described how to earn by selling data using Ocean Market, with a focus on types of data to sell: your proprietary data, others’ proprietary data, and value-adds to open&nbsp;data.</p> Next Steps / Further&nbsp;Reading   Article introducing Ocean Market: “Ocean Market: An Open-Source Community Marketplace for Data.

<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4068">Human-centric Data &amp; Identity Management – Implementing Real World Case Studies</a><br><br>Earlier in 2020, the European Union published “A European Strategy for Data” outlining its vision for a connected single digital market where the benefits of the digital economy could enhance the lives of its citizens, residents and trade partners.<br><br>However, we now find ourselves at a very real crossroad. A post-pandemic world will be a new type of normal. Amidst the tragic loss of lives there have been breakthroughs in science, new ways of working along with embracing new digital tools.<br><br>We are at the beginning of a new design and architectural phase where just because technology can, doesn’t mean it should. Personal data linked to identity, fuelled by AI sits at the centre of these decisions.<br><br>Enabling citizens, students, patients, passengers and consumers to more equitably join the value chains fuelled by data will ultimately lead to greater trust and personalisation, resulting in a more prosperous society. However, this will require new commercial models, enforceable regulation and the digital tools to transform our connected society.<br><br>This session will focus on the implementation of real-world case studies including standards, commercial models and technology choices.

Data Sovereignty Now: unleashing the benefits of data in line with European values<br>Webinar: Thursday 22 October 2020 – 14:15:15 CET




 




On behalf of ourselves and our partners, <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org/2020/09/30/event-webinar-datasovereignty-now-political/">we are pleased to invite you to our webinar </a>debate on ‘Data Sovereignty Now: unleashing the benefits of data in line with European values’. The webinar is especially interesting for politicians and their staff in Europe.



It is the aim of the European Commission and local governments to unleash the full benefits of data usage for everyone in Europe in line with European values. Data sovereignty holds the key to achieving that.<br><br>It is a worthy ambition, but one that also raises a number of questions, such as what exactly is data sovereignty, how does it support European values, and how can organisations in the public/private sector help to accomplish this ambition?<br><br>These questions will be addressed in the webinar on 22 October.<br><br>Featuring:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arief-ernst-hühn-1721bb40/">Arief Hühn</a>, researcher at&nbsp;FreedomLab, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericpol/">Eric Pol</a>, founder of A New Governance and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a>, CEO &amp; Founder of Meeco.<br><br>Followed by panel discussion featuring&nbsp;the following experts: Eric Pol, Katryna Dow, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsinipuro/">Jaana Sinipuro</a> (project director at Sitra), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerardvdhoeven/">Gerard van der Hoeven</a> (director of&nbsp;the iSHARE Foundation) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/douwel/">Douwe </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/douwel/">Lycklama</a> (founder of&nbsp;INNOPAY).<br>

 An educational resource to learn about the Ocean toolkit — for the community, by the community <p>Ocean Academy is a community initiative created by four passionate Ocean Ambassadors. They aimed to have the broadest reach possible, including AI practitioners, data scientists and data owners, who may not yet be familiar with blockchain and smart contracts.</p><p>As the team started working on the project, it became clear that this project could go beyond credentialing, and serve as an outreach platform for Web3 and Ocean Protocol. And so, Ocean Academy came to fruition.</p> An Introduction <p><a href="https://oceanacademy.io?ref=oann">Ocean101</a>, the first educational module in Ocean Academy, consists of 23 chapters providing a beginner’s friendly introduction to blockchain technology. It focuses on how Ocean Protocol enables new forms of value creation and how it transforms data science workflows for practitioners.</p><p>Ocean101 is for anyone who is interested in learning how to monetize data and analytic services using blockchain technology. It was designed to provide a practical and interactive introduction to blockchain and Ocean Protocol, at no cost for the&nbsp;users.</p><p>The Ocean Academy team wants to spark the interest of the AI/data science community, with the <a href="https://oceanacademy.io?ref=oann">Ocean101</a> module, and join the open future for data science movement.</p> What to&nbsp;Expect <p>In the first few chapters of Ocean101, participants install their own Ethereum wallet, become familiar with the basic concepts of blockchain, and receive play tokens to experience first hand how Web3&nbsp;works.</p><p>Next comes a deep dive into smart contracts, and how they are used in the context of data science. Ocean Protocol’s infrastructure is presented, with a focus on how one can create value from data and algorithms.</p><p>At the end of <a href="https://oceanacademy.io?ref=oann">Ocean101</a>, a completion certificate is awarded! The module also provides new mental models and tools to enable the open future for data&nbsp;science.</p> The Future is&nbsp;Here <p>More modules are envisioned going forward, tackling more technical aspects of how Ocean Protocol can liberalize data, with its future releases.</p><p>Building a strong community is important in all blockchain networks. If you want to be an active member of the data economy, make Ocean Academy the first step in your&nbsp;journey.</p><p><a href="https://oceanacademy.io">Give it a try</a> and let us know what you think! You can also <a href="https://github.com/learn-ocean/ocean-academy?ref=oann">contribute to Ocean&nbsp;Academy</a>.</p><p><a href="https://oceanacademy.io">Ocean Academy</a></p><p>Special thanks to Gherardo Lattanzi, Albert Peci, Aymeric Bethencourt, and Laurent Rochat for creating and maintaining Ocean&nbsp;Academy.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

					  16.10.2020. Die EU-Datenstrategie fordert verantwortungsvolle Ökosysteme für personenbezogene Daten – MyData-Operatoren sind die Antwort.  comuny ist nun offiziell eines dieser richtungsweisenden Systeme.<br> <p>Eine weltweite Bewegung führender Unternehmen und Experten stellt sich auf für das neue Normale beim Datensharing und zeichnet das Produkt Trust Data Operator des deutschen Security-Startups comuny GmbH mit dem bemerkenswerten Status “MyData Operator 2020” aus.</p><p>Die Auszeichnung wurde am 14.10.2020 an sieben weltweit führende Unternehmen aus sieben Ländern verliehen, die sich alle für einen ausgewogenen Umgang mit persönlichen Daten einsetzen. “Wir sind überglücklich und bekommen mit dieser Auszeichnung eine weitere Bestätigung dafür, wie innovativ und wertvoll der Einsatz unseres Produktes ist”, so Beatrix Reiß, die zusammen mit ihrem Geschäftspartner Dominik Deimel comuny zu diesem Erfolg geführt hat. “Dominik und ich kommen aus dem eHealth-Markt und wissen aus langjähriger Erfahrung, vor welchen Hürden Modelle für neue Services, Versorgung und Zusammenarbeit stehen. Das wollten wir ändern.”</p><p>comuny erhält diese Auszeichnung für den Nachweis, wie verifizierte Daten zwischen Unternehmen und Kunde, Diensten und Lösungspartnern unter Einbeziehung und zum Vorteil aller Beteiligten übergreifend fließen. Der comuny Trust Data Operator beweist als B2B-Komponente hier das enorme Geschäftspotenzial, welches aus dem verantwortungsbewusstem Umgang mit Daten durch einen Operator entsteht.</p><p>“Viele sehen heute einfach nicht die Chancen, die eine wertschätzende digitale Beziehung mit sich bringt: bessere digitale Prozesse, Kosteneinsparungen, höhere Kundenzufriedenheit und nicht zuletzt das positive digitale Image für’s Geschäft. Deshalb unterstützen wir Unternehmen hier und lösen quasi nebenbei ihre dringenden Probleme im Kundendatenmanagement” freut sich Dominik Deimel. Das beweist comuny gerade mit ersten Kunden, so ist über den comuny Operator der Zugang zur elektronischen Patientenakte oder die Ausgabe der elektronischen Gesundheitskarte nach PDSG komplett digital möglich. Für die elektronische Patientenakte arbeitet comuny mit einer der größten Krankenkassen Deutschlands zusammen, um die Nutzung der ePA für ihre Versicherten so komfortabel wie möglich zu gestalten. comuny wurde außerdem ins aktuelle Batch#20 des InsurLab Germany berufen – das ist wie ein Ritterschlag der deutschen Versicherer.</p><p>Die 7 Organisationen, denen der Status “MyData Operator 2020” verliehen wurde, repräsentieren verschiedenste Länder und Serviceangebote. Einige bieten breit gefächerte Dienstleistungen direkt für Einzelpersonen an, einige haben fokussierte Angebote in nur einer Branche, während wieder andere Technologien und Infrastruktur für Dritte bereitstellen, um stärker auf Bedürfnisse von Kunden ausgerichtete Dienste zu ermöglichen. Sie alle dürfen ab sofort das Logo “MyData Operator 2020” verwenden und erklären, dass ihnen “der Status MyData Operator 2020 von MyData Global in Anerkennung ihres Wirkens für eine menschenorientierte Infrastruktur zur Datenverarbeitung und -nutzung verliehen wurde”.</p><p>Einzigartig an MyData-Operatoren ist auch ihr Wille zur radikalen Zusammenarbeit für sichere Datenflüsse ohne Lock-In-Effekt. Die Preisträger arbeiten untereinander zusammen, um ein erfolgreiches, interoperables Ökosystem für personenbezogene Daten zu schaffen. Joss Langford, Co-Leiter der thematischen Gruppe MyData-Operatoren gratuliert den Preisträgern “für ihre Integrität, ihren Einsatz und ihre Offenheit bei diesem beispiellosen Informationsaustausch, der weit über die Anforderungen jeglicher Gesetzgebung hinausgeht.”</p><p>“Wir glauben, dass offene Ökosysteme, die den Menschen echte Wahlmöglichkeiten zwischen guten Alternativen bieten, die neue Norm für persönliche Daten und darauf gestützte digitale Dienste sind.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The problem of trust over a network is longstanding. It has been addressed in a variety of ways since the internet blossomed, but never as yet solved.</p>



<p>Take, for example, Certificate Authorities (CAs), the organizations with the power to issue certificates to websites so browsers will recognize them as legitimate. These certificates function as a primitive identification for websites, where the CA is attesting to the identity of the website and the website can use this certificate to identify itself to browsers – because all browsers trust the CAs.</p>



<p>The flaw here though is obvious: what if a CA is compromised and begins issuing false certificates? No set of keys can be considered absolutely immune to compromise, no matter how powerful the controller.</p>



<p>The central problem here is that of trustless key distribution and attribution (more specifically, the implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/dkms-recommendations.md">Distributed Key Management System (DKMS)</a>. That is, how do we know that a key is truly controlled by an identifier and, given an identifier, how can we know which keys it controls? (It’s important to note here that CAs are not trustless mechanisms, but that browsers rely entirely on trusting that a CA has not been compromised.)</p>



<p>Decentralized digital identity using the technology of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) appears to remedy the issue. However, this <a href="https://mattr.global/overview-of-decentralized-identity-standards/">collection of related specifications</a> only defines a consistent interface for different DID methods to implement a DKMS in any way they see fit, as well as associated semantics to make them very flexible and useful.</p>



<p>The exact way that key distribution and attribution is addressed is different between DID methods. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and blockchains have proven effective for the purposes of designing decentralized DID methods and even centralized trust-requiring systems, such as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/github-did">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://github.com/did-twit/did-twit/blob/master/spec/index.md">Twitter</a>, have been used.</p>



<p>Most DID methods are still fairly young, but they often share certain characteristics:</p>



  Central registry-based: the infrastructure might be decentralized (e.g. a blockchain or other DLT), however the DID method is informationally centralized, i.e. registration and resolution involve the updating or reading of the shared state of a single network or infrastructure.  Canonicity: the central registry is considered to be the single trustworthy source of truth.  Availability provision: the central registry’s entire state can be queried at any time from anywhere (with a network connection).  



<p>The logical centralization of these kinds of methods provides an important, arguably more fundamental property: conflict resolution. The underlying consensus mechanism of these DID method implementations (e.g. the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">Bitcoin blockchain for did:btcr</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver/blob/develop/README.md">Ethereum blockchain for did:ethr</a>) prevents any conflicting states from being propagated on the network. And if this sounds similar to a cryptocurrency, that’s because it is.</p>



<p>Blockchain consensus mechanisms were and are designed to maintain some kind of invariant about the current state of the chain. In Bitcoin and other currency chains, this invariant is the amount of existing coins: the mechanism is designed to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spend problem</a>. It seemingly makes sense, then, to use this property of blockchains for identity. Or does it?</p>



<p>Interestingly, it actually does not. The invariant of single-spend leads to slow consensus time because it must be applied to the globally-shared state of the chain. In identity, however, we do not have a double-spend problem.</p>



<p>The invariant we care about in identity is different. It is only that an update to the state of the keys and other metadata associated with an identifier be valid. The crux here is that the state of accounts (i.e. identifiers) never overlap or depend upon each other.</p>







 So, where does KERI fit into this? 



<p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. It was initially conceived by Dr. Samuel Smith, distributed systems pioneer and founder of <a href="https://www.pro-sapien.com/">ProSapien</a>, and is now being worked on and implemented under the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). In a nutshell, KERI is a flexible, secure, minimal and privacy-preserving trustless DKMS.</p>



<p>In contrast to blockchain or central registry-based trust systems, KERI is based on a hash-chain data structure called a ‘key event receipt log’ (KERL). Conceptually, it’s similar in some ways to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DID Method specification</a>, except that its data model is a KERL rather than a DID document. And while KERI can be used as a DID method, it is fundamentally not reliant on any of the DID specifications and can be used in many other contexts as well. In particular, it is also useful for Internet of Things (IoT) networks and other security-conscious, low-resource use cases.</p>







System design trade space. (visual rework of the original graphics by <br><a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM">Samuel Smith</a>)



 Exploring events 



<p>A KERL is composed of a list of key events and witness receipts – more on these later. A key event, however, is a transaction signed by the controller of the identifier and indicates an update in the state of the identifier’s keys or other semantics. There are a few basic kinds of key events.</p>



  Inception: this event signals the creation of an identifier, and it cryptographically binds some information to the identifier. The result of an inception event is an identifier with two sets of keys: one for signing, another for controlling. The signing key set can be used to authenticate as the identifier, while the control key set (which is hashed and not visible in the event) can be used to create rotation events.  Rotation: this event signals the change of signing and control keys for the identifier. KERI relies upon a rule called pre-rotation for post-quantum security. Rotation events maintain this rule. Upon rotation, the control keys (used to sign the rotation event) become the new signing keys, while a new set of control keys is added. This ensures that no attacker can ever compromise the control keys because they are never used (or perhaps never even existed in the first place) until they sign the transaction which makes them no longer the control keys. A rotation event which has an empty set for the control keys is equivalent to abandoning the identifier (as no new control events are possible).  Interaction: these events simply contain a commitment to a piece of data. Within KERI they can be used by a delegator to commit to – and thus finalize – a delegated inception or rotation event.  Delegated inception: this event signals adding a new set of delegated keys to the identifier. Similar to the inception event, this new key set has an identifier created by cryptographically binding its inception data, and as such can be referenced by a “path” from the main identifier, e.g. identifier#delegated_identifier.  Delegated rotation: this event signals the rotation of a delegated key set, similarly to the rotation event. Much like the main identifier, the delegated identifier does not change when the underlying key set is rotated.  



 State update rules 



<p>Along with these event types, there is a set of rules for validating a list of these events. The result of applying these rules is an identifier and a set of keys which are proven to be controlled by the identifier. In simple terms, these rules are:</p>



  There can only be one inception event, and it must come first.  Each rotation event must be signed by the control keys established by the previous events and must set the new signing keys to be the previous set of control keys.  Each delegated inception or rotation event must be signed by the signing keys established by the previous events.  All events must have a monotonically-increasing counter.  All events must contain the hash of the previous event.  



<p>These rules, when applied to the key events, provide the conflict resolution mechanism which enables KERI to work independently of a central registry. A key event log or KEL (i.e. a log containing only events with no receipts) which is being updated will reject an incorrect event. By appending the first valid event, all other valid events for that place in the KEL are rendered invalid (i.e. the counter or backhash or some other semantic detail will be deemed incorrect).</p>



<p>The key event log validation rules provide a way to know the correct key state for an identifier, just as the consensus rules of the Bitcoin blockchain provide a way to know the correct balance of an account. In this sense, a KEL can be thought of as a “single-account blockchain” or micro-ledger. This is perfect for knowing a KEL is valid — but when presented with multiple different KELs for a single Identifier, how can one know which is the “true” KEL?</p>



 Witnesses 



<p>The witness system is the conflict resolution mechanism for KERLs (remember, a KERL is a KEL plus witness receipts), the same way that the validation rules serve as the conflict resolution mechanism for key events. In an inception event, the creator of the event can list several “witness” identifiers. Upon creation of a key event (every kind, not just inception), the entity must present the event to its witnesses and in return the witness gives a signature of that event. These signatures are compiled into a witness receipt for each event in the KEL. In the case of divergent conflicting KELs being detected, a validator can collect the KEL and the witness receipts into a KERL and prove which is correct via an algorithm called KAACE (KERI’s Agreement Algorithm for Control Establishment, see section 11 of the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI white paper</a> for more details).</p>



<p>The security mechanism here is subtle but very effective:</p>



  The witnesses are cryptographically bound to the identifier in the inception event.  The witnesses are assumed to be trusted (or at least not known to be malicious) by the creator of the identifier and give signatures which cannot be repudiated.  Any attacker must compromise both the control keys of the identifier (very difficult already because of pre-rotation) and all of the signing keys used by the witnesses. If there is more than one event, they will have to compromise the entire key history of each current and previous witness and the identifier. This is much more difficult than, say, compromising the single key pair used to secure a Bitcoin account.  



<p>With these security properties, a KERI-based identifier is at least as hard to compromise as most blockchain accounts, equivalent to compromising a single private key. What’s more, a KERI-based identifier is more difficult to attack, being equivalent to reversing several hash functions and compromising an arbitrary number of private keys held by different parties.</p>



<p>This makes KERI an incredibly flexible and powerful way of managing identifiers and keys without recourse to, reliance on, or vulnerability through any centralized or decentralized service or infrastructure.</p>



<p>KERI can even act as a bridging account, whereby key pairs for different ledger networks can be managed and linked under a single Identifier, due to its cryptographic flexibility. This is because KERI currently supports five signature schemes and can be extended to add more.</p>



<p>Ultimately KERI’s core value propositions are:</p>



  Enforced pre-rotation: ensures that the recovery keys are never exposed prior to use, so that even an attacker with a quantum computer can not crack the recovery key set.  Ambient verifiability: events being verifiable without reliance on a global state which must be kept synchronised allows for KERI to be effective on any scale and in any deployment environment, networked or not.  Flexible trust structures: the two-layer multisig combined with the rotatable witness set provides support for any imaginable arrangement of trust, or none at all.

  <p>The evolution of cybersecurity protection demands a more nuanced response to providing access to a company’s sensitive resources. Policy-based access control (PBAC) combines identity attributes and context variables to enable sophisticated granting of access to corporate systems and protected resources based on centrally managed policies that ensure consistent access control decisions across the enterprise. Advancement in both business requirements and technology (such as growing use of micro-services), require a better way to control access. In a way that is consistent across all silos, dynamic enough to react to change in risk, and provides better control for the application business owners.</p>
<p>PBAC facilitates the application of consistent policy across all applications that use the PBAC authorization service. Furthermore, policies are evaluated in real-time against current attributes rather than having to wait for a nightly update of identity attributes before access control policy is correctly applied. PBAC also facilitates a risk management approach to access decisions. If access outside business hours represents a greater risk the authorization service could prompt for an additional authentication factor before access is granted.</p>

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director, Responsible Technology</p><p>Today our grantee, WaitWhat, launched the second season of <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">Should This Exist?</a>, which earlier this year was nominated by the prestigious Webby Awards for best tech podcast in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>We put Should this Exist? on the “must listen” list! It stretches your understanding about radically new technology and its implications on our lives — both the promising and perilous. The storytelling is riveting, the topics are supremely well chosen, and the show’s host — Internet serial entrepreneur and investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a> — masterfully guides listeners on unforgettable journeys alongside the inventors of our times. In each episode, Caterina engages with a groundbreaking technology — from contact tracing, to a robot caregiving, to deepfake video production — to ask the important questions. The show surrounds you with ideas and interpretations, but ultimately leaves it to you to decide if the tech should exist, and how it&nbsp;should.</p><p>We’re excited to support this show because the world is hungry for this kind of conversation, as we’ve seen with interest in <a href="https://ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer</a> and in Netflix’s recent The Social Dilemma. We want to imagine and guide technology to its greatest potential and help technologists navigate around unintended consequences that are so hard to anticipate.</p><p>After you subscribe <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">here</a> to the podcast, you might want to sign up to the <a href="http://eepurl.com/gnZTf9">weekly newsletter</a>.</p><p>Here’s a <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">custom link</a> to today’s show if you’d like to share, and below, you can read more about our first three episodes.</p><p>LISTEN: <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar</a></p><p>Premieres Wednesday, October 14:<br>The deepfake detective<br>Chances are, you’ve seen a “deepfake” video. But did you know it? A new breed of tech detectives are building tools to spot these hyper-realistic videos — built with AI — where people say things they didn’t say or do things they’d never do. Some of these clips are just good, fanciful fun. But a deepfake deployed at the right moment could sway an election, or wreck a life. That’s why UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid is working on a “deepfake detective” — a tool to help media outlets know what’s real and what isn’t. But the same program could also give deepfakers a blueprint for how to make their work undetectable. Deepfake technology already exists. This episode asks: What should we do&nbsp;now?</p><p>Premieres Thursday, October 15:<br>Contact tracing: So promising. So invasive. <br>It’s one of the best weapons we have to contain a pandemic. But can it defeat the disease without spying on people who might carry it? MIT’s Kevin Esvelt has a bold idea: Let’s try a new form of contact tracing that could more than double the program’s impact. Bi-directional tracing looks both forward and backward from a known transmission, building a chart of the “undiscovered branches of the viral family tree” and identifying potential spreaders other systems can’t see. But how much of our data are we willing to give the government, even if it’s to fight Covid-19?</p><p>Premieres Wednesday, October 21:<br>Grandma, here’s your robot<br>Is it the loneliest idea you’ve ever heard? Or an ingenious hack that helps human caregivers be more attentive and empathetic? You might have these questions when you meet the robot caregivers who roam the halls at retirement homes, doing basic tasks for residents and keeping them connected. Is elder care something we want a robot to do? Roboticist Conor McGinn from Trinity College Dublin actually moved into a retirement home in Washington, DC, to gain a deeper understanding of what residents might want from a robot. The answer surprised him, and it prompts deeper questions: As humans, what responsibility do we have toward our elders? When we fail them, should robots close the gap? And is that the future we want for ourselves?</p>

 Robert Miller, Director of Project Management and Strategy at ConsenSys Health, on healthcare data and its challenges <p>In the seventh episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we spoke to <a href="https://bertcmiller.com/about/">Robert Miller</a>, Director of Product Management and Strategy at <a href="https://consensyshealth.com/">ConsenSys Health</a>. In a conversation with us, he spoke about the uniqueness of healthcare data; the relationship between federated learning, blockchain in the context of healthcare data; challenges in the standardization of healthcare data, and more. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> Why is healthcare data considered unique? <p>Healthcare data is some of the only data that we have that is not autobiographical, but it's biographical. For example: when you write a social media post or you're on Amazon searching a product- you took an action and that generated some information. But in the context of healthcare, at least in traditional context, it is a physician actually, that is taking down notes. It is through their lens of the world of your action, their interpretations that generate your healthcare information. Even though it's a super-sensitive, intimate information about you -- it's always generated through the lens of another person. It's biographical, not autobiographical. And that generates all sorts of interesting problems from it. Traditionally, people think of it as their medical records or the kind of information that gets taken down in a physician's office or maybe an insurance company, but you can almost see any information in some way as health information if you dig deep enough. It's not just your CT scan, but you might be able to use somebody's social media activity and their text messages to get a proxy of how social they're feeling. This could be an indicator of how mentally well they are or not. There's an increasingly expansive view that not only are your health records or health data, but all of your data is health data in some sense or the&nbsp;other.</p> Sovereign identity in healthcare doesn't exist to&nbsp;die <blockquote>I don’t think that identity really exists in healthcare to die the way that it does in other domains. Health data is very unstandardized but the situation is getting better. Let’s say there are two hospitals- If you were to walk in and go up to the desk of each and sign up for them, they will probably record your identity in two different ways. It is very difficult to take a person’s identity in one context in one part of the healthcare system and match it to a person’s identity in a different context, because there aren’t standardized ways of doing this. Not only do we not have self-sovereign identity, we just don’t have a good sense of identity at all in&nbsp;health.</blockquote><p>Standardization is a very important problem that needs to be solved in order for us to have data sovereignty. We're getting better all the time at standardizing data and people are slowly converging on some standards. Machine learning algorithms are getting better at matching people's identities or like learning the sort of quirks but there is a long way to&nbsp;go.</p><p>The reason why there is no national standard patient identity in the United States like there is in other places is a long-standing worry on part of our lawmakers.</p> What is Federated learning and privacy-preserving AI <p>Federated learning is a way of training machine learning algorithms in a collaborative privacy-preserving manner. That allows for a network of participants to train an algorithm without any individual participant needing to share their data. In a traditional machine learning context, you send the data to a centralized repository. And in that centralized repository, you train an algorithm. But in federated learning, you send the algorithm to the data stored in its home location. Participants in the network after they receive the algorithm, improve it on their local data, which creates an updated better algorithm before passing on to the next participant in the federated Learning Network. And it's only this updated algorithm and not the underlying data which is shared. A federated learning network can have 30 parties training the same algorithm or a million parties even at scale, without anybody sharing their underlying information. It is a way of training a decentralized AI. And in all likelihood, you've benefited from and contributed to a federated learning network without ever knowing&nbsp;it.</p><p>Federated learning originated from a team at Google, who created it as a way of improving typing suggestions on your device without people having to give up their privacy. The basic way that it works is that you have an algorithm on your phone from Google. And this algorithm updates based on what you're typing, and sort of proves the algorithm improves predictions based on the way that you type in those improvements on the autofill or the texting predict algorithm are aggregated together by Google, which formed the basis of a new algorithm that is then distributed to your phone, the way that you tied improves it a little bit, those improvements, then get aggregated again, and so forth. This lets you preserve individual privacy and your texts are never shared, only the improvements in the algorithm autocorrect. This type of technology can be used in other contexts as well, like enterprise health data settings.</p><blockquote>Right now, federated learning in a healthcare context is only being used by enterprises. I think that there are about 10 different federated learning networks that are running on health data today on varying levels of sophistication.</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>1:28-5:30: Introduction by Robert Miller and background</p><p>5.35-8:20: Why healthcare data is&nbsp;unique</p><p>8:20-16:30: Sovereign identity in healthcare</p><p>16.38-29:59: federated learning and healthcare data</p><p>30: 00-end: The role of DAOs in standardization of data, healthcare data on the blockchain and&nbsp;beyond</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Katryna Dow, founder and CEO of&nbsp;Meeco. 
<p>Katryna talks to Oscar about her career (including inspiration from Minority Report), Meeco’s personal data &amp; distributed ledger platform, the importance of data minimisation to inspire trust in organisations, and cultural differences in attitudes towards digital identity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The greatest way to overcome this privacy paradox is transparency.”</p>
<p>“Where regulators have moved to increase the data transparency and data rights of individuals, these need to actually be part of the solution architecture.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Katryna Dow&nbsp;is the founder and CEO of&nbsp;Meeco; a personal data &amp; distributed ledger platform that enables people to securely exchange data via the API-of-Me with the people and organisations they trust. Katryna has been pioneering personal data rights since 2002, when she envisioned a time when personal sovereignty, identity and contextual privacy would be as important as being connected. Now within the context of GDPR and Open Banking, distributed ledger, cloud, AI and IoT have converged to make&nbsp;Meeco&nbsp;both possible and necessary.</p>
<p>Find out more about Meeco at <a href="https://meeco.me/">meeco.me</a>.</p>
<p>For the past three years, Katryna has been named as one of the Top 100 Identity Influencers. She is the co-author of the blockchain identity paper ‘Immutable Me’ and co-author/co-architect of Meeco’s distributed ledger solution and technical White Paper on Zero Knowledge Proofs for Access, Control, Delegation and Consent of Identity and Personal Data. Katryna speaks globally on digital rights, privacy and data innovation.</p>

 A Decade of Digital Public Goods: Holding Up the Digital Economy, Preventing Monopolies, and Safeguarding Freedoms for&nbsp;All <p>By CV Madhukar, Managing Director, Responsible Technology</p>Long lines form with South Africans waiting to receive COVID relief&nbsp;funds.<p>Digital platforms, such as <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/the-open-source-identity-platform-mosip-hits-a-new-milestone-ff9137610bed">digital identity</a> and interoperable <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">payment systems</a>, form the scaffolding that holds up our entire digital economy, improving the delivery of basic services to millions.</p><p>While not visible, this digital architecture has the power to enhance many different aspects of our lives, wherever we live on the globe. Identification enables people to open new bank accounts and access public services like education and health. While interoperable payment systems have the ability to drive down transaction costs for consumers.</p><p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen just how essential digital infrastructure can be. South Korea and Singapore were able to use theirs to track and trace who had contracted the virus — and to whom they had been in close proximity with. India used its digital infrastructure to send more than $200 million in emergency aid directly to more than 340 million citizens in a matter of days. Estonia, meanwhile, used its digital infrastructure to create digital immunity passports, which allow those who have recently tested negative for the novel coronavirus to return to work in person. <br> <br>The problem is that this kind of digital infrastructure is only present in a few countries around the world — which leaves the rest of us to depend on slower, less reliable systems. Even in countries as wealthy as the US, unemployment benefits, which could be paid in seconds via digital infrastructure, can take months to process due to antiquated technology and processes. And when it comes to countries with far fewer resources, especially in Africa, the lack of digital infrastructure can create even bigger impediments to access even basis services. For example, the lack of formal identification is one of the biggest barriers for financial inclusion. And even if governments and philanthropists have every intention of supporting vulnerable people, these will remain mere intentions without a mechanism through which they can get people the resources they need. <br> <br>That’s why Omidyar Network is working to make sure countries have the technical resources to build the digital infrastructure that is powering so much of the developed world — and to do it in a way that is cost-saving, open-sourced, and empowering to local entrepreneurs who will no longer have to be dependent on big technology companies.</p><p>To be clear, digital infrastructure must also be accompanied by rigorous laws and policies to protect individual privacy and prevent harms. Digital infrastructure must be built so people have control over how their data are used, and data privacy must be built-in, not opt-in. It should be seen as a public good that enables private-sector growth, prevents digital monopolies, and safeguards the rights and freedoms of&nbsp;all.</p><p>On September 18, New America organized a virtual event, “<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/events/un-general-assembly-2020/">2030: A Decade of Digital Public Goods for Effective Institutions</a>,” on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Philanthropists, heads of state, government regulators, civil society leaders, and startups gathered to launch a decade of work to develop digital goods for the public sector. Several speakers pointed to the shortage of public investment in building such infrastructure.</p><p>We urgently need philanthropists to not only bring development assistance to the countries that need it, but to also invest in the infrastructure that makes it possible to get there. We need governments to own this agenda and build tech so the management of large-scale, digital infrastructure lies within the country’s elected institutions. And in an era where data has become a key factor of economic development, we need to focus on empowering individuals with agency, thereby generating the greatest benefit to the&nbsp;people.</p><p>That’s not to say the private sector won’t reap any rewards from these investments, on the contrary. In the same way companies benefit from public works like roads, bridges, and tunnels, they will also be able to innovate on top of this foundational layer of digital infrastructure — and reach customers they never could have found otherwise. Likewise, this technology will be able to multiply returns on philanthropic investments by exponentially expanding the universe for people across the world. <br> <br>Put simply, digital infrastructure is a first-mile necessity for an equitable digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>This could have a positive, transformative impact on the global economy and global development. But it’s going to take all of us to install safe and inclusive, digital infrastructure all over the world. If we make this kind of investment, we can begin to build a world where gaps in technology never limit the programs governments can implement, the progress they can make, or anything people do to improve their own&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Watch the full <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/events/un-general-assembly-2020/">event recording</a> online to hear how others in the conversation proposed advancing the #DigitalDecade to support public institutions.</p>

 The GiD Report#130 — It’s no accident that Big Tech are monopolies <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-129-what-we-learned-about-digital-identity-from-onlyfans-445b5eb8a875">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies  Justice Department could charge Google this&nbsp;week  Microsoft allows app store users to choose their own&nbsp;payments  Americans have hated monopolies for centuries  How Facebook screwed up by trying to get TikTok&nbsp;banned  The fintech&nbsp;wave  Stuff happens   1. Guess what? Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies according to the House Judiciary Committee. Photo Suzy Hazelwood<p>That much is outlined in their 450 page report, <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf">which you can check out&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>“No surprises here,” Greg Kidd <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1313876886796156928">tweeted</a>. (Also not a surprise if you’ve been following this newsletter.)</p><p>He added:</p><blockquote>“It’s the world we live in now. It didn’t happen by accident. We need to change the way antitrust and anticompetition law works so that it works for rather than against innovation, inclusion and neutrality.”</blockquote><p>Which is more or less spiritually aligned with the intentions of the report. These are some of the changes tol antitrust law proposed — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-5f6b5b5f-e83e-4615-8503-5317ba2c1e59.html">via&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p>  limiting companies’ ability to compete unfairly against third parties on their own platforms by either requiring online marketplaces to be independently run businesses or establishing rules for how such marketplaces can be organized;  blocking online platforms from giving themselves preferential treatment or playing favorites with other content providers;  requiring social networks to be interoperable so that people can communicate across platforms and carry their data over from one platform to&nbsp;another;  directing antitrust enforcers to assume that an acquisition by a dominant tech firm is anticompetitive unless proven otherwise; and  allowing news publishers to team up to negotiate against tech platforms looking to carry their&nbsp;content.  <p>Of interest here, the 16 month investigation outlined specifically how Apple and Facebook achieved and continues to wield its monopoly power — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-5f6b5b5f-e83e-4615-8503-5317ba2c1e59.html">via&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Apple: The report says Apple exerts monopoly power over software distribution to more than half the mobile devices in the U.S. It accuses the company of exploiting rivals by levying commissions and fees and copying apps, and says Apple gives preference to its own apps and services.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook: The social media network has monopoly power in the social networking space, the report finds, and takes a “copy, acquire, kill” approach to would-be rivals such as WhatsApp and Instagram, both of which it bought in the early&nbsp;2010s.</blockquote><p>First, we should just acknowledge that the conclusions of the report and various proposals are all an incredible validation of the work we’ve been doing here at GlobaliD the past few years. There will always be two ways to fix a systemic issue — from the top down and from the bottom up. Ideally, you have both happening in&nbsp;concert.</p><p>GlobaliD has been working on the bottom-up solution to the problem. Now the top-down approach is coming, and it’s great to&nbsp;see.</p><p>Ideally, regulations are timely but in practice, they are lagging indicators. Consumer preferences and demands are already changing.</p><p>(Anecdotal: My sister was telling me this morning that she doesn’t really use Instagram anymore or sees as much value in it for her personally. And isn’t that how these things usually go? Long before lawmakers jump through all the hoops in order to break up Facebook, the kids will have already found a new shiny&nbsp;toy.)</p><p>A bit of reality: This is really just the start of a potentially long and drawn out process. We’re talking about the titans of industry, and they won’t go down without a fight. (They’ve all already denied the findings of the report, denying that they are monopolies or violate antitrust law. Unsurprisingly, Big Tech thinks the competitive landscape is healthy.)</p><p>But if we do end up achieving the proposals of the report, it will be game changing — there’s no doubt about&nbsp;that.</p><p>This is politics, though, so you never know. That being said and given the way the current election buildup is panning&nbsp;out:</p><blockquote>If Democrats take the White House and the Senate in November, they could use this report as a blueprint for longer-term legislative and enforcement changes to limit tech giants’&nbsp;power.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theregreview.org/2020/10/01/hovenkamp-antitrust-regulation-over-time/">Antitrust and Regulation Over Time | The Regulatory Review</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/06/technology/house-antitrust-report-big-tech.html">The House Antitrust Report on Big&nbsp;Tech</a>  <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/10/antitrust-isnt-the-solution-to-americas-biggest-tech-problem">Antitrust Isn’t the Solution to America’s Biggest Tech&nbsp;Problem</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/congress-big-tech-monopoly-power.html">House Lawmakers Condemn Big Tech’s ‘Monopoly Power’ and Urge Their&nbsp;Breakups</a>  <a href="https://qz.com/1914446/a-simple-change-to-antitrust-law-that-could-rein-in-big-tech/">The single, simple rule change that could force tech platforms to&nbsp;compete</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/10/07/google-antitrust-and-how-best-to-regulate-big-tech">Google, antitrust and how best to regulate big&nbsp;tech</a>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/congress-gets-ready-to-smash-big">Congress Gets Ready to Smash Big Tech Monopolies</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/house-panel-to-recommend-breakup-of-tech-giants-republican-says">House Panel to Seek Breakup of Tech Giants, GOP Member&nbsp;Says</a>   2. This will be a long drawn out battle but there are already skirmishes abound. The Justice Department could charge Google as early as this week. (Top&nbsp;down) <p>That would amount to the biggest such action against a U.S. tech company in 20 years (since Microsoft).</p><p>It could mean forcing Google to sell off Chrome, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/10/feds-may-target-googles-chrome-browser-for-breakup-428468">reports Politico</a>.</p><p>A bit of context: This particular action is coming from the Trump administration. The point? This is truly a bipartisan issue.</p> 3. Microsoft’s app store now lets users choose their own payments systems. (Bottom&nbsp;up) <p>That’s part of 10 app store principles promoting “choice, fairness and innovation” <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/08/app-store-fairness-caf-interoperability-principles/">the company just published</a>:</p>  Developers will have the freedom to choose whether to distribute their apps for Windows through our app store. We will not block competing app stores on&nbsp;Windows.  We will not block an app from Windows based on a developer’s business model or how it delivers content and services, including whether content is installed on a device or streamed from the&nbsp;cloud.  We will not block an app from Windows based on a developer’s choice of which payment system to use for processing purchases made in its&nbsp;app.  We will give developers timely access to information about the interoperability interfaces we use on Windows, as set forth in our Interoperability Principles.  Every developer will have access to our app store as long as it meets objective standards and requirements, including those for security, privacy, quality, content and digital&nbsp;safety.  Our app store will charge reasonable fees that reflect the competition we face from other app stores on Windows and will not force a developer to sell within its app anything it doesn’t want to&nbsp;sell.  Our app store will not prevent developers from communicating directly with their users through their apps for legitimate business purposes.  Our app store will hold our own apps to the same standards to which it holds competing apps.  Microsoft will not use any non-public information or data from its app store about a developer’s app to compete with&nbsp;it.  Our app store will be transparent about its rules and policies and opportunities for promotion and marketing, apply these consistently and objectively, provide notice of changes and make available a fair process to resolve disputes.  <p>OK, sure, this is mostly a symbolic move (given Microsoft’s market share in the space) in order to get ahead of the news and to take some well-timed jabs at Microsoft’s rivals.</p><p>But it also gives you a sense of how companies in general are reacting to the new vibes of the&nbsp;times.</p> 4. A bit of history. TL;DR — Americans have hated monopolies for centuries. <p>A great longread from Ben Thompson’s Stratetchery — which is essentially<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/anti-monopoly-vs-antitrust/?utm_source=Memberful&amp;utm_campaign=cbfc41228d-daily_update_2020_10_07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-cbfc41228d-110987421"> a historical take on the American view of monopolies (and in turn antitrust)</a>.</p><p>First, here’s Ben quoting William Letwin in<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo3642778.html"> Law and Economic Policy in America: The Evolution of the Sherman Antitrust Act</a>:</p><p>Hatred of monopoly is one of the oldest American political habits and like most profound traditions, it consisted of an essentially permanent idea expressed differently at different times. “Monopoly”, as the word was used in America, meant at first a special legal privilege granted by the state; later it came more often to mean exclusive control that a few persons achieved by their own efforts; but it always meant some sort of unjustified power, especially one that raised obstacles to equality of opportunity.</p><p>And boy does that hatred go way back. Here’s a quick teaser from&nbsp;Ben:</p><p>As Letwin notes, American distrust of monopolies had its roots in England and 1624’s Statute of Monopolies, which significantly constrained the ability of the King to grant exclusive privilege; colonial and state legislatures similarly passed laws restricting grants of exclusive power by governments, and while the Bill of Rights did not have an anti-monopoly provision (contra Thomas Jefferson’s wishes), one of the most divisive political questions for the first several decades of the United States was over the existence (or not) of a national bank, in large part because it was a government-granted monopoly.</p><p>Check out Ben’s full piece:<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/anti-monopoly-vs-antitrust/"> </a><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/anti-monopoly-vs-antitrust/?utm_source=Memberful&amp;utm_campaign=cbfc41228d-daily_update_2020_10_07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-cbfc41228d-110987421">Anti-monopoly vs. Antitrust</a></p> 5. BONUS: How Facebook screwed up by trying to get TikTok&nbsp;banned <p>The <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201009&amp;instance_id=22992&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=40442&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2F3a51c187-cd2e-58cc-a68f-f0ed955b10e7&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">NYTimes tech newsletter:</a></p><blockquote>Instagram’s boss had a message this week for the White House and the world: It was counterproductive for the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/technology/us-appeals-injunction-against-tiktok-ban.html?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012">to try to ban TikTok</a>, the popular video app from&nbsp;China.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s bad for U.S. tech companies and people in the United States, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, <a href="https://www.axios.com/instagram-head-on-tiktok-ban-damage-might-have-already-been-done-e6337b00-d48f-4cb7-a2e6-791937eb233a.html?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012">told Axios</a>, if other countries take similar steps against technology from beyond their borders — including Facebook and its Instagram app. (He and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/zuckerberg-facebook-all-hands-tiktok-ban?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012">Mark Zuckerberg</a> have<a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1306941776733835278?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012"> said this before</a>, too.) “It’s really going to be problematic if we end up banning TikTok and we set a precedent for more countries to ban more apps,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>Mosseri has a point. What he didn’t say, though, was that Facebook has itself partly to blame. The company helped fan the fears about TikTok that Facebook is now worried will blow back on the company. This is&nbsp;bonkers.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook complaining about a bad policy that Facebook helped initiate might seem like an eye-rolling joke, but it’s more than that. It’s the latest evidence that the company’s executives are incapable of foresight. Facebook not predicting how its own actions might cause harm later on is partly why we have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/technology/facebook-qanon.html?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012">sprawling conspiracies</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-azerbaijan-troll-farm?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012">autocrats harassing their own citizens</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>They weren’t wrong. There are reasons to be worried about TikTok and other Chinese technology operating in the United States. But I don’t believe Facebook was bringing up these concerns out of principled commitment to American values. What Facebook was doing was pure short-term self-interest.</blockquote><p>That sounds about&nbsp;right.</p> 6. BONUS: The fintech&nbsp;wave:  7.

<p>Decentralized identity—also known as self-sovereign identity—is earning a reputation as a silver bullet that can solve all of today’s identity problems. It promises to ensure perfect privacy, informed consent, user independence and control, and the ability to leverage the latest technology and cryptography.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But for those of us who’ve been in the identity industry for some time, these promises might seem far-fetched. We’ve seen too many other purported magical solutions rise and fall over our careers, and evaluating decentralized identity’s true potential is no easy task. Complicating matters is the fact that if you’re coming from a single sign-on (SSO) background of SAML, OAuth or OpenID Connect, you have likely encountered an entirely new glossary of unfamiliar terminology, often conflicting technical descriptions and a distinct lack of actionable standards.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>That’s not really too surprising for new technology efforts, though it does make it more challenging to follow. So we thought we’d offer a friendly introduction—mapping concepts you’re already familiar with to the new ones, explaining where there’s a lot of overlap, highlighting some of the differences and demonstrating where decentralized identity is likely to go—without any hype.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

 Simplicity and Interoperability via a Datatokens Core  Introduction <p><a href="http://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> aims to equalize the opportunity to access and monetize data. We accomplish this by creating simple tools&nbsp;to:</p>  Publish and consume data as decentralized datatokens. Datatokens can get stored in ERC20 wallets, traded on ERC20 exchanges, managed by DAOs, and more. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">This post</a> has&nbsp;details.  Discover data for sale, and purchase it in Ocean Market, a decentralized exchange (DEX) tuned for data. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">This post</a> has&nbsp;details.  <p>This post describes the architecture for Ocean software, updated for Ocean&nbsp;V3.</p><p>Datatokens allow us to simplify the Ocean V3 architecture compared to Ocean V1/V2, while enhancing interoperability to leverage crypto wallets, DEXes, and more [1]. The figure below illustrates.</p>Ocean Protocol tools architecture, updated for&nbsp;V3.<p>Here’s an overview of the&nbsp;figure.</p>  The top layer is applications like Ocean Market. With these apps, users can onboard data services into crypto (publish and mint datatokens), hold datatokens as assets (data wallets), discover data assets and buy / sell datatokens for fixed or auto-determined price (data marketplaces), and consume data services (consume datatokens).  Below that are libraries used by the applications: Ocean React hooks, JavaScript library, and Python library. This also includes middleware to assist discovery: Aquarius and (3rd party tool) TheGraph.  The lowest level has the smart contracts used by the libraries. They’re deployed on Ethereum mainnet to start, and other networks&nbsp;later.  <p>Left to right are groupings of functionality: tools for datatokens, tools for markets (including pools), tools to consume data services and for metadata, and external ERC20&nbsp;tools.</p><p>The rest of this post elaborates.</p> Datatokens &amp; Access Control&nbsp;Tools <p>The publisher actor holds the dataset in Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, on their phone, on their home server, etc. The dataset has a URL. The publisher can optionally use IPFS for a content-addressable URL. Or instead of a file, the publisher may run a compute-to-data service.</p><p>In the publish step, the publisher invokes Ocean Datatoken Factory to deploy a new datatoken to the chain. To save gas fees, it uses <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167">ERC1167</a> proxy approach on the ERC20 datatoken template. The publisher then mints datatokens.</p><p>The publisher runs Ocean Provider. In the consume step, Provider software needs to retrieve the data service URL given a datatoken address. One approach would be for the publisher to run a database; however this adds another dependency. To avoid this, it stores the URL on-chain. So that others don’t see that URL, it encrypts&nbsp;it.</p><p>To initiate the consume step, the data consumer sends 1.0 datatokens to the Provider wallet. Then they make a service request to the Provider. The Provider loads the encrypted URL, decrypts it, and provisions the requested service (send static data, or enable a compute-to-data job).</p><p>Instead of running a Provider themselves, the publisher can have a 3rd party like Ocean Market run it. While more convenient, it means that the 3rd party has custody of the private encryption/decryption key (more centralized). Ocean will support more service types and url custody options in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Ocean JavaScript and Python libraries act as drivers for the lower-level contracts. Each library integrates with Ocean Provider to provision &amp; consume data services, and Ocean Aquarius for metadata. Ocean React hooks use the JavaScript library, to help build webapps &amp; React Native apps with&nbsp;Ocean.</p> Market Tools <p>Once someone has generated datatokens, they can be used in any ERC20 exchange, centralized or decentralized. In addition, Ocean provides a convenient default marketplace that is tuned for data: Ocean Market. It’s a vendor-neutral reference data marketplace for use by the Ocean community.</p><p>The marketplaces are decentralized (no single owner or controller), and non-custodial (only the data owner holds the keys for the datatokens).</p><p>Ocean Market supports fixed pricing and automatic price discovery.</p>  For fixed pricing, there’s a simple contract for users to buy/sell datatokens for OCEAN, while avoiding custodianship during value transfer.  For automatic price discovery, Ocean Market uses automated market makers (AMMs) powered by <a href="http://www.balancer.finance">Balancer</a>. Each pool is a datatoken — OCEAN pair. In the Ocean Market GUI, the user adds liquidity then invokes pool creation; the GUI’s React code calls the Ocean JavaScript library, which calls the Pool Factory to deploy a Pool contract. (The Python library also does this.) Deploying a datatoken pool can be viewed as an “Initial Data Offering” (IDO).  <p>Complementary to Ocean Market, Ocean has reference code to ease building third-party data marketplaces, such as for logistics (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/dexfreight-ocean-protocol-partner-to-enable-transportation-logistics-companies-to-monetize-data-7aa839195ac">dexFreight</a> data marketplace) or mobility (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-delivers-proof-of-concept-for-daimler-ag-in-collaboration-with-daimler-south-east-564aa7d959ca">Daimler</a>).</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">This post</a> elaborates on Ocean marketplace tools.</p> Metadata Tools <p>Metadata (name of dataset, date created etc.) is used by marketplaces for data asset discovery. Each data asset can have a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">decentralized identifier</a> (DID) that resolves to a DID document (DDO) for associated metadata. The DDO is essentially <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> filling in metadata fields. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/7">OEP7</a> formalizes Ocean DID&nbsp;usage.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/8">OEP8</a> specifies Ocean metadata schema, including fields that must be filled. It’s based on the public <a href="https://schema.org/Dataset">DataSet schema from schema.org</a>.</p><p>Ocean uses the Ethereum mainnet as an on-chain metadata store, i.e. to store both DID and DDO. This means that once the write fee is paid, there are no further expenses or dev-ops work needed to ensure metadata availability into the future, aiding in the discoverability of data assets. It also simplifies integration with the rest of the Ocean system, which is Ethereum-based. Storage cost on Ethereum mainnet is not negligible, but not prohibitive and the other benefits are currently worth the tradeoff compared to alternatives.</p><p>Due to the permissionless, decentralized nature of data on Ethereum mainnet, any last-mile tool can access metadata. Ocean Aquarius supports different metadata fields for each different Ocean-based marketplace. Developers could also use <a href="http://www.thegraph.com">TheGraph</a> to see metadata fields that are common across all marketplaces [2].</p> Third-Party ERC20 Apps &amp;&nbsp;Tools <p>The ERC20 nature of datatokens eases composability with other Ethereum tools and apps, including MetaMask and Trezor as data wallets, DEXes as data exchanges, and more. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837?source=---------3----------------------------">This post</a> has&nbsp;details.</p> Actor Identities <p>Actors like data providers and consumers have Ethereum addresses, aka web3 accounts. These are managed by crypto wallets, as one would expect. For most use cases, this is all that’s needed. There are cases where the Ocean community could layer on protocols like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> or tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://3box.io/">3Box</a>.</p> Implementation &amp; Conclusion <p>This post has outlined the Ocean architecture.</p><p>The code is in private beta with teams building on Ocean. It has undergone a security audit; there were no major issues, and lesser issues have been resolved. In coming weeks we will open up the GitHub repositories, and release updated documentation.</p> Acknowledgements <p>Thanks very much to the following people for reviews: Sarah Vallon, Monica Botez, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrucePon">Bruce Pon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alexcos20">Alex Coseru</a>. Thanks especially to Samer Sallam for his thorough feedback on the access control section. Thanks to the whole Ocean Protocol engineering team for the collaboration in building towards this. Finally, thanks to the broader Ocean community for their ongoing&nbsp;support.</p> Notes <p>[1] Ocean V3 architecture is simpler than Ocean V1/V2 architectures, without losing benefits provided by Ocean V1/V2. Its basis is the simpler mental model, with datatokens at the core. This allows it to better leverage existing infrastructure, and keeps things out of the smart contract layer if not needed there. Some simplifications include:</p>  No custom code for buy &amp; sell access. Instead, use <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC20 transfer()</a> etc.  No forcing use of OCEAN to buy &amp; sell. People can trade datatokens in whatever denomination they like (ETH, DAI, fiat, or&nbsp;OCEAN).  No custom code for logic or service execution agreements (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/exploring-the-sea-service-execution-agreements-65f7523d85e2">SEAs</a>). Instead, “<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/focus-on-productivity-not-efficiency-4ed4fe9a454f">get out of the way</a>” and let people leverage <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/">Solidity</a> for decentralized orchestration.  No overhead to <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-create-an-upgradeable-smart-contract-using-zeppelinos-example-of-fixing-smart-contract-6f6612ed8df4">upgrade smart contracts</a>. Instead, deploy super-simple smart contract code without upgradeability.  No <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/secret-store">Parity Secret&nbsp;Store</a>.  No dedicated Ocean network (Pacific). Instead, deploy to Ethereum mainnet, and beyond. We’ll provide more details in a later&nbsp;post.  <p>[2] We anticipate improved integration with TheGraph in releases after&nbsp;V3.0.</p> Further Reading   “Ocean Protocol V3 Posts: Links to all V3-Related Stories”&nbsp;[<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-posts-413b2dd33e8f">link</a>]  <p>Follow <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> via our <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a>; chat with us on <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GUyxrE0Hi154D0NrlOqLFg">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">Discord</a>; and build on Ocean starting at our&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/developers">docs</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-architecture-overview-9f2fab60f9a7">Ocean Protocol V3 Architecture Overview</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
