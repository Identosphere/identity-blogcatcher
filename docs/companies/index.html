<p>Have you ever wanted to invest in stocks or bonds, but felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of options? If you’re new to investing, it might sound like a puzzle. But what if you could simply pool your money with others to invest in a variety of assets without doing all the heavy lifting? That’s where mutual funds come in. Let’s break it down!</p>

 What Are Mutual Funds? 



<p>In simple terms, mutual funds are investments that pool money from lots of different investors. Then, a professional manager uses that pooled money to buy a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Instead of buying individual stocks or bonds yourself, you invest in a mutual fund and let experts handle the details.</p>



<p>The real magic of mutual funds is diversification. By investing in a fund, you’re spreading your risk across a range of different assets. If one stock or bond performs poorly, others in the fund might do better, balancing things out.</p>

 How Do Mutual Funds Work? 



<p>Imagine you and a group of friends each throw some cash into a pot. A fund manager is the one who decides how to invest that money. The best part? You don’t have to worry about picking individual stocks or bonds. The fund manager does it all for you.</p>



<p>Mutual funds can be:</p>



 
 Actively managed: A team of experts picks investments and changes them regularly to try to outperform the market. 



 Passively managed: These funds track a market index (like the S&amp;P 500) and have lower fees since no one is actively picking stocks. 
 



<p>You earn money from mutual funds in three main ways:</p>



 
 Dividends: When the fund holds stocks that pay dividends, you’ll get a share of that income. 



 Capital Gains: When the fund sells an asset for a profit, you get a cut of the earnings. 



 NAV Growth: If the value of the assets in the fund increases, the price of your shares in the fund goes up too. 
 


 
 


 Types of Mutual Funds 



<p>There are many types of mutual funds, and each serves a different purpose depending on your financial goals.</p>



 
 Equity Funds: These funds invest mostly in stocks. They’re great for people looking for higher potential returns and willing to take on more risk. 



 Fixed Income Funds: These focus on bonds and other debt instruments. They’re less risky but typically offer lower returns than equity funds. 



 Index Funds: A passive option that tracks a specific market index, like the S&amp;P 500. These funds are generally low-cost and perform similarly to the overall market. 



 Balanced Funds: These invest in a mix of stocks and bonds to provide both growth and stability. 
 



<p>Each of these types fits different investment strategies. So, whether you want aggressive growth or steady income, there’s a mutual fund for you.</p>



 4 Benefits of Investing in Mutual Funds 



<p>Investing in mutual funds comes with several key advantages that make them a popular choice for both beginners and experienced investors. Here’s why mutual funds might be the right choice for you:</p>



 Diversification: Reducing Risk 



<p>Instead of putting all your money into one or two stocks, mutual funds pool your money with other investors and invest in a variety of assets like stocks, bonds, and sometimes even real estate. This means your investment is spread across dozens or even hundreds of different securities, which helps reduce risk. If one asset performs poorly, others in the fund may perform better, balancing out the losses.</p>



 Professional Management: You Don’t Have to Be an Expert 



<p>One of the biggest perks of mutual funds is that you don’t need to be a financial expert to get started. Fund managers—professional investors with deep knowledge of the market—handle all the decision-making for you. They decide which stocks or bonds to buy, when to buy them, and when to sell, ensuring your portfolio is actively managed according to the fund’s strategy.</p>



 Low Costs: Affordable Investment Options 



<p>Mutual funds, especially index funds, tend to have lower costs compared to other investment types. Index funds are passively managed and track a market index (like the S&amp;P 500), so their fees are minimal. While actively managed funds can have higher fees due to professional management, the low-cost options in mutual funds make them an affordable choice for many investors.</p>



 Accessibility: Invest with Any Budget 



<p>Whether you have $100 or $10,000 to invest, mutual funds offer an accessible way to enter the market. Because you can buy shares in a fund, you don’t need large amounts of money to gain exposure to a diverse set of assets, making them perfect for investors at all financial levels.</p>

 How Much Can You Make from Investing in Mutual Funds? 



<p>Let’s put it into perspective. If you invested $10,000 in a mutual fund that performed at an average annual return of 7% (a reasonable figure over the long term), here’s how your investment could grow over time:</p>



 
 After 1 year: You’d have $10,700. 



 After 5 years: Your investment would grow to around $14,025. 



 After 10 years: You’d have around $19,671. 
 



<p>Of course, mutual funds can go up or down in value, and returns are never guaranteed. But over time, they offer the potential for steady growth.</p>



 The 3-5-10 Rule for Mutual Funds 



<p>Here’s a simple guideline: the 3-5-10 rule. It suggests that you should consider holding onto your mutual fund investment for different periods based on performance:</p>



 
 3 Years: Evaluate if the fund is doing what it should. Are you seeing growth? 



 5 Years: You should see decent returns by this point. If not, it might be time to reassess. 



 10 Years: Historically, mutual funds are a long-term play. Over a decade, the odds of your investment performing well are much higher. 
 



 Mutual Funds vs. ETFs: What’s the Difference? 



<p>You might have heard of ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), and while they’re similar to mutual funds, there are a few key differences:</p>



 
 Liquidity: ETFs can be traded throughout the day, just like stocks. Mutual funds, on the other hand, are bought or sold at the end of the day based on their Net Asset Value (NAV). 



 Costs: ETFs usually have lower fees because they’re often passively managed. Mutual funds, especially actively managed ones, tend to have higher fees. 



 Flexibility: ETFs are more flexible, allowing you to trade any time during market hours. Mutual funds can only be bought or sold at the close of trading. 
 



<p>Both can diversify your portfolio, but ETFs tend to be more liquid and cheaper.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Mutual funds offer an easy way for beginners to get into investing without needing to know everything about the stock market. They provide diversification, professional management, and accessibility, making them a solid choice for anyone looking to grow their money over time.</p>



<p>Whether you’re starting with $100 or $10,000, there’s a mutual fund for you. So, take the plunge, do your research, and let mutual funds help you reach your financial goals!</p>

 What is Solana? A Quick Overview 



<p>Before we jump into transaction tracking, let’s quickly recap what Solana is and why it’s so popular. Solana is a high-performance blockchain known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and super low fees. Whether you’re dealing with decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, or building on smart contracts, Solana’s scalability makes it a go-to for developers and users alike.</p>



<p>But behind all that speed, there’s a lot happening in the background — and that’s where transaction IDs come into play.</p>


 
 


 The Role of Transaction IDs in Solana 



<p>So, what exactly is a transaction ID? In Solana, the transaction ID (or signature) is a unique string of characters that identifies each transaction on the blockchain. It’s like your receipt after buying something online — but way cooler because it’s immutable and transparent on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Why does it matter? If you’re managing assets, tracking NFT sales, or just trying to check if your transaction went through, the transaction ID is your key to understanding exactly what happened. It helps you audit, trace, and troubleshoot any issues related to your transactions.</p>

 Methods for Viewing Solana Transaction Code 



<p>There are a few ways you can go about viewing Solana’s transaction codes, but the most popular method involves using Solana’s Web3.js API. Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a full-fledged developer to get started.</p>



 Using Solana’s Web3.js API 



<p>Solana’s Web3.js library allows you to interact with the blockchain and retrieve transaction data. The most important function we’ll use here is getSignaturesForAddress. This function lets you pull up all transactions associated with a given address (be it a wallet, mint address, or program ID).</p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of what you’ll need:</p>



 
 Node.js (version 16.15 or higher) 



 Yarn installed (or npm works too) 



 Solana Web3.js 



 Some basic JavaScript knowledge 
 



<p>Once you have everything set up, you can query Solana for transaction history related to any address. Here’s how you can set it up:</p>



 
 Create a Project Directory: 
 



<p>mkdir get_sol_tx</p>



<p>cd get_sol_tx</p>



<p>echo &gt; log.js</p>



 
 Install Dependencies: 
 



<p>yarn init -y</p>



<p>yarn add @solana/web3.js@1</p>



 
 Set Up the Code: 
 



<p>In your log.js file, add the following code to establish a connection to Solana’s blockchain and get transaction signatures:</p>



<p>const solanaWeb3 = require(‘@solana/web3.js’);</p>



<p>const endpoint = ‘https://example.solana-devnet.quiknode.pro/000000/’;</p>



<p>const solanaConnection = new solanaWeb3.Connection(endpoint);</p>



<p>const searchAddress = ‘YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE’;</p>



<p>This basic setup connects you to the Solana blockchain through an RPC endpoint (you can use public nodes, but QuickNode is an excellent choice for speed).</p>


 
 


 Retrieving Transaction Details via the Web3 API 



<p>Now that you’re connected to Solana’s network, let’s get into viewing solana transaction code.</p>



 The getSignaturesForAddress Method 



<p>This function is a game-changer. By calling it, you can retrieve all transactions associated with a particular address. You can specify how many transactions you want to pull (up to 1000), and even filter them by date.</p>



<p>Here’s how to retrieve transactions and view essential details like signature, status, and block time:</p>



<p>const getTransactions = async (address, numTx) =&gt; {</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const pubKey = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey(address);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let transactionList = await solanaConnection.getSignaturesForAddress(pubKey, { limit: numTx });</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transactionList.forEach((transaction, i) =&gt; {</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const date = new Date(transaction.blockTime * 1000);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Transaction No: ${i+1}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Signature: ${transaction.signature}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Time: ${date}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Status: ${transaction.confirmationStatus}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log((“-“).repeat(20));</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});</p>



<p>};</p>



<p>getTransactions(searchAddress, 3);</p>



<p>This script will give you a list of recent transactions tied to the address you’re interested in, along with their respective transaction IDs and other key details. It’s that simple!</p>

 Diving Deeper: Parsing Transaction Details 



<p>Now, you have the transaction IDs, but what’s inside them? To get a deeper understanding of each transaction, you can use getParsedTransaction.</p>



<p>This method provides additional insights into what each transaction is doing, such as the program interactions and instructions executed. Here’s how to extract that data:</p>



<p>const getTransactions = async (address, numTx) =&gt; {</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const pubKey = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey(address);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let transactionList = await solanaConnection.getSignaturesForAddress(pubKey, { limit: numTx });</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let signatureList = transactionList.map(transaction =&gt; transaction.signature);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let transactionDetails = await solanaConnection.getParsedTransactions(signatureList);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transactionList.forEach((transaction, i) =&gt; {</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const date = new Date(transaction.blockTime * 1000);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const transactionInstructions = transactionDetails[i].transaction.message.instructions;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Transaction No: ${i+1}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Signature: ${transaction.signature}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Time: ${date}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Status: ${transaction.confirmationStatus}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transactionInstructions.forEach((instruction, n) =&gt; {</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`—Instructions ${n+1}: ${instruction.programId.toString()}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log((“-“).repeat(20));</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});</p>



<p>};</p>



<p>With this, you’ll be able to see what programs or smart contracts interacted with each transaction. It’s like opening the hood of the transaction to see what’s really going on!</p>



 Real-World Example: Tracking Transactions in Action 



<p>Let’s put everything into practice. Suppose you want to track transactions for a Solana wallet or an NFT mint. Here’s what you can do:</p>



 
 Grab your wallet address or mint address (example: vines1vzrYbzLMRdu58ou5XTby4qAqVRLmqo36NKPTg). 



 Run the script to pull up the transaction history for that address. 



 See the transaction details, including the IDs and the programs involved. 
 



<p>This is super helpful for tracking NFT sales or token transfers. You can even check it out on Solana’s Explorer to compare and confirm your results.</p>



 Using Solana Explorer for Transaction Tracking 



<p>Not a coder? No worries! You can always head over to the Solana Explorer for a visual look at your transactions.</p>



 
 Go to<a href="https://explorer.solana.com/"> Solana Explorer</a>. 



 Search for your address or transaction ID. 



 See all your transaction history and detailed logs in one easy-to-navigate interface. 
 



<p>It’s perfect for anyone who prefers a no-code solution to view transaction data and stay updated.</p>


 
 


 Tracking Solana Events 



<p>Solana allows smart contracts (programs) to emit events. These are similar to Ethereum’s events but have a few key differences. Instead of querying past events, you need to watch for events in real-time.</p>



<p>If you want to listen for specific events (like when a token is transferred or an NFT is minted), you can set up an event listener using the Anchor framework. It’s like getting notified every time something cool happens on the blockchain.</p>



 Troubleshooting &amp; Best Practices 



<p>While Solana’s transaction tracking is pretty straightforward, there are a few things you should keep in mind:</p>



 
 Check your connection: Make sure your RPC endpoint is working properly (QuickNode is a great choice for faster responses). 



 Handle errors: Sometimes, transactions might fail due to network congestion or misconfigured endpoints. Always check your logs! 



 Optimize queries: Don’t pull unnecessary data. Limit your query to only what you need to avoid API limits. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Now that you know how to view and track Solana transactions like a pro, there’s nothing stopping you from diving deep into the world of Solana blockchain! Whether you’re building DApps, tracking NFT mints, or just keeping an eye on your assets, the transaction ID is your key to transparency and security.</p>

  Thales and Qatar Airways Sign Memorandum of Understanding to Develop Local Service Hub in Doha

Mon, 02/24/2025 - 10:00


            <p>Thales, a global technology leader in the defence, aerospace, cybersecurity and digital solutions markets, and Qatar Airways, voted the World’s Best Airline by Skytrax in 2024, have today signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to establish a dedicated Inflight Entertainment (IFE) service and maintenance center based in Doha, Qatar. </p>
<p>The mission of a local Thales facility is to provide rapid access to comprehensive services such as repair, spare distribution, technical assistance and line maintenance for the full range of Thales IFE products.</p>

             <br>

<p>This will drive Qatar Airways’ operational excellence and support the airline's ambitious growth plans to serve a large quantity of aircraft. In line with Qatar Vision 2030, this partnership will contribute to the growth of the aerospace and MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations) ecosystem and bring high-skilled jobs to the country. </p>
<p>This MOU builds on a strong and long-standing relationship between the two companies. Over the years, Thales has been Qatar Airways’ trusted IFE provider for several aircraft platforms, including their Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, A350 and A380 aircraft. <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/aerospace/press_release/qatar-airways-signs-agreement-thales-equip-a321-nx-fleet-award">This partnership was recently expanded to include Qatar Airways’ new A321 NX fleet, which will be equipped with Thales’ award-winning FlytEDGE cloud-native IFE solution</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Qatar Airways Chief MRO Officer, Mr Ali Al Saadi said: “We are pleased to see the progression of our work with Thales. It is vitally important that we continue to explore new ways to ensure our technology and capabilities are at the cutting edge of modern aviation, and I am confident that our partnership with Thales will enable this to happen.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thomas Got, Vice President, Aviation Global Services at Thales said:, “Our partnership with Qatar Airways is growing stronger. This MOU underscores our shared commitment to even greater operational excellence and lays the groundwork for developing a local service hub and expertise in Doha, to support the airline’s future growth ambitions.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Bain Capital Withdraws From Fuji Soft Bidding War As KKR Strengthens Position</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bain-capital/">Bain Capital</a> has discontinued its pursuit of Fuji Soft, ending its bidding war with KKR for the Japanese software company valued at over $4 billion.

<p>DeepSeek Halts Chatbot App Downloads in South Korea Amid Privacy Concerns</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepseek-ai/">DeepSeek</a>, a Chinese AI startup, has paused downloads of its chatbot apps in South Korea due to privacy concerns raised by the Personal Information Protection Commission. The apps were removed from the App Store and Google Play, with DeepSeek agreeing to enhance privacy protections before relaunching. While existing users can still access the app, authorities advise against entering personal information. Concerns include unclear third-party data transfers and excessive data collection. Many South Korean agencies and companies have restricted the app’s use, with DeepSeek having around 1.2 million users in the country as of late January, second only to ChatGPT. <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/downloads-of-deepseeks-ai-apps-paused-in-south-korea-over-privacy-concerns/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--kLBVZgoG1FA9jmCFvVsWqqZ5C8UWABzKy_QmDxhavU6tviXS48o5EuJ5bxy55duQA4RWO">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Norway Indicts Four for $87 Million Crypto Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme</p>



<p>Norwegian authorities have indicted four individuals in an $87 million cryptocurrency fraud and money laundering scheme that defrauded thousands globally. The scam, disguised as a multi-level marketing operation, sold “product packages” with false promises of lucrative investments in gas, mining, and real estate. Investigators found no real investments were made, and it operated as a Ponzi scheme, using new deposits to pay earlier investors. Over 700 million kroner was laundered through a Norwegian law firm and transferred to accounts in Asia, aided by professional facilitators. <a href="https://crypto.news/87m-crypto-scam-uncovered-in-norway-four-individuals-indicted/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--kLBVZgoG1FA9jmCFvVsWqqZ5C8UWABzKy_QmDxhavU6tviXS48o5EuJ5bxy55duQA4RWO">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>UK Government Pressures Apple to Weaken iCloud Encryption, Sparking Privacy Concerns</p>



<p>Brazil has established a Federal Biometric Service to manage the issuance of the national identity card (CIN), which requires both fingerprint and facial biometrics in accordance with NIST, ISO/IEC, and ICAO standards. The system must comply with specific false non-identification and false positive rates for various match types. The law also requires liveness detection—Level 1 for low-risk and Level 2 for high-risk transactions—based on NIST evaluations. With 20 million CINs issued since 2022, the government plans to release its implementation strategy within 90 days, integrating this biometric service with the Gov.br digital identity system. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/brazil-establishes-federal-body-for-biometric-checks-id-card-issuance?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--kLBVZgoG1FA9jmCFvVsWqqZ5C8UWABzKy_QmDxhavU6tviXS48o5EuJ5bxy55duQA4RWO">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>US Court Ruling Against Ross Intelligence Sets Key Precedent In AI Copyright Law</p>



<p>A recent U.S. ruling against Ross Intelligence determined that using Thomson Reuters’ copyrighted headnotes for training its AI legal research platform infringes copyright, establishing a precedent in AI copyright law. This decision poses challenges for AI companies facing over 39 similar lawsuits by emphasizing the commercial impact of use rather than transformative fair use. While it doesn’t directly affect companies like OpenAI and Midjourney, it bolsters copyright holders’ positions, and experts believe the reasoning could apply to generative AI models, although the legal landscape is still evolving and may change on appeal. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/17/what-the-us-first-major-ai-copyright-ruling-might-mean-for-ip-law/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--niP2V0hbrT6zyNYJS6y29SuDSnELTKJ4RgPrkgdGPJP4hw8cxsfpPBSHNxq88Vgb-aADC">(Source)</a></p>

			 Nida Orhan is UX/UI Designer and Front-end Developer at Tokeny, she joined the company in 2017. 
 Reflecting on the 7-year Journey 
 You’ve been with the company since the very beginning, as the UX/UI Designer &amp; Front-end Developer. How has the company supported your growth during this time? 
<p>Over the past seven years, the company has given me the opportunity to take on diverse challenges that have expanded both my UX/UI design and frontend development skills. Working on multiple products simultaneously has strengthened my ability to manage priorities effectively while delivering high-quality designs. Working on complex challenges within our comprehensive platform has strengthened my ability to balance usability, technical constraints, and business objectives when designing UI solutions. I’ve gained extensive experience in Web3 UX design, frequently pioneering new UI patterns and crafting user experiences tailored to the evolving needs of DeFi and emerging technologies. The trust and autonomy I’ve been given have allowed me to experiment, learn, and continuously improve, while also staying up to date with the latest design trends and technologies. Additionally, the collaborative environment has provided a great space for exchanging ideas and learning from talented colleagues across different teams.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Tokeny’s Culture Involvement 
 Tokeny has grown significantly since you joined. How has the company culture evolved in your opinion? 
<p>The company has maintained its core values of collaboration, innovation, and openness, even as it has grown. In the early days, everything was fast-paced and dynamic, with a smaller team making quick decisions. As we expanded, we introduced more structured processes, improving efficiency and ensuring that our work scaled effectively.</p>

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “Tokeny has retained a strong sense of teamwork and a supportive atmosphere, where everyone is encouraged to share ideas and contribute.” 

		 
	 
             
	 
		 
			 “Tokeny has retained a strong sense of teamwork and a supportive atmosphere, where everyone is encouraged to share ideas and contribute.” 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe your own personal growth within the company? 
<p>Initially, my focus was purely on executing designs and implementing frontend features, but over time, I’ve taken on more responsibility in shaping the overall user experience of our products. Being the sole designer has required me to be adaptable, balancing creativity with practicality. As our team has expanded, I’ve gained valuable experience collaborating across departments and working with professionals from diverse backgrounds, enhancing my ability to communicate, adapt, and align design solutions with various perspectives.</p>

		 
	 
                           
	 
		 
			 “This journey has reinforced my confidence and problem-solving abilities, making me a stronger professional overall.” 

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 “This journey has reinforced my confidence and problem-solving abilities, making me a stronger professional overall.” 

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 Company Values in Practice 
 You mentioned in your previous interview how much you appreciated the collaborative and friendly team culture. Can you share an example of a project where you or your team used this collaboration, and how it was received? 
<p>One good example is the development of the token settings configuration. Due to its complexity, it required close collaboration between the product, design, development, and blockchain teams to create an intuitive user experience while staying within technical constraints. Through continuous iteration, feedback sessions, and collective problem-solving, we refined the interface into a solution that was both user-friendly and technically robust.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Reflections and Future Outlook 
 If you could give advice to your younger self, just starting out at Tokeny, what would it be? 
<p>I would tell myself to embrace the fast-paced nature of a growing company and take initiative. In the beginning, I sometimes hesitated to push my ideas forward, but over time, I learned that being proactive and vocal about design decisions leads to better outcomes. Also, I’d remind myself that adaptability is key—things change rapidly, and staying flexible and considering future goals of the product while keeping the user experience at the center is the best approach.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 “I see Tokeny further solidifying its position as a leader in digital asset infrastructure, with the ERC-3643 standard becoming more widely adopted across the industry.” 

		 
	 
                        
	 
		 
			 “I see Tokeny further solidifying its position as a leader in digital asset infrastructure, with the ERC-3643 standard becoming more widely adopted across the industry.” 

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 As someone who has been with the company through significant milestones, where do you see Tokeny going in the next five years, and how do you envision your role evolving in that journey? 
<p>As Tokeny scales, establishing and growing a strong network and community around this ERC-3643 standard will be crucial, alongside continuous innovation in new products. This evolution will introduce more sophisticated UX/UI challenges, demanding increasingly agile and adaptive design approaches. I envision myself playing a key role in shaping these advancements, ensuring our solutions remain both powerful and user-friendly.</p>

 By Steve McCown 



<p>Today’s news is filled with articles and discussions about digital identity, credentials, passwordless logins, etc. Inevitably, articles gravitate towards digital wallets, some pending ‘wallet war’, and who will win it. The short answer is … everyone.</p>



<p>When modern digital identity technologies emerged, they introduced new cryptography, keys, tokens, and other security data and they required a specialized type of storage that developers called a ‘wallet’. Wallet apps quickly emerged to enable users – with no interest in cryptography other than it increases security and privacy – to push a button and securely access whichever service they were seeking. Lots of wallet apps emerged … and Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft, etc. all took notice.</p>



<p>Today, the Apple Wallet or the Google Wallet is on nearly every mobile. So, did they win the so-called wallet war? Sort of, but not exactly. Depending on which mobile device you use, you have an Apple or Google wallet and almost certainly use it. However, whether you know it or not, you have other ‘wallets’ on your device and you use them regularly, too.</p>



<p>As one example, most airlines have their own wallet, but they don’t call it a wallet. Flying <a href="https://www.delta.com/">Delta Airlines</a>? You probably have the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fly-delta/id388491656">Fly Delta app</a>. This app lets you search, compare, and book flights. It helps you change seats to get that inch or two of extra leg room. It also prompts you to check in, creates a boarding pass, and even helps you find your new gate when your flight is moved. For identity, it manages your government ID data, your passport, and credit cards. For air travel, it does pretty much everything. So, why are we still using the Apple Wallet?</p>



<p>While the Fly Delta app focuses on Delta’s flying experience, the Apple Wallet (or Google Wallet) does a bunch of other random, but really important, things. It stores payments and lets you pay online and at contactless terminals, and maintains an itemized list of purchases. It also stores insurance cards, movie tickets, membership cards, and a limitless set of cards with QR codes. So, if Apple’s wallet does all of that, why would you need anything else?</p>



<p>While the Apple Wallet is very general purpose, it can’t do all the specialized things that apps like Delta’s do. While you’ll use Delta’s to search, book, and carry out your travel plans, Fly Delta also lets you save your boarding pass as a card with flight info and a boarding QR code into your Apple Wallet. Why do they work together? Isn’t there a war over wallet adoption? Not really.</p>



<p>While the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">Browser Wars</a> battled over control of your web experience, today’s wallet apps specialize by providing different functionality, which means you will likely want several – and you will want to them to work together. Domination may have been the previous goal, but today, we want our apps to work together to give us a seamless, interoperable experience as we bounce from app to site to service and then into another app. Consumers want an easy, seamless experience that just works – since that’s how we think.</p>



<p>So, is a wallet an app or a feature of an app?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer is yes, because wallets (or rather wallet functionality) are in everything. Some apps are called wallets (e.g., <a href="https://www.apple.com/wallet/">Apple Wallet</a>, <a href="https://wallet.google/">Google Wallet</a>) and we see them that way. Some apps have wallets inside (e.g., <a href="https://www.delta.com/us/en/delta-digital/mobile">Fly Delta</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>) and we use them that way. Don’t get hung up on whether an app is a wallet, or a wallet is (part of) an app. Ask two questions and keep asking them:</p>



 
 Is it secure? Does it use all the right encryption and standardized protocols and does use them in the right way?&nbsp; 



 Does it maintain YOUR privacy? Does it keep your data private, or does it sell your identity, purchase, and usage data and exchange all that with social media and data brokers? &nbsp; 
 



<p>Keep asking those questions, ask them of every provider, and don’t stop asking. As you ask about wallet privacy and security, you can also ask whether they comply with the latest industry standards. Emerging standards help providers enhance security and privacy, comply with national legislation (e.g., GDPR), and avoid data breach embarrassments. A new generation of cryptographic identity standards and protocols are currently available from industry standards organizations, such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a>, etc. These standards groups are creating blueprints that are becoming the backbone of national legislation, such as Europe’s <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS Regulation</a>, which “facilitates secure cross-border transactions by establishing a framework for digital identity and authentication … to create confidence in electronic interactions and promote seamless digital services in the EU.”</p>



<p>So, is a wallet an app or does an app contain a wallet? While the answer is a definitive yes, now you know that the real questions are How is it built?, Does it comply with industry standards?, and Will it protect my identity and my data?</p>

<p>2024 was a pivotal year for the adoption of mobile driver’s licenses (mDL), with many new states moving to adopt this new form of privacy- and security-enhancing digital identity. However, many of these projects are still being tested, with elements still to be explored and refined.</p><p>One of those is accessibility in emerging technology. Digital credentials like mDL are crucial to many basic aspects of life, like all forms of identity documentation, and must be usable by as many people as possible. It’s vital to ensure, for instance, that the visually impaired can present credentials in various contexts. There are upsides to explore, too: What benefits might people gain from new digital identity tools?</p><p>The good news is that, while challenges remain, mobile devices and apps already offer comprehensive accessibility options that extend to digital credentials—in fact, mobile devices have become powerful tools for improving the lives of those with disabilities. For some types of disabilities, such as mobility impairments, digital credentials offer further quality-of-life improvements.</p> What Does Accessibility Mean? <p>Information technology built for accessibility must abide by four core principles outlined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">World Wide Web Consortium</a>. These principles are sometimes referred to by the acronym POUR, for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.</p><p>Tools should be Perceivable even for those with constrained senses; they should be Operable with a variety of input mechanisms, including keyboards, touch, or voice controls; and they should be clear so they’re easily Understandable. Finally, infrastructure should be Robust in its formatting and presentation, enabling a variety of user agents and assistive technologies to interpret and present data to users.</p><p>For state and local governments in the U.S., making web and mobile tools accessible is mandatory under the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> and its evolving rules. These rules ensure that everyone can benefit from the convenience of the internet to engage with vital government processes like voting and paying taxes.</p><p>But serving as many users as possible is also just good business for private firms: more than 4 million Americans, for instance, have<a href="https://www.afb.org/research-and-initiatives/statistics/adults-vision-loss-nhis?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> serious or total loss of vision</a>, 11 million have <a href="https://nationaldeafcenter.org/faq/how-many-deaf-people-live-in-the-united-states/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">serious hearing loss or total deafness</a>, and more than 12%, or 40 million, have<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disability-impacts-all-of-us-infographic.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> impaired mobility</a>. Overall, according to the CDC, nearly 29% of American adults have some form of disability.</p><p>That’s not a group businesses can afford to leave underserved.</p> Digital Tools for the Visually Impaired <p>The first accessibility challenge you’re likely to consider when thinking about the mobile driver’s license is for users with visual impairments. For example, one common way a digital credential might be presented is as a QR code, which is likely to be quite difficult for someone who can’t see the scanning device.</p><p>The good news is that the phone itself is far less of an obstacle. A sighted person might assume that the lack of tactile feedback like braille would make using a smartphone nearly impossible for a blind person, but in fact, <a href="https://lifeofablindgirl.com/2019/02/03/how-do-blind-and-visually-impaired-people-use-a-mobile-phone/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">smartphones have shown many advantages for the blind</a>. Thanks to screen-reader software and gesture-based controls built natively into both Apple and Android devices, according to one expert, “the vast majority of everyday actions that needed the help of a third person a few years ago <a href="https://www.inclusivecitymaker.com/the-smartphone-a-revolution-for-the-blind-and-visually-impaired/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">can now be done on the phone.</a>”</p><p>For mDL users, that means a screen reader will let them find the correct wallet and credentials. As VDCs become more common, this might even become a more accessible option than paper credentials: It’s relatively rare for certifications or identity documents to be offered with braille options, and while the percentage of visually impaired people who use braille is not well-studied, it seems surprisingly low:<a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/news/two-centuries-later-braille-is-still-as-important-as-ever-says-teenage-sight-loss-campaigner?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> only about 7% in the U.K.</a>, for instance. Digital credentials could, in practical terms, be more accessible than paper documents.&nbsp;</p><p>This does require the designers of credentials and wallets to comply with the POUR tenet of robustness: data must be easy to read for a variety of user agents. While wallet designers will need to be specifically attentive here, one of the great strengths of verifiable digital credentials is that they conform to universal standards – meaning that the data in the credentials themselves will be consistently categorized and formatted by default, making it easy for agents to interpret for users.</p><p>Read More: <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/who-should-build-a-digital-wallet-2/">Who Should Build a Digital Wallet?</a></p><p>The question of scanning or presenting credentials in various contexts is thornier. While we don’t claim to have the answer, one possible route would be to use sound to guide users to a scanner: a scaled-down analog to the <a href="https://www.okeenea.com/en/audio-beacon?ref=blog.spruceid.com">audio beacons</a> that are common for U.S. crosswalks and increasingly used in other settings.&nbsp;</p> Security as Accessibility <p>The largest group of Americans with disabilities is people who face cognitive impairments, defined as serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. A substantial portion of this group is made up of older Americans – and they are disproportionately victims of <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5508139/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">fraud and phishing attempts</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While VDCs can't stop scammers from asking for an intrusive amount of personal data or prevent phishing of passwords, they can bring an additional element of security to common transactions with trusted verifiers, such that any fraudulent activity will stand out. If a bank is routinely asking for a verifiable digital credential before transferring money, it will be obvious if that credential isn't required or if the verifier is not the normal requester for a fraudulent transfer.</p><p>Of course, mDL and other forms of VDC are novel technologies that may be off-putting or confusing for those with cognitive impairments, regardless of their theoretical benefits. This is one important reason that VDC-based identity, whatever its advantages, should be offered as an optional, convenient supplement for paper-based documents rather than a required substitute.</p> The Big Benefit of Digital Credentials: Secure Remote Services <p>Mobility impairment is the second-largest type of disability impacting Americans after cognitive impairment. This is where the mobile driver’s license and other VDCs have the potential to truly shine: because they are reliable for acceptance online, digital credentials can enable new kinds of remote services for people who face challenges moving around. This potentially includes not just reliably proving identity online but eventually presenting a variety of other documents, from <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/stories-from-the-future-how-new-u-s-digital-identity-rules-will-change-our-lives/">marriage certificates to property titles and medical history</a>.</p><p>Discussion around digital credentials has often touched specifically on financial services and benefits provision, particularly relevant for people with a disability since some may receive financial assistance. Reliable digital identity and credentials can also open employment opportunities for the mobility impaired: remote work is ideal for many people with mobility challenges, and digital credentials used for secure access control can make more roles available remotely.</p><p>While work remains to carefully understand and address user needs, a close look shows that digital credentials are starting from a very strong position for accessibility. As the verifiable digital credential ecosystem develops, SpruceID is committed to maximizing that potential for the benefit of all Americans.</p> Explore Accessible Verifiable Digital Credentials <p>At SpruceID, we’re committed to making digital identity solutions accessible, secure, and user-friendly for everyone. As mobile driver’s licenses and verifiable digital credentials continue to evolve, ensuring inclusivity is key to unlocking their full potential.

 How do you live in a house that isn’t property? How might reimagining our relationship with the house create space for Indigenous Reconciliation? And how might this support the thriving of the next seven generations? <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle Civics</a>, <a href="https://www.7gencities.org/">7GenCities</a> and the <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/">Property &amp; Beyond Lab</a> explore this proposition in one of the first exhibitions and workshops on FreeHouse Tkaronto. <p>In early October last year, Dark Matter Labs and 7GenCities, by the kind invitation of our friends at Evergreen, participated in the annual Evergreen Conference 2024, on the <a href="https://www.evergreen.ca/learn-and-discover/the-evergreen-conference/the-evergreen-conference-2024/">theme of “unlocking public spaces for people and planet.”</a> Apart from hosting a workshop on our toolkit for Open Space Resilience Tool Embedding Reconciliation, developed by <a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">TreesAI</a> and 7GenCities for Evergreen, we also showcased for the first time in public our FreeHouse Tkaronto proposition, as a conference exhibit and a workshop. This blog documents our work so far, and what’s coming&nbsp;next.</p> What is FreeHouse? FreeHouse at the Desgin Museum’s Future Observatory Display<p>FreeHouse, a concept of a self-owning house existing beyond property relations, has been an ongoing exploration across many parts of DML, including most recently as a <a href="https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/future-observatory-display">display at the Design Museum’s Future Observatory exhibition</a>, and a Life Ennobling Economics and Radicle Civics discussion on how <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/non-extractive-financing-for-a-house-a-green-tinted-fantasy-or-a-realistic-proposition-1710a2ead629">housing can be financed non-extractively</a>. For us, self-ownership is a core provocation of the <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/">Property &amp; Beyond Lab</a> and creates the space to ask critical questions about our relationship with housing, including:</p>  How do you live in a house that owns itself?<br>If there isn’t an owner that has all the rights over a house because it owns itself, how can we make decisions over housing and its value for the&nbsp;commons?  What if a house could generate value beyond extracting rent?<br>Housing is treated as a commodity that allows the owner to extract rent. But a house could generate energy, reduce flood risk, improve biodiversity, sequester carbon, improve health, and more. What would generative housing look like&nbsp;instead?  What if the materials of a house are leased from the Earth and not owned?<br>A house is made up of many materials, some of which often end up in landfill at the end of its life. If we didn’t own the house’s materials but they were on loan from the Earth, how might we care for and reuse them more responsibly?   FreeHouse Tkaronto: a housing model that creates space for restoring longstanding Indigenous relationships with the&nbsp;land <p>FreeHouse Tkaronto is our first place-based proof-of-possibility proposed for Toronto, building on our collaborator Callum Nolan’s research on the viability of regenerative housing models on Toronto’s ravines.</p><p>What we call Toronto occupies the homeland of present-day Treaty 13 holders, the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation and the ancestral homelands of the Anishinaabeg, Wendat and Haudenosaunee Confederacies. Not only do we acknowledge their custodianship over this land, but we should also understand that these and other Nations have sacred, longstanding and multivalent relationships with the land based on kinship, reciprocity and stewardship that have cared for this land over generations.</p><p>It is only since the imposition by colonialism of western conceptions of property — the idea of enclosing and controlling a piece of land — that property has become the predominant form of relationship between humans and the land. This has underpinned many of the systemic issues around housing inequality today, which are especially stark in the context of Toronto, where <a href="https://torontofoundation.ca/vitalsigns-issue-2/">house prices are growing four times faster than incomes</a>, while housing supply is failing to meet growing demand, with <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/research-reports/housing-and-homelessness-research-and-reports/social-housing-waiting-list-reports/">almost 93,000 on the social housing wait&nbsp;list</a>.</p>Canada is an outlier among G7 countries in terms of housing unaffordability, measured by real house price to income ratio. Image source: Callum Nolan based on data from&nbsp;OECD<p>FreeHouse Tkaronto, as a demonstrator of a house beyond property relations, is therefore not for us just a thought exercise, but a critical step in Indigenous reconciliation. We hope to prove the possibility of an alternative housing model that moves beyond property and extraction, and instead recenters Indigenous land relationships built on interdependent and reciprocal interactions with the land and structures that we create as home. FreeHouse Tkaronto could prove a pathway for systems change, decolonising the problematic systems that have underpinned the multiple crises we face, from climate to&nbsp;housing.</p> Why Toronto’s ravines? <p>Toronto’s ravine system is one of the things that makes the city unique: these blue-green networks of rivers and urban forests run all the way from its green belt to its city centre, and is in fact the largest in any city in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>There is already an intergenerational tradition of Indigenous stewardship in the ravines. Ravines have naturally demarcated territory before superimposed property and administrative lines, their streams and rivers made them a hub of trade and travel, and the site of many communities and settlements. The Carrying Place trail followed what is now known as the Humber River, and was one of the most important First Nations trade&nbsp;routes.</p>Mapping the social factors of the ravines, from land ownership, Indigenous sacred fire sites, to existing community housing. Image source: Callum&nbsp;Nolan<p>Restoring connections and access to the land is a critical dimension of Indigenous reconciliation today. In more recent years, there have been Indigenous stewardship initiatives of municipally-managed lands, such as the role of Indigenous Land Stewardship Circle in Toronto’s High Park Oak Savannahs, and the Nikibii Dawadinna Giigwag land-based learning and sustainable urban design program. These initiatives situate diverse Indigenous knowledges within conservation and regenerative land relationships, and provide opportunity and access to land for urban Indigenous Community, as part of a deeper reconciliation process.</p><p>Since Ontario’s Conservation Authorities Act 1946, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) is responsible for managing the ravines, with a unique governance arrangement. TRCA owns up to 60% of the land designated as ravines, where it has management agreements with the City of Toronto. For land the TRCA does not own but falls within the ravine designation, TRCA requirements take precedence over all other regulations (e.g. for building permits), and TRCA undertakes work for environmental/ remediation purposes, including on private land (e.g. backyards) that fall under this designation. The TRCA and the City of Toronto are critical decision-makers in how the ravines are stewarded.</p><p>The TRCA recognises the value that the ravines provide to the city: they estimate that the ravines contribute <a href="https://pub-trca.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=5227">ecosystem services worth CA$800 million annually</a> and they admit this is a conservative estimate where over half of this figure is the social value from the use of the ravines for recreation, with only a select number of co-benefits accounted with an existing body of evidence. The value of flood risk mitigation, biodiversity (beyond the social value of “knowing natural areas exist”), and its synergetic impact on urban climate resilience is notably&nbsp;absent.</p>Mapping the ecological factors of the ravines, from restoration priority, water quality, vegetation health, to ongoing remediation projects. Image source: Callum&nbsp;Nolan<p>Yet not all ravine land is fulfilling its full regenerative potential for Toronto’s commons. Callum Nolan’s remote sensing and GIS analysis of the ravine network, using water quality data and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imaging (an indicator of vegetation greenness and plant health), reveals parts of the ravine system that have been degraded due to human intervention, including hard surfaces and canalisation, contrary to the ravines’ popular image as “untouched wilderness.” This is corroborated by the TRCA’s own Integrated Restoration Prioritization index which identifies parts of the ravines with high priority for ecosystem restoration, based on aggregating metrics such as natural cover, aquatic systems, altered hydrology, connectivity and natural heritage value. By combining multiple metrics, we can already begin to identify potential sites which could host an alternative model for restoring and caring for the&nbsp;ravines.</p> Reconciliation and restoration on the ravines: a strategic opportunity <p>The FreeHouse Tkaronto proposition is simple: creating regenerative, truly affordable housing on degraded land along valuable ravine ecosystems for residents who will support land stewardship inspired by Indigenous land practices.</p><p>The model works in two parts: firstly the FreeHouse’s regenerative design principles will ensure that the home is built in a non-extractive and sustainable way. This crucially recontextualises the home not as a commodity, but a confluence of relationships: that with its inhabitants (comfort, design for minimal maintenance, the steward’s rights), and the wider ecosystem (energy use and generation, heating, urban drainage, biodiversity and use of resources). The development of the FreeHouse will also provide an opportunity to remediate the past ecologically-damaging interventions of the site as part of its landscaping, such as reusing or removing grey infrastructure while restoring naturalised watercourses, and re-wilding the riparian landscape.</p><p>Secondly, the model recognises that Indigenous knowledges and practices are rooted in an embodied presence on the land. How would a steward who actually lives on the land understand the entangled ecological and social relationships around the ravines differently from a conservation worker who manages it as part of a portfolio of responsibilities? And how would this embodied knowledge shape how they care for the land differently?</p><p>We suggest that, under guidance and leadership of Indigenous knowledge holders, a model of resident stewardship could support the flourishing of the ravines and the value they add to the city’s commons. This could be through supporting activities to restore and preserve the ravine environment (e.g. caring for saplings), or developing intelligence of the ecosystem’s health through experiencing it daily (e.g. observing wildlife, plant health, water quality, etc.). This builds on initiatives that already exist in the ravine context, such the Indigenous-led <a href="https://turtleprotectors.com/">Turtle Protectors program</a>, and the TRCA’s own efforts, such as its <a href="https://trca.ca/conservation/sustainable-neighbourhoods/">Sustainable Neighbourhood Action Plan (SNAP) programs</a>, which involve local communities in the stewardship of urban nature in their areas. There are also <a href="https://parks.canada.ca/culture/autochtones-indigenous/cercle-circle">initiatives across Canada</a> to enable Indigenous stewardship in public land practices.</p>The strategy weaves together a commons of multiple actors across the&nbsp;ravines.<p>It is the ambition of the model to realise housing as a genuine commons: weaving together multiple actors, from Indigenous stewardship leads, residents, to public authorities in mutually beneficial relationships, and creating value in their entanglement that is greater than the sum of its parts. This would also be reflected in the strategic design components required, such as the governance and decision-making design of this commons, the stewardship agreement between resident and the commons, and frameworks for understanding the multivalent and holistic outcomes created by the FreeHouse and the steward’s care.</p> Exhibition and Workshop at the Evergreen Brickworks The Freehouse Tkaronto display at the Evergreen Conference<p>As part of the two-day Evergreen Conference, we were offered the opportunity to exhibit at Brickworks’ Young Centre, where we showcased the FreeHouse Tkaronto proposition in public for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>Apart from exhibition boards that summarise the FreeHouse Tkaronto proposition, the exhibition also featured provocative objects that captured the FreeHouse concept, including those featured in our Design Museum’s Future Observatory exhibition. This included a sample of a cross-laminated timber structure ‘on loan from the Earth’ showing repairs and records of its past lives. A ‘receipt for ecosystem services’ was also displayed, to raise questions over what generative value a house could have beyond extracting rent. As an interactive conversation prompt, we also had a mock stewardship agreement with flash cards allowing visitors to suggest what a fair combination of rights and responsibilities for a FreeHouse resident should&nbsp;be.</p><p>The exhibition also summarised our analysis of the ravines within the city limits, understanding the different entangled relationships that are inherent in ravine land in two maps. In ‘Ecology of the Ravines’, we show NDVI analysis, water quality, Integrated Restoration priority, and areas of TRCA ownership together with a selection of relevant conservation projects. In ‘Community around the Ravines’, we map out lost/buried rivers, significant Indigenous historical sites, sacred fire sites, community housing schemes, in relation to areas of TRCA ownership and ravine and green space zoning designations, with a selection of Indigenous and community-led initiatives.</p><p>Finally, the exhibition features an illustrative drawing of a FreeHouse Tkaronto situated in the landscape, exploring what the different forms of value the ravines create for the city, and how this could be augmented by the FreeHouse design and the resident stewards.</p><p>The Evergreen Conference provided an opportunity to receive feedback from actors involved in placemaking, from architects and urban designers, members of community organisations, environmental consultants, to people who work for municipal and conservation authorities. Visitors were invited to leave their feedback, with a few recurring themes that stood out. There was appreciation of the power in fundamental reframing ideas about property in relation to housing and resources that have been embedded deeply in the very&nbsp;culture.</p><p>However, there were also concerns over the fact that much local political effort has been invested in ensuring that ravines are protected from development. Even if the FreeHouse Tkaronto strategy aimed to remediate the ecologically-degraded parts of the ravine, it could set a precedent for ravine development, including in its more extractive forms. We will work closely with the TRCA, as the permitting authority for ravine land, to ensure that this unintended consequence is&nbsp;avoided.</p><p>Finally, we also learned of existing precedents for an integrated stewardship-housing model in and around Toronto. For example, Parks Canada’s Rouge National Urban Park, operates realty services for properties (including residential) inside the national park, <a href="https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/on/rouge/info/serviceimmobilier-realty/who">offering leases for tenants who commit to responsible stewardship</a> of the heritage buildings, and protecting the built and natural environment of the park. <a href="https://trca.ca/conservation/trca-property-management/">The TRCA, which also owns 118 residential properties</a>, also similarly leases homes on a stewardship basis. These serve as local precedents for models of combining housing, stewardship in conservation areas, on which FreeHouse Tkaronto can&nbsp;build.</p> Rightsholder &amp; Stakeholder Engagement Workshop Rightsholder and stakeholder workshop at the Evergreen Brickworks<p>On the day after the Evergreen Conference, we organised a half-day workshop to take a focused deep dive into the proposition for feedback and exploring next steps. It was co-hosted by 7GenCities (Jayne Engle, Tanya Chung-Tiam-Fook), Dark Matter Labs (Calvin Po, Callum Nolan, Sofia Valentini), and the City of Toronto’s Indigenous Affairs Office (Selina Young, Fred Martin, Emma&nbsp;Cooper).</p><p>Attendees also represented different stakeholders in the system. This included:</p>  Dr Hopi Martin from Edge of the Bush (Ojibwe Developmental Psychology and Education Oshkaabewis — Sacred Helper, Messenger, Fire Keeper, Lodge Caretaker)  Colleagues from across different parts of the&nbsp;TRCA:  Sonia Dhir (TRCA’s government and community relations liaison)  Steven Heuchert (TRCA’s development, planning, and&nbsp;permits)  Edlyn Wong (TRCA’s property)  Nicola Hives from the Toronto Foundation  Michelle Baldwin from Community Foundations of&nbsp;Canada  Lois Lindsay from Evergreen Canada who also kindly provided the venue situated in the heart of the Don Valley and the&nbsp;ravines.  <p>It should be noted that pre-workshop briefings and conversations were held with some of the attendees, as well as a number of Indigenous Elders and housing and community advisors who were unable to attend the workshop at the Brick Works. Ideas, concerns and recommendations from these engagement sessions helped to shape and refine thinking, design and planning of the workshop and exhibit, and overall&nbsp;project.</p><p>The workshop began in ceremony with the asemaa or sacred tobacco teaching co-led by Dr. Hopi Martin (Lenni Lenape + European) and Fred Martin (Anishinaabe + Mi’kmaq), and deep sharing of local Anishinaabe knowledge and wisdom traditions situated on the land and in place, within the context of Waasayishkodenayosh or the Lower Don River watershed. An Waabizheshi Oshkaabewis of the Ojibwe Martin Clan (Sacred Helper, Messenger, Fire Keeper, Lodge Caretaker), Hopi’s generous teachings wove together a rich, multi-layered spiritual, cultural and natural basket to hold and nourish the dialogues and collective sensemaking. Hopi leads the Edge of the Bush, an Indigenous-led land-based learning initiative with partners like Evergreen. Fred is Senior Project Manager at the Indigenous Affairs Office and Waterfront Secretariat, City of&nbsp;Toronto.</p><p>The Indigenous co-holder at 7GenCities, Tanya (Akawaio-Kapon/mixed), shared a futuring narrative she created for the initiative, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1doDlaB7zsGFypR_PxTP_lpVunsaSKtaE/edit">FreeHouse Tkaronto: Reimagining our relationships to land and housing as a common good</a>, where she invited us to collectively imagine a future Tkaronto where we were re-rooted into the lineage of place and First Peoples, landscapes, entangled human and more-than-human relationships, and Indigenous stewardship traditions of the Lower Don watershed and ravines. She invited us to imagine manifesting an emergent housing system based on deeper, more reciprocal and re-sacralized land relationships, where housing is allocated and governed as a common good. To imagine also FreeHouse Tkaronto as a proof of possibility for a vibrant housing commons embedded in: intrinsic forms of valuation, collectively defined and mutually agreed upon resident and land stewardship rights, and roles and responsibilities inspired and guided by diverse, long held Indigenous land protocols and practices.</p>Rightsholder and stakeholder workshop at the Evergreen Brickworks<p>Jayne, Calvin and Callum then gave a recap of the FreeHouse Tkaronto concept and how it sits in the wider context of 7GenCities and Dark Matter Labs’ work, and building on the learnings of <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/oa-edit/10.4324/9781003199816/sacred-civics-jayne-engle-julian-agyeman-tanya-chung-tiam-fook">Sacred Civics: Building Seven Generation Cities </a>(Engle, Agyeman &amp; Chung-Tiam-Fook, 2022) and <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/gg6r1tfm/production/32778190c96f1fc092be8d251483b8782f163354.pdf">FreeLand</a>. The structure of the workshop was focused on collecting feedback across different parts of the proposition, and then taking a deeper dive into selected comments for open discussion.</p><p>One of the most important comments that arose is how our work learns the lessons of Indigenous place-based knowledge. For example, ‘Tkaronto’, originates from the Kanyen’kehà:ka phrase meaning “where there are trees standing in the water.” This etymology for what would become the city Toronto’s name, and also the name of our FreeHouse, embodies a special relationship with water and the natural watercourses. It was also raised that in some First Nations languages, city is conceptualized in more inclusive and relational ways, such as the Nêhiyaw (Cree) word for city: otenaw literally translates as ‘a circle of hearts coming together’. Indigenous languages and narratives should be central in communicating the vision of FreeHouse, and what it means for humanity and the planet being in relationship, instead of the technical language of policy, such as ‘frameworks’ and ‘mapping’, that DML is often accustomed to. We should therefore also reflect on different media of communication, beyond ‘decks’ and ‘papers’, and consider the role of the arts and other forms of storytelling.</p><p>This was also related to a reflection about how FreeHouse Tkaronto relates to the wider political context over Indigenous reconciliation. It was noted that it is coming up to ten years since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was concluded, which is a key milestone for assessing progress. There was also a discussion about how FreeHouse Tkaronto and the concepts of self-ownership and stewardship sits in relation to Land Back movements, and the tensions that will need to be addressed.</p><p>Understanding the wider context of historic injustice will be essential in finding the right approach. Engagement of, and centering, Indigenous Community and Indigenous housing leadership at all stages of visioning, building and implementing a proof of possibility was deemed paramount by Indigenous co-hosts. When considering how we will design governance and decision-making processes, there was a question of what Indigenous-led stewardship means tangibly. It was raised that, based on past experiences, Indigenous People having an equal seat at the table is not enough. We must consider what safeguards need to be put in place, who might need to give up power, and also what systems need to change to enable this approach.</p><p>Similarly, the financing approach must not simply “look for new money” but be aware of the overwhelming wealth that has been extracted by dispossessing Indigenous Peoples of their lands and breaking treaty agreements. When the legal and regulatory barriers to this work are encountered, their role in entrenching and reinforcing the status quo should be considered, as should their origins and legitimacy, especially in relation to natural and Indigenous laws. It was suggested that a ‘regulatory sandbox’ approach can be used to carve out a space for restoring these&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The current approaches to conservation are still very much oriented around ‘control’, rather than one of ‘being in relation’. There have been attempts at <a href="https://trca.ca/conservation/restoration/ecosystem-compensation/">ecosystem compensation</a> which aims to quantify and replace loss of ecosystem value with creation and restoration projects, but this is still based on a premise of avoiding harm and could move further towards regeneration. The balance between a holistic approach and measurable outcomes will also require consideration, especially when accepting funding and investment. Furthermore, there is much political capital invested in this paradigm of control (especially over development permits) as it is seen as “the last protection left” for the ravines from being developed, echoing feedback from the exhibition.</p><p>For FreeHouse Tkaronto to serve as a demonstrator of regenerative approaches, it must navigate these tensions carefully. One compelling suggestion was that instead of building literally in ravine-designated areas, FreeHouse could choose ecologically-degraded sites adjacent to ravine land. The remediation would therefore be a way of “extending the ravine network”, creating net positive ecological value while avoiding the political risk of setting precedents for ravine development and opening the door to expanding settlement in the ravines. This would also sidestep some of the practical difficulties (e.g. safe access and insurability challenges) associated with flood and erosion-prone land. A Sustainable Drainage Strategy (SuDS) strategy for ravine-adjacent land could also reduce downstream risk, as demonstrated in similar precedents such as Mimico&nbsp;Creek.</p>An indicative mapping study of potential sites that can ‘extend the ravines’ through the regenerative development of FreeHouses, subject to further analysis on property ownership.<p>Our initial mapping study above, based on an indicative sample area of the city, is already highlighting a number of potential sites. We have identified vacant land or unproductive surface parking lots adjacent to the TRCA-regulated ravines area could be remediated as a way of “extending the ravines” while developing FreeHouse Tkaronto. As part of further site analysis studies, which would be conducted as part of the next phase of work, we would further refine the study by considering additional search criteria such as land ownership. We could explore how these ravine-adjacent opportunities coincide with lands that are publicly owned (whether at a municipal, provincial, or federal level) where there is a compelling case to use them to generate value for the public good. Other factors affecting the viability of FreeHouse development would also be considered.</p><p>A potential site for prototyping FreeHouse Tkaronto connected to the 72km circular Loop Trail in Toronto’s Don Valley ravine network, is at a very early stage of discussion with Evergreen. Another possible site suggested was the car park of the new TRCA headquarters, which has unrealised land use and ecological restoration potential.</p> Next steps <p>We are in the developmental stage of building foundations and partnerships for this emergent project and we will continue to work on ideating and co-building this work in 2025, with potential next steps including:</p><p>We will continue building FreeHouse Tkaronto as a proof of possibility in an extremely timely moment of housing crisis; emerging recognition for Truth &amp; Reconciliation and Indigenous leadership (including land stewardship approaches); climate breakdown; political and economic uncertainty; and rising momentum for transformative innovation in housing and civic infrastructures, regenerative land relationships, and collaborative and Indigenous co-led governance approaches. This work includes:</p>  Continue to build relationships and partnerships with interested co-builders, rights holders and stakeholders, and&nbsp;funders  Continue to explore and develop key foundations: i.e. ravine ecology and climate resilience, Indigenous land stewardship and regenerative value, design and delivery, regulatory and legal considerations, residence stewardship agreement and multi-actor governance, and financing and funding&nbsp;options.  Secure substantial funding for this developmental work on the project, as well as to build the prototype.  Deepening engagement with Indigenous Community i.e. local Knowledge Keepers, urban housing organisations and land stewards; and non-Indigenous local land stewards including a community engagement workshop.  Continuing site analysis and selection studies for FreeHouse prototype e.g. assess feasibility and risks of potential ecologically-degraded sites adjacent to ravine land in the Don Valley, Tkaronto, and their potential to generate ecological and social&nbsp;value.  Studying context-based precedents of housing commons and Indigenous land stewardship and co-governance relevant to Tkaronto context: e.g. community land trusts and Toronto’s Port Lands Waterfront Revitalization and Indigenous Cultural Revitalization.  <p>We will have take a special focus on planning the governance design process for FreeHouse Tkaronto:</p>  Developing ideas for structuring collaborative governance including Indigenous co-governance;  Exploring the challenges of multi-actor governance i.e. time needed to build consensus while maintaining momentum; finding shared&nbsp;purpose;  Prioritizing Indigenous perspectives and co-leadership; and  Mapping the design journey, with transparency in sharing challenges, decisions, and influence of institutional and political systems.

 Deep Search Tools and Techniques on Google 



<p>Google offers a range of deep search tools that allow you to find exactly what you need. With simple tricks like using quotation marks or excluding keywords, you can save time and quickly access the information you need.</p>



 Search for Exact Phrases 



<p>When you want to perform an advanced search for an exact phrase, the best method is to put it in quotation marks. This tells Google that you’re only interested in pages with that exact phrase.</p>



<p>Example search: “Deep search techniques”</p>



<p>This will return pages that contain the exact phrase “Deep search techniques” as you requested.</p>



 Excluding Keywords 



<p>To eliminate irrelevant results, you can use the minus sign (-). Simply add a minus sign in front of any keyword you want to exclude from the advanced search results.</p>



<p>Example search: SEO -Facebook</p>



<p>This will find SEO-related information, but without any results related to Facebook.</p>



 Using “OR” in Searches 



<p>When you want to search for either one keyword or another, use the “OR” operator (must be in uppercase).</p>



<p>Example search: “SEO” OR “Digital Marketing”</p>



<p>This will return results related to both SEO and Digital Marketing, expanding the scope of your deep search.</p>



 Search by Text, Title, or URL 



<p>You can search for information within a page’s content, title, or URL using operators like allintext:, allintitle:, and allinurl:.</p>



<p>Example search: allintext:”Advanced search”</p>



<p>This will return pages that include the phrase “Advanced search” in their text content.</p>


 
 


 Other Deep Search Tricks 



<p>In addition to these basic tricks, there are many other deep search techniques to help you extract information faster and more accurately. You can try special commands like “site:”, “related:”, or “link:” to find information more effectively in specific situations.</p>



 Search Within a Specific Website 



<p>If you want to perform an advanced search within a specific website, use the site: operator.</p>



<p>Example search: site:seothetop.com “SEO”</p>



<p>This will return articles related to “SEO” only from the website seothetop.com.</p>



 Search for Related Websites 



<p>Use the related: command to find websites with similar content to the one you know.</p>



<p>Example search: related:seothetop.com</p>



<p>This will help you explore websites with similar content, useful when searching for alternative sources of information.</p>



 Search for Websites Containing Links 



<p>If you want to find websites that link to a specific page, use the link: operator.</p>



<p>Example search: link:seothetop.com</p>



<p>This will show pages that contain links to seothetop.com, valuable for backlink analysis in SEO.</p>



 Search Using Synonyms 



<p>Use the tilde (~) symbol to search for synonyms, which helps expand the scope of your advanced search.</p>



<p>Example search: ~marketing</p>



<p>Google will search for synonyms of “marketing,” including “digital marketing,” “advertising,” and more.</p>



 Deep Web: How to Explore the “Deep” Part of the Internet 



 What is the Deep Web? 



<p>The Deep Web is the portion of the internet that cannot be found using regular search engines. This area contains private databases, legal documents, personal accounts, and other content that can only be accessed through specialized deep search engines.</p>



 The Difference Between the Deep Web and the Dark Web 



<p>The Deep Web and the Dark Web are often confused, but they are actually two distinct parts of the internet. The Dark Web is a section of the Deep Web, but it is associated with illegal activities and can be dangerous. It’s important to understand this difference to avoid potential risks when accessing these areas.</p>

 Deep Search Engines for Exploring the Deep Web 



<p>To explore deeper resources within the Deep Web, users need specialized deep search engines, which are different from those used on the surface internet.</p>



 
 Torch: One of the oldest and most notable advanced search engines for the Deep Web, Torch allows users to access documents, forums, and other resources that regular search engines like Google cannot index. It supports searches on websites with a “.onion” domain, providing access to hidden resources deep within the internet.<br> 



 DuckDuckGo: Known for its commitment to privacy on the surface web, DuckDuckGo also supports deep searches in the Deep Web. It does not store user information and helps search for hidden websites, ensuring privacy during web browsing. DuckDuckGo does not track or record any search history, making it ideal for users who want to maintain anonymity when browsing the Deep Web.<br> 



 Ahmia, Haystack, Yippy: Other specialized advanced search engines like Ahmia, Haystack, and Yippy are designed to access the darker parts of the internet. These tools allow users to search hidden sites without being tracked or having their data recorded, ensuring security and privacy. All of these engines support access to “.onion” websites, allowing users to search the Deep Web safely and effectively. 
 


 
 


 Benefits of Using Deep Search 



<p>Using deep search techniques offers numerous benefits, not only helping you find more precise information but also supporting SEO optimization and protecting your privacy online. Let’s explore these benefits to enhance your search experience.</p>

 Why Should You Turn SafeSearch Off? 



<p>When SafeSearch is enabled, you won’t have access to all search results because some content is filtered out. However, turning off SafeSearch allows you to access more in-depth data, which can be crucial for certain fields that require detailed information. Let’s dive into why turning SafeSearch off might sometimes be necessary.</p>



 
 Expanding Search Results: Turning off SafeSearch opens the door to more comprehensive search results, providing access to details that might be hidden with SafeSearch on. This gives you the chance to find more in-depth data, including valuable information that might otherwise be excluded.<br> 



 Specialized Needs and Research: If you’re a researcher, teacher, or working in a field that requires detailed information like medicine, art, etc., turning off SafeSearch is essential. Sometimes, to ensure you don’t miss any important resource, you need unrestricted access to all search results.<br> 
 



 How to Turn SafeSearch Off on Laptop and Phone (Android &amp; iOS) 



<p>If you want to easily access information without restrictions, turning off SafeSearch is a good option. Here’s a quick guide on how to do it on both computers and mobile devices, from Android to iOS, with just a few simple steps.</p>



 Turning Off SafeSearch on Laptop 



<p>To disable SafeSearch on a laptop, follow these simple steps within Google:</p>



 
 Open your browser and go to Google’s homepage. 



 Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on “Settings,” then select Search Settings. 



 In the SafeSearch filters section, you’ll see the option to Turn on SafeSearch. Uncheck this box to turn off the feature. 



 Finally, make sure to click Save to confirm. Once completed, your search results will no longer be limited by SafeSearch filters. 
 


 
 


 Turning Off SafeSearch on Mobile (Android/iOS) 



<p>Turning off SafeSearch on mobile is also quick and easy:</p>



 
 Open the Google app or your web browser. 



 Tap the Menu icon (usually three horizontal lines or dots) and select Settings. 



 In the Settings section, find SafeSearch, and switch it to Off. 



 Don’t forget to save your changes to activate the setting. Now you can access broader search results without being restricted by SafeSearch. 
 


 
 


 Common Issues When Turning Off SafeSearch 



<p>While turning off SafeSearch brings many benefits, there might be a few issues that you could encounter along the way. Let’s explore some common problems users face when trying to disable this feature and how to fix them quickly.</p>



 
 Unable to Turn Off SafeSearch: Sometimes, you may find that you can’t turn off SafeSearch. This could be due to settings imposed by your internet service provider or security software. If you encounter this issue, try contacting your service provider or checking any active security software on your device.<br> 



 Network or School Settings: Certain public networks or schools may have SafeSearch locked for protection. In this case, you won’t be able to change the settings unless you have access to the network’s admin settings.<br> 



 Security Software: Some security or internet monitoring software can block the ability to turn off SafeSearch. You may need to check your settings or temporarily disable the security software to make changes. 
 


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Turning off SafeSearch can help you broaden your search capabilities and access deeper resources, especially when you need detailed information for professional research. However, it’s important to weigh the risks of potentially encountering inappropriate content. Consider carefully and adjust the settings according to your needs and the environment in which you’re using your device.</p>

<p>Slow internet speed can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you’re working, studying, or just enjoying some entertainment online. When your internet connection slows down, it disrupts everything from your job to your fun activities. But don’t worry, there’s no need to immediately call your service provider. The following 5 easy tips will help you boost internet speed at home without any technical expertise!</p>

 Why Is My Internet Speed So Slow? 



<p>Before diving into solutions, it’s important to understand why your internet may be running slow. Identifying the causes will help you find the most effective way to improve your connection. Here are some common reasons for slow internet speed:</p>



 Poor Router Placement&nbsp; 



<p>Many people overlook the placement of their router, but it’s one of the most important factors affecting signal strength. If your router is placed in a corner of the house, near windows, or behind thick walls, the signal will weaken. To get the best performance, make sure your router is centrally located in your home.</p>



 Too Many Devices Connected Simultaneously&nbsp; 



<p>When too many devices (phones, laptops, TVs, tablets, etc.) are connected to the same wifi network, the bandwidth gets shared among them, causing slower speeds. This is especially noticeable when there are activities that consume a lot of bandwidth, like streaming videos or gaming.</p>



 Undersea Cable Issues&nbsp; 



<p>If you’re using fiber optic internet, slow speeds might be due to problems with undersea cables. These cables are responsible for international internet connections, and issues like weather disruptions or technical faults can cause slowdowns.<br></p>



 Wrong Wi-Fi Frequency Band&nbsp; 



<p>Sometimes, slow internet isn’t about the connection itself but rather the frequency band your router is using. The 2.4GHz band is often crowded due to interference from devices like microwaves or Bluetooth gadgets. Switching to the 5GHz band can help reduce interference and boost internet speed.</p>



 Hardware or Software Issues&nbsp; 



<p>Your computer or devices could also be the cause of slow internet. If you haven’t updated your software or drivers, or if there’s malware, your connection might be affected. A quick fix is to ensure your system is up to date and free of viruses.</p>

 5 Simple Tips to Boost Internet Speed 



<p>Now that you know why your internet might be slow, let’s explore some easy and effective ways to boost internet speed at home.</p>



 Clear Your Browser Cache and History 



<p>When you browse the internet, your browser stores data like cache, cookies, and browsing history. If you don’t clear them, it can slow down your browsing experience. Regularly deleting this data will free up space and improve the browser’s performance. This is a quick and simple fix for boosting your browsing speed.</p>



<p>How to do it: Simply go to your browser settings and choose the option to clear browsing data (cache, cookies, and history).</p>



 Change Your Bandwidth Limiting Settings 



<p>Windows computers may have bandwidth-limiting settings that can slow down your connection. You can adjust these settings to use all the available bandwidth. To do this, head to the Group Policy section on your computer and change the bandwidth options. You’ll notice a significant improvement in your internet speed.</p>



 Switch Wi-Fi Bands 



<p>If you’re using the 2.4GHz band, you may be experiencing interference from other devices. Switch to the 5GHz band for faster and more stable internet. The 5GHz band is less crowded and can handle higher speeds, especially when multiple devices are connected.</p>



 Place Your Router in an Optimal Location 



<p>Router placement plays a huge role in signal strength. Ideally, your router should be placed in the center of your home, away from walls, metal objects, and electronic devices. By doing so, you’ll ensure a stronger and more stable Wi-Fi connection, which means better internet speed.</p>



 Set Up Stronger Wi-Fi Security 



<p>If your Wi-Fi isn’t secure, other people might be using your network without your permission, which could slow down your internet speed. Set a strong password for your Wi-Fi and enable WPA2 or WPA3 security to limit access. This will keep your network secure and improve internet performance.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Boosting your internet speed at home is easier than you might think. With just a few simple adjustments, like clearing your cache, switching bands, or relocating your router, you can enjoy faster and more stable internet. So, why wait? Try these tips today and experience the difference! And don’t forget to share these tips with your friends and family, so they can enjoy better internet speeds too!</p>

				  How to navigate Europe’s new digital identity and wallet standards without your development team grinding to a halt? Here’s why Indicio is your copilot and how we take a 360-degree approach to successful deployments.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>The European Union’s new digital identity specifications —&nbsp;eIDAS 2.0 and EUDI —&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/what-the-european-digital-wallet-means-for-business/">are transformative</a>. They will change the way we digitally interact with each other, with government services, and with business. By creating a digital architecture for seamless trust, they will seed a <a href="https://indicio.tech/destination-europe-unlock-markets-create-seamless-services-with-indicio-provens-eudi-wallet-integration/">new era of innovation</a>.</p>
<p>Which is all very exciting. But implementation of decentralized identity is not always as simple as it sounds. Speaking from experience, before great things can be built, gnarly technical challenges and unfamiliar specifications must be overcome. And for anyone who has been watching the eIDAS 2.0 and EUDI development wave, the surf is… rough.</p>
<p>I’ve no doubt you have an ace technical team. But let me illustrate the development challenge you face and then talk about this challenge as a business proposition.</p>

			<p>Originally published in the <a href="https://www.gdf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.2.2025_GDF-Annual-Report-2024.pdf">GDF Annual Report 2024</a>, published in February 2025</p>

			<p>Liquidity drives markets. Yet, in tokenized real-world asset (RWA) and securities markets, liquidity remains trapped in silos, unable to reach its full potential. Distributors operate as isolated ecosystems, and investors are limited to closed networks. As financial services progress on-chain, the question underpinning how to better facilitate this adoption is clear: how do we unlock true liquidity and scale the market?</p>

			 The pain of siloed liquidity 
<p>Today, tokenized markets operate in isolation. Distributors list assets on their platforms, but each platform functions as a closed ecosystem, limiting liquidity to its internal investor base. An investor placing an offer on one distributor’s platform relies entirely on that platform’s order book to find a counterparty.</p>
<p>This fragmentation stifles market activity. Offers go unmatched, trades are delayed, and assets remain underutilized. Tokenization and its underlying technology promises to solve these inefficiencies, rather than exacerbate them. The issue is not with the concept of tokenization, but in evolving our understanding of how liquidity functions on-chain – a paradigm fundamentally different from anything we have seen before.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 
 Shared liquidity is the future 
<p>On-chain liquidity is supposed to be shared. It breaks down silos, creating a global marketplace where offers flow seamlessly across platforms. Distributors still maintain their unique platforms and investor relationships but can now tap into a dynamic and giant order book shared by the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>The benefits of shared liquidity are profound:</p>
 
 For investors: Access to a global pool of liquidity without leaving their trusted distributor’s platform. They see more opportunities,experience faster transactions, and benefit from a more vibrant market. 
 For distributors: An expanded role as enablers of global liquidity. They can curate assets fort heir investor networks while participating in a larger and more active ecosystem. 
 For issuers: Increased market activity and visibility for their assets, unlocking value and accelerating adoption. 
 
 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 
 
 
 ERC-3643: The open-source standard enabling market liquidity 
<p>The ERC-3643 standard enables shared liquidity by allowing issuers to issue, manage, and distribute permissioned tokens. It enables compliance, composability, and interoperability.</p>
 
 Built-in compliance: Compliance is embedded directly at the token level. ERC-3643 tokens include transfer restrictions and identity-based validation, ensuring that only eligible investors can participate. Unauthorized users and transactions will be denied automatically. 
 Interoperability: ERC-3643 is built on top of ERC-20, making it interoperable directly with the entire EVM ecosystem. It brings a standardized compliance layer to ensure seamless and compliant interaction across platforms. 
 Composability: ERC-3643 is modular and adaptable. It can add additional functionalities by combining them with other smart contracts, such as the DINO liquidity protocol, which allows investors (directly or via distribution platforms) to publish Delivery vs. Delivery (DvD) offers on- chain. 
 
 
 
 
 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 
 
 
 
 Shared DvD offers: Redefining liquidity as we know it 
<p>The DINO liquidity protocol transforms the blockchain network into a distributed marketplace, where distributors connect and seamlessly transact together, without sharing their clients.</p>
<p>The most fascinating aspect of the shared order book is the self-executing DvD smart contracts that power ERC-3643 token offers, enabling complete on-chain automation. By redefining liquidity and breaking down silos, they transform blockchain into a seamlessly interconnected global marketplace.</p>
 
 
 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Once investors publish a DvD offer, it instantly becomes visible across all distribution platforms. When a buyer accepts the offer, whether on the same platform or a different one, the DvD smart contract verifies everything:</p>
 
 Eligibility: The buyer’s onchain identity is validated to ensure compliance. 
 Compliance rules: Transfer restrictions and conditions are automatically enforced. 
 Balance check: The buyer’s wallet is checked to confirm sufficient funds. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Once all conditions are met, the transaction is settled instantly, without counterparty risk or intermediaries.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “This is not only a faster way to trade, but also a completely new experience. Investors can participate in secondary trading with the simplicity and speed of an e-commerce transaction. Click. Trade. Done.”

 Shared Standards, Shared Success 
<p>The tokenized markets are advancing rapidly, driven by the adoption of shared standards that foster trust, compliance, and operational efficiency. ERC-3643, supported and recognized by major financial and regulatory institutions like <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-fuels-abn-amro-bank-in-tokenizing-green-bonds-on-polygon/">ABN AMRO</a>, <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2025/february/04/dtcc-announces-composerx">DTCC</a>, <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/fasanara-adopts-erc-3643-to-launch-tokenized-money-market-fund">Fasanara,</a> <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA12-2121844265-3182_Report_on_the_DLT_Pilot_Regime_-_Study_on_the_extraction_of_transaction_data.pdf?utm_content=277544254&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;hss_channel=lcp-94127367">ESMA</a>, <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpmorgan/documents/technology/jpmorganchase-emerging-technology-trends-a-jpmorganchase-perspective.pdf">Citi</a>, <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpmorgan/documents/technology/jpmorganchase-emerging-technology-trends-a-jpmorganchase-perspective.pdf">JPMorgan Chase</a>, Global Digital Finance, and <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/lu/en/about/press-room/deloitte-announces-award-winners-at-their-2024-digital-assets-conference.html">Deloitte</a>, has emerged as a cornerstone of this progress and exemplifies industry collaboration in creating a unified framework for issuers, distributors, and investors.

<p>James is a compliance officer at a growing asset management firm. After landing a new institutional client, his team is preparing for increased regulatory scrutiny. James knows that building a robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program is essential—not just to meet regulations, but to safeguard the firm’s reputation.</p>



<p>With AML regulations tightening and financial crimes evolving, James needs a streamlined approach to compliance. Here’s how his team gets it right.</p>



 



 Laying the Groundwork with Customer Due Diligence (CDD) 



<p>James’s first priority is verifying the identity of clients and assessing their risk profiles. Instead of relying on manual checks, his team adopts a digital onboarding system:</p>



 
 Clients upload ID documents securely, which are scanned and validated using optical character recognition (OCR). 



 A live selfie ensures biometric verification to prevent identity fraud. 



 The system cross-checks client data with global sanctions lists in real time. 
 



<p>By automating routine checks, James’s team handles larger client volumes without delays and identifies potential risks early.</p>



 



 Spotting and Reporting Suspicious Activity 



<p>One morning, James reviews an alert: a client’s transaction pattern has shifted unexpectedly. The system’s machine learning models detect anomalies that suggest potential layering of funds.</p>



<p>With just a few clicks, James’s team:</p>



 
 Documents the findings in an automated Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). 



 Submits the SAR directly to regulators within the required timeframe. 
 



<p>Automated reporting cuts hours of manual work and ensures regulatory deadlines are never missed.</p>



 



 Keeping Records Secure and Accessible 



<p>AML regulations require James to keep records of client verification and SARs for years. His firm’s secure cloud-based system ensures:</p>



 
 Records are encrypted and accessible only to authorized users. 



 Retention policies are enforced automatically to comply with regulations. 



 An audit trail is generated for transparency and easy reporting during reviews. 
 



<p>This system reduces the risk of human error and makes audits seamless.</p>



<p></p>



 A Quick-Start Guide for Every Business 



<p>AML compliance can be simplified with the right tools and strategies. Here’s a recap of key steps:</p>



 
 Implement Digital Onboarding: Verify customer identities quickly and securely. 



 Automate SAR Submissions: Ensure timely reporting with minimal manual input. 



 Centralize Record Keeping: Maintain secure, accessible records for audits. 



 Adopt a Risk-Based Approach: Focus efforts where they matter most. 



 Train Your Team: Equip employees with the knowledge to spot and act on red flags. 
 



<p>By building a strong AML program, firms like James’s don’t just meet regulatory standards—they build trust, protect their business, and contribute to the fight against financial crime.</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The e-learning market is estimated to be worth a staggering <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/e-learning-market-A06253#:~:text=E%2DLearning%20Market%20Research%2C%202032,the%20same%20or%20different%20times.">$933.5 billion by 2032</a>. Driven by the growth in online work and school, this exploding sector offers a convenient way to become certified in a skill or obtain a degree. But these degrees or certifications are prone to being lost or defrauded and require checking in with the school to verify. What we need is a better way for students to store their credentials, and a faster, easier way for businesses and schools to verify these achievements.</p>
<p>Digital Knowledge is an expert in e-learning, with a track record of 27 years in the business and over 2000 schools and companies served. Their latest product, Skill+ enablesstudents to hold their credentials locally on their mobile devices using Open Badges 3.0. These new credentials are then shareable with the tap of a button, and can be verified by the university or business requesting them without the need to check in with the issuing institution, saving days or weeks of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/306155332">Join the next Indicio Meetup</a> to see the technology in action. Takahiro Hata, Senior Fellow, Yuki Ooba, KnowledgeDeliverSkill+ Project Manager, and Jason Gettys, KnowledgeDeliverSkill+ Badge API Engineer, will be joining us to discuss the solution and why they chose to build it this way in depth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see:</p>
<p>A comprehensive overview of Skill+: Discover how Skill+ supports both Open Badge 2.0 and the more secure Open Badge 3.0 standards, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of digital badges.</p>
<p>A step-by-step demo: Learn how to seamlessly import badges from popular platforms such as Credly, Badgr, and LecoS into your Skill+ wallet.</p>
<p>An interactive Q&amp;A: Engage with our experts to address your specific questions and gain insights into maximizing the potential of Skill+ for your professional development.</p>
<p>Why Open Badges?</p>
<p>Open Badges 3.0 uses Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity principles to ensure that digital badges can be independently verified and trusted without relying on a central authority. This advancement makes it easier to share skills and achievements across various platforms while maintaining authenticity and control over personal credentials.</p>
<p>Open Badges are quickly gaining adoption across the education industry with <a href="https://www.digital-knowledge.co.jp/archives/40587/">88.2% of respondents</a> in a recent report saying that digital badges are necessary for the future of education and business. The time saved by not needing to jump through hoops to double check the presented information is invaluable. For a more in-depth look at the technology and its use in education you can read a <a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">recent article from Indicio.</a></p>

							  Give Me Utility, Don’t Give Me $LIBRA   <p>Well, not to blow our own vuvuzela, but our pivot to utility came at the perfect time.</p>  <p>The mood of the week has been blowback to key opinion leaders (KOLs) who have spent much of the bull cycle trumpeting the speculative meme projects they were investing into their large follower bases to sell for a profit. All textbook insider trading schemas, openly admitted to by the LA Vape Cabal and other current “darlings” of the Solana shitcoin casino.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Chief among these KOLs: Argentinian President Javier Milei. The world leader is facing a federal probe for his role in promoting and allegedly launching $LIBRA. No, not&nbsp;that&nbsp;$LIBRA&nbsp;— Facebook’s defunt token from last cycle, IYKYK. (What’s Zuckerberg batting these days? .201?) Also an abject failure,&nbsp;this&nbsp;$LIBRA was developed with the help of the now-infamous Hayden Davis, who rugged most of Twitter with coin. Its market cap went from $2.6B to $0.8B in less than an hour of the token’s launch, and now sits at a dismal $300M.</p>  <p>All of this degenerate news that we said was finally being purged from our weekly writing is the very evidence the wider space may be pivoting toward utility too.&nbsp;</p>  <p>So what does real utility look like? We’ve spent plenty of time discussing Helium, the clearest protocol-as-a-service value proposition around. (Even Big Telecom is bought in.) And we’ve also touched on how memecoins have been leveraged by brands like&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/heartsol/30-mother-may-i/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=that-is-so-not-kol">Iggy Azalea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/heartsol/24-past-performance-doesnt-guarantee-future-results/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=that-is-so-not-kol">Pudgy Penguins</a>&nbsp;to monetize fan communities in new ways.</p>  <p>But to understand the full potential of crypto utility, let’s first take a step back and talk about the state of the technology, its parts, and the implications. Web3 technology largely consists of decentralized communications protocols with varying degrees of auditable logs for transactions related to using the protocol.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Bitcoin, the most famous of these protocol, is a digital money transfer service. It leverages complex math, distributed processing and storage, and defined hard limits on scarcity, in order to ensure the integrity of the system without having a bank running the books in the middle.</p>  <p>That idea inspired Ethereum to build the World Computer, a blockchain protocol focused on bringing the transparent audibility of the financial ledger to other systems reliant on account-keeping — think video games, social and streaming platforms, or business software. Much of Ethereum’s ecosystem has focused on the financialization of different assets on the Layer-2 (read: middle-men) blockchains, in order to meet the cost-related challenges of scaling the network.</p>  <p>Then, there is Solana, which has iterated on the original concept of a world computer to build what it calls a real-time state machine: a database that can read and write transactions at the speed at which users are generating them. This blockchain protocol is 100-1000x faster than Ethereum, with a demonstrated track record of getting faster and more distributed over time.</p>  <p>With artificial general intelligence (AGI) potentially on the horizon, unique and verified datasets are the moats necessary to build the AI companies of the future. Solana not only scales to onboard consumers, but to license their data to the future of AI agents.</p>  <p>There are a lot of smoke and mirrors in the web3 spaces. Rather than doomscrolling X for the next cool (KOL?) thing, we’d recommend the unsexy and TradFi-coded process of due diligence. Do your research into each new project and prioritize those with an understanding of data and its importance to shaping intelligence systems in their domain. This will continue to be the differentiating force between projects that succeed here long-term, and those that go the way of the $LIBRA(s).</p>  <p>To that end, the dePIN projects building on Solana understand that securing the data on a Layer-1 —&nbsp;and doing so cheaply — is an incredibly important piece to scaling their unit economics in the future. And that’s why this publication continues to shout that transactions per second (TPS) is king when it comes to evaluating the protocols themselves.</p>  <p>—El Prof</p>

							         How Meow Is Redefining Business Banking   <p>In the early days of fintech, startups like Brex and Mercury gained traction by offering streamlined banking solutions to startups and small businesses. But much like early web2 banking platforms, these services often replicated traditional models with little innovation beyond the user interface.</p>  <p>Now, a new wave of fintech disruptors is emerging&nbsp;— not with a bang, but a meow.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.meow.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopFOU4CtDtpiSIA0pFEpNZcjj3YV9ykYhZlQ3PQGQMiQc_6M--V&amp;utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=that-is-so-not-kol">Meow</a>&nbsp;started as a crypto yield platform, but it is quickly scaling toward a powerhouse in business banking. Unlike legacy fintech that relies on traditional infrastructure, Meow is designed for agility, giving businesses instant access to high-yield Treasury bills (T-bills), FDIC-insured checking accounts, and even venture debt solutions.</p>  <p>At its core, Meow enables businesses to put their idle cash to work without the complexity of hiring a corporate treasurer. The platform’s key offerings include:</p>    <p>T-bill investments: Businesses can park cash in government-backed securities, earning safe, high yields previously accessible only to large corporations.</p>  <p>High-interest checking accounts: Through partnerships with traditional banks, Meow offers businesses up to $125M in FDIC insurance.</p>  <p>Venture debt &amp; founder mortgages: Startups can access funding through Meow’s marketplace, where banks and private credit firms bid on financing opportunities.</p>    <p>Meow’s efficiency-driven model took on fresh luster when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed in March 2023. Amid the banking crisis, startups and small businesses rushed to find alternative cash management solutions. Within a month, Meow secured $500M in deposits, proving that businesses were actively seeking a more agile, tech-driven banking solution.</p>  <p>Meow wasn’t always an heir apparent to that title though. It launched in 2021 as a crypto lender. ICYMI, those weren’t exactly the “winners” of that particular bull cycle. But the following year, as major players like TerraUSD and Three Arrows Capital collapsed, Meow’s founders made a bold decision —&nbsp;returning customer funds and pivoting away from the volatile crypto lending space.</p>  <p>But while it has stripped away some of the volatility, the web3 ethos remains part and parcel with Meow’s operations. Its automation-heavy and efficiency-first approach mirrors the decentralization movement in crypto, where smart contracts replace middlemen and minimize operational overhead. While fintech giants continue to burn cash on high marketing budgets and bloated headcounts, Meow is busy proving out a viable alternative.</p>  <p>Much like how DeFi challenged traditional finance, Meow is challenging outdated banking models by offering businesses:</p>    <p>Full autonomy over their financial strategy without complex corporate treasury teams.</p>  <p>Access to institutional-grade financial tools without legacy banking bureaucracy.</p>  <p>A lean, transparent, and technology-driven approach to managing corporate capital.</p>    <p>The future of business banking isn’t just about offering higher yields. It’s about redefining efficiency, transparency, and control. With Meow’s relentless focus on innovation, this future is already here. I am there already. Be there too.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

<p>Imagine being able to prove you’re old enough to buy a drink without flashing your ID—or proving you have insurance without handing over your policy details. Sounds like magic? It’s just math. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) might be the biggest leap for privacy since encryption, but they also come with serious challenges. Let’s talk about the good, the bad, and the future of this technology.</p>



<p>If you’re <a href="https://corporate-blog.global.fujitsu.com/fgb/2024-11-12/01/">not familiar</a>, ZKPs are a cryptographic technique that allows one party to prove something to another party without revealing any other information beyond the proof itself. It’s no wonder these have been heralded as the holy grail for privacy-preserving selective disclosure.</p>



<p> Audio Blog</p>







<p>ZKPs have the attention of several standards development communities and have for a while. (<a href="https://self-issued.info/">Mike Jones</a> did a great presentation at EIC in 2023 that touched on ZKPs; check out the <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/EIC_2023_Selective_Disclosure.pdf">slides</a> starting around slide 26). I get it. ZKPs are mathematical magic, especially for applications like age verification, secure access control, and decentralized identity systems. But like any technology, they come with their own set of challenges. For one, they have a high computational cost, requiring powerful devices to execute the complex math behind them efficiently. The equipment required to support that computational effort is expensive, raising questions of scalability. There are also several ZKP algorithms out there; I don’t know what happens when competing platforms don’t support each other’s algorithms. These questions take my brain to one uncomfortable question: Are ZKPs going to widen the digital divide?</p>



 Understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs 



<p>At their core, ZKPs allow someone (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without sharing any additional details. For example, imagine proving you know the solution to a puzzle without revealing the solution itself. This is achieved through advanced cryptographic algorithms that ensure the verifier gains confidence in the proof while learning nothing else. (I’m just saying that “mathematician” and “magician” sure sound similar. But I digress.)</p>



<p>ZKPs do promise some very sexy things:</p>



 
 Privacy: They enable granular data sharing, revealing only the necessary information. 



 Security: They lower the risk of data breaches by limiting the exposure of sensitive data. 



 Versatility: They can be applied across various fields, from financial transactions to identity verification, because every sector has use cases for this. 
 



<p>But, sexy math doesn’t mean solving for everything:</p>



 
 Computational Intensity: The algorithms are resource-heavy, demanding significant processing power up to and including specialized hardware. 



 Device Dependency: Effective use often requires high-end (read: expensive) devices, limiting accessibility. 



 Complexity: Developing and implementing ZKPs is technically challenging and requires significant expertise. 
 



 ZKPs in Standards Development 



<p>In the world of digital identity, ZKPs have come up quite a bit in the verifiable credentials space. Standards development groups like those in the IETF working on selective disclosure (e.g., <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">SD-JWT</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-spice-sd-cwt/">SD-CWT</a>) are exploring how ZKPs can be integrated into identity systems to improve privacy and security. Research groups like the IRTF’s <a href="https://www.irtf.org/cfrg.html">Crypto Forum Research Group</a> (CFRG; more on them later) are also looking at work in this space and how it might apply to standards under development. Age verification tends to be the most popular example, though there are others that apply in <a href="https://www.techlab.cdc.gov/index.php/2023/04/01/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp/">healthcare</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42452-019-0989-z.pdf">public sector</a>, <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2023/05/12/an-introduction-to-zero-knowledge-proofs-in-blockchains-and-economics">banking</a>, etc.</p>



 



<p>Zero Knowledge Proofs are just one piece of the standards puzzle. If your team is figuring out how to engage in standards development—or just needs to stay ahead of what’s coming—I can help.  <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">See how I work</a> or <a href="https://doodle.com/bp/heatherflanagan/30-min">Book a quick chat</a>.</p>



 



<p>While ZKPs offer innovative solutions to challenging problems, they won’t work for everyone. For example, in settings where access to high-end devices or strong network connections is limited, alternative methods of selective disclosure may be more practical. Verifiable credentials based on attribute-based encryption or other techniques might complement ZKPs to create more inclusive systems.</p>



<p>Despite the promise of solving very thorny privacy problems, there’s a tension here between innovation and inclusivity. As we’ve seen with other technologies, the benefits often go first to those who can afford cutting-edge devices, leaving others behind. Standards development communities, particularly those involved in the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/20/digital-credentials-that-can-be-verified-a-lesson-in-terminology/">digital credentials</a> space, are positioned to address this gap, but it requires intentional design choices and collaboration across stakeholders.</p>



 Balancing Innovation with Equity 



<p>Here’s what’s making me anxious: The promise of ZKPs shouldn’t come at the cost of equity. If the future of privacy relies on technology that only the most privileged can access, then we’ve failed a significant portion of the global population. So let’s think about how to advance in a few more areas. (There is work going on in each, but let’s not get complacent):</p>



 
 <a href="https://blog.icme.io/minimal-space-maximum-pace-how-memory-efficient-zero-knowledge-proofs-work/">Optimizing Algorithms</a>: Continued research should focus on reducing the computational burden of ZKPs, making them more efficient and accessible. 



 <a href="https://open.bu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/bb92dba0-75e0-4855-9960-4db0f8b72ee1/content">Device Compatibility</a>: Developing lightweight ZKP implementations that work on older or less powerful devices is crucial. 



 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689949">Privacy Alternatives</a>: While ZKPs are a powerful tool, they’re not the only path to privacy. There are other technical mechanisms to explore. 



 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/">Collaborative Standards</a>: Standards bodies must prioritize equity, ensuring that technical specifications account for diverse use cases and resource constraints. 
 



 Non-Human Identities and ZKPs 



<p>ZKPs aren’t just about humans; they have a significant role to play in NHI as well. Devices, software agents, and even digital twins increasingly operate in environments where trust and privacy are critical. Here’s where ZKPs come into play:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/5/1145">Device Authentication and IoT</a>: ZKPs can allow IoT devices to securely prove their identity without exposing sensitive information. For example, a smart thermostat could authenticate itself to a central hub without revealing its serial number or full configuration. 



 <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-03712482/file/These_UTC_Amira_Barki.pdf">Machine-to-Machine Communication</a>: ZKPs enable machines to verify each other’s credentials securely, such as an autonomous vehicle proving it has insurance coverage. 



 <a href="https://norma.ncirl.ie/5033/1/gauravrameshsavanur.pdf">Supply Chain and Provenance</a>: Digital twins of products can use ZKPs to prove authenticity or origin without disclosing the entire supply chain. 
 



<p>However, just as with human identities, there are challenges. Many non-human entities, like IoT devices, are resource-constrained and may struggle to handle the computational demands of ZKPs. These limitations further highlight the importance of making ZKPs more accessible, not just for individuals but for organizations and devices with limited resources.</p>



 What’s Next for ZKPs? 



<p>The future of ZKPs is as exciting as it is complex. One organization leading the way in advancing ZKP research and development is the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/cfrg/about/">CFRG</a>. Part of the <a href="https://irtf.org">IRTF</a>, CFRG brings together cryptographers, researchers, and industry professionals to explore cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, including ZKPs. Their work helps ensure that standards and implementations are both secure and practical for real-world use.</p>



<p>In addition to CFRG’s efforts, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pec/zkproof">ongoing research</a> (NIST is just one example) focuses on optimizing algorithms to reduce computational overhead and developing hardware accelerators to make ZKP technology more efficient and accessible. Collaboration across academia, industry, and standards bodies is necessary to overcome current limitations and ensure ZKPs can be deployed equitably.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the journey to mainstream adoption of ZKPs will require thoughtful design, practical implementation, and a commitment to inclusivity. By leveraging the work of groups like CFRG and fostering collaboration, we can ensure that ZKPs advance privacy and benefit everyone.</p>

FeatureZKPsCurrent Models of Selective DisclosurePrivacy LevelExtremely high (reveals nothing but the proof)Partial (shares limited info)Computational CostHigh (math is hard!)Lower (simpler cryptography)Device RequirementsExpensive hardware needed?Works on most devicesAdoption BarrierComplexity, costMore familiar, easier to deploy



 Wrap Up 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are an exciting innovation that could actually make privacy a technically viable and enforceable thing online. Their ability to enable secure, selective disclosure is amazing, and their potential applications are as diverse as the people on the Internet. But as we push the boundaries of what’s possible with the latest technologies, we must also ensure that privacy is not a privilege reserved for those with the latest devices.</p>



<p>By balancing innovation with accessibility, I think we can build a future where everyone benefits from the advancements in privacy-preserving technology. ZKPs are undoubtedly a step in the right direction, but they’re just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Let’s make sure we’re solving it with everyone in mind.</p>

  Arizona Department of Public Safety partners with Thales for enhanced security of license and identity credentials
prezly

Tue, 02/18/2025 - 14:00


             
 This new contract covers over 300,000 cards annually, including Concealed Weapons Permits (CWP), Certificate of Firearms Proficiency (LEOSA), Fingerprint Clearance Cards (FCC), and various licensed Security Guard and Private Investigator ID cards (SG/PI).  
 Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) joins a growing number of jurisdictions in North America who have switched to Thales’ 100% polycarbonate cards – resulting in more sustainable and secure cards. 
 The new cards are already accessible for licensed citizens, law enforcement partners, and other parties using these license and identity credentials. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>The Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) has awarded Thales a contract, with potential to extend through 2029, for off-site printing of their special license and identity cards including Concealed Weapons Permits, Certificates of Firearms Proficiency, Fingerprint Clearance Cards, and various licensed Security Guard and Private Investigator cards.</p>
<p>As part of this award, these ID cards are being upgraded with stronger security features and a redesigned appearance to ensure a high degree of security and trust in each credential. The new security elements include transitioning to 100% polycarbonate cards, for stronger security and the ability to leverage a large number of embedded, visible security features making it easier for first-line inspectors and law enforcement to quickly and clearly identify whether the credential is genuine or has been altered. </p>
<p>New security features being added to these cards include a detailed laser engraved portrait photo for a clear photo easy to identify in rapid or low light situations, smooth color transitions within a secure background pattern, and a reflective embossed pattern across the card surface for kinetic movement effects. All security features are safely located within, and protected by, the polycarbonate card body and cannot be tampered with without damaging the card, thereby making the tampering attempt extremely evident.</p>
<p>Arizona DPS joins over a dozen other Thales partner agencies in North America that have switched to cards made from 100% polycarbonate, for best-in-class identity credential documents. In addition to the highest-level of security available, polycarbonate also provides a highly durable card with higher resistance to fraud over the life of the credential.</p>
<p>Thales is the fastest growing provider of license and identity solutions in the U.S., with a true partner-based approach with our agency and jurisdiction customers. Thales offers the strongest security features in the marketplace for identity credentials, as well as regularly introduces new card security features, to ensure our commitment to the fight against fraud. </p>
<blockquote><p>“These next generation identity cards provide Arizona citizens, businesses and state officials with stronger security for these credentials, allowing for quicker validation,” said Tyson Moler, Vice President for Thales Identity and Biometric Solutions in North America. “Thales is pleased to partner with the Arizona DPS, leveraging our key strengths and expertise in reliable and secure documents solutions.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Thales is a trusted provider of driver’s license and ID solutions in the U.S. Thales provides driver’s license and ID card solutions to the following 17 agencies and jurisdictions across North America: Alaska, Arizona MVD and DPS, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, New Brunswick, New Hampshire, New York, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Texas, Washington D.C., Wyoming.</p>

<p>Across North America, effective Research Data Management (RDM) is essential for securing and maintaining grant funding. Funding agencies both in Canada and the United States place a huge emphasis on data security, integrity, and accessibility as critical components of responsible research and a key requirement for funding. Here are five reasons we believe why.</p>

 
    Compliance with Funding Agency Requirements  
 
<p>In Canada, the Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy (CIHR, NSERC, SSHRC) mandates that institutions implement RDM strategies to maintain funding eligibility. Likewise, in the United States agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) require researchers to submit Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Plans ensuring secure and responsible data handling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers have learned the hard way that failure to comply with these requirements can result in funding delays, reduced future funding opportunities, and in many cases, loss of grants.</p>
<p><br></p>
 
    Protecting Sensitive and Confidential Data  
 
<p>Research involving health data, personal information, or proprietary industry information must adhere to stringent data security laws.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In Canada, adherence to PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) and provincial laws (e.g., Ontario’s PHIPA) is required. PIPEDA for example sets the ground rules for how private organizations collect, use, protect, and disclose personal information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the US on the other hand, any federally funded research must be compliant with both HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act), as well as the newly enacted NIST 800-171 requirements that went into effect on January 25, 2025. These new requirements cover any federally-funded research managing Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So as you can see, by following structured data security guidelines, proper data security prevents breaches, ethical violations, and reputational damage that can impact future funding opportunities.</p>

 
    Ensuring Long-Term Data Accessibility  
 
<p>Funding agencies across North America expect research data to be well-documented, preserved, and accessible for future verification and use.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At myLaminin, we believe researchers have options when it comes to research repositories. There are many federally-sponsored, institutional, domain-specific, and private-sector tools and repository options. The selection of the right repository however is dependent on the nature of the research, the number of locations involved in data collection, the tools required for analysis, the overriding research methodology, team member locations, and their respective roles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the end, properly managed data increases research impact, research repeatability, and improves the chances of future grant renewals.</p>
<p><br></p>
 
    Enhancing Credibility and Trust  
 
<p>A robust RDM framework facilitates data collection and minimizes errors, fraud risks, and data loss, which could otherwise jeopardize research validity. In our view, funders prefer researchers and institutions that demonstrate rigorous data stewardship and adherence to ethical data handling.</p>

 
    Supporting Open Science and Collaboration  
 
<p>It should be noted that many grants require both data sharing and transparency while balancing intellectual property protection. For example, U.S. initiatives like NIH's Data Sharing Policy encourages researchers to openly share federally funded data, while in Canada, the Tri-Agency Policy promotes open science, ensuring data is preserved and shared appropriately.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Indigenous data sovereignty also requires support of the OCAP principles, (Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession) and while OCAP does not contradict open science rather, it enhances inclusivity, ethics, and collaboration. A respectful approach allows Indigenous knowledge to contribute to global research without compromising community rights and autonomy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With that said, secure research data management enables controlled access and fosters collaboration without compromising sensitive information.</p>
<p><br></p>
 In Conclusion 
<p>We believe a well-designed research data management platform helps researchers to create a robust strategy for handling research data while increasing their chances of securing grant funding. The ideal RDM repository should be secure, adaptable to various research domains, and more importantly, flexible enough to support different data types, storage locations, distributed teams, and role-based access thereby making regulatory compliance seamless and efficient.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>By ensuring you comply with funding agency policies, promoting the safeguarding of sensitive information, and promoting open science, you can boost your credibility, streamline the funding process, and contribute to high-impact, reproducible research.</p>

 We unpack the findings from IDnow’s recent UK and France Fraud Awareness Reports to explore the differences in perceptions of fraud, preferences of identity verification solutions and much more. 



<p>Separated by just 34km of the English Channel, there are many things that France and the United Kingdom have in common: size of populations, diversity of cultures, and, unfortunately, alarming rates of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In France, victims of financial fraud and scams lose at least <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/french-financial-fraud-victims-lose-at-least-500-million-every-year/">€500 million annually</a>, while in the UK, the problem appears to be even more pronounced. In fact, in just the first half of 2024, over <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/policy-and-guidance/reports-and-publications/half-year-fraud-report-2024#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of,to%20be%20accessed%20or%20controlled.">£570 million was stolen in payment fraud</a> alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, we published the IDnow UK Fraud Awareness Report, which surveyed members of the British public to explore the nation’s awareness of the latest fraud terms, the industries considered most susceptible to fraud, and how commonly Brits used risky channels like unencrypted messaging platforms to transfer copies or scans of ID documents. Last month, we published an edition focused on France, ‘Fraude bancaire : enquête sur la confiance des Français envers leur banque’ [<a href="https://www.idnow.io/fr/portfolio/fraude-bancaire-enquete-confiance-francais/">Bank fraud: survey of French people’s confidence in their bank</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Referring to the recent French Report, Cyril Patou, Vice President of Sales (France) at IDnow said: “The results highlight the importance of increased awareness and having open dialogue between financial institutions and users to move forward together in the fight against fraud.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this blog, we explore the differences in results between the two nations and consider why a tailored, culture-specific approach to fraud prevention – and identity verification –&nbsp;is required.</p>



 
   
     
                     UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024 
                      Learn more about the British public’s awareness of fraud and their attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology.  
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
	     
 


 Loyalty, trust and public awareness of fraud. 



<p>While 54% of UK respondents said they would consider switching banks if they were a victim of bank fraud, only 27% of French respondents agreed, indicating that either the French were more loyal to their banks or accepting of falling victim to fraud. Surprisingly, 11% of French respondents said they had been victims of bank fraud yet had still not changed banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to fraud terms, the Brits tend to be more informed than their French counterparts. For example, over half of UK respondents said they had heard of ‘deepfakes’ (videos of digitally created people that are typically used to obfuscate the user’s identity), while 42% of French said they had not heard the term combined with a further 25% who said they had heard of deepfakes, but didn‘t know what it means.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both countries are currently experiencing a rise in sophisticated digital fraud techniques, including deepfakes. In a recent post on social media, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e1kne7q1qo">French President Emmanuel Macron shared a montage of deepfake videos</a> featuring himself in popular movies, commenting “nicely done.”&nbsp;In the UK, recent <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/deepfakes-demean-defraud-disinform/">Ofcom data shows that 43% of individuals</a> aged 16 and older have seen at least one deepfake online in the last six months. Deepfakes have clearly arrived and being used for both fun and fraudulent purposes. In fact, the UK government recently declared deepfakes as the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/uk-government-declares-deepfakes-greatest-challenge-of-the-online-age">“greatest challenge of the online era</a>.”</p>



<p>Attitudes on whether banks are adequately protecting their customers against fraud like deepfakes are largely the same in France (72%) and the UK (73%), leaving more than a quarter of respondents in both countries that either disagree or just don’t know – suggesting better education on not only the latest fraud terms but banks’ methods of fraud prevention is needed.</p>



 Which industries cause the French and British public the most concern? 



<p>Both France and the UK agree that the riskiest industry when it comes to fraud is <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">financial services </a>(65% and 75% respectively) followed by online shopping. Clearly, these are both industries where it serves for customers to be as cautious as possible, as bank and e-commerce accounts store important personal identifiable information that can be misused for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third on the ranking of riskiest industry is social media fraud, which is where a lot of fraud originates, especially <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>. Discover all about the rise of social media fraud, and how one man almost lost a million euros to a pig butchering scam in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">blog, ‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the major differences seen in the IDnow Reports is the perception of public services as a potential source of fraud. While in France, nearly a third of the French population (32%) are concerned, just 13% of the UK public appear worried about eGovernment fraud. Could it be that the French are just more critical of eGovernment services or perhaps it’s just that a higher percentage of the French population are using eGovernment services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It appears to be the former, as in 2023, just <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-survey-on-drivers-of-trust-in-public-institutions-2024-results-country-notes_a8004759-en/france_4edec498-en.html">34% of the French public</a> reported high or moderately high trust in the national government, below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s average of 39%.</p>

 Government and public preferences in identity verification solutions. 



<p>Most industries are either required by regulation to implement identity verification checks or have chosen to do so to optimize processes or fight fraud. Such checks are required for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">account opening in Banking</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">compliance checks in Crypto</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">age verification in Mobility</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">streamlined check-in processes in Travel</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">financial risk checks in Gambling,</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">contract signing in Telecommunication</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity verification requires users to provide and have information associated with their identity verified. This may be checking an identity document, such as a driver’s license, passport, or a nationally issued identity document or by biometric authentication of users’ attributes like fingerprints or facial features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each country tends to have different approaches to fraud prevention and identity verification processes, which is often determined by regulatory requirements. In Germany, for example, video verification is required when opening bank accounts due to strict AML/GwG requirements, however this may all be set to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gwvideoidentv-german-financial-sector/">change in the near future.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In France, the government has a national digital identification program and provides citizens with electronic ID cards that facilitates secure access to various services. This centralized system enhances the efficiency of identity verification processes across both public and private sectors. France also has FranceConnect, the national digital identity federator, where users verify themselves for eGovernment and other regulated services. Our report found that the concept of digital identities was familiar to 72% of French respondents. Plus, a large majority of French (70%) said they would be prepared to use a digital identity to access bank accounts or carry out important transactions.</p>

<p>In the UK, there is currently no one consistent and coherent ID system, with companies instead relying on database checks and document checks of different forms of ID, including driving licences and passports. However, the government is experimenting with various ways of modernizing its approach, including the 2023 release o<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">f a Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> (DIATF) – a set of rules and standards designed to establish trust in digital identity products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was also a flurry of activity at the beginning of 2025 with the announcement that the government planned to launch the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/wallet">GOV.UK Wallet</a>, which was very quickly followed up by panicked questions regarding its impact on the DIATF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once launched, the holders of the GOV.UK Wallet will be able to:&nbsp;</p>



  Securely save government-issued digital documents&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Present these documents to organizations, businesses and other parts of government to prove age, identity, or eligibility for services&nbsp;  



<p>When asked which identity verification method they considered the most trustworthy for a secure, reliable and accurate process, 20% of French respondents said document capture and facial recognition, while 42% of UK respondents cited a combination of electronic identity data checks and document capture and facial verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While 16% of French respondents would prefer an expert-led identification process like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a>, just 9% of UK respondents felt the same way. Seemingly, the French are more open-minded toward expert-led solutions than the Brits. However, products like IDnow’s customizable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent Flex</a> are now becoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/video-identity-verification-fraud-prevention/">increasingly popular in European countries outside Germany</a>, where they have typically enjoyed much success due to national BaFin (Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) online onboarding regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are clearly differences between the two nations when it comes to awareness of fraud, the industries considered riskiest and their preferred methods of identity verification. However, what is consistent in both the UK and France is the ever-present risk of fraud and the need for a collaborative push by regulatory and government bodies and financial services to commit to fraud prevention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thankfully, whether <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated</a> or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">expert-led</a>, online or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">in-person</a>, IDnow offers one of the widest ranges of identity verification and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">digital signature</a> solutions in Europe and beyond.

This year’s Summit followed previous meetings in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration/the-bletchley-declaration-by-countries-attending-the-ai-safety-summit-1-2-november-2023">Bletchley Park, UK (2023)</a>, and <a href="https://www.aisummitseoul.com/">Seoul, South Korea (2024).</a> Ostensibly, the convenings aimed to agree on guardrails for the future of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The Paris AI Summit characterized the times in which it was held — one of fragmenting geopolitics, divergent priorities, and the growing pursuit of sovereign interest over collective good.</p><p>Many observers concluded that not only was the Summit more of a trade fair for Paris’s AI ambitions — with French President Macron’s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-answer-donald-trump-fossil-fuel-drive-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-summit/">‘plug baby plug’</a> a, umm, plug for the country’s nuclear industry, but it was also a failure on its own terms. Although more than sixty countries, including China, India, and Germany, signed on to a declaration that committed to “ensuring AI is open, inclusive, transparent, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy, taking into account international frameworks for all,” both <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a6b5426d-645f-433b-8090-a2a26a3deec6">the US and UK refused to do so</a>, with US Vice President J. D. Vance saying the United States would work to retain its dominance in&nbsp;AI.</p><p>There were bright spots. The <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366619217/AI-Action-Summit-two-major-AI-initiatives-launched">commitment to Current AI</a>, a $400-million fund focused on building “open, people-first technologies,” offers hope, yet the initiative will have to demonstrate how it can have ecosystemic impact and bend the arc of AI development toward the&nbsp;good.</p><p>My main takeaway from the AI Summit is that, despite the increasingly centralized, mega investment focus of Big Tech AI that seems to be rushing headlong to doomsday land, the most interesting developments are in fact the opposite: away from the big companies, where efforts focus on shifting power toward&nbsp;people.</p><p>I saw this at the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/video/20250211-africa-ai-village-in-paris-we-are-a-population-of-1-5-billion-we-can-not-go-unrecognized">African AI Village</a>, an independent meeting convened by a coalition of leading African organizations, including Qhala and Smart Africa, and supported by the likes of Mozilla, CEIP, and others. Three themes struck&nbsp;me:</p>  Decentering and decolonizing power: Calls to stop asking for permission and instead to build African AI models, applications, and skills are growing increasingly confident. We can’t underestimate the importance of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-deepseek-why-is-it-disrupting-ai-sector-2025-01-27/">China’s DeepSeek AI models</a> here in demonstrating that the AI field can be disrupted.  Decentering principles of data governance and turning to Indigenous forms of knowledge: The <a href="https://www.kahuiraraunga.io/maoridatagovernance">Maori Data Governance Principles</a> are an example of this approach. The Maori Principles have also informed work Caribou has done with UNDP on governance frameworks for <a href="https://www.governance4id.org/">digital ID</a> and forthcoming on data exchange and digital&nbsp;ID.  Dependency on metal, especially data centers, to maintain sovereignty: Africa has only 155 data centers. In 2023 these generated<a href="https://inform.tmforum.org/features-and-opinion/data-center-investment-on-the-rise-in-africa"> less than 1 megawatt (MW), compared to 88 in the US and 73 in the EU</a>. Analysts suggest that Africa desperately needs as much as 1,000 MW and 700 facilities if African AI is going to be independent of the hyperscale cloud and computing providers.  <p>The other theme that stood out in this technology-focused Summit is people. In the headlong rush to greater investment, including in <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/11/military-community-gathers-in-paris-to-discuss-how-ai-is-impacting-conflict-around-the-wor">AI for defense</a>, the struggle to put people first continues. The <a href="https://www.saysmaybe.com/podcast">Computer Says Maybe</a> live-streamed review of the Summit captured this&nbsp;trend.</p>  Where are all the people? There was a general consensus that the Summit had not done enough to focus on people or risk. The few references to people, such as the launch of Current AI, the public interest AI fund, were welcome, but not&nbsp;enough.  The challenge of mobilizing public engagement — and protest — was also flagged as a barrier to influence and advocacy. One explanation for this was the challenge of “showing the bodies”; in contrast to other digital technologies where harms are readily apparent, the harms from AI are difficult to link directly to the technology.  Increasing emphasis on developing AI diagnostic tools and methods to strengthen AI accountability led to a discussion about the role of more constructive engagement: the diagnostician vs. the clinician. The former simply identifies problems, while the latter provides constructive solutions. Importantly, there was widespread agreement among panel members about the importance of criticism, with one panel member noting that “criticism is service.”  <p>But the big elephant in the room was geopolitics. Not just the geopolitics of AI — with US Vice President Vance <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/vp-jd-vance-calls-europe-row-back-tech-regulation-ai-action-summit/">“warning Europe to go easy on regulating US tech firms”</a> — but the broader geopolitical context in which AI sits. The very rapid changes taking place in the United States, the decline in multilateral approaches to addressing global challenges, including but not only AI, are factors that will shape the future role of digital technologies in politics and everyday life. So we must take much greater account of the geopolitics in which technologies exist if we are to address the challenges of&nbsp;power.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/where-are-all-the-people-58c6c69975ff">Where are all the people?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Keeping your CPU cool is essential for performance and longevity. If you’re into gaming or handle demanding tasks like video editing, you’ll want to make sure your CPU doesn’t overheat. Let’s break down why good CPU temp matters and how to maintain it for the best performance.</p>

 What is a Good CPU Temperature? 



<p>Knowing what constitutes a “good” CPU temperature can make all the difference for your system. Here’s what you should aim for a good CPU temp, depending on what you’re doing:</p>



 
 Idle Temperature: When your computer isn’t doing much (just sitting on the desktop), the ideal CPU temperature should be between 30°C to 50°C. If it’s higher than this, it’s worth checking your cooling system.<br> 



 Normal Use: For tasks like browsing, watching videos, or light gaming, temperatures between 50°C to 75°C are totally fine. Anything higher may indicate you need better airflow or cooling.<br> 



 Heavy Load: If you’re gaming or running demanding software, temperatures between 70°C to 85°C are typical. Once it hits above 85°C, that’s when you need to start thinking about cooling options.<br> 



 Maximum Temperature: At maximum load, such as gaming at full throttle or rendering videos, Intel CPUs should stay under 90°C, while AMD CPUs should aim to stay below 92°C. Temperatures above this for extended periods could damage your hardware.

 What Affects Your CPU Temperature? 



<p>There are several factors that can cause your CPU to run hotter than usual:</p>



 
 Workload: The more your CPU is working (e.g., heavy gaming, 3D rendering), the higher the temperature. The CPU has to process a lot more information, generating heat in the process.<br> 



 Ambient Temperature: If your room is too hot, your CPU will naturally run hotter. Cooling systems work better in cooler environments.<br> 



 Cooling System: If your CPU cooler isn’t up to the task, or if it’s clogged with dust, the temperature will rise. Ensuring good airflow in your case and using a high-quality cooler can prevent this. 
 



 Common Causes of High CPU Temperature 



<p>There are several common reasons why your CPU might be running too hot. Identifying these causes early on can help you take the right steps to keep a good CPU temp. Here are 4 main factors to watch out for:</p>



 
 Dust Buildup: Dust can clog fans and heatsinks, restricting airflow and causing your CPU to overheat. Regular cleaning is essential to maintain efficient cooling. 



 Overclocking: Overclocking your CPU increases heat production. If you’re pushing your CPU beyond its factory settings, it’s important to monitor temperatures to prevent overheating. 



 Poor Ventilation: Placing your PC on soft surfaces like a bed or couch can block airflow, causing heat to build up. Ensure your PC is on a hard, flat surface to promote better cooling. 



 Aging Hardware: Over time, thermal paste can dry out, and cooling fans can wear down, reducing cooling efficiency. Regular maintenance, like reapplying thermal paste and cleaning fans, helps keep temperatures under control. 
 


 
 


 5 Tips for Maintaining a Good CPU Temperature 



<p>Maintaining an optimal CPU temperature requires regular attention and a few simple adjustments. By improving airflow, upgrading your cooling system, and performing routine maintenance, you can ensure your CPU runs efficiently and stays cool. Here are some practical tips to help you manage your CPU’s temperature effectively.</p>



 Improve Airflow 



<p>To keep your CPU cool, make sure your PC is placed in a well-ventilated area. Ensure there’s enough space around your PC for air to flow freely. Adding extra case fans or organizing cables inside the case can improve airflow and help cool your CPU more effectively.</p>



 Upgrade Your Cooling 



<p>If you’re into gaming or regularly run demanding applications, upgrading to a more efficient cooling system is a great idea. Consider switching to a liquid cooling system, which is more effective at heat dissipation compared to traditional air cooling, especially under heavy load.</p>



 Clean Your System Regularly 



<p>Dust accumulation is one of the biggest factors that can affect your cooling system. To avoid overheating, clean your PC’s interior every few months. Focus on removing dust from fans, heatsinks, and vents, which can all block airflow and increase temperatures. Using compressed air or a soft brush can help remove dust without damaging components.</p>



 Reapply Thermal Paste 



<p>Over time, thermal paste between your CPU and cooler can dry out and lose its effectiveness. Reapplying fresh thermal paste ensures better heat transfer, helping your CPU stay cooler. This is especially important if you’re experiencing higher temperatures or if it’s been a while since you built or serviced your system.</p>



 Use a Cooling Pad for Laptops 



<p>If you’re using a laptop, a cooling pad equipped with fans can significantly help reduce temperatures, especially during gaming or multitasking. Cooling pads provide additional airflow to your laptop’s bottom surface, preventing excessive heat buildup and improving performance during intensive tasks.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Maintaining a good CPU temp is vital for performance and longevity. By keeping an eye on your CPU temperature, cleaning your system, improving airflow, and investing in better cooling, you can ensure your computer runs smoothly and stays reliable for the long haul. Regular monitoring and simple maintenance can prevent overheating and help you get the most out of your machine, whether you’re gaming, working, or just browsing.</p>

<p>India Considers Banning Chinese AI Chatbot DeepSeek Over Data Privacy And Cybersecurity Risks</p>



<p>India is considering banning DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot, due to data privacy and cybersecurity concerns, with CERT-In, under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, investigating its data collection practices. DeepSeek reportedly gathers user data through prompts, device metadata, app interactions, and external sources, raising fears of unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential manipulation of political discourse. Unlike ChatGPT, DeepSeek poses elevated privacy risks, as it can track user behavior across other AI platforms like ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Similar concerns have led countries like the US, Italy, and Australia to restrict DeepSeek’s use. India’s finance ministry has already warned against using AI tools like DeepSeek on government devices, reinforcing the need for strict regulations to protect national security and user privacy. <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/artificial-intelligence/india-likely-to-ban-deepseek-ai-over-data-privacy-and-cybersecurity-risks?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8wDiKe5A745prQbZESWFuZkzn8Ds4Qhch9z0t7PpTpGwc6Yh2Aejq-MbUGq2mbvBnlje8X">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>UK Government Pressures Apple to Weaken iCloud Encryption, Sparking Privacy Concerns</p>



<p>The U.K. government secretly ordered Apple to create a backdoor to access encrypted iCloud backups under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, aiming to weaken Apple’s end-to-end encryption feature, Advanced Data Protection. The order, which Apple is likely to comply with by removing the feature for U.K. users, has sparked concerns over privacy rights and the potential for similar demands from other governments. Critics argue that the move would set a dangerous global precedent, making encrypted data more vulnerable to cybercriminals and authoritarian regimes. Security experts warn that weakening encryption contradicts efforts to protect users from state-sponsored cyber threats, such as recent hacking campaigns by Chinese-backed groups. The U.K.’s approach risks straining alliances with nations prioritizing encryption as a safeguard against espionage and cyberattacks. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/uks-secret-apple-icloud-backdoor-order-is-a-global-emergency-say-critics/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GC-_vorLz04i6FHCt41SOz3chrht4rZontaHNBr1FAA5yoZOTOiaTF5xPnbmimyUKM4Sv">(Source)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/">Thales</a>, the leading global technology and security provider, today announced the launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/access-management/fido-key-lifecycle-management">OneWelcome FIDO Key Lifecycle Management</a>,&nbsp;a new solution to help large organizations successfully deploy and manage FIDO security passkeys at scale. This announcement reflects Thales’s commitment to provide its customers with a seamless and secure passwordless journey.</p>
<p><a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/access-management/fido-key-lifecycle-management">OneWelcome FIDO Key Lifecycle Management</a>&nbsp;combines an interoperable management platform with&nbsp;<a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/access-management/authenticators/fido-devices">Thales hardware FIDO security keys</a>&nbsp;(passkeys) specifically designed by Thales for use in large organizations. The solution helps CISOs accelerate and secure their passwordless journey by managing FIDO security keys at scale, in a simple and efficient way, throughout their lifecycle. In addition, CISOs benefit from the ultimate Thales expertise in cyber security and in complex projects.</p>
<blockquote><p>Danny de Vreeze, Vice President, Identity &amp; Access Management at Thales, said:&nbsp;“Authentication is at the heart of securing identities and we are committed to supporting organizations securely transition to passwordless authentication. This solution eliminates the barriers to smooth adoption and enables IT teams to easily manage FIDO security keys beyond just the enrollment. The OneWelcome FIDO Key Lifecycle Management solution is a crucial part of our Passwordless 360° approach that encourages organizations to deploy passwordless at scale and reap its strategic benefits.”</p></blockquote>
<p>FIDO security keys are the gold standard for protecting the enterprise from phishing attacks, but cumbersome self-registration and lifecycle management processes often lead to user frustration, IT overheads and delayed passwordless authentication deployment.</p>
<p><a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/access-management/fido-key-lifecycle-management#features">Thanks to unique capabilities</a>, this new solution, allows IT teams to quickly preregister keys and manage them easily and securely from enrollment to revocation. By relieving end users from these processes, the OneWelcome FIDO Key Lifecycle Management solution improves end-user productivity, accelerates FIDO authentication deployment at scale and secures the entire FIDO key lifecycle.</p>
<blockquote><p>Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CEO at The FIDO Alliance, said:&nbsp;“The FIDO Alliance’s mission is to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords with simpler, stronger authentication. As an active board member of The FIDO Alliance, Thales underscores that mission by supporting a wider deployment of FIDO standards via its device-bound passkey Management Solution – with the added bonus of full key lifecycle management.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The interoperable management platform is integrated via FIDO2 provisioning API’s to Microsoft Entra ID which enables organizations to pre-register Thales FIDO keys on behalf of their end users.</p>
<p>Thanks to this integration, Enterprises adopting Microsoft 365 can provide secure and seamless authentication to their users from day one. Thales confirms its position as an&nbsp;<a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/blog/access-management/passwordless-mfa-Solutions-for-Microsoft-365-Security">Identity Trailblazer won at the 2024 Microsoft Security Excellence Awards</a>&nbsp;in recognition of its innovative IAM solutions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Natee Pretikul, Principal Product Management Lead at Microsoft Security, said: “<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/identity/public-preview-microsoft-entra-id-fido2-provisioning-apis/4062699">With FIDO2 provisioning APIs</a>&nbsp;and our longstanding collaboration with Thales, we are empowering organizations to deploy phishing-resistant authentication at scale. By pre-registering end users for a passkey (FIDO2) credential, we enable them to use phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication methods more quickly.”</p></blockquote>
<p>*<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">The FIDO Alliance</a> is an open industry association with a focused mission: reduce the world’s reliance on passwords.

  Thales Alenia Space and ESA sign contract for HydRON to demonstrate first multi-orbit optical communication network
tas

Fri, 02/14/2025 - 09:59


             
 Thales Alenia Space will develop the world’s first all-optical, multi-orbit optical space communication network 
 ESA’s HydRON project will meet the challenge of bringing connectivity to multiple users to showcase the capabilities of optical communication technology 
 The company will leverage its expertise to contribute to Europe's technological independence in connectivity services through space. 
 
<p>Cannes, February 14, 2025 – Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA)&nbsp;for Element #2 of the HydRON (High-thRoughput Optical space Network) Demonstration System (DS) for the design, development, deployment and in-orbit demonstration of a full end-to-end optical system to verify and validate the world’s first all-optical, high-data-rate, multi-orbit transport network in space.</p>
<p>HydRON is set to transform the way data-collecting satellites communicate, using laser technology that will allow satellites to connect with each other and ground networks much faster.By enabling rapid, high-capacity connections between satellites and ground networks, HydRON will significantly enhance our ability to collect and utilize data from space.</p>
 
    
 
<p>HydRON optical communication for broadband in space&nbsp;©ESA</p>
<p>The project will be conducted with the support of the various space agencies involved in this exciting challenge: the Italian Space Agency (ASI), the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Polish Space Agency (POLSA), the Romanian Space Agency (ROSA), Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Swiss Space Agency (SSO). Other agencies are expected to join during the project to expand the mission’s objectives. HydRON forms part of ESA’s Optical and Quantum Communications – ScyLight programme within the Connectivity and Secure Communications directorate.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am really pleased Thales Alenia Space will be contributing to Europe’s technological independence in connectivity services through space,” said Giampiero Di Paolo, Deputy CEO and Senior Vice President, Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space. “Thales Alenia Space believes HydRON Demonstration System is the key enabler for the reliability and operability of a high-throughput optical network in space, paving the way for the future of commercial optical communications in Europe and globally.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“It was an honour to sign this contract with Thales Alenia Space, which moves us closer to establishing Europe's first optical communication network in space," said Laurent Jaffart, ESA’s Director of Connectivity and Secure Communications. "HydRON is set to maintain Europe and Canada as global leaders in the optical domain. With the system being interoperable, HydRON will ensure we continue to grow ESA’s cooperation with our international partners."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thales Alenia Space’s role in HydRON-DS project </p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space, with its long track record in telecommunication networks and expertise in the production of optical terminals for space, developed in Zurich, has already coordinated a working group involving Telespazio, a joint venture between Leonardo (67%) and Thales (33%), responsible for the ground segment, and other Italian and European companies for Phase A/B1 of the HydRON-DS project. This work was completed at the end of the 2023.</p>
<p>Today, Thales Alenia Space in Italy is ready to lead a European industry consortium for building the HydRON-DS Element #2 mission partition, including the space segment (LEO collector satellite and GEO optical payload) and ground segment (two optical ground stations, mission and network control center and satellite control center).</p>
<p>The project will develop and validate two concepts:</p>
 
 Fiber in the Sky: multi-orbit optical telecommunications at high data rates between space and ground assets. 
 Internet beyond the Clouds: innovative onboard routing techniques at high throughput (&gt;&nbsp;100&nbsp;Gbps) to build an optical space transport network seamlessly integrated with terrestrial fiber-based networks.

 TON Network: The Ultimate Blockchain for Speed &amp; Scalability 



<p>The Open Network (TON) is a decentralized blockchain designed by the creators of Telegram to handle high-speed, scalable transactions. It processes millions of transactions per second while ensuring decentralization and security. TON offers a faster, cheaper alternative to other blockchains, making it perfect for decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and everyday crypto transactions.</p>



<p>TON is a full ecosystem that includes DeFi protocols, decentralized applications (dApps), NFT marketplaces, and Telegram integration. With a growing user base and vibrant community, TON is reshaping the crypto space, offering a seamless experience for managing assets and exploring decentralized opportunities.</p>



 Why TON Bridge is Your Go-To Tool for Seamless Crypto Transfers 



<p>When it comes to transferring assets across blockchains, flexibility, speed, and low fees are key. TON Bridge delivers all of that and more, allowing users to easily bridge their tokens to and from TON. Here’s why it’s quickly becoming the go-to solution for seamless crypto transfers.</p>



 Unlock Cross-Chain Power 



<p>TON Bridge allows you to transfer assets between TON and popular blockchains like Ethereum and BSC. In fact, TON Bridge supports cross-chain transactions for several assets, including Toncoin and USDT. This flexibility is crucial, as it enables users to tap into the full potential of TON’s ecosystem while still benefiting from other major blockchain networks.</p>



 Fast, Affordable, and Secure 



<p>TON Bridge ensures that transfers are processed in seconds, with typical transaction times ranging from 5-10 minutes depending on network congestion. On top of that, users enjoy minimal fees, often a fraction of what you’d pay on Ethereum. For example, transferring assets to TON usually incurs a fixed 1 TON fee, plus minimal gas costs, making it far cheaper compared to Ethereum’s gas fees which can skyrocket during peak times.</p>



 Telegram Integration: A Game-Changer 



<p>With TON’s Telegram integration, users can manage their crypto directly through the Telegram app—simplifying both everyday transactions and larger transfers. With over 500 million active users on Telegram, this seamless integration provides a unique, user-friendly experience that no other blockchain offers. You can send, receive, and store your crypto in Telegram’s native wallet, making it as easy as sending a text message.</p>


 
 


 Bridging Assets to TON: A Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Started 



<p>Transferring assets to TON can be quick and easy when you follow the right steps. Whether you’re new to the TON ecosystem or a seasoned crypto user, this step-by-step guide will help you bridge assets seamlessly and securely.</p>



 Step 1: Get Your Wallets Ready 



<p>Before you begin, make sure you have the right wallets set up. You’ll need a TON wallet like Tonkeeper or Telegram Wallet, and a Web3 wallet (like MetaMask) for the blockchain you’re bridging from (e.g., Ethereum, BNB). Having both wallets ready ensures a smooth transfer process.</p>



 Step 2: Connect Your Wallet to TON Bridge 



<p>Once your wallets are set up, head to the TON Bridge website. Click “Connect Wallet,” select your wallets for both the source and destination blockchains, and authorize the connection. This will link your wallets to the TON Bridge, allowing you to start your transfer.</p>



 Step 3: Choose Your Token and Amount 



<p>Next, choose which token you want to transfer to the TON network. Select from supported tokens like USDT or Toncoin and input the amount you wish to transfer. The system will automatically calculate the equivalent value on TON for the selected token.</p>



 Step 4: Approve the Transaction and Confirm 



<p>Before finalizing the transfer, you’ll need to approve the transaction in your wallet. A prompt will appear to confirm the details of the transfer—double-check everything to ensure accuracy, then click “Approve.” This step is essential for authorizing the bridge to process your transaction.</p>



 Step 5: Paying Fees and Finalizing the Transfer 



<p>At this point, you’ll be prompted to pay any fees associated with the transfer. Expect a fixed 1 TON fee for bridging to the TON network, plus minimal network fees. Once you confirm the payment, the transaction will begin processing, typically within a few minutes.</p>



 Step 6: Receive Your Tokens in TON Wallet 



<p>Once the transaction is complete, check your TON wallet for the transferred assets. Your tokens should appear in your wallet, and you’re now ready to explore the full benefits of the TON ecosystem.</p>



 Extra Tip: Alternatives for Bridging 



<p>If you’re looking for other ways to transfer assets to TON, consider using alternatives like Symbiosis or Layerswap. These platforms support bridging from Ethereum, BNB, and other chains to TON with competitive fees and fast processing.</p>


 
 


 Pro Tips: Maximize Efficiency When Bridging to TON 



<p>When it comes to bridging assets to TON, timing and strategy can make a big difference. Here are some pro tips to help you save on fees and optimize your cross-chain transfers.</p>



 Save on Fees by Timing Your Transfers Right 



<p>One of the easiest ways to save on fees is to time your transfers wisely. Gas fees can vary depending on the time of day and network congestion. To minimize costs, consider making your transfers during off-peak hours—typically on weekends or late at night, when the Ethereum network is less congested. By avoiding peak hours, you can often save up to 30% on gas fees, making your bridge to TON even more cost-effective.</p>



 Optimizing Cross-Chain Transfers: A Pro’s Guide 



<p>To make your cross-chain transfers even easier and cheaper, consider using bridging platforms that offer low fees and fast processing times, like Symbiosis or Rubic. These platforms often provide optimized routes for asset transfers, ensuring the best rates by automatically selecting the most efficient bridge. Additionally, look for platforms that support multi-chain bridging, allowing you to transfer assets from multiple networks to TON in a single transaction—saving time and money. Keep an eye on any promotions or discounts offered by bridging services, as they can help reduce fees even further.</p>

<p>The rise of e-commerce has led to an explosion in demand for packaging,<br>
with much of it ending up in landfills. Reusable packaging offers a<br>
sustainable solution, but its success hinges on high return rates. This<br>
article explores the potential of gamification and blockchain rewards to<br>
incentivize customers to return reusable packaging, specifically<br>
focusing on mailers that can be returned via mailbox. We will analyze<br>
two business models: one leveraging these technologies and one that does<br>
not, providing a comprehensive value comparison.</p>
<p>Gamification and Blockchain Rewards: A Powerful Combination</p>
<p>Gamification involves integrating game-like elements, such as points,<br>
badges, and leaderboards, into non-game contexts to drive user<br>
engagement and influence behavior1. By tapping into our natural desire<br>
for competition, achievement, and rewards, gamification can make even<br>
mundane tasks more enjoyable and motivating. Studies have shown that<br>
gamification can lead to increased participation, improved information<br>
retention, and higher conversion rates2. However, the success of<br>
gamification depends on customer readiness, which is influenced by<br>
factors like the simplicity of the program and the quality of<br>
information provided3.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology, a decentralized and transparent system for<br>
recording and verifying transactions, provides a secure and efficient<br>
platform for managing rewards programs. Its key characteristics, such as<br>
immutability and traceability, foster trust among participants4.<br>
Blockchain also enables the creation of tokenized rewards, which can be<br>
used across different platforms and even traded on secondary markets,<br>
offering greater flexibility and value to customers5.</p>
<p>The synergy between gamification and blockchain creates a powerful<br>
incentive system. Gamification provides the motivational engine, while<br>
blockchain ensures the security and transparency of the rewards program,<br>
enhancing its credibility and appeal to customers4. This combination<br>
is particularly relevant in the context of loyalty programs, a market<br>
that has experienced significant growth in recent years. In 2015, 3.8<br>
billion loyalty program memberships were active in the US, with<br>
enrollment growing by 20% across various industries6.</p>
<p>Incentivizing Reusable Packaging Returns: Two Business Models</p>
<p>Model 1: Traditional Approach (No Gamification or Blockchain)</p>
<p>This model relies on traditional methods to encourage returns, such as:</p>
 
 
<p>Deposit fees: Customers pay a deposit upon receiving the<br>
packaging, which is refunded upon return.</p>
 
 
<p>Pre-paid return labels: Including a pre-paid return label with<br>
the package for easy return.</p>
 
 
<p>Environmental messaging: Emphasizing the environmental benefits<br>
of returning the packaging.</p>
 
 
<p>While these methods can be effective to a certain extent, they often<br>
lack the engagement and motivation needed to achieve high return<br>
rates7.</p>
<p>Model 2: Gamified Blockchain Rewards</p>
<p>This model integrates gamification and blockchain to create a more<br>
engaging and rewarding return experience:</p>
 
 
<p>Tokenized rewards: Customers earn tokens for each returned<br>
mailer. These tokens can be redeemed for discounts, exclusive<br>
products, or even exchanged for other cryptocurrencies5.</p>
 
 
<p>Gamified challenges: Introduce challenges, such as returning a<br>
certain number of mailers within a specific timeframe, to earn bonus<br>
tokens or achieve higher tiers in the rewards program8.</p>
 
 
<p>Interactive tracking: Allow customers to track their return<br>
history and token balance through a user-friendly app or online<br>
platform9.</p>
 
 
<p>Community building: Create a community around the program,<br>
allowing users to interact, share their achievements, and<br>
participate in contests10.</p>
 
 
<p>By combining the motivational power of gamification with the security<br>
and transparency of blockchain, this model aims to create a more<br>
engaging and rewarding return experience, leading to higher return rates<br>
and increased customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Beyond tokenized rewards, blockchain has the potential to transform<br>
loyalty programs by enabling features like real-time tracking of<br>
rewards, personalized offers based on individual customer behavior, and<br>
interactive challenges that make earning rewards more engaging9.</p>
<p>To further enhance the program, businesses can leverage the<br>
psychological principles behind gamification. For instance, by<br>
incorporating elements of challenge, accomplishment, and social<br>
interaction, they can tap into users' intrinsic motivation and desire<br>
for rewards, making the return process more appealing and enjoyable12.</p>

<p>Environmental Impact        Moderate                                                 High</p>
 
<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>Model 2, with its gamified blockchain rewards system, offers several<br>
advantages over the traditional approach. It has the potential to<br>
significantly increase customer engagement and return rates by making<br>
the return process more fun and rewarding. The use of blockchain<br>
technology adds a layer of security and transparency, building trust<br>
with customers and enhancing the program's credibility. Furthermore,<br>
the tokenized rewards offer greater flexibility and value to customers,<br>
increasing their motivation to participate13. However, it's important<br>
to acknowledge the potential downsides of blockchain rewards, such as<br>
the risk of token value fluctuations and the need for technical<br>
expertise to manage the blockchain system14. Businesses need to<br>
carefully weigh these costs against the potential benefits of increased<br>
return rates and customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Environmental Impact of Reusable Packaging</p>
<p>Reusable packaging offers significant environmental benefits compared to<br>
single-use alternatives. It reduces waste, conserves natural resources,<br>
and lowers greenhouse gas emissions15. Studies have shown that<br>
reusable packaging can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 82% and plastic<br>
waste by 87% compared to single-use options16. The break-even point,<br>
where the environmental impact of a reusable container becomes less than<br>
that of single-use, varies depending on factors like the type of<br>
container and its production process17.</p>
<p>Furthermore, blockchain technology can contribute to a more sustainable<br>
and ethical supply chain for reusable packaging. By providing a<br>
transparent and immutable record of the packaging's lifecycle,<br>
blockchain can be used to track the origin of materials, ensure<br>
responsible sourcing, and promote transparency in the recycling<br>
process18.</p>
<p>Several successful initiatives demonstrate the feasibility of reusable<br>
packaging programs. For example, Starbucks' "Borrow a Cup" program<br>
allows customers to borrow a reusable cup for a small deposit and return<br>
it at any participating store. Other successful examples include the<br>
"Banff Borrows" program in Canada and the reusable container system at<br>
the Our Tampines Hub hawker center in Singapore19.</p>
<p>By incentivizing the return of reusable mailers, both business models<br>
contribute to reducing the environmental impact of e-commerce packaging.<br>
However, Model 2, with its potential for higher return rates, could lead<br>
to even greater environmental benefits.</p>
<p>Current Return Rates for Reusable Packaging</p>
<p>While data on the return rates of reusable mailers specifically is<br>
limited in the provided research, studies have shown that reusable<br>
packaging systems in other sectors can achieve significant return rates.<br>
For instance, a study by Fashion for Good found that reusable packaging<br>
systems in the fashion e-commerce industry can achieve return rates of<br>
up to 80%, leading to substantial reductions in waste and emissions16.</p>
<p>Boosting Customer Engagement and Loyalty</p>
<p>Gamification and blockchain rewards have the potential to significantly<br>
increase customer engagement and loyalty. Research suggests that<br>
customers who engage with gamified loyalty programs are twice as likely<br>
to be satisfied with the brand12. Moreover, blockchain-based loyalty<br>
programs offer enhanced transparency and security, which can further<br>
strengthen customer trust and loyalty13.</p>
<p>Manufacturing and Shipping Costs</p>
<p>The cost of manufacturing reusable packaging is generally higher than<br>
single-use packaging due to the use of more durable materials20.<br>
However, this cost is offset by the savings from reduced packaging<br>
consumption over time. Shipping costs can also be reduced with reusable<br>
packaging due to its efficient stacking and reduced need for frequent<br>
shipments21. It's important to consider that shifting to reusable<br>
packaging for e-commerce can lead to a cost increase of more than 50%<br>
for mailer bags and nearly 200% for cardboard boxes, depending on the<br>
specific scenario22.</p>

  Thales, Amelia and Breakthrough Energy Contrails launch one of world's largest Contrail Avoidance campaigns  
prezly

Thu, 02/13/2025 - 10:00


             
 Thales, in collaboration with the airline Amelia, and Breakthrough Energy Contrails, announces the large-scale deployment of a contrail avoidance solution, which has already been tested on the flight routes from Paris and Valladolid (Spain). Contrails are one the major challenges in the ecological transition in aviation and this initiative has helped avoid more than 20 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) in 2024, reducing the climate impact1 of each flight by up to 40%. 
 By modifying the altitude of the planes rather than their lateral trajectory, the solution optimizes flight plans and thus limits the potential overconsumption of fuel to under 3%. Amelia plans to further expand this initiative in 2025, progressively applying it to most of its eligible flight operations, making this experiment one of the largest in the world. 
 With this solution, Thales, a key player in more sustainable aviation, offers a systematic approach that can be quickly integrated by all airlines, seeking to reduce their environmental impact as of today.

<p>Thales, in partnership with Amelia and Breakthrough Energy Contrails, takes a major step towards more environmentally friendly aviation, by implementing an innovative contrail avoidance solution.</p>
<p>Since June 2024, Thales' contrail avoidance solution has been deployed on all Paris-Valladolid flights operated by Amelia, using Embraer ERJ145 aircraft. This initiative is part of the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/aerospace/press_release/thales-lead-decor-research-project-test-solutions-lowering">DECOR</a> project, supported by France's 2030 investment plan.</p>
<p>Contrails, the artificial clouds produced by aeroplanes, trap heat from the sun, playing a role similar to that of greenhouse gases and thus significantly contributing to global warming. The impact of contrails can represent a significant part of the total climate footprint of aviation, rivalling even that of CO2.</p>
<p>By integrating its solution with Amelia’s Operational Control Center (OCC) tools, Thales enables OCC operations agents to directly obtain alternative trajectories to their flight plans, combining controlled operational impact and a significant reduction in contrails. </p>
<p>When a significant impact of contrails is detected, the Thales solution, <a href="https://flights-footprint.com/">Flights Footprint</a>, suggests flight alternatives that allow for a significant reduction in climate impact, with a minimum average decrease of up to 40% in the total climate impact of the flight. This flight optimization relies solely on adjustments to the aircraft's altitude, without changing their route, which helps to keep additional fuel consumption to below 3%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Yannick Assouad, Executive Vice-President, Avionics, Thales said: “Thales' contrail avoidance solution is a first for France. It is fully aligned with Thales' strategy aiming to transform the aerospace industry towards a more environmentally-friendly future through technology, for more sustainable and responsible aviation”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on proven scientific principles, this innovative solution utilizes the latest weather forecasts and the most advanced climate models provided by Breakthrough Energy Contrails to optimize the flight plan. At the end of each flight, these climate models, enriched by meteorological reanalysis data, are applied to the actual flight path of the aircraft to assess the effectiveness of avoiding contrail formation areas. Additionally, the installation of a ground camera, supplied by Reuniwatt, enables the solution's effectiveness to be validated through the direct observation of contrails, thanks to the analyses conducted in partnership with the digital services company <a href="https://sii-group.com/en-FR">SII</a>.</p>
<p>This project has prevented an average of more than 4 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) per flight, initially affected by contrails. Amelia has decided to extend this system to eligible flights in 2025, becoming the first airline to systematically implement a contrail avoidance approach.</p>
<blockquote><p>Adrien Chabot, Director of Sustainable Development at Amelia said: “Taking condensation trails into account allows for the analysis of the total climate impact of our operations and thus a better optimization of them. The challenge is to significantly and quickly reduce our impact on climate change by continuing the deployment of the Thales solution initiated in 2022. Today, it is probably one of the most promising approaches in terms of cost/benefit regarding climate impact.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This solution, accessible and easily deployable, creates new horizons for all airlines, paving the way for more sustainable and responsible aviation on a global scale.</p>
<blockquote><p>Matteo Mirolo, Head of Strategy at Breakthrough Energy Contrails said: "The impact of contrails on the climate, similar to that of CO2, is one of the major challenges of the ecological transition in aviation. We are delighted to collaborate with Thales to implement large-scale pilot avoidance campaigns, like this one done with Amelia, which are crucial when considering the eventual deployment of systematic avoidance measures."</p></blockquote>

<p>Identity and fraud are two sides of the same coin, and emerging technologies have made it impossible (and risky) to separate the two. Leveraging stolen credentials, synthetic identities, and artificial intelligence (AI), fraudsters are exploiting vulnerabilities across organizations with siloed identity and access management (IAM) and fraud functions. <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/account-takeover-ato-fraud.html">Account takeover (ATO)</a> fraud surged by 354% in 2023 alone, underscoring the need for a unified approach. Addressing today’s threat environment requires identity and fraud teams to share insights and adopt integrated strategies that proactively stop fraud before it occurs. Collaboration is not just a technological necessity but a strategic imperative to protect organizations and their customers from increasingly sophisticated attacks.</p>

				  Europe’s embrace of decentralized identity means significant cost savings for business and better customer experiences 
 The European Union is laying the foundation for the mass digitalization of business and social life for over 450 million people with open-source specifications for a European digital identity (eIDAS 2.0) and digital identity wallet (EUDI). The identities and wallets built from these specifications and standards will, eventually, enable European citizens, businesses, and organizations to securely share and prove information about themselves in privacy-preserving ways across each of the 27 member states.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>What does this mean for business?</p>
<p>There are two dimensions to how EUDI will impact business:</p>
<p>Interaction with the government.</p>
<p>Interaction with customers (whether B2B or B2C).</p>
<p>Interaction with government</p>
<p>The scale of the EU’s digital ambitions are already driving global adoption of decentralized identity; countries want to be digitally compatible with what emerges so as to ensure frictionless interaction, whether in trade or travel.</p>
<p>But at the same time, many countries have already adopted similar decentralized solutions, some of which are far ahead of Europe in deployment and offer much greater functionality to users (due to more advanced decentralized identity specifications).</p>
<p>The best way for a company, an industry, or a sector to see what the immediate impact of EUDI will look like is to look at Canada, where the Government of British Columbia’s implementation of “<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/home/">digital trust</a>” through Verifiable Credentials has reduced paperwork and increased efficiency for business.</p>
<p>A good starting point is login. A company with a decentralized digital identity no longer needs to use a login and password to access government services, thereby significantly reducing the company’s and the government’s exposure to identity theft and fraud while improving user experience.</p>
<p>Government, in turn, can issue credentials for business registration, business addresses certifications, licenses, permits — the whole range of paper-based authorization and proof — in the form of tamper-free credentials, which a company can then use and reuse whenever it needs to prove that it has the requisite documentation for a particular activity. The goal: eliminate paperwork and duplication with information that can be instantly authenticated.</p>
<p>With the ability to create verifiable documents comes the ability to sign these documents in the same verifiable way. For example, with a verifiable credential, a business can digitally sign an application for a license in a way that a) automatically ingests the requisite authenticated data from the credential, thereby reducing friction and manual data entry error, and b) signs the application in a legally-binding unalterable way.</p>
<p>The government of British Columbia has also created <a href="https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/about">OrgBook</a> as a verifiable repository of information about businesses registered in the Canadian province.</p>
<p>In sum, EUDI and eIDAS represent a significant opportunity to reduce the costs of compliance by creating authoritative and verifiable business data that can be seamlessly reduced. For data and regulation-intensive sectors, this represents a significant opportunity to reduce costs and make the business of setting up and running a business much more efficient.</p>
<p>Interaction with customers</p>
<p>The immediate advantage to decentralized digital identities is that you really will be able to know that your customer is your customer. By enabling people and organizations to hold their identity data, share this data securely, and have it easily, instantly, proved cryptographically, decentralized identity removes a critical security weakness in current digital authentication: the centralized database filled with personal data.</p>
<p>If you don’t have to store personal data to verify a digital identity, it can’t be stolen and you eliminate a security cost. It also means you can provide seamless access to a resource or service without the need for customers or users to create identity accounts with logins and passwords, a key attack vector for phishing and a key friction point for users (no more MFA). And if you no longer have to store personal data in order to make your business work, you’ve just radically simplified compliance with the numerous directives from GDPR on data minimization and privacy. You’re happy, your customers are happy — rarely is there a technology where everyone comes out as a winner.</p>
<p>These are the immediate benefits and the impact will be felt most in fraud reduction and better customer and user experiences. But remember, you can create Verifiable Credentials for multiple kinds of data and not just personal data. How about Verifiable Invoices to simplify invoicing and tackle invoice fraud? You could cryptographically prove in an instant that every invoice was authentic, came from a legitimate supplier, and had not been altered. A simple use case to implement, simple to use, and it solves a systemic problem.</p>
<p>And if you can manage invoices, you can manage payments. Remember, if you can trust the identity and the data presented from a Verifiable Credential, you can immediately act on the data. Seamless authentication and seamless payments create trust networks that eliminate the need for intermediaries and enable you to scale business in a way that current technology can not. This has significant revenue saving and creating implications.</p>
<p>Exciting! So what do you do now?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter the market by building quickly and then scale your solution when you need to. And you can do this easily and cost-effectively with Indicio Proven.</p>

<p>We’ve also made it easy to combine credential formats in a single digital wallet for a continuous workflow, so you can leverage Indicio Proven’s interoperability to go from anywhere to everywhere.</p>
<p>Why Indicio? We are masters of scale, battle tested in global deployments. With Indicio Proven you can be up and using Verifiable Credentials in hours and implement a country-level solution in a matter of days.</p>
<p>And because we’ve been leading the world in building award-winning, enterprise-grade decentralized identity solutions. We’ve got everything you need to go straight to building a solution for your customers instead of embarking on a long, costly learning curve to build all the components from scratch.</p>
<p>There’s going to be a cascade</p>
<p>The value props of this technology are not imaginary. Here’s what Gartner’s Market Guide from 2024 had to say</p>
<p>Decentralized identity for “identity verification, account takeovers, fraud, privacy and security… represents magnitudes of improvement in terms of efficiency, cost and assurance.”</p>
<p>At some point, incremental development and deployment turns into a cascade. The shift to an architecture of portable digital trust changes the fundamentals in how we share and consume information. Seamless authentication reduces the cost and drag of uncertainty in an information-driven economy. The question is if you don’t start now, will you be able to catch up to those who do.</p>

 Bridging the&nbsp;Gap <p>For developers looking to build in Web3, the transition from Web2 can feel like stepping into an uncharted territory. While decentralization unlocks incredible possibilities, it also introduces unfamiliar complexities, fragmented tooling, and new security paradigms that can slow down innovation and adoption.</p> 🛠 The Developer Struggles in&nbsp;Web3 <p>Web2 development has long been streamlined with centralized hosting, standardized SDKs, and predictable infrastructure.</p><blockquote>Web3, on the other hand, presents a maze of challenges:</blockquote><blockquote>Burner Wallets &amp; User Retention — Temporary wallets lead to high churn rates, making it difficult for developers to retain&nbsp;users.</blockquote><blockquote>Fragmented Infrastructure — No single framework exists; developers must juggle multiple chains, protocols, and standards.</blockquote><blockquote>Gas Fees &amp; Transaction Friction — Onboarding users comes with the burden of explaining gas fees, network congestion, and transaction speeds.</blockquote><blockquote>Security &amp; Custody Dilemmas — Self-custody is empowering, but it also places greater responsibility on developers to ensure key management solutions are secure and user-friendly.</blockquote><blockquote>Developer Tooling Gaps — Compared to Web2, Web3 lacks a polished, standardized stack, making it harder to ship production-ready applications efficiently.</blockquote><blockquote>How Web3 Can Make Onboarding Developers Easier?🤔</blockquote><p>💡 If Web3 is to reach mass adoption, we need to lower the barriers for developers by addressing key inefficiencies:</p><blockquote>🎯 Unified Developer Tooling — Simplified SDKs, modular APIs, and cross-chain compatibility to reduce friction in building dApps.<br>🎯 Abstracting Complexity — Gasless transactions, account abstraction, and streamlined wallet UX to eliminate unnecessary hurdles for both devs and users.<br>🎯 Scalability Without Trade-offs — Optimized rollups, L2 solutions, and auto-scaling infrastructure to ensure smooth, high-performance applications.<br>🎯 Security-First Design — Better frameworks for key management, on-chain security, and phishing protection to enhance developer confidence.<br>🎯Bridging Web2 Standards — Making the transition easier by integrating familiar Web2 authentication models (OAuth, SSO) with decentralized identity&nbsp;systems.</blockquote> 🌍 The Future: A Frictionless Web3 for&nbsp;Builders <p>Developers shouldn’t have to choose between innovation and usability. The goal should be a Web3 ecosystem that feels as intuitive and powerful as Web2, without sacrificing decentralization. The real Web3 revolution will come when builders can focus on creating great products without the unnecessary headaches.</p><p>The next wave of Web3 adoption starts with better developer experiences. Let’s make Web3 as seamless as it is powerful.</p><p>Team Safle&nbsp;✨</p>

<p>The Royal Navy’s fleet communications systems are being maintained to support combat capability after one of the largest investment in naval communications across Europe. The announcement for Maritime Communications Capability Support (MCCS) secures around 100 high skilled jobs at Thales and the new arrangements are estimated to save the Royal Navy up to £30m in through life costs over the next decade.</p>
<p>Communications systems on Royal Navy Units are a critical component of a platform’s ability to operate and fight; any failure or degradation of these systems places significant risk on the Royal Navy’s ability to fulfil Defence Outcomes. To meet and sustain global Royal Navy operational commitments requires resilient and enduring support contracts to maintain mission critical equipment at the highest levels of operational capability and availability.</p>
<p>The MCCS arrangement replaces the previous <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/europe/united-kingdom/markets-we-operate/defence-uk/maritime-solutions/maritime-solutions-14">Fleetwide Communications</a> contract which Thales in the UK has overseen for the past seven years.</p>
<p>Thales in the UK will also provide “waterfront” office services, obsolescence recovery for aging equipment and inventory management, ensuring spare part availability and ongoing defect repairs as required.</p>
<p>A key element to the contract is the slashing of red tape through closer collaboration between DE&amp;S, the Royal Navy, and Thales in the UK, effectively delivering a “one defence” team which massively reduces bureaucracy while boosting efficiency. Thales in the UK is awarded the freedoms and autonomy to make informed decisions on equipment replacement to sustain capability long-term to the benefit of the Royal Navy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Commodore Phil Game, Director of Sense, Decide &amp; Communicate at DE&amp;S, said: “First and foremost, this announcement ensures the Royal Navy continues to have effective and secure communications equipment with continuous support from Thales, which has Europe’s largest team of marine communications engineers, supporting its vital work keeping the UK and our allies safe. Crucially, we have looked at outcomes from other successful defence programmes and applied the lessons learned from those, in particular cutting unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy allowing Thales much more freedom to get the job done. We estimate that the scope of this contract will save between £25m and £30m in through life costs to the Royal Navy over the 10-year support period by working in a much more collaborative way with Thales in the UK, underlining our ‘one defence’ philosophy.” </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Phil Siveter, CEO Thales in the UK, said: “At Thales we are delighted to continue supporting the Royal Navy in its vital mission to protect our nation. This long-term fleetwide support framework reflects our unwavering commitment to ensuring the Royal Navy remains combat-ready and equipped with world-class communications capabilities, today and into the future. Building on seven years of trusted partnership, we are proud to provide the technical excellence and on-the-ground support that keeps ships, submarines and installations operational and mission-ready. By working as ‘one team’ across the Naval Enterprise, we are driving innovation and systems integration to place the Royal Navy at the cutting edge of defence technology for the next decade.”</p></blockquote>

				 <p>Mark is the founder of a growing logistics company, and after months of negotiation, he’s ready to seal a major partnership with a global distributor. But first, his company needs to undergo a Know Your Business (KYB) verification—a process he assumes will be long, tedious, and full of back-and-forth document requests.</p>



<p>Instead, Mark is about to experience how modern KYB technology makes business verification faster, simpler, and more secure.</p>



 



 A New Kind of KYB Process 



<p>In the past, Mark would’ve been asked to submit business registration papers, proof of ownership, and leadership information through email. On the other side, the distributor’s compliance team would spend days cross-checking everything manually, verifying documents, and screening for red flags.</p>



<p>This time, Mark receives a secure link to a KYB platform. The process is refreshingly simple:</p>



 
 Step 1: Mark enters his company’s registration number, and the system pulls verified data from official registries in seconds. 



 Step 2: He completes a quick biometric verification using his smartphone to confirm that he’s the authorized representative. 



 Step 3: The platform automatically runs global sanctions checks and searches for adverse media mentions. 
 



<p>By the time Mark finishes his morning coffee, the verification is done.</p>



 



 Instant Verification for Ownership and Key Personnel 



<p>KYB goes beyond company registration—it verifies who owns and controls the business. The platform prompts each key executive to complete their own ID verification remotely, ensuring they are who they claim to be.</p>



 
 Government-issued IDs are scanned and validated. 



 Biometric liveness detection confirms that the individuals are physically present. 



 The system’s secure, blockchain-backed ledger keeps records tamper-proof and ready for audits. 
 



 



 Cross-Border Compliance in Real Time 



<p>Mark’s company operates internationally, which means regulatory checks across multiple jurisdictions. Thanks to automation, the KYB system:</p>



 
 Cross-references corporate filings from various countries. 



 Screens against global sanctions and politically exposed persons (PEP) lists. 



 Ensures that beneficial ownership is transparent and compliant with regulations. 
 



<p>What once took days of manual research now happens in minutes.</p>



 



 KYB as a Business Enabler 



<p>Instead of being a bottleneck, the KYB process becomes a point of confidence for Mark and the distributor. By verifying his company’s legitimacy quickly and securely, the deal moves forward without delays.</p>



<p>For growing businesses like Mark’s, digital KYB isn’t just about meeting regulations—it’s about building trust and accelerating partnerships. With tools that combine biometric verification, automated regulatory checks, and secure data management, KYB is transforming from a necessary step into a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Mark signs the contract that same afternoon, knowing his company’s reputation is as solid as the deal itself.</p>



<p>For industries like real estate, insurance, and lending, digital KYB solutions offer more than regulatory compliance—they enhance transparency, strengthen relationships, and foster faster, safer transactions.</p>

<p>Gartner VP Analyst <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akifk/">Akif Khan</a> has good reason to believe workforce use cases for identity verification (IDV) will gain serious traction in 2025. Having received just five calls about the topic in the first five of his six years on Gartner’s IAM team, he reports there’s been a major spike in such queries in recent months. In a January <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/akifk_workplaces-are-evolving-ive-covered-identity-activity-7284939872417579008-mn3Z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios">LinkedIn post</a>, Kahn reveals the biggest drivers of client interest in workforce IDV are account recovery flows and employee onboarding.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see why. Thanks to high-profile data breaches at <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/mgm-caesars-hacks-more-of-the-same-is-coming-your-way-but-heres-how-to-stop-it/">MGM and Caesars</a>, IT service desks have become prime targets for fraudsters impersonating employees seeking assistance with a password reset and account recovery. In these “vishing” scams, information gleaned from employee social media profiles can help hackers fool overworked IT service desk personnel into granting them unfettered access to corporate systems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more than 100 US companies in aerospace, defense, retail, and technology have fallen prey to North Korean nation-state attackers leveraging falsified identity information and <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/01/24/identity-fraud-rise/">deepfake technology</a> to gain employment in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/29/north-korea-jobs-indict-money-plot/77958927007/">remote IT positions</a> from which they can exfiltrate data and conduct espionage. Even though technology to prevent such incursions is readily available, the frequency and severity of successful attacks keep growing.</p>
 Workforce Wake-up Call: The IDV Imperative 
<p>Whether it’s the service desk or employee onboarding, the cost of doing nothing about workforce IDV can be catastrophic. Once fraudsters have infiltrated corporate systems, they are free to escalate their access privileges, steal valuable data and source code, deploy crippling ransomware, and more.</p>
<p>Ransomware exposure costs US businesses an estimated <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherwishartsmith/2024/12/09/the-persistent-ransomware-threat-2024-trends-and-high-profile-attacks/">$124 billion</a> annually, and 35% of victim organizations never retain their data. And that’s just the start of the pain. A year after the February 2024 ransomware attack on UnitedHealth, the $22 million ransom was nothing compared to the <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ransowmare-attacks-in-2024/52949/">$3.09 billion</a> in total financial losses stemming from the incident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the average cost of a data breach topped $4.88 million in 2024—<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec">$9.48 million</a> for US-based organizations. But according to PwC, 27% of companies worldwide, and 34% of companies in North America, have suffered a data breach that cost them between $1 million and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/34-Cybersecurity-Statistics-to-Lose-Sleep-Over-in-2020">$20 million</a> in the past three years. As much as 44% of organizations hit by an <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/11/06/identity-related-data-breaches-cost/">identity-related breach</a> estimated the associated costs exceed those of a typical data breach.</p>
<p>In the case of North Korea’s operatives, fraudulent employees who passed background checks, reference verifications, and rounds of <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/security-firm-hires-north-korean-hacker-knowbe4">Zoom interviews</a> performed job tasks while installing remote monitoring and management <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/crowdstrike-2024-report-exposes-north-koreas-covert-workforce-in-u-s-tech-firms/">(RMM) tools</a> to establish a persistent presence within compromised networks. Others worked to exfiltrate data stored in OneDrive, SharePoint, and other cloud-based systems.</p>
<p>With help desk attacks, the ever-growing attack surface of outsourced IT support and call center operations crewed by less experienced, often short-term employees make these organizations especially vulnerable to vishing. Emerging, <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2024/08/08/ai-voice-deepfakes-waging-war-on-healthcare/">AI voice-enabled attack</a> modalities only make matters worse</p>
 Hope Is Not a Strategy: Balancing Security, Cost, and UX 
<p>Put it all together, and it’s no wonder Khan is fielding more questions about workforce IDV. And in his post, he asks the exact right questions: “Will organizations see the value in using IDV for these workforces use cases? Do they see the cost and challenges to the UX as proportionate to the risks being mitigated? And do they feel confident that IDV can mitigate those risks?”</p>
<p>As I mentioned, technologies to effectively address these use cases are widely available today. Organizations sourcing solutions are likely to find these same technologies prompt answers to Khan’s other questions in the affirmative.</p>
<p>The problem today is that HR departments and IT service desk operations with remote workers tend to rely on antiquated identity verification processes that rely on manual review of government-issued credentials shared in the clear via email and SMS messaging. High-quality fake credentials and deepfake technologies easily defeat these measures. Traditional forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) aren’t much help. Fraudsters increasingly demonstrate the ability to compromise SMS-based codes and push notifications through social engineering, SIM swapping, and other techniques.</p>
<p>Many forms of biometric authentication aren’t foolproof either. Anyone with administrative access can register things like user biometrics to any device they access—or set up an alternative identity provider to bypass authentication measures all together. These technologies aren’t always easy to integrate with existing workflows or infrastructure either—let alone meet a growing array of privacy mandates.</p>
 Modernizing Workforce Verification and Authentication 
<p>With traditional forms of MFA growing unreliable, modern forms of identity verification and authentication are setting new standards for security, convenience, and efficiency. Solutions certified to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>, <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics-</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a>, and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a> standards, for instance, combine machine-verified identity to government-issued credentials (driver’s license, state ID, passport, etc.) and enable non-phishable multifactor authentication when verified users login to digital services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/">1Kosmos</a>, for example, is a case in point. Our workforce <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">verification solution</a> provides an order of magnitude improvement in credential issuing during user onboarding and account recovery—replacing weak, knowledge-based and two-factor forms of authentication with a simple self-service workflow that accommodates government-issued credentials in 140 countries with 99% accuracy. Executed from any device, anywhere, anytime, 1Kosmos detects stolen and synthetic identities while establishing high-assurance trust for legitimate workers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our workforce <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/workforce/">authentication solution</a> eliminates the vulnerabilities of traditional passwords via passwordless, identity-backed biometrics. Built on a decentralized identity framework, it ensures secure, frictionless authentication of employees, contactors, and supply chain partners and, importantly, puts users in control of their own personal identifiable information. We also provide support for password reset and legacy 2FA/MFA to accommodate disparate IT environments built over decades.</p>
<p>Our solutions are built on the only platform certified to NIST 800-63-3, UK DIATF, FIDO2, and iBeta ISO/IEC 30107- standards with an SDK and standard APIs to avoid security exploits and prevent vendor lock. With collaborations like our partnership <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2025/01/unlocking-workforce-security-1kosmos-concentrix-expand-identity-backed-passwordless-mfa/">with Concentrix</a>, we help organizations enable workforce verification and authentication that transforms security, reduces costs, and enhances the user experience.</p>
 Khan-versation Starter: Looking Forward to What’s Next 
<p>In his LinkedIn post, Gartner’s Khan writes, “I’m super interested to see whether this takes hold in 2025,” adding,” I look forward to engaging with clients and vendors this year to see how this shapes up.” We couldn’t agree more—and we look forward to doing just that.</p>

<p>Educational institutions, such as universities, public schools, and entities issuing certification courses, face a growing need for secure, efficient identity verification systems that support a mobile-ready world. Ensuring that students, staff, and alumni have safe and convenient access to their credentials is essential, and in today’s world, having their credentials easily accessible on their phones is the experience they expect. Traditional paper-based documents, from diplomas to transcripts, can be cumbersome, prone to forgery, and slow to access and verify. These outdated processes create inefficiencies, increase administrative workloads, and open doors to credential fraud.</p><p>Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) offer a streamlined, tamper-proof solution that addresses these challenges head-on. By moving away from paper-based records to digital verifiable credentials, educational institutions can improve security, efficiency, and user experience. Read on to explore the top ten real-world applications of digital credentials in education and how SpruceID can partner with institutions to drive digital transformation.</p> Today’s Top 10 Real-World Applications <p>1. Digital Diplomas and Certificates: Traditional diplomas are susceptible to damage, loss, and fraud. With VDCs, students can access secure, verifiable digital diplomas that are easily shared with employers or graduate programs. This ensures authenticity while enabling institutions to reduce administrative burdens associated with paper records.</p><p>2. Transcripts and Academic Records: Transcripts often take weeks to process and are costly to manage. Digital credentials provide instant, secure access to academic records, allowing students to share their achievements with prospective employers or other institutions. VDCs streamline the verification process, making it more efficient and less prone to error.</p><p>3. Enrollment Verification: When students apply for discounts or benefits based on their enrollment status, paper verifications can slow down approval processes and increase the risk of fraud. VDCs enable instant, accurate verification of enrollment status, facilitating faster access to services such as health insurance, transportation, and housing.</p><p>4. Professional Certifications: Digital credentials can serve as verifiable proof of certification for students completing professional courses, simplifying the job application process. Employers gain confidence that candidates possess verified skills, reducing onboarding time and enhancing workforce quality.</p><p>5. Student ID Cards: Physical student IDs can be lost, stolen, or counterfeited, posing security risks on campuses. Digital student ID credentials streamline campus access—from libraries to dining halls and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to campus facilities. They can also be presented to businesses or services that offer benefits and discounts for enrolled students.</p><p>6. Continuing Education and Micro-Credentials: Lifelong learning is on the rise, and micro-credentials are increasingly important. VDCs allow institutions to issue verified micro-credentials and continuing education certificates, empowering individuals to build a verified portfolio of skills for career advancement.</p><p>7. Internship and Extracurricular Verifications: Internships and extracurricular involvement are valuable experiences, but verifying participation can be challenging with paper-based methods. Digital credentials can serve as verifiable records of participation using cryptographic technology that can’t be faked, simplifying the application process for further education or employment.</p><p>8. Financial Aid and Scholarship Eligibility:&nbsp;Applying for financial aid and scholarships often requires students to verify their identity and enrollment status, which can be a time-consuming process involving paperwork and manual checks. By integrating Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs)—such as mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) or digital student IDs—students can instantly confirm their identity and eligibility, expediting the verification process and reducing administrative delays. This streamlined approach can ensure faster access to student funding while improving security and trust in the application process.</p><p>9. Alumni Identity and Credentials: Educational institutions often manage records for alumni long after graduation. Digital credentials ensure alumni can easily access and share their academic records and certifications, providing value long after their time at the institution and allowing them to slowly transition out of university accounts.</p><p>10. International Student Verification: International students often need to verify their credentials across borders, which can be a slow and complicated process. VDCs enable fast, reliable verification for visas, immigration, and educational assessments, helping students navigate cross-border requirements efficiently.</p> SpruceID’s Solution <p>SpruceID partners with educational institutions and government workforce development councils to create a secure ecosystem of verifiable digital credentials that enhance trust, security, and efficiency. We are currently working with Colorado on skills-based hiring and digital learning records (LERs), aiming to create a future where skills, not just credentials, connect people to job opportunities while addressing workforce challenges.</p><p><a href="https://workshift.org/in-push-for-skills-based-hiring-colorado-invests-in-new-tech-and-a-new-language-of-learning/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn how SpruceID is supporting this vision as the chosen tech vendor</a> to help ColoradoFWD toward its goal of designing a multi-use digital wallet.</p><p>Our Credible platform supports a wide range of digital credentials, from diplomas to student IDs, utilizing cryptographic signatures to prevent tampering, unauthorized sharing, or fraudulent reproduction. With minimal data disclosure, students can confirm credentials with only essential information, keeping their personal details secure and in compliance with privacy standards. This approach reduces administrative bottlenecks and streamlines verifications, ultimately lowering costs related to physical records, printing, and mailing.</p> Shaping the Future of Digital Identity in Education <p>We believe the future of education will fully embrace verifiable digital credential solutions that integrate seamlessly with industry standards and foster collaboration across the sector. By adopting VDCs, institutions can protect students’ data, improve the services they provide, and reduce administrative burdens.</p><p>SpruceID is committed to helping institutions prepare for this digital transformation, working with universities, colleges, and other educational entities to implement scalable, interoperable solutions.

<p>Here’s our progress over the last two weeks:</p><p>Holochain Core, Runtimes &amp; Dev Tooling: Holochain 0.4.1 has moved from release-candidate to an official <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain?ref=blog.holochain.org">release</a>. This version has been integrated into the deployment runtime <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kangaroo-electron?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kangaroo</a>, the scaffolding tool has been updated to use it, and the Launcher update is in progress.&nbsp; We have positive reports from the field of people using the 0.4.1 release in their apps.</p><p>Networking: We are wrapping up the rewrite of our low-level networking modules: tx5 and Kitsune2. Tx5 implements the low-level p2p end-to-end encrypted WebRTC connections between peers, while Kitsune2 implements the layer on top of tx5 to store and sync data through gossip in distributed hash tables (DHTs) between the peers. The first versions of Kitsune2 crates have been published to <a href="https://crates.io/search?q=kitsune2&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">crates.io</a>! Our next steps are: </p><p>1) creating Wind Tunnel tests for Kitsune separate from Holochain, </p><p>2) writing a simple showcase kitsune-only p2p app for internal review, and </p><p>3) integrating the crates back into the Holochain codebase. </p><p>These next steps have been scoped, estimated and are underway.</p><p>Testing: It was quite fun to run through our current manual testing process on the first 0.4.1 release candidate, catch an error, have that fixed and run through the same test procedure successfully to then yield the green light for the full release. On the automated testing front, we’ve spun up our orchestration Nomad server, and hooking that up to Nomad-clients deployed to Holoports is well underway.</p><p>Dev Docs: We are continuing work to improve our developer documentation. Over the last two weeks we published <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Build Guides</a> on <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/dnas/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DNAs</a> &amp; <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/zomes/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Zomes</a>, next up are docs on hApps, validation and genesis self-check!</p><p>As always, the best place to really see the details behind the Dev Pulse is to look at Github’s Insights page for whichever repo you are most interested in. For example see <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pulse/monthly?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/pulse?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kitsune2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

 Navigating Compliance in Research 
<p>As research becomes increasingly data-driven, researchers must be cognizant of and abide by the complex regulatory landscape to ensure compliance with security, privacy, and ethical standards. Numerous regulations come into play depending on the nature of the research covering personal health information, controlled unclassified information, or sensitive electronic records.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is well documented that failure to comply with these regulations can lead to legal consequences, data breaches, and even reputational damage, making it crucial for researchers to understand and implement the necessary safeguards.</p>
<p><br></p>
 Key Regulatory Frameworks in Research 
<p>The regulatory landscape varies based on jurisdiction and the type of data. Some of the most critical frameworks that researchers may need to comply with include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>NIST 800-171,&nbsp;which went into effect on January 25, 2025, protects Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in non-federal systems and organizations by establishing stringent security requirements. This is particularly important for research funded by U.S. federal agencies.</p>
<p>21 CFR Part 11 regulates electronic records and electronic signatures in FDA-regulated research, ensuring digital documentation meets the same standards as traditional paper records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) mandates strict controls over healthcare data privacy and security for research that involves patient information. Researchers handling such data must ensure encryption, controlled access, and audit trails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PHIPA (Personal Health Information Protection Act, Ontario) applies to healthcare-related research in Ontario, ensuring that personal health information is handled with privacy and security.</p>
<p>PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, Canada) impacts private-sector research across Canada. It governs how personal information is collected, used, and shared. Research teams are required to obtain consent and ensure relevant data protection measures.</p>
<p>SOC 2 Type II&nbsp;is a voluntary, widely recognized standard for SaaS (Software as a Service) providers, ensuring that organizations handling sensitive data maintain strict security, availability, and confidentiality controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) provides an outlook on the best practices for managing cybersecurity risks, helping researchers strengthen their data security posture.</p>
<p><br></p>

 What Researchers Need to Do to Stay Compliant 
<p>With an excess of regulations to follow, we believe researchers must be proactive in adopting compliance best practices. Here are five ways we believe how.</p>
<p><br></p>
 
   <p>Identify Relevant Regulations&nbsp;– Compliance frameworks are project-specific. Researchers should assess the relevant regulations based on data type, funding sources, and jurisdiction.</p> 
   <p>Implement Security Controls&nbsp;– Encryption, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access will help ensure the protection of sensitive data.</p> 
   <p>Maintain Documentation &amp; Audit Trails&nbsp;– Compliance frameworks often require detailed records of data handling, access logs, and security measures.</p> 
   <p>Use Trusted Data Storage &amp; Collaboration Tools&nbsp;– Cloud-based platforms that comply with SOC 2, HIPAA, and NIST 800-171 can help researchers securely store and share data. Good RDM tools can substantially reduce the risks of non-compliance but researchers must still take responsibility for the methods and procedures designed to support their research.</p> 
   <p>Ensure Ethical Compliance&nbsp;– If human or animal participants are involved, securing Research Ethics Board (REB) approval is crucial to align with regulatory requirements.</p> 
 
<p><br></p>

 Is It Easier to Use SaaS Solutions for Compliance? 
<p>Managing multiple compliance requirements can be overwhelming. This is why many research teams rely on internal IT to support their research needs. However, this is often a cumbersome, inefficient, and error-prone approach.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Increasingly, many researchers are turning to SaaS solutions that integrate security, collaboration, and regulatory compliance into a single platform.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We believe a well-designed research management platform should provide secure data storage, maintain audit trails, and enable secure collaboration across teams while enabling access control and simplifying compliance with HIPAA, SOC 2, and NIST CSF frameworks.</p>
<p><br></p>
 Conclusion 
<p>At myLaminin, we understand that regulatory compliance can be a complex and time-consuming challenge for researchers. Our platform is designed to simplify this process by integrating robust security measures with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>myLaminin was designed and built with compliance in mind, with secure data management, and seamless collaboration features. Our platform reduces the administrative burdens associated with regulatory compliance while enhancing data integrity allowing researchers to focus on breakthroughs not bureaucracy leading to more discoveries and innovation.&nbsp;</p>

							  Bond Villain Vibes A-Brewing   <p>Last week’s largely advertorial edition, complete with some empty hot fluff, got the team and I thinking about how reactive we’ve been to the space lately. Whether actively engaging it or passively consuming it secondhand, we’ve primarily been responding to a larger conversation as it unfolds on the TradingView charts of livestream shit-shillers.</p>  <p>But we’re not just trying to respond to the conversation. We’re trying to shape it.</p>  <p>To that end, we want to get back to discussing utility in the space. Solana ETFs are poised to go mainstream, as is the broader blockchain. Users looking to transfer money on digital payment platforms are now seeing stablecoins as the top option. Why? Because they’re cheaper, not to mention more trustworthy, than the old rails. And I am certainly a free market, stablecoin maxi. Does that mean I’m looking to bring back the wildcat banks of old? No way. But I do prefer more issuers of stablecoins to less, and I don’t believe mechanisms like the FDIC incentivize the right behaviors from the banks they protect consumers from.</p>  <p>Why bring this up?</p>  <p>DOGE —&nbsp;and no, not the memecoin, which, on an unrelated note, I’d hodl given the ongoing and future relevancy of the task force — is currently digging through transactions across departments tied to the direction of the executive branch. There’s been no shortage of pushback to their scorched earth approach. But that has left little room for discussion of the potential opportunities it opens up.</p>  <p>Like, say, the promise of putting the federal budgetary dispersion on chain.</p>  <p>Benford’s law is an algorithm that’s easy to run, and the Department of Defense hasn’t passed an audit in decades. I would fully support monitoring the financial transaction of our tax dollars, as well as the accounts of public officials, via a secure and transparent blockchain ledger.</p>  <p>However, that’s with the important caveat that said monitoring does&nbsp;not&nbsp;extend to individual citizens. This rightful fear extends to the existing administration, which is happy to run a full-on blitz supporting the space, but with an ignorance so ironic that it risks ushering in the very surveillance state feared under a CBDC system.</p>  <p>In the hands of the current ruling class, it’s reasonable to believe any widespread blockchain adoption could quickly devolve into the worst centralized use case imaginable: digital identity systems. Trump, and the Republican party as a whole, have been very vocal about their disdain for inconsistent voter identification requirements, and with their crackdown on the immigration front, and past conversations around other ID systems, it’s hard to not picture any development on this front.</p>  <p>Real ID, the web2 version of you tokenizing your digital identity, becomes law for air travel this spring. Want to fly on a plane? Your birth certificate or passport need to be used in the issuance of your driver license, or state ID card. Not that scary in the grand scheme of things, but when paired with the forced face and biometric scanning that’s occurring at many boarding gates, the surveillance state seems to be expanding.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, “Scam” Altman and Trump just partnered on Project Stargate, where $500B of funding has been secured for a marginally more intelligent AI. Scam’s brute force approach to tackling this problem is pretty caveman to me. But when you consider he’s got the might of the US government, ChatGPT, and his crypto-based, digital ID system project WorldCoin brewing, it all starts to seem a little less neanderthal and a bit more Bond Villain.</p>  <p>TL;DR: Don’t call your Senators, just launch a stablecoin. The best resistance to chaos is to create your own order.</p>  <p>—El Prof</p>

							         Web3 DNA Ownership Goes Mainstream   <p>In the early days of direct-to-consumer DNA testing, companies like 23andMe and Ancestry.com built billion-dollar businesses by offering genetic insights — while quietly monetizing the most personal version of user data behind the scenes.</p>  <p>But now, a new wave of blockchain-powered health solutions is emerging, shifting control back to individuals.</p>  <p>Enter&nbsp;<a href="https://genobank.io/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=bond-villain-vibes">GenoBank.io</a>, a project that represents the natural evolution of personal genomics in a decentralized world. Unlike traditional DNA testing services, GenoBank.io enables patient-led genetic and health testing while ensuring compliance with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. This means individuals can own, control, and even monetize their genetic data — all without exposing their personal identity.</p>  <p>At its core, GenoBank.io is the first anonymous DNA test kit powered by blockchain. The project utilizes patent-pending LabNFTs to tokenize genomic data, allowing users to track and manage their DNA sequences without relying on a centralized entity. With this approach, GenoBank.io offers unprecedented privacy, security, and transparency. Instead of blindly submitting DNA samples to a corporation, individuals can:</p>    <p>Buy test results to detect early signs of disease.</p>  <p>Sell their genetic profile to research institutions or biotech firms.</p>  <p>Donate their data to accelerate scientific breakthroughs.</p>  <p>Track changes in their genetic sequence over time (epigenetics).</p>    <p>What would it look like if established healthcare brands and biotech firms embraced this model? Frankly, it could be the logical next step for an industry grappling with data privacy concerns.</p>  <p>Imagine if leading pharmaceutical companies adopted blockchain-powered DNA testing. Instead of collecting genetic data through opaque agreements, companies like Pfizer or Roche could incentivize patients with crypto rewards for voluntarily sharing anonymized data.</p>  <p>Alternatively, legacy healthcare brands struggling to regain public trust could use blockchain-based genomics to rebuild credibility. A company like 23andMe, for example, could introduce a Web3 model where users maintain full ownership of their genetic data — trading access on their own terms.</p>  <p>Even consumer-facing brands in the wellness industry could tap into this trend. Picture Nike launching NikeGenome, a tokenized DNA-based fitness program where users earn crypto rewards for achieving health milestones based on their genetic predisposition. (Far-fetched? Maybe. But this is the same web3 space that propelled $fartcoin to a larger market cap than ZipRecruiter so stranger things have happened.)</p>  <p>For this decentralized model to succeed, users need a secure and interoperable way to manage their DNA data — which is why GenoBank.io is integrating with MetaMask and other blockchain wallets. By following a few simple steps (like setting up a dedicated MetaMask profile and securing private keys), users can ensure only they control access to their biosamples. This approach not only safeguards against unauthorized data misuse but also creates a provable, tamper-proof record of consent for genetic research participation.</p>  <p>Beyond individual users, GenoBank.io is also revolutionizing DNA collection for laboratories and researchers worldwide. Through its B2B service, the platform provides:</p>    <p>Custom-branded DNA test kits for research institutions.</p>  <p>Warehousing and fulfillment solutions for large-scale studies.</p>  <p>Consent management tools that indemnify against data privacy claims.</p>  <p>Secure reverse logistics for handling biosample returns.</p>  <p>Integration with CLIA and non-CLIA diagnostic labs for advanced genetic testing.</p>    <p>Much like how memecoins disrupted finance, blockchain-powered DNA ownership has the potential to upend the genomic industry. By leveraging web3 principles, GenoBank.io is democratizing access to genetic insights, ensuring privacy, and empowering individuals to take control of their biodata.</p>  <p>The implications are massive:</p>    <p>Patients gain full autonomy over their genetic information.</p>  <p>Researchers get access to valuable genomic data through transparent, ethical agreements.</p>  <p>The entire healthcare industry moves toward a more decentralized and privacy-focused future.</p>    <p>In the end, it’s not just about protecting DNA data; it’s about redefining the relationship between individuals, technology, and medical science. The future of Web3 genomics is here — and it’s only getting started. Be there!</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

</p>  What is a Digital Signature? Secure Your Information with Encryption &amp; a 6-Step Signing Process  <p>2024/6/30</p>
     <br>


  <br>


      <br>
  <p>In the digital era, securing electronic documents and transactions is crucial to prevent fraud and unauthorized access. Digital signatures are cryptographic security measures that authenticate the identity of the signer and ensure the integrity of documents.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

  <br>
   I. What is a Digital Signature? Is it Legally Recognized?&nbsp; 
  <br>


  <br>


   A. Definition of a Digital Signature&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <br>
  <p>Digital Signature is an anti-counterfeiting method that can verify the authenticity of digital credentials such as electronic documents and electronic certificates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Article 2, Item 3 of Taiwan’s “<a href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=J0080037">Electronic Signatures Act</a>” by the Ministry of Digital Affairs, a “digital signature” refers to a type of electronic signature created using mathematical algorithms or other cryptographic methods to generate a specific length of digital data encrypted with the signatory’s private key. It can be verified using a public key and is supported by a certificate issued by a certification authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To simplify, the digital signature is a way of signing e-documents. It is encrypted with the “private key” that belongs to the document owner. When others receive a digitally signed document, they can use the ‘public key’ to verify the signature. If the verification is correct, it can prove that the original owner truly signed the document and that the contents have not been tampered with or forged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you see an e-document as an official printed letter, a digital signature is a seal that can prove the letter’s authenticity.&nbsp;</p>
  <br>


  <br>


   B. How Digital Signatures Work 
  <br>
  <p>There are 3 main functions of digital signature:&nbsp;</p>
  <br>


      <br>
   
 Ensure the identity of the signer: Digital signatures can authenticate the identity of the signer to ensure that the signer of an e-document is the actual owner or authorizer of the document.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Keep the security and integrity of document content: Digital signatures can maintain the integrity of e–document content and prevent it from being tampered with or omitted.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Avoid contract disputes: A legally valid digital signature can protect the rights and interests of both parties and prevent either party from repudiating the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
  <br>


  <br>


   C. 3 Key Legal Elements of a Digital Signature&nbsp; 
  <br>
  <p>To be legally valid, a digital signature must meet three criteria:&nbsp;</p>
  <br>


      <br>
   
 Verifiability – Must be issued by a recognized Certification Authority (CA).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Full Presentability – Must be readable and accessible in any format or device.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Mutual Agreement – Both parties must consent to digitally sign the document.&nbsp; 
 
  <br>

  <br>
   II. Digital vs. Electronic Signatures: What’s the Difference? 
  <br>
  <p>The most common way to sign a document is to sign it with a physical handwritten signature. However, paper documents are not only easily damaged and not conducive to archiving, but also have low security. Therefore, with the development of digital documents, handwritten signatures have gradually been transformed into electronic signatures and digital signatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital signature is a type of electronic signature, but the two have different meanings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The electronic signature covers a wide range, as long as it is in electronic form, i.e. the signatures generated through digitizing can be considered as electronic signatures. Common forms include text, images, symbols, etc. Scanned documents of handwritten signatures are also counted as electronic signatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital signatures refer specifically to the signature generated by encryption algorithm technology.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between digital and electronic signatures is security. Digital signatures use algorithms, encryption technology, and third-party certification authorities to enhance security and credibility, while electronic signatures lack the guarantee of these certificates.&nbsp;</p>

  <br>
   III. How Do Digital Signatures Work? Encryption &amp; Signing Process 
  <br>


  <br>


   A. Introduction to the principles of digital signature 
  <br>


  a. Encryption Methods: Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography     <br>
  <p>Digital signatures and digital documents are based on the same encryption principle, but the execution method is slightly different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital signature uses asymmetric cryptography to sign documents with a private key and verify signatures with a public key. Besides digital signature, asymmetric cryptography can also be applied to digital credentials, which encrypts the document with the public key (lock) and decrypts the document with the private key (unlock).&nbsp;</p>
 
 Symmetric Encryption: One lock matches one key. The key for encryption and decryption is the same. Thus, if you lock with key A, you can only open with key A.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Asymmetric Encryption: The key that encrypts and decrypts is not the same, but a pair of different public and private keys. Use public key A to lock, but use private key B to open. The private key is not publicly available, so it can be used to decrypt or sign files.&nbsp; 
 
  <br>


  b. RSA      <br>
  <p>RSA is one of the most widely used asymmetric encryption algorithms for digital signatures, secure email, and online banking. It was developed at MIT in 1977 and remains a critical security standard.&nbsp;</p>
  <br>


  <br>


   B. Step-by-Step Guide to Apply a Digital Signature 
  <br>


  a. How to Obtain &amp; Use a Digital Signature      <br>
  <p>Follow these six essential steps to securely sign digital documents:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  <br>


      <br>
  <p>STEP 1. Apply for a Digital Certificate from a Certification Authority (CA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 2. The CA confirms the applicant’s identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 3. Receive Your Private-Public Key Pair linked to your verified identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 4. Digitally Sign Documents using the private key.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 5. The CA issues the credential to the applicant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 6. Recipients confirm authenticity using the public key.&nbsp;</p>
  <br>


  b. Security Precautions for Digital Signatures     <br>
  <p>Even the most secure encryption methods are vulnerable to cyber threats. Here’s how to safeguard your digitally signed documents:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Use a trusted Certification Authority (CA) for issuing digital certificates.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Ensure public key &amp; identity binding to prevent unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Store private keys securely to prevent cyberattacks.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Verify signed documents before accepting them to avoid fraudulent transactions.&nbsp;

<p>Agentic AI is changing authentication faster than our identity models can keep up. We’ve built systems assuming users are human, but what happens when an AI agent, not the user, needs to authenticate on their behalf? Our current identity frameworks weren’t designed for this, and the gaps are starting to show.</p>



<p> Audio Blog</p>







<p>If you’ve read my earlier post, Are You Human? A Dive Into the Proof of Personhood Debate, you’ll notice some overlaps here. That post dove into the tricky questions around distinguishing humans from non-humans and explored some early efforts to tackle proof of personhood. This post extends that conversation by examining how agentic AI complicates the identity landscape further.</p>



<p>As if digital identity wasn’t confusing enough…</p>



 “Traditional” Federation Models 



<p>In federation models that assume a relying party (RP) and an identity provider (IdP), the process of authentication is kicked off by a user. From there, the RP and IdP have a lovely chat about what data is being requested (by the RP) and what data will be sent in response (by the IdP). These systems have served well in scenarios where it’s important to recognize the information may be about the user, but it does not belong to the user. (Example: a user’s affiliation with an organization is not something the user owns; it’s owned by the organization. The user should have control over releasing that information in most circumstances, but they do not own it.)</p>



<p>Enter agentic AI. What happens when an AI agent, not the user themselves, needs to authenticate?</p>



 
 Trust Boundaries: Can existing federation models extend trust to an agent acting autonomously on a user’s behalf? And if so, what ensures the agent’s actions align with the user’s intentions? 



 Granularity of Authorization: Federation models today operate on relatively coarse-grained permissions (e.g., scopes in OAuth). For agents, finer-grained controls may be necessary to specify “what” an agent can do. Those controls will also need to specify “when,” “where,” and “how.” 



 Auditing and Accountability: When an agent performs actions, how do we audit and attribute those actions to the user who authorized the agent, particularly if something goes wrong? 
 



 OAuth2 FTW! (Right?) 



<p>In some of my conversations with people deeply embedded in the authentication space, they suggest that OAuth2-based authentication should make this a non-issue. But I’m not too sure. While OAuth2 does provide a framework for delegation, where a user can grant an agent limited access to their resources, I’m not actually asking about the basic mechanics (but if you’d like to discuss those, this is an <a href="https://mayakaczorowski.com/blogs/ai-agent-authentication">interesting post</a> to start with). I’m asking about under what circumstances those mechanics can and should be used, and whether they actually solve for all the use cases.</p>



 OAuth2 Handles Delegation, But Not Autonomy 



<p>So, first, my understanding is that OAuth2 would allow a user to delegate access to an AI agent by issuing tokens with specific scopes and permissions. For example, a user could grant a personal assistant app access to their calendar or email. Brilliant! We need that. </p>



<p>However! OAuth2 assumes the agent is an extension of the user’s intent, not an autonomous actor. Agentic AI introduces the possibility that an AI might make independent decisions, adapt over time, or interact dynamically with other systems in ways that extend beyond the original scope of user intent. And before you say “that should never happen,” that horse is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-agents">leaving the barn</a> even as I type.</p>



<p>Here are some potential scenarios:</p>



 
 An AI-powered email assistant that autonomously schedules meetings and replies to clients—What happens if it books a flight without explicit user consent? 



 An AI stock trading bot that exceeds the user’s intended risk profile—Who is responsible? 



 A personal shopping assistant that buys items based on inferred preferences—What happens if it misunderstands intent? 
 



<p>Is it the user, the developer, or the service that may have manipulated the AI agent to behave in a particular way? </p>



 Granularity and Oversight 



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.108">OAuth2 tokens</a> typically grant access to resources but don’t provide detailed controls over how, when, or why those resources are accessed. So, in the use cases I’m worried about, an agent might need to send emails on your behalf but not at all times or for all recipients. As far as I know, OAuth2 has no native mechanism to enforce or audit such fine-grained boundaries.</p>



<p>For highly autonomous agents, a more nuanced authorization model is needed that could dynamically enforce user preferences or constraints as the agent operates.</p>



 Federated and Decentralized Contexts 



<p>In federated systems (systems that externalize their authentication and even authorization actions), introducing agentic AI complicates how trust is propagated across domains. <a href="https://oauth.net/2/scope/">OAuth2 scopes</a> might suffice in single-domain scenarios but fall short in multi-stakeholder environments.</p>



<p>In decentralized identity systems, such as those using verifiable credentials, the challenge extends to ensuring agents can securely act as verifiers or holders without compromising privacy or security. More on this in a bit.</p>



<p>While OAuth2 provides a solid foundation for today’s delegation needs, addressing agentic AI in authentication may require:</p>



 
 Enhanced granularity of scope to define not just what an agent can do, but how and when it can do it. 



 Dynamic consent and revocation mechanisms that allow users to adapt permissions as agents operate. 



 AI-specific identity standards, potentially building on OAuth2 or incorporating concepts like decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, to handle autonomous behavior. 
 



<p>So, yes, OAuth2 is excellent for handling simple delegation. ut agentic AI isn’t just about delegation. It makes independent decisions, adapts over time, and interacts unpredictably. Agentic AI introduces complexities around autonomy, accountability, and trust that stretch beyond the protocol’s original design. The question isn’t whether OAuth2 can delegate, it’s whether it can adapt to the nuanced and evolving behaviors of autonomous agents. (I both enjoyed and freaked out a bit with <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/01/17/lets-talk-about-ai-and-end-to-end-encryption/">this post</a> on AI and end-to-end encryption, which is another part of the discussion.)</p>



 Comparing and Contrasting

 Verifiable Credentials and Identity Wallets: Issuer, Verifier, and Holder 



<p>The identity wallet model, with its issuer, verifier, and holder, offers an alternative framework for authentication. These systems are often designed with decentralization and user control in mind. What’s not to love? The growing ecosystem of mobile driver’s licenses and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home">EU Digital Identity wallets</a> that live on browsers and devices suggests some interesting conversations when it comes to agentic AI. </p>



<p>To make sure we’re all on the same page, here are a few quick and simplified definitions for the entities involved in identity wallet issuance and verification. The concepts are similar to RP and IdP.</p>



 
 Issuer: Provides credentials (e.g., a verifiable credential) to the holder. 



 Holder: Stores and manages credentials, presenting them to verifiers when needed. 



 Verifier: Validates the presented credentials. 
 



 Agentic AI and VCs 



<p>This is a beautiful system when it applies to humans. When applied to agentic AI, however, I have questions:</p>



 
 Agent as Holder: If an AI agent acts as a credential holder, how does it securely store, manage, and present those credentials? How do we prevent misuse if the agent is compromised? Should an AI agent ever be a credential holder at all? 



 Delegation: Can an agent act as a delegated representative of the user, and how do we enforce boundaries? For example, could an agent be issued temporary credentials with limited scope and validity? Probably, though some systems might not allow agents for various security and privacy reasons. 



 Selective Disclosure: Identity wallet models often emphasize privacy through selective disclosure, such as revealing only a user’s age without exposing their birthdate. How might agents balance this with their need to automate tasks efficiently? It’s like a self-driving car; it’s a self-managing agent. 
 



<p>The wallet model seems to offer more flexibility for agentic AI than “traditional” federation models, but it introduces a new layer of complexity. It has to ensure the AI agent’s autonomy doesn’t come at the cost of security or user control.</p>



 Glimmers of Direction 



<p>It’s no fun asking all these questions without having associated answers. Regardless, I suspect work is underway (or will be soon) in a few areas:</p>



 
 Delegated Trust Models: Expanding on existing delegation mechanisms to allow users to grant agents fine-grained, revocable permissions. 



 AI-Aware Standards: Developing new identity standards that explicitly account for agentic AI, whether by enhancing federation protocols or building on the identity wallet paradigm. 



 Contextual Authentication: Leveraging contextual signals—such as behavioral patterns, location, or task context—to authenticate agents dynamically. 



 Reputational Systems: Having people and systems “vote” on whether something is a person or a bot. I cringe a bit about the potential liability involved here, but the idea is definitely receiving some attention. 
 



<p>Ultimately, the questions of “if,” “how,” and “when” agentic AI and authentication will align are as much about societal and regulatory readiness as they are about technical feasibility. The opportunities are immense, but so are the challenges.</p>



<p>The identity industry has spent decades building systems for human authentication. Agentic AI changes the game. If we don’t rethink our identity models now, we’ll be retrofitting yesterday’s solutions onto tomorrow’s problems—and I’d rather avoid that headache. If you’re working in this space, let’s talk at IIW, EIC, or Identiverse!</p>

<p>Fraud prevention has historically been perceived as a trade-off between robust security and a seamless customer journey. However, as fraud tactics have evolved over the years, so too have prevention and detection strategies, proving that security and smooth customer experiences can coexist. However, recent technology advancements have shifted this narrative. Is it still possible for increased security and low-friction customer experiences to compliment each other in our current age of artificial intelligence (AI) and deepfakes? In today’s interconnected digital economy, does fraud prevention still equate to intrusive verifications, login frustrations, and <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication.html">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> fatigue?

 So, you’ve decided to enter the Brazilian gaming market? Here’s everything you need to know to remain compliant, fight fraud and offer a frictionless customer experience. 



 



<p>So, it’s finally happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After years of ‘Will they, won’t they?’, the Brazilian powers that be have finally managed to agree on how its sports betting and online gaming market should be regulated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that for the first time ever, Brazilian operators can serve Brazilian players, capitalizing on the country’s huge customer base and generating millions of tax revenue in the process. Brazilian players, meanwhile, can now use Brazilian platforms, benefiting from the local language and accessibility options that a local platform offers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is great news as before January 1, 2025, players had to either use black market platforms or international ones; neither of which were ideal for providing sufficient consumer protections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the dangers of using black market gambling platforms in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/">‘Before Brazilian regulation: The dangers of gambling without KYC.’</a></p>



<p>Of course, as Brazil is such a new market, complete with new regulatory requirements, there are certain <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/latam-gambling-operators-compliance-challenges/">compliance challenges operators need to be aware of</a> and important considerations to factor in before launching.</p>

 How to offer completely compliant gaming experiences in Brazil. 



<p>Being compliant and adhering to regulatory requirements not only protects a business from potential anti-money laundering (AML) and social responsibility fines but also from reputational harm. Each year, <a href="https://gamblingindustrynews.com/gambling-industry-fines/#1704844800">hundreds of millions in fines</a> are levied against gaming operators and although there haven’t been any fines against a Brazilian operator yet, it is surely only a matter of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, according to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-lawyer-neil-montgomery-gambling-fines/">Neil Montgomery</a>, a lawyer that operates in Brazil, there is no doubt that Brazilian operators will soon find themselves on the receiving end of fines and even civil cases due to the country’s litigious culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Disgruntled consumers will now have a local door to knock on and use the Brazilian courts to obtain favourable awards. Brazilian courts will look at sports betting and iGaming operators as wealthy companies and an expectation for companies to compensate damages costs to consumers,” said Neil Montgomery, founder of Brazilian law firm, Montgomery &amp; Associados.</p>



<p>Working with an identity verification provider with regulatory expertise and deep knowledge of the market ensures operators can navigate the complexities of Brazilian legislation and regulation with ease; safe in the knowledge they’re offering completely compliant player experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more information on Brazil’s newly regulated sports betting and online gambling market, read our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">‘Everything you need to know about online gambling in Brazil’.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>As experienced providers of KYC and identity verification solutions for the gaming industry, IDnow has customers from around the world using IDnow to offer all manner of compliant use cases, from new account openings and age verifications to affordability checks and deposit withdrawals, and everything in-between.</p>



<p>Working with companies operating globally has equipped us with a deep knowledge of different regulatory environments, along with every nuance of their customer onboarding processes, every document or data point required to be processed and every product innovation and functionality that could make the customer experience more inclusive, intuitive and, of course, compliant.</p>

 7 steps for compliant customer onboarding in Brazil. 



<p>A robust customer onboarding experience for a Brazilian gaming platform should restrict fraudsters and underage or ineligible users from opening accounts, while protecting genuine players from fraud and potentially saving the company millions in AML fines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to offer an end-to-end compliant player registration and verification process in seven steps:</p>



  CPF Validation: In Brazil, every citizen is issued a unique <a href="https://blog.remitly.com/finance/brazilian-cpf/">Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas (CPF) number</a>, which is used for tax purposes. When cross-checked against the national CPF database, the numbers can be used to verify the identity of players during onboarding.  



  Checking against restrictive lists: You know the saying: one rotten Brazilian apple spoils the whole Brazilian barrel (or something like that). Offering a safe and secure gaming experience requires operators to be assured that every single one of their players are entitled to be there, which is why the second important step in the player registration and verification process should be to check applicants’ identities against multiple official restrictive betting lists (lists containing those who could jeopardize results of sporting events, e.g.: athletes or managers).&nbsp;  



  PEPs and Sanctions: Like the second step, checking against PEPs and Sanctions lists is essential to assess and effectively mitigate the associated risks of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and sanctioned individuals.&nbsp;  



  Document verification: When combined with CPF validation, document verification enables operators to cross-check and verify identity data with other forms. It’s also important to be able to process a variety of different document types, especially in Brazil, where different provinces often have different identity formats and types. The three most common documents that operators should be able to check and verify in Brazil as per the regulation are:<br><br>1. Brazilian passport&nbsp;<br>2. Carteira de Identidade (RG) (National identity card)&nbsp;<br>3. Carteira Nacional de Habilitacao (National driving license)&nbsp;  



  Advanced fraud detection: Fraud detection technology can provide an additional barrier by protecting against various fraud attacks. For example, our seamless advanced fraud detection technology flags whenever a forged document is submitted and can verify whether prospective players are real through liveness checks – all without adversely impacting the user journey. Such checks can help prevent common and emerging fraud types like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/synthetic-identity-fraud/">synthetic identity theft</a>.&nbsp;  



  Biometric enrolment: The penultimate step in our player registration and verification process records players’ biometric information, including facial images to facilitate future smoother player authentication.&nbsp;  



  Optional manual review: At this stage, the player has registered and verified their identity and are able to start playing. However, for additional security, operators can also choose to perform a manual review of submitted documents and biometrics for additional peace of mind, especially for high-risk individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



 Customized consistency. 



<p>While knowing what needs to be done to create a compliant onboarding process is clearly important, perhaps what is even more important is how it is done and what the user experience of doing it is like. After all, if the customer experience is too complicated then customers will seek out a competitor that does offer an intuitive process or worse still, revert to the black market to platforms that are less concerned with KYC or robust identity verification processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, customer abandonment isn’t something specific to the gambling industry. In fact, 90% of companies said they lose customers during the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221115005637/en/90-of-companies-lose-potential-customers-during-the-digital-onboarding-process-according-to-ABBYY-State-of-Intelligent-Automation-Report-Q4-2022">digital onboarding process</a>, with the top three reasons for drop-offs including:&nbsp;</p>



  Too long processes (29%)&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Identity proofing and affirmation pain points (26%)&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Too many manual steps (26%)  



<p>At IDnow, we are committed to delivering cutting-edge identity verification solutions that address the specific needs of our customers and their end users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, when we discovered that most Brazilians tended to keep their identity cards in plastic sleeves, we amended our onboarding instructions in the user interface. By including culturally tailored&nbsp;instructions, such as requesting the removal of IDs from plastic sleeves, we ensured users could complete document capture with ease. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to bear in mind that while compliance and regulatory requirements may differ by country, operators must offer a consistently positive user experience, regardless of the market or the regulatory requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply put, the user experience needs to be as seamless as it is secure, which has benefits for both the operator and ultimately the customer.</p>



 Integrate seamlessly, with IDnow. 



<p>Managing multiple point solutions (e.g. biometrics or documents) across different service providers not only creates inefficiencies and complexities in identity verification processes, but it can also make integration difficult, especially if journeys need to be adapted to regulatory changes or to detect and mitigate new risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our modular and scalable orchestration hub has been designed to reduce technical complexity and enable global operators to balance strict KYC/AML requirements with seamless UX. What’s more, any third-party KYC and compliance service can be easily added to IDnow making it easy to manage in one integration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tailored for Brazil’s regulations and localized needs, IDnow simplifies identity verification and compliance with a plug-and-play solution, allowing users to access data, document and biometric verification through a single, unified integration point.</p>



<blockquote><p>As regulations, data and document types, and ultimately customer requirements differ per region, there is a huge advantage in choosing an identity verification provider that can be tailored to a specific country’s risk and KYC needs.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, VP of Global Gaming at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>“Being able to offer a holistic approach to identity verification that can combine compliance services, including IDV, biometric authentication and data verification to meet any country’s requirements will very quickly become a necessity,” Roger added.</p>

<p>Imagine discovering that a loan was approved in your name without your knowledge. That’s how identity crimes begin. Fraud doesn’t start with stolen money, it starts with stolen or forged identities. Businesses often focus their fraud prevention efforts on financial losses, but by then, the damage is already done and personal information has already been compromised. To effectively combat fraud, organizations must address threats earlier in the lifecycle, when identity crimes such as phishing, credential and identity theft, and synthetic identity creation take place​​. By recognizing identity crimes as the foundation of fraud, businesses can proactively disrupt these attacks before they lead to financial or reputational harm​.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Myth That Fraud Happens at the Moment of&nbsp;Loss 
<p>For many, fraud seems to begin when money or goods are stolen. It's easy to see why - the most visible impact of fraud is financial loss. This focus often leads organizations to invest heavily in transactional fraud detection systems, believing that stopping unauthorized transactions is the key to stopping fraudulent activities​​.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truth is, financial loss is merely the final chapter in a longer story of identity crimes. Fraudsters rely on stolen identities, synthetic profiles, and breached credentials to set the stage for their schemes. By the time money changes hands, the groundwork has already been laid through compromised identity or unauthorized access. Addressing fraud earlier, like during account creation or login, is far more effective than reacting to suspicious transactions later​.</p>

 What Are Celebrity Meme Coins? 



<p>In simple terms, celebrity meme coins are digital currencies either created or endorsed by well-known celebrities. Unlike more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, these coins usually don’t offer much in terms of technical utility. Instead, their value largely comes from the celebrity behind them and the hype they generate. These coins can experience huge price jumps, often fueled by the celebrity’s popularity and their massive social media following.</p>



<p>Many celebrity meme coins are designed to be fun and lighthearted, drawing inspiration from pop culture, internet memes, or iconic moments from the celebrity’s career. Their value tends to fluctuate based on the buzz surrounding their launch and the ongoing promotion from the celebrity or their team.</p>

 Celebrity Meme Coins List: Top 5 Coins You Need to Know About 



<p>Here’s a closer look at some of the most popular celebrity meme coins that are making waves in the market today. These coins have garnered attention due to their celebrity backing, viral potential, and exciting price movements. Let’s dive into the details of the top 5 celebrity meme coins currently circulating:</p>



 $Jenner (Caitlyn Jenner) 



 
 Price: $0.0001 



 Market Cap: $46M (Peak) 
 



<p>Launched with a bang, $Jenner took off when Caitlyn Jenner promoted it alongside a famous image with Donald Trump. It saw a huge spike initially, reaching a peak market cap of $46 million. However, it quickly dropped by over 65%, showing the volatile nature of meme coins. Even with this significant dip, $Jenner remains one of the most talked-about celebrity meme coins, thanks to its massive media attention and celebrity backing. The coin was part of a larger trend where several celebrities launched their tokens on the Pump.fun platform.</p>



 $Trump (Donald Trump) 



 
 Price: $0.0001 



 Market Cap: $35M (Peak) 
 



<p>$Trump soared in popularity thanks to Donald Trump’s resurgence in the media and his loyal fanbase. The coin reached a market cap of $35 million, heavily supported by his political followers. Despite criticisms from some who saw it as a gimmick, the coin saw impressive growth, especially around Trump’s campaign comeback. It continues to generate interest, especially during political events and media coverage.</p>



 $Elon (Elon Musk) 



 
 Price: $0.145 



 Market Cap: $1.2B 
 



<p>Without a doubt, $Elon is the most well-known celebrity meme coin, largely because of the massive influence of Elon Musk. Whenever Musk tweets or mentions anything about crypto, especially $Elon, the coin sees an instant surge in interest. With peaks reaching up to a billion-dollar market cap, $Elon is seen as a potential rival to Dogecoin. Its strong following and Musk’s continued influence make it a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts, cementing it as a significant player in the meme coin space.</p>



 $Mother (Iggy Azalea) 



 
 Price: $0.0018 



 Market Cap: $10M (Peak) 
 



<p>$Mother, the meme coin backed by rapper Iggy Azalea, launched with a lot of buzz. While it hasn’t experienced the same explosive growth as $Elon, it remains a steady player in the celebrity meme coin market. Its market value has fluctuated as the initial excitement wore off, but $Mother continues to appeal to Azalea’s fanbase and meme coin collectors. It’s a good example of how celebrity-backed tokens can maintain interest despite the rollercoaster ride.</p>



 $Kekius (Kekius Maximus) 



 
 Price: $0.02197 



 Market Cap: $22M 
 



<p>While $Kekius may be lesser-known than some of the other meme coins, it has found its niche within smaller crypto communities. With a more modest market cap, $Kekius has gained traction due to its dedicated followers and steady growth. This coin has become one of the hottest new meme coins to keep an eye on, with its loyal fanbase keeping the momentum going in the crypto space.</p>


 
 


 Why Are Celebrity Meme Coins So Popular? 



<p>Celebrity meme coins have taken off recently, and it’s easy to see why. Here are a few key reasons behind their growing popularity:</p>



 
 Celebrity Power: Celebrities are more than just famous figures; they’re also massive influencers. From Caitlyn Jenner to Elon Musk and even Iggy Azalea, these stars bring huge followings with them. When they back a meme coin, their fans often rush to get involved, driving up demand and boosting prices. 



 Viral Power of Social Media: Celebrities are experts at leveraging social media to create instant buzz. Platforms like Twitter and Instagram allow them to easily share their new coin launches, sparking viral interest. This quick spread of information often leads to dramatic price spikes as more and more people jump on board. 



 Fun and Engaging: Let’s face it—meme coins are fun! They’re often based on pop culture references or memes, making them easy to understand and relatable. Even those who aren’t crypto experts can enjoy the lighthearted side of meme coins. This fun factor attracts people who want to be part of the latest trend, not just make an investment. 



 Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): As celebrity meme coins grow in popularity, FOMO kicks in. People see others making a quick profit, and the fear of missing out pushes them to get in on the action, sometimes even before fully understanding the risks. This rush of new investors adds to the excitement and can further drive prices up. 
 



 Risks and Scams in Celebrity Meme Coins 



<p>Celebrity meme coins are fun and exciting, but they also come with some serious risks. Let’s break down the main concerns:</p>



 
 Volatility<br>Meme coins can shoot up in value one day and crash the next. It’s all about the hype. Take $Jenner for example: it hit a market cap of $46 million but dropped by 65% after the initial excitement wore off. This kind of roller coaster is typical for meme coins, so be prepared for major ups and downs if you’re thinking about investing. 



 <a href="https://blog.herond.org/pump-and-dump-in-cryptocurrency-a-growing-threat-in-the-digital-asset-market/">Pump and Dump Schemes<br></a>Some meme coins get inflated by hype, and then insiders sell off their coins when the price is high, leaving regular investors holding the bag. This is called a “pump and dump.” $Jenner faced this exact situation: its price spiked, but then the value collapsed after major holders sold off their coins. 



 Lack of Regulation<br>Many celebrity meme coins are new, and there’s not much regulation around them. This makes them more vulnerable to scams. Without proper rules in place, it’s easier for shady activities to go unnoticed, and that can lead to huge losses for unsuspecting investors. 



 Short-Lived Hype<br>Meme coins often get attention because of a viral moment or celebrity endorsement. But once the hype dies down, the coin can lose value quickly. Remember, these coins might seem like a great investment now, but they can fade just as fast as they rose.

 The Future of Celebrity Meme Coins 



<p>Where are celebrity meme coins headed? Here’s what you should keep in mind about their future:</p>



 
 Celebrity Influence<br>Celebrities play a huge role in the success of these coins. If they keep promoting the coin, it might do well. But if they lose interest or the celebrity’s public image changes, the value can fall off a cliff. $Jenner and $Trump have seen big gains thanks to celebrity involvement, but how long will that last? 



 Social Media Trends<br>Social media drives meme coin success. When a celebrity shares their coin on Twitter or Instagram, it can spark a huge surge in interest. However, if the trend shifts or people lose interest, the coin can quickly lose value. It’s all about timing, and trends can change fast. 



 Regulations<br>Governments are still figuring out how to deal with meme coins. If countries decide to regulate or even ban them, it could affect their value. So, if you’re thinking about investing in these coins, it’s important to stay up to date on any changes in regulation that could impact the market. 
 



 Which Meme Coin Might Hit $1 by 2025? 



<p>It’s hard to say for sure, but looking at the current trends and celebrity influence, $Elon and $Trump are the most likely meme coins to reach $1 by 2025. Their backing by some of the biggest names in the world gives them a special edge in the market. That said, meme coins are notorious for their wild volatility, and with their unpredictable nature, we can’t really know which of these coins will stand the test of time. Only time will tell which ones will thrive and keep growing in value.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Celebrity meme coins have taken the cryptocurrency world by storm, blending fun, pop culture, and investment opportunities into one exciting package. While they offer intriguing potential, especially with big names like Elon Musk and Donald Trump backing them, they come with inherent risks, including volatility, pump-and-dump schemes, and short-lived trends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an investor, it’s important to stay informed, be cautious, and understand that celebrity-backed hype can be fleeting. If you’re looking to get involved in celebrity meme coins, take the time to do your research and be prepared for the ups and downs that come with this wild and unpredictable market.</p>

But understanding these fees and knowing how to manage them can save you a lot of money in the long run. Whether you’re dealing with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency, there are several ways to reduce these costs. In this blog, we’ll explore what crypto transaction fees are, the factors that influence them, and provide you with actionable tips on how to save crypto transaction fee.</p>

 What Are Crypto Transaction Fees? 



<p>Crypto transaction fees are the costs you pay when transferring digital currencies. These fees go to miners or validators who verify and record transactions on the blockchain. The fee amount can vary based on factors like the cryptocurrency used, network congestion, and how quickly you need the transaction to be processed.</p>



<p>For example, Bitcoin fees can spike during high traffic, while smaller coins may have lower fees but offer less security. Understanding these fees helps you manage costs when sending or receiving crypto.</p>

 4 Popular Types of Crypto Transaction Fees 



<p>Crypto transactions come with several types of fees, and understanding them can help you save money. Here’s a quick breakdown:</p>



 1. Network Fees 



<p>These are fees paid to miners or validators for processing transactions on the blockchain. The amount varies based on network congestion – the busier the network, the higher the fees. To save on this, it’s best to avoid trading during peak times.</p>



 2. Exchange Fees 



<p>Platforms like Coinbase or Binance charge fees for buying or selling crypto. These fees can vary depending on your trading volume. Many exchanges offer lower fees for higher trading volumes, so if you’re a frequent trader, you might pay less.</p>



 3. Deposit and Withdrawal Fees 



<p>These fees are charged when transferring funds to or from an exchange. Some platforms offer free deposits, but withdrawals can come with fees that vary based on the crypto and platform. Always check before moving your funds.</p>



 4. Maker and Taker Fees 



<p>On exchanges, “makers” are those who add liquidity by placing limit orders, while “takers” are those who execute market orders, taking liquidity. Maker fees are typically lower than taker fees, so if you want to save, it’s good to place limit orders and wait for them to be filled.</p>


 
 


 4 Factors That Influence Crypto Transaction Fees 



<p>Several factors can drive up or lower the cost of your crypto transactions. Let’s take a quick look at what influences these fees:</p>



 
 Network Congestion: When many people are trying to make transactions at the same time, it creates congestion. This high demand leads to increased fees, especially during peak times. Think of it like rush hour traffic; everyone is trying to get through at once. 



 Transaction Size: Larger transactions require more processing power, and as a result, they often incur higher fees. The more complex the transaction, the more it costs to validate and record it on the blockchain. 



 Blockchain Type: Different cryptocurrencies have different fee structures. For example, Bitcoin tends to have higher network fees due to its large user base and complex network. In contrast, other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin or Stellar are designed to have lower fees. 



 Exchange Policies: Each crypto exchange has its own fee structure. Some may charge a flat fee, while others use tiered pricing based on your trading volume. It’s important to compare exchanges to find the best deal for your needs. 
 


 
 


 5 Tips On How To Reduce Bitcoin Transaction Fees 



<p>If you’re looking to minimize Bitcoin transaction fees, here are some practical steps that can make a big difference:</p>



 
 Choose the Right Time: Bitcoin transaction fees tend to increase during times of high network congestion. This happens when more people are trying to make transactions at the same time. To avoid this, try to make your transaction during quieter times, such as early in the morning or late at night when fewer people are active on the network.<br> 



 Use SegWit Addresses: Bitcoin transactions can be sent using SegWit (Segregated Witness) addresses. These addresses allow for more efficient transactions by reducing the size of each transaction, which leads to lower fees. If your wallet supports SegWit, make sure you use these addresses for cheaper transactions.<br> 



 Consolidate Transactions: Instead of sending multiple small transactions, consolidate them into one larger transaction. When you make several small payments, each one requires its own fee. By grouping smaller transactions together, you can significantly reduce the total amount you pay in fees.<br> 



 Select Low-Fee Networks: Not all blockchains have the same transaction fees. While Bitcoin can be costly during busy periods, other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin or Stellar offer much lower fees. If your transaction can be done on one of these networks, it may be worth considering to save on costs.<br> 



 Leverage Off-Peak Hours: Performing transactions when fewer people are using the Bitcoin network can help lower the fees. During off-peak hours (for example, weekends or early mornings), the network is less congested, which means your transaction will be processed at a lower cost.

 How To Save Crypto Transaction Fee 



<p>When trading or transferring crypto, these strategies can help you save crypto transaction fee:</p>



 
 Limit Orders: Instead of using market orders that execute immediately at the current price, use limit orders. Limit orders allow you to set the price at which you’re willing to buy or sell a coin, which can reduce trading fees. Market orders often incur higher fees due to immediate execution, whereas limit orders give you more control over your costs.<br> 



 Utilize Exchange Tokens: Many exchanges, like Binance with its native token BNB, offer discounts on trading fees if you use their platform’s tokens. Holding and using these tokens for fees can save you a significant amount, especially if you trade frequently.<br> 



 Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): DEXs, such as Uniswap or PancakeSwap, typically have lower fees compared to centralized exchanges. This is because they don’t require an intermediary, and the fee structure is often simpler. If you’re okay with slightly more technical setups, DEXs can be a great way to save money on transaction costs.<br> 



 Consider Layer 2 Solutions: For Bitcoin, using Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network can drastically reduce transaction fees. These networks work by handling transactions off-chain and then settling them on the main blockchain later, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. If you frequently send Bitcoin or other supported cryptocurrencies, exploring Layer 2 could be a game-changer for reducing fees. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Saving on crypto transaction fees is essential for maximizing your profits and minimizing unnecessary expenses. By understanding the different types of fees, such as network fees and exchange fees, and using strategies like selecting the right time for transactions or opting for decentralized exchanges, you can significantly reduce your costs. It’s all about being smart with your crypto transactions, and with these tips, you’ll be able to save crypto transaction fee and trade more efficiently.</p>

<p>Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract platform designed to provide fast, secure, and low-cost transactions for a variety of applications1. Developed by Mysten Labs, a team of former Meta engineers, Sui aims to address the scalability limitations of existing blockchains while offering a user-friendly experience for both developers and users2. This report delves into the core components of the Sui blockchain, exploring its architecture, tokenomics, ecosystem, and future plans. It is the first blockchain built for internet scale, enabling fast, scalable, and low-latency transactions3. Sui was designed to solve some of the problems around web34. In addition to its focus on speed and scalability, Sui is also designed with social interactions and Web3 experiences in mind5.</p>
 Mysten Labs 
<p>Mysten Labs is building critical infrastructure to enable a more decentralized internet6. The company was founded in 2021 by former engineers from Meta's Diem blockchain initiative2. Mysten Labs has secured the backing of multiple prominent investors, including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), FTX Ventures, Jump Crypto, Binance Labs, and Coinbase Ventures2.</p>
 Sui's Architecture and Consensus Mechanism 
<p>Sui distinguishes itself through its unique object-centric data model. Unlike traditional blockchains that revolve around accounts, Sui treats all on-chain data as objects with unique identifiers and ownership properties1. This model enables parallel transaction processing, significantly enhancing scalability and efficiency1. Each object in Sui maintains its state and versioning. When an object is modified, a new version is created while retaining the previous versions for transparency and traceability8.</p>
<p>Sui's architecture allows for the management of multiple network states simultaneously while ensuring that the final state is consistent across transactions9. This minimizes conflicts, enabling smooth and effective parallel execution9. Sui also has a flexible storage design that enables users to record and delete objects created as a result of running a transaction10. Users pay only for the actually used storage space, which is perfectly optimized10.</p>
<p>Sui employs a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, where token holders delegate their SUI tokens to validators who are responsible for verifying and processing transactions1. This approach allows for faster consensus and lower latency compared to traditional Proof-of-Work systems11. The Sui consensus engine, Mysticeti, builds upon the Narwhal and Bullshark consensus algorithms. Narwhal acts as a mempool, ensuring efficient transaction batching, while Bullshark handles the sequencing of transactions within a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure2. This combination enables Sui to achieve high throughput and sub-second transaction finality7. After finality is reached, a checkpointing protocol produces a causal history of all transactions in the system12. This is used for complete audits, as well as to keep Full nodes and lagging validators synchronized efficiently12.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Sui does have blocks, referred to as "checkpoints", which are contained within epochs10. The blockchain's current status and parameters can be accessed on the Suiscan homepage, Chain Info Parameter page, and Staking Parameter page10.</p>
 Sui Move Programming Language 
<p>Sui utilizes the Move programming language, originally developed for Meta's Diem project13. Move is designed to be secure and efficient, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities in smart contracts13. Its resource-oriented approach prevents issues like asset duplication or unintended loss, making it well-suited for financial transactions and NFTs2. Sui also uses the Move Prover, which allows developers to verify that their code executes as intended1.</p>
<p>Sui Move introduces several key differences compared to its implementation in other blockchains:</p>
 
 
<p>Sui uses its own object-centric global storage.</p>
 
 
<p>Addresses represent Object IDs.</p>
 
 
<p>Sui objects have globally unique IDs.</p>
 
 
<p>Sui has module initializers.</p>
 
 
<p>Sui entry points take object references as input14.</p>
 
 
 Sui Lutris Protocol 
<p>Sui Lutris is the distributed system protocol that powers Sui, allowing it to achieve very low latency alongside high-throughput and long-term stability12. Sui Lutris combines DAG-based consensus with consensus-less approaches to achieve sub-second latencies and sustained throughput of thousands of transactions per second12.</p>
<p>Sui Lutris relies only on consensus to process complex smart contracts that operate on shared objects, that is objects that any user can mutate12. Sui Lutris also supports network maintenance operations, such as defining checkpoints and reconfiguring validators12.</p>
 Key Features and Advantages 
<p>Sui offers several key features and advantages that contribute to its growing popularity:</p>
 
 
<p>High Performance and Scalability: Sui's parallel execution model and optimized consensus mechanism enable it to handle a high volume of transactions with low latency13. Sui's take on parallel transaction processing is one of its most innovative technologies15. Tests have shown Sui achieving up to 297,000 transactions per second (TPS)15. In fact, Sui recently processed 65.8 million transactions in a single day, setting the record for most transactions recorded on any blockchain in a 24-hour period16.</p>
 
 
<p>Enhanced Security: The Move programming language and Sui's object-centric model enhance security by reducing vulnerabilities and limiting attack vectors15. Many errors in application design are rejected by Sui's software and are impossible due to Sui's application guardrails17. Sui's DPoS mechanism ensures that validators are incentivized to act in the network's best interest15.</p>
 
 
<p>Low Transaction Fees: Sui's efficient architecture and Storage Fund mechanism contribute to low transaction fees, making it cost-effective for users13.</p>
 
 
<p>Developer-Friendly Environment: The Move programming language and Sui's comprehensive documentation provide a user-friendly environment for developers to build and deploy decentralized applications13.</p>
 
 
<p>Improved User Experience: Features like zkLogin allow users to interact with dApps using familiar web credentials, simplifying the onboarding process and enhancing user experience18.</p>
 
 
<p>Cross-Blockchain Compatibility: Sui's interoperability features allow for seamless interaction with other blockchains19. This expands Sui's reach beyond its own ecosystem and allows for greater flexibility in how assets can be used and traded19.</p>
 
 
<p>Network Capacity: Sui's network capacity expands to meet demand, growing with businesses, not against them20.</p>
 
 
 SUI Tokenomics 
<p>SUI is the native token of the Sui blockchain. It has a fixed total supply of 10 billion tokens11. This is the total number of SUI that can ever be minted, but the total supply is not available for transactions11. SUI serves several key functions within the Sui ecosystem:</p>
 
 
<p>Staking: Users can stake SUI to participate in the DPoS consensus mechanism and earn rewards11. Sui's PoS system is more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems8.</p>
 
 
<p>Gas Fees: SUI is used to pay for gas fees required to execute transactions and other operations on the network11. Sui's gas-pricing mechanism achieves the triple outcomes of delivering users with low, predictable transaction fees to optimize their transaction processing operations and prevent denial-of-service attacks21.</p>
 
 
<p>Governance: SUI holders can participate in on-chain governance by voting on protocol upgrades and other key decisions11.</p>

However, as technology becomes more focused toward round-the-clock production, the modern workplace increasingly presents dilemmas that pit people’s roles, values, and desires against each other.</p><p>This rising tide of inner conflict isn't surprising.

These conflicts manifest as tension between what we think we should do and what we want to do, creating moral dilemmas that challenge our self-awareness. This differs from external conflict, where we battle external forces like circumstances or other people.</p><p>Writers often use various types of internal conflict to drive character arcs. Writing tips from skilled authors remind us that the most compelling stories feature characters whose internal struggles mirror our own experiences with personal growth. In our own character development, we might face similar conflicts. </p><p>A classic example is the struggle between career advancement and work-life balance—like a professional weighing whether to take a higher-paying job that requires more time away from loved ones. Here, the character's internal conflict (ambition versus personal values) often intertwines with external forces (workplace demands versus family needs).</p><p>The different types of internal conflict we face include:</p>  <p>Moral conflict between competing ethical principles</p>  <p>Self-doubt about our abilities or choices</p>  <p>Cognitive dissonance between beliefs and actions</p>  <p>Personal growth challenges that test our self-image</p>  <p>Examples of internal conflict in professional settings often mirror those found in a good story: the ambitious employee torn between advancement and ethical concerns, or the team leader struggling with difficult decisions about resource allocation. These inner struggles create compelling character arcs in both fiction and real life.</p> Common Causes of Internal Conflict <p>Understanding why we face such inner turmoil helps in resolving internal conflicts effectively. Research in psychological literature identifies several common triggers that any main character in their own life story might face:</p><p>Value Conflicts: When different personal values compete for priority, creating moral dilemmas. For instance, valuing both honesty and loyalty can create conflict when keeping a friend's secret would mean being dishonest with others.</p><p>Decision Paralysis: The tension created when multiple good (or bad) options exist, each with their own advantages and drawbacks. This often occurs in career decisions, relationship choices, or major life changes.</p><p>Role Conflicts: When different roles in life demand conflicting behaviors or time commitments. A common example is balancing professional responsibilities with personal relationships or self-care.</p><p>Identity Transitions: During periods of personal growth or change, internal conflict often arises between old patterns and new aspirations. This is particularly common during career changes or relationship evolutions.</p> Signs of Unresolved Internal Conflict <p>Recognizing internal conflict is the first step toward resolving it. Research from the American Institute of Stress identifies several common indicators that internal conflict may be affecting someone's well-being.</p><p>In emotional terms, persistent anxiety, irritability, and mood swings often signal unresolved internal conflict. People might notice themselves feeling constantly unsettled or unsatisfied, even when external circumstances are relatively stable. Many report a sense of being "stuck" or unable to move forward with decisions.</p><p>Behaviorally, internal conflict often manifests as procrastination, indecisiveness, or inconsistent actions. Someone might repeatedly change their mind about important decisions, or find themselves unable to stick to resolutions they've made. Sleep disturbances are another common sign, with studies showing that unresolved internal conflict can reduce sleep quality by up to 30%.</p><p>Physical manifestations can include tension headaches, digestive issues, and muscle tension—particularly in the neck and shoulders. These symptoms often worsen during periods when the internal conflict feels most pressing.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F347e58aa-2d2e-488d-a63b-f8e7b995152d_3264x1942.jpeg">          </a>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@youssefnaddam?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">youssef naddam</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/two-persons-arms-iJ2IG8ckCpA?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>  Evidence-Based Strategies for Conflict Resolution <p>Research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience has identified several effective approaches to resolving internal conflict and cognitive dissonance. These strategies don't just provide temporary relief—they help build lasting resilience and decision-making confidence.</p><p>While seeing a mental health professional can be beneficial during times of extreme internal conflict, sometimes that can be too costly or impractical. It’s also helpful to learn how to work through it individually, so that it can be more efficiently dealt with.</p><p>The current science suggests three main approaches:</p><p>1. Changing conflicting behavior to align with values</p><p>2. Updating beliefs to accommodate necessary behaviors</p><p>3. Adding new information that bridges the gap between beliefs and actions</p><p>For the first, one powerful approach comes from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which is a type of talking therapy that helps patients recognise and follow their personal values.<a>1</a> This involves deeply examining what truly matters to someone—beyond surface-level preferences or societal expectations—by asking them to open up and examine all of their thoughts, reactions, and feelings.</p><p>For the second, cognitive restructuring can be a helpful exercise. This evidence-based technique involves examining and challenging the thoughts underlying internal conflicts, and proposing plausible alternatives to uncomfortable beliefs. This might mean questioning whether moving for a new job is inherently negative, or whether a difficult conversation at work really will end a relationship—and considering possible and less extreme situations instead.<a>2</a></p><p>For the last, research as a tool is as important as ever. For example, someone in a creative tech role like the games industry might initially have an issue accepting lucrative AI support in their work. However, they may be able to bridge the gap by discovering and supporting ethical and genuinely useful AI products, rather than more environmentally-damaging AI.</p><p>Mindfulness approaches like <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/anxiety-journaling-complete-guide">Journaling</a> have also shown remarkable effectiveness, as discussed previously, as they allow people to better understand and recognize sources of conflict.</p><p>But, how does that actually get put into practice, and used to help?</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa23edf9f-a938-4f59-a6b8-328e813354e2_4256x2832.jpeg">          </a>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@glenncarstenspeters?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Glenn Carstens-Peters</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-writing-bucket-list-on-book-RLw-UC03Gwc?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>  Creating an Internal Conflict Action Plan <p>Moving from understanding to action requires a structured approach. As we discussed in our <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">goal-setting article</a>, breaking down conflict resolution into manageable steps significantly improves outcomes. The key is creating a process that feels both comprehensive and achievable—here’s an example to begin working with:</p>  <p>Define the Conflict: Start by clearly articulating the conflict, including all competing elements. Write down not just the surface-level conflict, but the deeper values and needs at play. For instance, a conflict about taking a new job might actually be about balancing security with growth, or personal fulfilment with family responsibilities.<br><br></p>  <p>Develop Evaluation Criteria: Think about what the ideal solution might include, both practically (like salary) and emotionally (like family time). Try to be as clear as possible.<br><br></p>  <p>Examine the Assumptions Underlying the Conflict. Often, people have incorrect, unconscious beliefs that make conflicts seem worse than they are. By writing out all of the things that feel true about a dilemma, and tackling them with the methods from the last section, truth can be more easily separated from fiction. For example, the belief that a role with a new company means contact will be lost with old teammates can be challenged by the fact that many people stay friends with ex-colleagues.<br><br></p>  <p>Brainstorm Solutions: This section is easier said than done. Still, by combining the previous steps, it’s common that a solution or decision that felt unrealistic due to unconscious assumption now appears more fitting. Either way, the goal isn't to find a perfect solution—research shows that aiming for ‘good enough’ decisions that honor our core values leads to better outcomes than pursuing perfection.<a>3</a></p>  <p>Even with all of the above support, however, trying to resolve internal conflict independently can be a long and stressful process. This is why more and more advanced support systems are being developed for exactly that reason.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5298f5e9-554f-4694-bd2c-98ee0ac29bb6_4468x3216.jpeg">          </a>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@possessedphotography?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Possessed Photography</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/closeup-photo-of-white-robot-arm-jIBMSMs4_kA?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>  The Role of <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> in Internal Conflict Resolution <p>Modern technology, particularly artificial intelligence, has introduced new tools for addressing internal conflict effectively.</p><p>Though the internet has made knowledge and psychological support more accessible than ever, an <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companion</a> can serve as an unique space for exploring thoughts and feelings without judgment, <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbots</a> can respond back with tailor-made responses.</p><p>This dynamic can help identify patterns in someone’s decision-making, emotional responses, and behavior that contribute to internal conflict—and an advanced enough personal AI could even suggest therapies, therapists and tactics to deal with these personal triggers.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of these tools depends heavily on user trust and privacy—without it, users won’t discuss their internal conflicts in enough detail for the AI to provide accurate support.

As the KILT community has now established the KILT Foundation, this goal has been&nbsp;reached.</p><p>The KILT core developers and design team has transitioned to galaniprojects, KILT’s first and most recognised integrator. They will maintain the KILT blockchain and work closely with the KILT Foundation to develop new features on community request. The team size has not been&nbsp;reduced.</p><p>The administrative employees, Elisa, Matthias, and Ingo, become independent KILT agents and continue their work for PoKe — Polkadot’s Key Account BD Unit under the umbrella of BOTLabs. Ingo remains the sole founder of KILT Protocol and will devote significant time and resources to continue his presence for KILT and its community.</p><p>Gustav stays in the Polkadot ecosystem, transitioning into the legal department of <a href="https://www.parity.io/">Parity Technologies</a>, a company that develops much of the open-source tech that drives <a href="https://polkadot.com/">Polkadot</a>.</p><p>The Foundation, led by Rish and Svet, will cater to the community’s needs and the well-being of the KILT network and developed software.

<p>This piece explores the use of serious games in international development spaces, acknowledges their challenges and limitations, and considers ways to create thoughtful gaming scenarios that inspire learning and&nbsp;action.</p><p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-savita-bailur-3986801/">Dr. Savita Bailur</a> — Senior Director of Gender Equality &amp; Social Inclusion, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdtabares/">Jesús Tabares</a> — Grants &amp; Community Manager, both at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou</a>.</p> What are serious&nbsp;games? <p>Over the 2024 holiday season, many gathered with family and friends to engage in games, whether indoors or outdoors, silly or serious. (Cluedo, for instance, can feel quite serious.) The holiday season often highlights the appeal of games, from lively board game nights with family to quiet moments spent solving&nbsp;puzzles.</p><p>As routines have resumed in the new year, this “games season” may already feel distant. However, the spirit of play can continue to inspire work and creativity in areas such as development, community building, and activism. The engaging and immersive nature of games provides a unique space for critical thinking and meaningful discussions, especially when addressing issues of justice and equity. A game is “an activity that one engages in for amusement or fun.” <a href="https://www.abtglobal.com/our-people/clark-c-abt">Clark C. Abt</a> first introduced the term “serious games” in his <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780819161482/Serious-Games">1970 book</a> of the same name. He defined serious games as those that could be “played seriously or casually” with an explicit educational purpose beyond mere entertainment.</p><p>In the context of international development, serious games have emerged <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1748048518814358?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.11">as powerful tools leveraging interactive and immersive experiences</a>. Serious games have been gaining traction as transformative tools for development practitioners, and are now used to raise awareness, educate, and promote behavior change in areas such as poverty alleviation, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. Titles like <a href="http://www.peacemakergame.com/">PeaceMaker</a>, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/edutech/brief/evoke-an-online-alternate-reality-game-supporting-social-innovation-among-young-people-around-the-world">Evoke</a>, and <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/research/projects/urbansim/">UrbanSim</a> illustrate how games can drive collaboration and problem-solving by simplifying complexity and encouraging participants to engage from fresh perspectives. Similar examples are David Taverner’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/space4development-dt_hello-my-name-is-doctor-isla-campbell-activity-7183735468318982144-XlgE/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">immersive work in space and climate</a> and the Wilson Center’s <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/program/serious-games-initiative">Serious Games Initiative</a>, which has games on managing plastic waste and navigating AI, just to name a few. As the field continues to mature, more rigorous evaluation is needed to fully understand the opportunity and potential of serious games on development goals and to refine their application in addressing global challenges.</p>In <a href="https://gda.esa.int/2024/01/cosmopolis-a-unique-immersive-urban-environment-opens-its-doors-to-visitors/">Cosmopolis</a>, players join Dr. Isla Campbell and other fascinating characters in a journey through Sylvan Glade, learning about the use of satellite data for forest management and monitoring. In-game the fantastic world of Sylvan Glade is combined with real-life accounts of uses of satellite data.<blockquote>The combination of play and purpose creates an environment where participants can approach challenges boldly and with greater creativity.</blockquote><p>Serious games enable players to simulate real-world scenarios, test strategies and assumptions in hypothetical scenarios, and build empathy in a safe, risk-free environment. Games create immersive spaces where abstract challenges become tangible, and where we can lay out the complexities of issues like poverty alleviation, gender equity, or climate resilience. Through simulation, challenges, and restrictive sets of rules, games introduce scenarios that not only force practitioners to think, but create a flat structure for others to challenge our assumptions and worldviews. In a family context, this could level the “playing field” between grandparents and grandchildren. At a company level, it could be between senior leadership, consultants, administrators, etc. The constellation of gamers with different worldviews makes the experience rich. Moreover, the power of playing games is also reflected in their ability to foster inclusion and creativity; games create a shared space where participants feel safe to contribute ideas, regardless of their role or expertise. This is especially critical in collaborative environments like development practice, or when championing equity in any&nbsp;sector.</p> “Please design a session on digital and livelihoods” <p>At Caribou’s November retreat, four of us (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdtabares/">Jesús Tabares</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-savita-bailur-3986801/">Savita Bailur</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natabaalo/">Grace Natabaalo</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannalaufer/">Hanna Laufer</a>) were asked to lead a company-wide session on the intersection of <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Platform_Livelihoods_Project_CaribouDigital_April2024_web.pdf">digital and livelihoods</a>, a crucial theme in Caribou’s portfolio. We knew we had to make the agenda productive yet fun. When brainstorming ideas for the most impactful format, some of us thought storytelling would be powerful, while others felt it might create artificial distinctions of “presenters” and “listeners.” Jesús, Community Manager for the Mastercard Strive portfolio managed by Caribou, proposed a “Future of Livelihoods” game. The aim of this approach was to foster collaboration, challenge assumptions, and create a shared space for innovative thinking — as well as have fun, of&nbsp;course.</p><p>We needed to connect the diverse lenses through which each team member had recently engaged with livelihoods — gender, youth, agriculture, or small businesses — so we created the Future of Livelihoods Lab, a game that captured everyone’s curiosity, creativity, and ingenuity. This game featured three decks of cards with an individual theme: Challenge, Innovation, and Client. Each team drew one card from each deck, outlining a specific livelihoods challenge, a cutting-edge innovation, and the profile of an imagined client with unique needs. For instance, a team might address the challenge of digital access gaps in rural Ghana through the innovation of mobile learning platforms to empower the client, young entrepreneurs represented by the Aspire Youth Collective. The objective was to design a strategy that seamlessly integrated the challenge, innovation, and client profile into a cohesive and impactful solution.</p><p>The game unfolded with lively discussions and a strategic swap option, allowing teams to exchange one card for another if their initial combination felt mismatched. Teams were given twenty minutes to craft their proposals and then pitch their strategies in two-minute presentations to a panel acting as a donor board, which scored each idea on creativity, client alignment, and scalability.</p><p>The dynamic, fast-paced nature of the “Future of Livelihoods Lab” energized the retreat, fostering innovative ideas and revealing cross-cutting themes among participants. A prize was awarded to recognize how this thoughtful and immersive activity transformed a pressing topic into a collaborative and enjoyable exercise.</p>Decks of cards and a matching animated background set the scene in the “Future of Livelihoods Lab.” Recognizing that development is not just a game: The challenges and limitations of&nbsp;games <p>Despite their promise, serious games also come with challenges. For games to resonate, they must be culturally relevant and accessible, ensuring all participants feel included. Additionally, power dynamics within groups can shape the experience, requiring careful facilitation, thoughtful mechanic and rule design, and adequate stewardship to maintain equity and inclusivity. Finally, practitioners must be sensitive when integrating play with serious issues. Not all serious games are focused on development, and not all development-focused games are necessarily serious. A decade ago, <a href="https://jadedaid.com/">Jaded Aid</a> made waves — though not without <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/25/jaded-aid-the-game-for-disillusioned-humanitarians">controversy</a> — for its sharp, self-referential critique of the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>What excites us today is a very different approach, one that moves away from self-critique (though it remains necessary) and toward fostering meaningful learning and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The questions of who designs, executes, and participates in a game must all be addressed thoughtfully. At a company level, there should be a collective understanding of the purpose of a game, and a sense of safety and security to raise points that might be different from others. This may not be the case at a community level, where power dynamics of “insiders” and “outsiders” or “game designers” and “participants” may emerge. Games may place a time and labor burden on participants. We may see evidence of groupthink, or fear to truly speak up, and reluctance to challenge cultural, social, and/or gendered hierarchies — critiques leveled at burdensome participatory methods more than twenty years ago by authors such as <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/participation-9781856497947/">Cooke and Kothari in “Participation: The New Tyranny.”</a></p><p>In our case, the in-person “Future of Livelihoods Lab” allowed for group discussion, creative thinking, and innovation. By creating a structured but flexible environment, the game enabled participants to think critically and collaboratively without losing sight of the broader purpose. It was specifically crafted for an audience of colleagues, with a shared ethos and a comparable understanding of the topic and its dynamics. Setting assumptions like these requires deeper thinking, collaboration, and planning in community scenarios, where a well thought-out game could help make solutions emerge — or a poor one could make issues&nbsp;worse.</p> The value of games: Insights for practitioners <p>Our Caribou retreat experience underscored several benefits of using serious games in development work:</p>  Breaking silos: Games bring together diverse stakeholders, encouraging them to work collaboratively and share insights that transcend individual roles or projects.  Encouraging horizontal collaboration through play: Structured play levels the playing field, empowering participants to engage as equals and contribute ideas&nbsp;freely.  Stimulating creativity: By stepping into fictional scenarios, participants are freed from the constraints of their usual roles, enabling them to take bold, imaginative risks.  Revealing blind spots: Games help participants explore perspectives they might not otherwise consider, uncovering overlooked challenges and opportunities.  Building empathy: Role-playing and interactive scenarios allow practitioners to see the world through the eyes of others, fostering greater understanding and connection.  Navigating complex learning curves through engagement: Games sustain attention by guiding participants through intricate topics in an intuitive and enjoyable way.  <p>For Jesús, these benefits are grounded in his experience using games as trust-building tools in community settings:</p><blockquote>“When participants work on a fictional scenario, it’s easier to spot the assumptions and biases we carry into our everyday work. This space to experiment without fear often leads to surprising breakthroughs.”</blockquote><p>Savita emphasizes how applying serious games in workplace scenarios encourages iterative thinking: “Games provide a relatively safe space where we can fail without real-world consequences.” For David Taverner, games are a powerful learning tool because “games are a form of ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_storytelling">interactive storytelling</a>’ and often hold our attention for long periods.”</p>Playing the “Future of Livelihoods Lab” game at the Caribou&nbsp;retreat. Beyond games: A tool for systemic&nbsp;change <p>While the “Future of Livelihoods Lab” was a useful exercise for Caribou, it’s just one example of how bringing games to work can enhance development practice, and iterating games can be just as important as creating new&nbsp;ones.</p><p>Savita plans to test and iterate further on the “Future of Livelihoods” game in the first class of her spring semester course “Human-Centred Digital Development” at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. While many international development students at “Northern” or “Western” universities come with good intentions, they can also come with assumptions around digital development, assumptions that can be questioned by using the game, thus raising awareness around barriers to digital livelihoods including access, relevance, literacy and use, and issues of social&nbsp;norms.</p><p>The real value of serious games lies in their ability to act as bridges — connecting people, ideas, and disciplines to create systemic change. Whether used in community workshops, classrooms, or multi-stakeholder forums, (serious?) games can foster dialogue, uncover new possibilities, and inspire bold&nbsp;action.</p><p>Reach out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdtabares/">Jesús Tabares</a> if you’d like to partner with Caribou to play seriously!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/serious-yet-fun-games-as-tools-for-digital-development-9e5e8047549a">“Serious yet fun”: Games as tools for digital development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Emma’s buying her first home—a process that used to mean printing documents, scheduling in-person visits, and endless waiting. But instead of navigating outdated systems, Emma’s lender uses modern Know Your Customer (KYC) technology. The result? A seamless, digital experience where her identity is verified in minutes, not days.</p>



 



 Reimagining KYC with Digital Identity 



<p>Emma logs into her lender’s app and is guided through a quick digital ID verification process:</p>



 
 She uploads a photo of her government-issued ID. 



 The system scans and validates the details instantly using optical character recognition (OCR) to ensure accuracy. 



 A live selfie confirms Emma’s identity through biometric liveness detection, verifying that she’s physically present and not using a static image. 
 



<p>In less than two minutes, Emma’s identity is verified—no manual forms, no waiting rooms.</p>



 



 A Secure Foundation: Blockchain for Tamper-Proof Records 



<p>Behind the scenes, Emma’s lender uses blockchain technology to protect her data. Unlike traditional databases, which are vulnerable to tampering, blockchain creates a secure, decentralized ledger where:</p>



 
 Verified records can’t be altered, ensuring transparency and data integrity. 



 Emma’s verified identity can be reused across multiple services, reducing redundant processes. 
 



<p>Though Emma doesn’t interact with blockchain directly, its presence strengthens the security of her entire transaction.</p>



 



 The Future of KYC: Self-Sovereign Identity 



<p>Emma’s experience offers a glimpse into the future of digital identity: self-sovereign identity (SSI). In this model, Emma controls her credentials through a secure digital wallet and decides what information to share.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



 
 When renewing her driver’s license, she could share only her name, birthdate, and photo—nothing else. 



 When applying for a new bank account, she could authorize proof of identity without revealing unrelated personal data. 
 



<p>SSI enhances privacy while streamlining the verification process, putting individuals in charge of their digital identities.</p>



 



 Redefining Trust in Financial Transactions 



<p>Emma’s KYC journey illustrates how biometric authentication, blockchain-backed security, and decentralized identity verification are redefining trust. For businesses, adopting these innovations isn’t just about meeting regulatory requirements—it’s about delivering secure, frictionless customer experiences that build confidence and loyalty.</p>



<p>The future of KYC is here, and it’s making complex verifications simple, secure, and efficient.</p>

<p>An integral requirement of academic research data management (RDM) is ensuring research repeatability to preserve the continuation of scientific integrity. Repeatability allows other researchers to validate findings, build on existing work, and maintain high-quality standards and public trust in research outcomes. </p>
<p><br></p>
 Well-document data and metadata significantly improve reuse 
<p>Effective RDM practices, such as thorough data management plans, organizing data systematically, storing data in accessible formats, and managing and controlling access to research data, facilitate the process of discovery and create a clear roadmap for others to follow. For instance, a study by Wallis et al. (2013) highlights that well-documented data and metadata significantly improve the likelihood of successful data reuse. When researchers provide detailed descriptions of their data collection processes, analysis techniques, and tools used in their research, it clarifies their procedures and allows others to accurately evaluate academic publications. This can also expedite the peer review process and enhance its accuracy, enabling more research to be published faster without compromising quality standards.</p>
<p><br></p>
 Guarantee long-term accessibility 
<p>Furthermore, storing data in trusted repositories guarantees long-term accessibility, which is crucial for ensuring that studies can be repeated effectively. According to a report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2019), transparent data sharing not only supports reproducibility but also creates an environment of innovative collaboration. By adequately adopting RDM best practices and solutions that are designed to enable them, researchers are able to contribute towards a culture of accountability, which ultimately strengthens the credibility of the scientific community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, good RDM is not just about preserving data, it is about defending the future of academic research itself. By enabling researchers to easily embrace strong research data management practices, myLaminin ensures that your data is not only secure but also accessible for future scholars. myLaminin's commitment to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) science principles, and reliability in our data security, team collaboration, agreements management, data collection, integrated Research Ethics Board, and audit trail capabilities supports ongoing discovery and innovation, helping us all build a more informed future.</p>

							         Doug Dimmadome Doppleganger   <p>Please forgive me and the&nbsp;&amp;SOL team for leaning heavy into the self-promo this week. I’m just a proud, newly-minted full stack dev. If your business buys ads from Google and Facebook, be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.app/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=oops-all-ads">register for growbot</a>. Now, onto your obligatory dose of overly verbose cultural commentary.</p>  <p>Despite what the above chart might suggest, crypto is not in a bear market. The most recent flushes are rational responses to the macro economic trends from Trump’s Tariffs, which have everyone looking to de-risk (or free up cash to do so).</p>  <p>But crypto isn’t the place to offload. It remains one of the best places to look for safety and opportunity right now.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Missouri, the state I’m writing from today, just introduced a bill to invest public funds in Bitcoin and protect miners. Elsewhere, the number of users leveraging my favorite decentralized phone network, Helium, are at an all time high. $JellyJelly, another token launched by some ex-Big tech product players on Solana just last week, is giving metered access to an AI-powered video creator tool. They decided to forgo investor funds by turning the token into a payment method for their software. This is the future of AI-powered SaaS.</p>  <p>The utility for crypto is here. And it’s mostly on Solana. The price action doesn’t say that currently because Trump is flooding the zone and tariffs are all anyone can think about right now. But my mind is unclouded by everything but some good old pharmaceutical grade Michigan kush. And to me, this downtrend just smacks of buying opportunity.</p>  <p>Ethereum’s gas fees and the transfer of another billion dollars in assets moving from Ethereum to Solana have depressed $ETH’s prices. But if the rumors out of Texas and Eric Trump’s Twitter feed are true, it will have another burst of life as TradFi’s regulated on-chain assets protocol and the push for the tokenized stock exchange in the shape of a ten-gallon hat and run by a Doug Dimmadome doppleganger. Meanwhile, newly-appointed crypto czar David Sacks is pushing for a&nbsp;memecoins and NFTs are collectibles&nbsp;narrative, which really services the fun.pump that’s happening on Solana. ($OPOS.)&nbsp;</p>  <p>I don’t think the memetic, gambling on chain is going away anytime soon. We are already starting to see those communities evolve into more robust entities, because why waste the brand value that’s already been created?</p>  <p>That’s part of why our team is so confident that both modern and legacy brands will be one of the upcoming metas. For more risk-averse players that might balk at launching an open market collectible, which could run afoul of securities law, there are those out there toying with the idea of stablecoins to service the loyalty programs. But if this does take hold, it will likely be a short-term trend. This approach de-risks the volatility of the token for its holders, sure. But it also removes the upside. I expect most of those brands to get curious about the upside of destabilizing the token, which could be a future risk for the industry, if those large public token coins were to crash.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Anyway, it’s all speculation, but what else is there to do in the DeFi space? And as we learned in 2021, speculation is more fun when the market is offering bargain prices at the start of tax season. Our faith in the utility of the web3 industry — securing the future of data sovereignty and enabling an ethical environment to interact with AI —&nbsp;is far from shaken.&nbsp;</p>  <p>While the income tax still stands, may your returns be massive.</p>  <p>—El Prof</p>

 Un gran paso hacia la seguridad de datos digitales 



<p>En un mundo cada vez más digital, la gestión de nuestra identidad se ha convertido en un tema central. La Ciudad de Buenos Aires da un paso trascendental hacia el futuro de la identidad digital con el <a href="https://www.clarin.com/ciudades/licencia-conducir-digital-disponible-app-portena-controles-valida_0_25cs4SRxUU.html?srsltid=AfmBOorMbGB4pqxtmhLmO-viN9M_olVxv4ZJgay2R0hGPAw3gHT8IQrI" title="">lanzamiento de la Licencia de Conducir como credencial verificable.</a> Este hito, disponible en las wallets <a href="https://extrimian.io/es/blog/integrating-quarkid-and-miba/" title="">miBA y QuarkID</a>, representa un avance significativo en la protección de datos personales y la eficiencia de los trámites.</p>



<p>En octubre de 2024, miBA integró QuarkID, permitiendo que los usuarios gestionen su información de forma segura a través de la tecnología blockchain de <a href="https://extrimian.io/es/wikis/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp/" title="">ZKsync</a>. Esta actualización proporcionó a los más de 3,8 millones de usuarios una Identidad Digital Descentralizada (DID), convirtiendo al Gobierno de la Ciudad en el primero a nivel mundial en adoptar blockchain para la gestión de identidades digitales.</p>



<p></p>



La licencia de conducir digital en CABA se puede exhibir a través de la app miBA.



<p></p>

 Mayor control:  



<p>Los ciudadanos tienen el control total de sus datos, decidiendo cuándo y con quién compartirlos.</p>



 Privacidad reforzada:  



<p>La tecnología de credenciales verificables protege la información personal de accesos no autorizados.</p>



 Seguridad avanzada:  



<p>La autenticidad de la licencia se verifica de forma criptográfica, previniendo fraudes y falsificaciones.</p>



 Eficiencia en trámites:  



<p>La verificación de identidad se agiliza, eliminando tiempos de espera y fricciones innecesarias.</p>



 Menos intermediarios:  



<p>Se reducen las interacciones con terceros para la verificación de documentos, simplificando procesos.</p>

<p>Modern financial services and technology have spread around the world over the past century-plus, but many adults still don’t have, or can’t access, traditional bank accounts or digital payments tools. As of 2021, only <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/07/global-digital-financial-inclusion-findex/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">75% of adults worldwide</a> have a bank or mobile spending account. This rate of so-called “financial inclusion” is lower in developing economies, at only 71%.&nbsp;</p><p>The consequences are substantial. Living without modern banking or payment tools makes basic life tasks like shopping harder, saving money more difficult and insecure, and adding particular burdens to small business operators. Exclusion can fall particularly hard on women and minority groups, who are sometimes still actively prevented from accessing banking infrastructure, compounding other challenges. In turn, financial exclusion depresses overall economic activity for communities and nations.</p><p>The good news is that financial inclusion has grown significantly over the past decade, driven by innovative mobile payments and digital identity systems like India’s Aadhar. SpruceID’s work is focused on the next generation of digital identity based on <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-physical-id-card-and-a-verifiable-digital-credential">cryptographic signatures</a> known as “verifiable digital credentials,” or VDCs.</p> The Mobile Transition and Financial Inclusion <p>The discussion about financial inclusion has been dramatically reshaped by the advent of digital technologies, particularly by the rise of mobile phones and smartphones. According to the World Economic Forum, the adoption of mobile tools has driven <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/07/global-digital-financial-inclusion-findex/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">the majority</a> of increased financial inclusion in the developing world over the last decade, and VDCs similarly rely on mobile devices. For that reason, we largely focus below on the specific advantages of VDC-based identity over existing digital and mobile tools.</p> More Affordable Banking <p>Again and again, whether in developing countries or wealthy nations, the number one reason individuals don’t use banks is the cost. Discussions often focus on the fear of <a href="https://www.afcpe.org/news-and-publications/the-standard/2015-4/three-reasons-why-people-dont-use-banks/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">overdrafts and other “gotcha” fees</a>, which were thankfully <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-closes-overdraft-loophole-to-save-americans-billions-in-fees?ref=blog.spruceid.com">recently capped</a> in the U.S. But banking costs will always trickle down to users in some fashion.&nbsp;</p><p>Two major cost centers for banks and payment services are service and fraud. Trustworthy VDCs can reduce service labor costs through automation and also offer potential long-term savings via fraud prevention. As onboarding for financial services has gone increasingly online, fraud has exploded, including most recently thanks to the rise of <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/why-the-u-s-post-office-is-key-to-fighting-ai-fraud/">fake IDs created with AI</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>By making digital identity trustworthy and fraud-resistant, online and off, VDCs should make banking services cheaper, increasing inclusion. They could even make online and digital lending services more affordable since being able to reliably trust that you’re lending to a specific person dramatically reduces fraud and defaults. Going still further, VDCs can also be used to prove educational credentials like degrees and training. Making these documents fully trustworthy and natively digital might further de-risk lending since lenders can verify education and experience credentials as easily and reliably as identity.</p> More Reliable Payments <p>Fraud prevention also increases the chance that users of digital payment systems will actually receive the money they’re owed, whether by a friend, customer, or government agency. This is particularly vital because mobile payments are such a major portion of recent adoption. One prime example is M-PESA, which began life as a form of digital cash for old-school “dumb” phones. M-PESA has now thrived for going on two decades, with profoundly transformative impacts: M-PESA adoption alone lifted <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/mobile-money-kenyans-out-poverty-1208?ref=blog.spruceid.com">2% of the Kenyan population out of poverty</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The scattershot distribution and rampant fraud in COVID-19 relief payments highlighted how vulnerable and fragmented the U.S. system for government disbursements is. Even users of India’s more advanced benefits system via Aadhaar have <a href="https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/aadhaar-card-aeps-scam-617970.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">had payments stolen</a>, in part because Aadhaar relies on an account number for access, a variety of what’s known as “knowledge-based security.”&nbsp;</p><p>VDCs, by contrast, can be tied to a specific device, preventing hackers from easily impersonating an account holder. For mobile payment systems, in particular, on-device digital credentials present huge security benefits for the still-unbanked, further enhancing trust and adoption. M-PESA-style systems that use official VDC-based identity for verification are not yet widespread. But they don’t face major technical barriers because VDCs—again, unlike centralized digital identity services—are designed to easily interact with third-party digital tools.</p> Privacy, Security, and Trust <p>By far the most direct advantage of a VDC-based digital identity system is that it protects the personal data and privacy of users. This is in part because the system can be implemented in a way to allow the storage and verification of identity data locally on a mobile device rather than requiring a <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/the-importance-of-protecting-digital-id-users-from-phone-home-surveillance/">“phone home” verification</a> to a faraway server. The latter “phone home” architecture is vulnerable to hacking: India’s centralized system, for instance, has experienced repeated, devastating thefts of private information from <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/aadhaar-data-of-millions-of-indians-put-on-sale-on-the-dark-web-reports-123103000993_1.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">millions of Indian citizens</a>. That information can, in turn, be used for fraud or worse.</p><p>VDC-based identity also offers better privacy for everyday use compared to both conventional paper ID documents and older digital identity systems. “Selective Disclosure” lets VDC users <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">control exactly what data they share</a>. This makes it possible to access banking services without revealing irrelevant details to the servicer – including identity details such as gender and race, which might enable discrimination. Another privacy and security feature of VDCs is more subtle: a digital identity document is less conspicuous than a paper document and often can’t be viewed without the holder’s explicit consent via opening their phone.</p><p>These features are vital for improving financial inclusion because they foster user trust. Some unbanked people are hesitant to participate in systems that might make them vulnerable – and in some cases, their fears have been justified. Correcting or preventing these flaws, and fostering deep trust in an identity system, are fundamental to improving many people’s lives by bringing them into the global banking and financial system.</p><p>To learn more about how SpruceID is advancing financial inclusion through verifiable digital credentials, explore our work in secure, privacy-preserving digital identity.

 France has become the latest in a long line of countries that is doubling down on requiring pornographic sites to offer mandatory age verification. The aim is to protect minors, but will it work and at what cost to user privacy?&nbsp; 



<p>In January 2025, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14267581/Porn-sites-risk-blocked-days-France-refuse-comply-18-age-checks.html">a new regulation was passed requiring pornographic sites in France</a> to verify the age of their users. This initiative aims to protect minors from exposure to inappropriate content online, which can <a href="https://www.barnardos.org.uk/blog/how-does-pornography-harm-children">cause long-term harm</a> and affect their perception of gender and sexual relations as well as put younger people and women at greater risk of abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Platforms must now implement robust identity verification solutions to verify users’ ages either through the identification of documents or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">facial recognition</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, questions have been raised on the effectiveness of the proposed methods and the potential impact on user privacy.&nbsp;</p>



 How France aims to crack down on underage users viewing pornography.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Every month, <a href="https://eclj.org/family/french-institutions/pornographie--23-millions-de-jeunes-francais-victimes-de-violence-sexuelle">2.3 million minors in France access pornographic sites</a>, representing a staggering 12% of the total visitors. To address the issue, the Regulatory Authority for Audiovisual and Digital Communication now requires adult sites to implement age verification services by April 11, 2025. After this period, sanctions, including site blocking, may be applied in the event of non-compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accepted methods of identity verification include the use of video selfies for biometric recognition, or proof of identity via document verification. As a simple confirmation of age is no longer sufficient, compliance is reinforced by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/double-anonymity-to-bring-age-verification-to-porn-and-social-media-in-france">a double anonymity system,</a> allowing age to be verified while guaranteeing anonymity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>With double anonymity, the site you’re connecting to doesn’t know who you are, only that you’re over 18. Plus, the age verification service doesn’t know which site you’re connecting to.</p>Marc Norlain, Managing Director at IDnow</blockquote>



 Global regulation practices for adult sites.&nbsp; 



<p>France is not alone in its efforts to regulate access to adult content. Here are how some other countries are tackling the issue of minors viewing pornography.&nbsp;</p>



  United Kingdom: The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">Online Safety Act</a> will require pornographic platforms to use age verification services by July. All websites on which pornographic material can be found, including social media platforms, must introduce ‘robust’ age-checking techniques, such as demanding photo ID or running credit card checks for UK users. Ofcom has published what it calls a “non-exhaustive” list of technologies that may be used to verify ages, which includes:&nbsp;  



  Open banking&nbsp;  



  Photo ID matching&nbsp;  



  Facial age estimation&nbsp;  



  Mobile network operator age checks&nbsp;  



  Credit card checks&nbsp;  



  Digital identity services&nbsp;  



  Email-based age estimation&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Germany: The country imposes strict regulations via the Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media (KJM). Sites must ensure that users are of legal age by using verification solutions such as digital identity services or national identity cards.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Italy: The government has recently tightened online controls. Pornographic platforms must verify age via state-issued digital identifiers, such as the SPID (Public Digital Identity System). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Denmark: More lenient than some other European countries, Denmark simply encourages the use of age verification services to protect minors, notably via public-private partnerships.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  United States: Since June 2024, <a href="https://avpassociation.com/4271-2/">19 states have passed laws</a> requiring age verification for access to adult content. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Nations such as China, Iran and Saudi Arabia completely block access to pornographic sites, using censorship technologies to prevent access.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  In Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic, there are no specific regulations imposing age verification services for pornographic sites, although discussions are underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>The <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en">Digital Services Act</a>, which is in force in all European Union (EU) Member States, requires digital platforms, including adult content sites, to implement age verification mechanisms when their services are massively used (over 45 million users). This regulation aims to ensure a safer online environment for minors throughout the EU.&nbsp;</p>



 Age verification solutions for accessing sensitive content.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Faced with new and more prolific age verification requirements, a promising solution is emerging to combine efficiency, anonymity and privacy: the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">EUDI Wallet (European Digital Identity Wallet)</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/yris/">Digital identity wallets</a> offer two main benefits:&nbsp;</p>



  Selective disclosure of information.&nbsp;  



<p>This system allows users to prove their age without disclosing other personal data. For example, users can confirm that they are over 18 without revealing other personal information, such as their name or address. Only information strictly necessary for verification is shared.&nbsp;</p>



  Non-traceability of users.&nbsp;  



<p>A key feature of the digital identity portfolio will be its ability to guarantee the non-traceability of users’ interactions with sites. Thanks to advanced technologies such as zero-knowledge proof, it will be impossible to link a user’s actions to a specific site or to their other online activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital wallets look set to usher in a major advancement in privacy protection, addressing some of the current concerns associated with using identity verification solutions to gain access to adult sites.&nbsp;</p>



 Porn, privacy and data confidentiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>When it comes to viewing pornographic content, the topic of privacy is clearly an important and sensitive topic. To reassure adult users that they will be able to remain anonymous and their data kept confidential, all while complying with new and upcoming regulations, it will become essential to implement solutions that comply with strict privacy protection principles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implementing these new solutions is a challenge but represents a major opportunity to combine innovation with security and respect for individual freedoms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/04/05/the-evolving-landscape-of-non-human-identity/">been saying</a> that to follow what’s happening in NHI standards, some of the core work you need to follow is happening in the IETF: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spice/about/">SPICE</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/wimse/about/">WIMSE</a>, and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about/">SCITT</a>. Everybody loves WIMSE with its workload identity architecture, and building the credential format in SPICE that can meet the needs of NHIs is of course brilliant (I’m not biased, you’re biased!). But thinking about this from the bottom up is what SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) is all about, and it’s time to learn more about it and its close allies, <a href="https://spiffe.io/">SPIFFE</a> (which isn’t happening in the IETF) and, yes, WIMSE. (I’ll cover SPICE in a future blog post.)</p>



<p> Prefer to listen? Here’s the audio version of this post:</p>







<p>First, let’s talk about why you should care.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a vendor or a product manager, modern software is a patchwork of third-party components, open-source libraries, and cloud-based services. A single weak link can undermine the entire system, putting your company’s product and reputation at risk.</p>



<p>That’s where SCITT comes in. By focusing on verifying every step in the software supply chain, it offers vendors the confidence that their components meet security and integrity standards. Customers, too, are demanding greater transparency, and SCITT is working to become a big part in how that happens.</p>



 Key Trends Shaping Supply Chain Security 



<p>Conversations about software supply chains are becoming almost as exciting as NHI and AI. Probably because NHI and AI depend on a crazy amount of software, each with its own set of potential vulnerabilities. We’re talking about rising threats, high-profile breaches, and increasing regulatory pressure requiring organizations to rethink how they build, deploy, and manage software. To meet these challenges, the industry is rallying around key practices and frameworks that promote transparency, trust, and resilience. Two of the big trends in this space are the adoption of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and the emergence of global legislation driving accountability.</p>



 The Rise of SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) 



<p>An <a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/industry-news/2023/why-are-regulations-demanding-sbom-adoption?utm_source=chatgpt.com">SBOM</a> is essentially an ingredient list for your software, showing all the components inside. The EU’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) now requires manufacturers to create and maintain SBOMs for digital products, which must be available for regulatory checks. SCITT can simplify this process by integrating verification mechanisms directly into the supply chain.</p>



 A Global Push for Legislation 



<p>The primary legislative framework in Europe that covers software supply chain security is the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act">Cyber Resilience Act</a> (CRA). Proposed in September 2022, the CRA introduces mandatory cybersecurity requirements for certain products in order to ensure their security throughout the product lifecycle. The CRA is setting the standard for cybersecurity, mandating secure development practices, vulnerability management, and lifecycle security. </p>



<p>Across the pond, U.S. executive orders also demand greater accountability for third-party software providers, emphasizing secure development attestations and artifact validation. There are two particular ones to pay attention to: </p>



 
 Executive Order on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a> (May 2021) directing federal agencies to improve the security and integrity of software critical to the government’s ability to function.&nbsp;If you’re interested in the supply chain aspects, see Section 4  Enhancing Software Supply Chain Security.  



 Executive Order on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/16/executive-order-on-strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Strengthening and Promoting Innovation in the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a> (January 2025) has an even bigger section (Section 2) on Operationalizing Transparency and Security in Third-Party Software Supply Chains.  
 



<p>Changes in administration can negate executive orders, but I suspect core elements like the supply chain requirements are going to stick around.</p>



 



<p>Supply chain security is evolving, but standards like SCITT, SPIFFE, and WIMSE are still finding their place. If you’re figuring out where these fit in your security strategy or how to engage in standards discussions, let’s talk.  <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/digital-identity-standards-development-services/">See how I help organizations navigate identity standards</a>.</p>



 



 What Is SCITT? 



<p>OK, let’s get back to SCITT. At its core, SCITT provides a framework to ensure integrity and transparency in the software supply chain. It’s about cryptographic proofs, signed attestations, and validated processes that make it easier to trust what you’re building and buying.</p>



 
 SBOM Integration: SCITT enhances the accuracy and traceability of SBOMs. 



 Certified Compiler Tracking: It ensures that trusted tools are used throughout the development process. 



 Compliance Made Simple: SCITT aligns perfectly with regulations like the CRA, making it easier for vendors to meet evolving standards. 
 



 Don’t Forget SPIFFE and WIMSE! 



<p>This isn’t directly an IETF thing, but it’s closely related to SCITT: SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone). SPIFFE addresses a critical challenge—workload identity in cloud-native environments. Think of it as a way to ensure that during builds and deployments, only the right processes are communicating with each other. No more hardcoded credentials or guessing who’s knocking on the door—SPIFFE ensures every workload has a secure and verifiable identity.</p>



<p>Here’s what SPIFFE brings to the table:</p>



 
 Workload Authentication: SPIFFE provides dynamic, secure identities for workloads, removing the need for manual credential management. 



 Securing CI/CD Pipelines: It locks down your build and deployment environments, ensuring only authenticated processes can interact with sensitive systems. 



 Complementing SCITT: Together, SCITT and SPIFFE form a powerful duo, enhancing transparency and security at every stage of the supply chain. 
 



<p>But wait—what about WIMSE, the Workload Identity for Multi-System Environments effort? Does it cover the same ground as SPIFFE? Well, kind of, but not exactly. Here’s the deal:</p>



 
 WIMSE: Focuses on creating vendor-neutral standards for managing workload identities across diverse systems. It’s about defining best practices and protocols to make sure everyone is playing by the same rules. 



 SPIFFE: Provides the frameworks and tools to implement those principles in real-world systems. In other words, SPIFFE is more about the “how,” while WIMSE is about the “what” and “why.” 
 



<p>Chatting with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/ietf@justin.richer.org">Justin Richer</a>, co-chair of the WIMSE working group, he helped me clarify the difference: SPIFFE is defining the tools for assigning and trusting the identities; WIMSE is defining the protocols and practices around them.</p>



 How SCITT, WIMSE, and SPIFFE Fit Together 



<p>Here’s how these three puzzle pieces come together to form a strong foundation for modern software supply chains:</p>



 
 SCITT: Verifies the integrity and transparency of the supply chain through cryptographic proofs and attestations. 



 WIMSE: Defines the standards and best practices for managing workload identities, ensuring a consistent approach across environments. 



 SPIFFE: Implements those standards with secure, dynamic identities that can be integrated into SCITT workflows. 
 



<p>Together, they ensure:</p>



 
 Trustworthy SBOMs: By verifying and securing every component in the supply chain. 



 Secure Build Environments: Through workload authentication and protection of CI/CD pipelines. 



 Compliance with Global Regulations: Aligning with frameworks like the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). 
 



 Why This Matters to Vendors and Product Teams 



<p>Cybersecurity practitioners don’t need to be convinced (I hope) about the importance of the work happening at the supply chain level. I want to make the case, though, that this matters to a much wider audience. While sales engineers and product teams may be ready to dismiss these deep, dark frameworks and standards as theoretical, recognize that SCITT and SPIFFE deliver practical, real-world benefits:</p>



 
 Building Trust: Customers and regulators increasingly demand transparency. SCITT and SPIFFE ensure your supply chain is secure and verifiable. 



 Staying Competitive: Security is no longer a “nice to have.” Vendors who embrace these frameworks gain a clear market edge. 



 Reducing Risks: From <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know">SolarWinds</a> to open-source vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks are a thing. These tools help mitigate those threats. 



 Operational Efficiency: Automating security processes reduces complexity, saving time and resources. There is SO MUCH going on in terms of attacks and defense, automating your security processes is not really optional.  
 



 Wrapping It Up 



<p>Efforts like SCITT, SPIFFE, and WIMSE might not grab headlines like the latest tech gadgets, but they’re truly critical and live at the foundation of software security. For vendors and product teams, understanding and leveraging these tools is about staying secure, competitive, and ahead of the curve. For me, I’m definitely going to keep my finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the space. My own decisions on what software and services I purchase or recommend will absolutely be influenced by these efforts. </p>

			 Trump Administration’s Impact on Tokenization: Is the Golden Age Upon Us? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>For years, US financial institutions have faced significant hurdles in adopting tokenization, primarily due to regulatory uncertainty and operational challenges. But recent changes under the Trump administration are clearing these obstacles, paving the way for the golden age of tokenization in the United States.</p>
 Breaking the Custody Barrier 
<p>The SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) created a major roadblock by requiring institutions holding tokenized assets for clients to report these as liabilities on their balance sheets.</p>
<p>This increased financial exposure discouraged institutions from offering custody services. With the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/staff-guidance/staff-accounting-bulletins/staff-accounting-bulletin-122?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PZKd2ybVDjst5_qELueLb9CBWllbDQalMpMKV-R-dFSqSIQAAdixo_pveyG8WzYtMAL7Z">repeal of SAB 121</a>, this burden has been lifted, enabling institutions to provide custody solutions for tokenized securities without unnecessary financial risk.</p>
 Public Blockchains Gain Regulatory Support 
<p>Institutions have long recognized the value of public blockchains for tokenized assets, removing silos, ensuring transparency, and unlocking interoperability. However, regulatory uncertainty left many hesitant to adopt them.</p>
<p>President Trump’s new<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PZKd2ybVDjst5_qELueLb9CBWllbDQalMpMKV-R-dFSqSIQAAdixo_pveyG8WzYtMAL7Z"> executive order on digital assets</a> changes this, ensuring lawful access to public blockchain networks and introducing technology-neutral regulations.</p>
<p>Like other forward-thinking jurisdictions (e.g., E.U., Singapore, Hong Kong), the US now takes a “same assets, same rules” approach, where compliance becomes the focus, not the underlying technology.</p>
<p>Tokeny’s proven solutions, using the ERC-3643 ‘T-REX’ standard, address the critical question of how to enforce compliance on public blockchains, allowing institutions to confidently move forward.</p>
 Stablecoins: Institutionally Accepted On-Chain Cash 
<p>One of the biggest challenges for tokenization has been the absence of on-chain cash that institutions are willing to adopt. Stablecoins, despite their wide adoption by cryptocurrency players, have faced hesitation from financial institutions due to concerns about legitimacy.</p>
<p>The recent executive order promotes lawful USD-backed coins while banning CBDCs in the US. This move not only provides regulatory clarity but also establishes stablecoins as a trusted on-chain cash solution.</p>
<p>While some institutions remain cautious, this shift is expected to accelerate institutional acceptance of cash coins for tokenized securities. It will unlock atomic settlements, where security and cash coexist on the same ledger, and enable automation of processes like capital calls, dividend payments, and more.</p>
<p>The growing demand for dollar-backed stablecoins is creating significant opportunities for tokenized money market funds. Stablecoin issuers will mint more tokens as adoption grows, driving a greater need for collateral that is liquid, safe, and yield-bearing. It’s precisely what tokenized money market funds offer.</p>
<p>At the same time, tokenized MMFs also represent onchain cash with yield, positioning them as an alternative to the first generation of stablecoins, which typically capture yield for themselves. This dynamic introduces both competition and synergy between the two, as stablecoin issuers may turn to tokenized MMFs for reserves, while investors seeking yield-bearing onchain cash could increasingly look to MMFs instead of stablecoins.</p>
<p>Tokeny’s customers are already leading the way. Moreliquid, which tokenized the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund, and Fasanara, which tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills, are capturing this trend with the scalable solutions we provide underneath.</p>
 A Golden Moment for Tokenization 
<p>The challenges are being resolved: regulations are aligning, proven technology like ours is ready, and the market is moving rapidly. Institutions must now ask themselves: What are we waiting for?</p>
<p>We believe this could be the year we bring the first trillion dollars in assets on-chain as an ecosystem. Let’s shape the golden age of tokenization together!</p>

<p>Access control is a key element of cybersecurity, ensuring only the right people access specific systems and data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two major access control models — Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC) — each of which is unique.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For security, identity, and access management (IAM) professionals, knowing when to use each model is critical to balancing security and usability. This guide explains the differences, real-world use cases, and how to choose the right model for your needs.</p>

<p>This post is a strategic collaboration announcement between <a href="http://immu.ai/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Immu.ai</a>, the Holochain Foundation, and Holo. You can check out Immu.ai's <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/immu-ai-and-holochain-foundation-announce-collaboration-to-advance-digital-product-passports-and-data-integrity-1034293563?ref=blog.holochain.org">announcement here</a> and then continue to the rest of this post to get a deeper sense and the wider context of why this collaboration matters.</p><p>I have a garden. I love eating the tomatoes that come out of my garden.&nbsp; Sometimes I love it because they taste better than supermarket tomatoes, but honestly they don’t always taste better than ones I get from the local farmers market, and I still love eating them.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I know the full story of the tomatoes.&nbsp; I know where I got the seeds.&nbsp; I know how they grew, what went into them, how they fared a dry-spell and more.&nbsp; There’s something deeply satisfying about knowing the story of what we eat, what we use, what we wear.</p><p>And it’s more than just satisfying, it’s actually critical to creating healthy systems.&nbsp; In any system where there is no information about an input to that system, there will be an inability to respond.&nbsp; If I don’t know what went into the growing of my tomatoes, I cannot respond to differences between tomato sources.&nbsp; If I know about pesticide use, carbon footprint, labor practices, transportation distances, then I can respond in my choices about which tomatoes to buy.&nbsp; This story is meant simply to show a systemic truth, that in a complex society where goods are produced and flow through a supply chain, we need mechanisms to have that data aggregated and attached to products as they make their way through the economy for the effects of producing those goods to not just be “externalities”.&nbsp;</p><p>We have seen for quite some time formal mechanisms to add some data to our products.&nbsp; USDA Organic, Fair-trade and similar certifications create a bit of added information. It’s rather easy to see the need for generalized, high resolution versions of these kinds of product indicators, but for the whole supply chain of products.&nbsp; It’s rather difficult to figure out how to build ones that have the reliability, transparency, systemic neutrality and incorruptibility we would want for such systems.&nbsp; And now, critically, the EU has mandated phasing in Digital Product Passports that will need to do just that.</p><p>In designing Holochain one of the core principles behind its architecture was for it to provide a substrate in which parties could create a space of engagement in the digital world in which they could all hold each other to account without having to have an intermediary keeping the accounts.&nbsp; These core design criteria led us to create a system where data provenance is a native feature of the framework.&nbsp; This is what is meant when people describe Holochain as “agent-centric”.&nbsp; All actions taken by agents in a given Holochain network include the provenance of that action, and only valid actions determined by the rules-of-engagement of that particular Holochain network, can get recorded. &nbsp; And all of this happens with no intermediary.</p><p>Such a substrate is ideal for creating the kind of transparency and accountability framework that can deliver on the demands of robust Digital Product Passport solutions that are truly decentralized.</p><p>Immu.ai is working on a platform for providing, data modeling, validation, and transparency, in service of Digital Product Passports, and has recognized the value proposition of Holochain to deliver on their commitment to decentralization of their platform. This is why the Holochain Foundation is taking on this strategic collaboration immu.ai together with Holo.&nbsp; We believe it will help deliver on the possibility of living in a world where the full story of the products we consume is available, and can be used to steer our economic participation in directions that aren’t full of collateral damage due to lack of information.&nbsp;</p><p>As a final note, this isn’t the only collaboration in this domain.&nbsp; The Holochain Foundation supports the development of <a href="https://hrea.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">hREA</a>, a Holochain based implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources%2C_Events%2C_Agents?ref=blog.holochain.org">Resource, Event, Agent</a> accounting framework and <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/?ref=blog.holochain.org">valueflows</a> ontology.&nbsp; You can read more about hREA and the Holochain community efforts <a href="https://happeningscommunity.substack.com/p/hrea-unlocking-data-for-regeneration?r=e6jau&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a>.</p>

							 <p>When we spoke last month I told you, that you wouldn’t hear from me again until the product is live. Given this is a monthly newsletter I’m certainly flying in under the radar.</p>  <p>It’s official, we at playhaus have finally delivered the first<a href="https://playhaus.app/?utm_source=beehiiv&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=community-update">&nbsp;working version of growbot</a>. Our go to market feature suite for our playhaus data wallet, that allows businesses to own their digital identity, and now use it to save 30% or more on their advertising investments.</p>  <p>We are in a closed alpha with clients of our agency, and strategic partnerships with friendly agencies, until all operations for onboarding and campaign management have been thoroughly tested. Hopefully about 6 months from now.</p>  <p>Oh, and we continued our 5 year growth streak. So 2025’s off to a great start!</p> 						 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>*if you need a refresher, we’ve been on a mission to build a smart wallet for digital identity since October 2020, because, especially in the age of AI, we believe people should have full ownership over their data &amp; digital breadcrumb trail.</p>

							 <p>All I can say is thank God for LLM’s. The last 12 months, the last 6 in particular, have felt increasingly faster. And given the exhausting drip of narratives out of the space, it makes sense. At the same time, with the pace it which I used to picked up skills without LLM’s to now, it’s a stark night and day difference. I installed a jailbroken, remote car starter, into the steering wheel column and deployed a cloud run instance, both for the first time in the same week. Accomplished is all I can say.</p>  <p>Looking at the numbers for 2024, we fell short of our goal of $100k. We still haven’t carved out much for the operator. Our February newsletter, coming in a short few weeks, will discuss our plans to blow past it, to a new target in 2025.</p> 						 
				 
				 
				 
																										 
				 
				 
				 
							 <p>Much of our plans revolve around the release of our go to market product, and growing our agency client roster. But we have strategic partnerships deploy white label versions of our portal to power other community center projects. They say if you love what you launch, you’ve waited to long.</p>  <p>I have mixed feelings, because I know where a lot of the bugs under the hood lie, and all the features I have yet to duct tape onto this bootstrapped version of a system I’m learning to build in real time. (real devs if you like this project please take this part away from me lol). But after for years of waiting, I am proud to finally be off the runway and building a plane in the air, rather than watching on the ground.</p>

We work with B2B solutions as well, but where sales cycles are less than 3 months.</p>  <p>If you know a business owner, or a marketing manager, of a consumer facing business earning more than $2M+ in annual revenue, than you are our ideal client.

<p>Wiz Researchers Uncover Data Leak in DeepSeek’s Unsecured Database</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/wizfreight/">WIZ</a> researchers found that China-based AI platform DeepSeek exposed over a million records, including user chat prompts and API keys, in an unsecured database. Though taken offline after contact, DeepSeek has not addressed the issue. Experts warn of security risks, while Italy investigates and the U.S. Navy advises against its use. OpenAI is also probing whether DeepSeek trained on ChatGPT outputs. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/exposed-deepseek-database-revealed-chat-prompts-and-internal-data/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--SDVs5T3TIhqFQ58k63cZs8DJlukvtXAZxzMSEWv1CpMzVGXI8-UR0sQTIO8hGasl5sATC">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Industry Coalition Urges Trump Administration to Accelerate Mobile Driver’s Licenses and Digital Identity Adoption</p>



<p>An industry coalition is urging the Trump administration’s DOGE to accelerate mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and digital identity adoption to fight fraud. The Better Identity Coalition called for state grants and private-sector partnerships. While Biden considered an executive order on digital identity, it didn’t materialize, though his cyber directive included anti-fraud measures. The Trump administration has maintained Biden’s directive, supporting mDL funding and identity verification standards. <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2025/01/industry-coalition-presses-doge-to-act-on-digital-identity/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--SDVs5T3TIhqFQ58k63cZs8DJlukvtXAZxzMSEWv1CpMzVGXI8-UR0sQTIO8hGasl5sATC">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Australia’s Big Four Banks Adopt ConnectID for Secure and Consent-Based Digital Identity Verification</p>



<p>Australia’s four largest banks—Commonwealth Bank, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nab/">NAB</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/anz/">ANZ</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/westpac/">Westpac</a> —now offer ConnectID, a digital identity solution by Australian Payments Plus (AP+). Acting as a secure intermediary, ConnectID enables users to share only necessary information during transactions with full consent, without storing or accessing customer data. Businesses benefit by reducing the need to manage sensitive information. Awareness of digital identity solutions in Australia has risen, with 72% of Australians familiar with them as of December 2024. <a href="https://thepaypers.com/online-mobile-banking/australian-banks-enable-secure-digital-identity-with-connectid--1271951?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--L4lCZ5WpqBgYg_k8t7hhfSxvxf1O4gGXmPGzZNSet1SOmgdGQBjmBUctb15arbdDSp0RD">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Apple Patches Zero-Day Bug in Core Media, Enables Apple Intelligence by Default in Latest Updates</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple/">Apple</a>‘s latest updates for iPhone, iPad, and Mac enable Apple Intelligence by default on newer devices and patch security bugs, including a zero-day vulnerability in Core Media. Hackers exploited the flaw to gain elevated privileges, affecting devices on iOS versions before 17.2. Apple has fixed the issue but did not disclose details on its discovery or targets. This is 2025’s first actively exploited iOS vulnerability, following seven similar cases in 2024. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/apple-fixes-zero-day-flaw-affecting-all-devices/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--L4lCZ5WpqBgYg_k8t7hhfSxvxf1O4gGXmPGzZNSet1SOmgdGQBjmBUctb15arbdDSp0RD">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>OpenAI Launches Operator, an Autonomous AI Agent, Amid Concerns Over Oversight and Trust</p>

<p>DeepSeek’s AI Breakthrough Disrupts Global Tech, Sparks Chip Stock Selloff, and Raises Cybersecurity Concerns</p>



<p>Chinese AI firm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepseek-ai/">DeepSeek AI</a> has shaken the global tech sector with its R1 and V3 AI models, matching top Western counterparts at a fraction of the cost. Training V3 on just over 2,000 Nvidia chips for $5.6M—far below the $100M–$1B spent by U.S. firms—DeepSeek’s efficiency triggered a chip stock selloff, with Nvidia plunging 15% and the Nasdaq dropping 3%. Beyond financial impact, DeepSeek’s cost-effective AI raises cybersecurity and military concerns, as it could democratize AI capabilities for various actors, including those with malicious intent. The breakthrough challenges U.S. export controls, intensifies the AI arms race, and could reshape the economics of AI development worldwide. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/chip-stocks-tumble-after-chinas-deepseek-ai-models-raise-doubts-over-u-s-tech-dominance-9799591b?mod=tech_lead_story&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8rbgCNmF4lYxz53nREmg9uLkVCuVpmYTKXXbSO_NZzCGNqnKAhxKLhX_ihti0q6DnjOp7m">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>DeepSeek Temporarily Halts New Sign-Ups for AI Assistant App Amid Malicious Attacks and User Surge</p>



<p>DeepSeek’s AI Assistant app, a top-ranked ChatGPT rival, has temporarily restricted new sign-ups due to “large-scale malicious attacks.” While existing users remain unaffected, new registrations faced outages and performance issues. Initially, DeepSeek required a mainland China mobile number for sign-ups, but this has since been removed, allowing Google, Apple ID, and email registration. It’s unclear if the issue is solely due to attacks or a surge in users, as the app recently topped the U.S. App Store charts. DeepSeek has provided limited details, and the situation is still unfolding. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/27/24353023/deepseek-ai-app-restricting-sign-ups-malicious-attacks?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8rbgCNmF4lYxz53nREmg9uLkVCuVpmYTKXXbSO_NZzCGNqnKAhxKLhX_ihti0q6DnjOp7m">(Source)</a></p>

<p>France Expands Binance Probe Over Money Laundering And Terrorist Financing</p>



<p>French authorities have expanded their investigation into Binance for money laundering and terrorist financing, covering activities from 2019 to 2024. The probe examines allegations of habitual money laundering linked to drug trafficking and tax fraud, as well as unauthorized marketing via influencers. This follows Binance’s $4.3 billion fine by U.S. officials in 2023 for similar violations. Despite receiving registered status in France in 2022, the exchange now faces scrutiny over customer complaints and inadequate disclosure, with the case referred to client protection and anti-fraud agencies. <a href="https://thepaypers.com/online-mobile-banking/france-deepens-probe-into-binance-over-alleged-ml--1272004?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-924QBzv3vIlqPi-5MtT7Uxy_G620OCJL2dcAbPb3FKsgwC5oZ9PEKM96REnXScFogGzV61">(Source)</a></p>

The need to network, collaborate, and lead often feels overwhelming. </p><p>“At work, I don’t always feel comfortable sharing my vulnerabilities,” Brunna admitted. </p> “Sometimes, being honest about feeling nervous can be seen as a weakness, and that’s not something I want to show.” <p>Even simple tasks, like asking her boss for vacation time, can spark overthinking. </p><p>“I wanted to ask for some time off, but my boss didn’t respond right away, and I found myself wondering: Is it too soon to ask? How should I phrase it?” </p><p>Instead of spiraling into doubt, she turned to Kin. </p><p>“I asked Kin how to approach the conversation,” she shared. “It helped me frame my request in a way that felt professional and clear. That gave me the confidence I needed to actually bring it up with my boss.”</p> Finding Support in the Right Tools <p>Brunna found a way to manage her challenges with Kin. What started as curiosity about the <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">personal AI</a> app quickly became an indispensable part of her routine.</p> “<a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a> feels like a safe space where I can open up without fear of judgment,” Brunna explained. <p>“It’s helped me prepare for difficult conversations at work, organize my thoughts, and even reflect on my emotions.”</p><p>One feature of Kin that stood out for her was how the <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companion</a> visualizes conversations. </p><p>“I love how it creates diagrams of what I share,” she said. “It’s helped me better understand myself, and it’s even something I plan to share with my therapist.”</p><p>Kin’s privacy features also gave her the confidence to open up. </p><p>“Knowing that my data is secure and won’t be shared is so important.

<p>Identity verification has emerged as a key component of modern enterprise security as rules tighten and cyber threats, increasingly powered by AI, grow in volume and effectiveness. Emerging technology, changing attack patterns, and new regulations are all influencing how companies validate identities.</p> 
<p>Traditional identity proofing and verification methods — which are generally employed only at fixed checkpoints such as employee onboarding — are no longer enough. The prevalence of hybrid workforces, the advancement of fraud techniques, and the demand for seamless user experiences, are driving a shift toward continuous, contextual identity proofing. As we go into 2025, we look at key identity verification challenges and trends and their effects on workplace security.</p> 
 Rise In Interview and Onboarding Fraud  
<p>It's increasingly common for organizations to discover (eventually) that the candidate they thought they hired for a role is not the person that joins the company. The FBI and other agencies have issued multiple alerts about fake IT workers from North Korea infiltrating U.S. companies by using fabricated or stolen identities. The most <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250123">recent FBI statement</a> warns that the stakes have grown higher, with North Korean IT workers extorting victims by holding stolen proprietary data and code hostage until the companies pay a ransom.</p> 
<p>The focus on the threat from North Korea however, while undeniably severe, masks the growing and widespread nature of the issue. Fraudsters exploit the ubiquity of remote work to pull a bait and switch, using deepfakes or stand-ins to impersonate job candidates during interviews and verification processes. The person that shows up on day one, and granted system access, isn’t the same person who went through the initial screening. Motivations range from the somewhat innocuous, for example trying to land a job the person isn’t qualified for, to malicious attempts to gain access to corporate systems. Anyone can be a target — HYPR recently exposed its own brush with <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/hypr-unmasks-fake-it-worker">candidate fraud</a> (which was thwarted by our Identity Assurance platform).</p> 
 AI-Powered Help Desk Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Credential resets remain a major vulnerability, with attackers tricking help desk agents to bypass security protocols. Most IT service desks operate with limited staff and handle a high volume of calls, many of which involve password or MFA issues. Attackers often take advantage of human nature and publicly available information to deceive service desk personnel, ultimately gaining access to legitimate credentials. Once inside, they can access sensitive systems, escalate privileges, and move laterally within an organization — often without triggering security alerts.</p> 
<p>These attacks are particularly dangerous because they sidestep traditional security controls. Even with strong authentication policies in place, a well-executed social engineering attack can grant an adversary the same access as an authorized employee. Cybercriminals use tactics like creating a sense of urgency, posing as high-ranking executives, or leveraging insider-like information — often stolen or scraped from public sources — to make their requests seem credible. Generative AI has made these schemes even more convincing, allowing attackers to mimic speech patterns, craft realistic emails, or even generate deepfake voices in real time.</p> 
<p>Preventing help desk social engineering with HYPR</p> 
 Adoption of Multi-Factor Verification  
<p>The intensifying attacks on workforce system vulnerabilities underscore the critical need for enterprises to implement adaptive, robust identity proofing methods capable of detecting and neutralizing these sophisticated threats. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-rise-of-multi-factor-verification">Multi-factor verification</a> (MFV) has emerged as a logical evolution of traditional multi-factor authentication (MFA). Instead of relying on authentication as the primary gatekeeper, MFV makes adaptive, risk-based identity verification an intrinsic part of daily access flows. It integrates factors like behavior, biometrics, and contextual signals to continuously validate user identity throughout the session. MFV can address weak spots in critical processes like credential recovery and device registration, which traditionally use insecure methods such as knowledge-based answers and help desk calls.</p> 
<p>Consider a situation where a user logs in from a trusted device but behaves in an unexpected manner, for example accessing files that aren’t typical for their role or working from a different location. Based on these risk signals, MFV adjusts in real time, raising the required verification levels. By ensuring that verification aligns with the perceived threat and situational risk, MFV not only reduces the risk from compromised credentials, it provides a quicker, less intrusive process.</p> 
 NIST 800-63-4: Upping the Identity Verification Stakes  
<br> 
<p>The draft <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/">NIST SP 800-63-4</a> guidelines, slated for release in 2025, introduce significant updates to strengthen identity proofing and verification standards. These include stricter provisions for remote identity proofing, incorporating advanced methods such as biometric matching and live document verification for remote onboarding. The draft standards also emphasize risk assessment, encouraging organizations to evaluate the risk level of each identity-related transaction and apply verification measures accordingly. Fraud detection is another area of focus, with requirements to detect and mitigate potential fraud during verification processes.</p> 
<p>The guidelines highlight the shift toward continuous identity verification as a critical component of identity assurance. Enterprises looking to align with NIST 800-63-4 will need to adopt rigorous, scalable solutions to improve security while meeting compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Emergence of Decentralized Identity  
<p>Decentralized identity systems will start to gain traction in the workplace in 2025. Organizations can significantly simplify and secure processes like onboarding and credential recovery by incorporating verifiable credentials, such as Microsoft Verified ID credentials, into their identity processes. A modern decentralized identity verification workflow might include the following steps:</p> 
  
  The employee’s identity is verified using advanced proofing methods, such as document capture, liveness detection, and employer attestation.  
  Once verified, the employee receives a secure, verifiable credential issued to their digital wallet.  
  The credential enables the employee to complete tasks like provisioning passkeys, enrolling in benefits, or resetting credentials, all without relying on centralized identity stores.  
  
<p>Example workflow to issue Microsoft Entra Verified ID credentials</p> 
<p>This decentralized approach not only streamlines workflows but also strengthens security by reducing reliance on centralized systems.</p> 
 Preparing for the Future of Identity Verification  
<p>As identity verification trends evolve, organizations must adapt to stay secure and competitive. Multi-factor verification, robust defenses against social engineering, and alignment with emerging standards like NIST 800-63-4 are critical to staying secure. Decentralized identity solutions offer promising advancements in simplifying and securing workforce processes, but only when paired with strong identity proofing practices.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s Identity Assurance platform was built to help organizations navigate these challenges. HYPR integrates phishing-resistant passwordless authentication, adaptive risk mitigation, and automated identity verification into a streamlined and user-friendly access flow. It allows organizations to tailor identity verification processes to fit their specific environments and use cases. For instance, secure self-service options can be used in low-risk situations, while additional measures, such as live video verification, can be invoked in higher-risk scenarios or when anomalies are detected. To see how HYPR can help your organization, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/get-a-demo">schedule a demo</a> tailored to your identity security interests and needs.</p>

But if you already have something in mind, or feel yourself drifting away from the prompt, that’s okay. Just keep writing.</p>  <p>Anything Goes: It doesn’t matter if you write one word, or 10,000. It doesn’t even matter what words they are. What matters is you wrote what you wanted to.</p>  <p>Add Feeling: That being said, many people find it helpful to consider their feelings as they write, and to include them. It might sound cliche, but it helps.</p>  <p>Don’t Push: If you’re finding it really hard to write anything, don’t force it. Just write that you struggled, and come back to it later—even during your next session.</p>  <p>And, remember—Journaling helps inform Kin's Memory about you. The more you use it, the more personal and valuable Kin’s insights will become. You can always discuss your Journal entries or even your feelings in Kin’s regular chat too, if you’re seeking interactivity.</p> Get Started Today with your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Assistant</a>: <p>Ready to start journaling?

<p>This article is written in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunus-g%C3%BCm%C3%BC%C5%9Fsoy/">Yunus Gümüşsoy</a>, the winner of the FOMC data challenge hosted by Ocean Foam in December&nbsp;2024.</p> Introduction <p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on January 28–29, 2025, has garnered significant attention from financial markets, impacting investment strategies across technology, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence sectors. Interest rate decisions are pivotal in shaping economic policy and market sentiment; thus, predicting these outcomes is invaluable for traders, analysts, and policymakers.</p>Fed Funds Interest Rate changes over&nbsp;time<p>To investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) in forecasting FOMC decisions and their market impact, <a href="https://www.ocean-foam.ai/">Ocean Foam</a> and <a href="https://competitions.desights.ai/">Desights</a> organized a <a href="https://competitions.desights.ai/challenge/33">data challenge</a> in December 2024. This initiative aimed to utilize ML techniques to analyze macroeconomic data, financial indicators, and Federal Reserve communications to enhance the accuracy of rate decision predictions.</p><p>This article discusses our findings from the challenge and employs the best-performing ML model to predict the FOMC’s latest decision. As of now, the Federal Reserve has opted to maintain current interest rates after several prior cuts, striving for a balanced economic path amid fluctuating market conditions. We will evaluate our model’s performance while acknowledging areas for improvement.</p> Applying the Model to January&nbsp;2025 <p>Following the success of the December challenge, we applied our highest-performing model to predict outcomes for the January FOMC meeting. We aimed to refine our predictive framework by integrating additional economic indicators, sentiment analysis, and ML optimizations.</p><p>Our analysis considered various macroeconomic factors, although we will highlight only a few key indicators here. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Consumer Price Index (CPI): A vital measure of inflation that significantly influences Fed decisions.  Unemployment Rate: An essential indicator of labor market health, crucial for monetary policy considerations.  Financial Market Trends: Encompassing stock market movements, bond yields, and overall investor sentiment.  Federal Reserve Communications: Analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) to detect shifts in policy&nbsp;tone.  <p>Please refer to the “Understanding Macroeconomic Correlations” section for a comprehensive view of all the factors analyzed.</p><p>We tested multiple ML models to enhance prediction accuracy and ultimately selected a fine-tuned Random Forest model for its balance of interpretability and predictive power. Transparency was essential; we ensured the model’s outputs were understandable and aligned with economic rationale. Our approach involved analyzing FOMC communications to discern tone and underlying messages through sentiment analysis tools. We also examined economic data trends to create features that could aid in predicting future rate&nbsp;changes.</p> Prediction for the January 2025 FOMC&nbsp;Meeting <p>Our model’s probability distribution for the January 29, 2025, FOMC rate decision is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  No change (+0.00%): 51.1% probability  Rate cut (-0.25%): 6.7% probability  Rate cut (-0.50%): 6.9% probability  Rate hike (+0.25%): 35.3% probability  <p>The model indicates a substantial likelihood of no rate change, consistent with the current economic landscape. The new presidential administration favors lower interest rates, so a rate hike appears less probable. However, a 35.3% probability remains for a 0.25% increase, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in market expectations.</p> Understanding Macroeconomic Correlations <p>Understanding the relationship between macroeconomic factors and the Fed Funds Rate is crucial for grasping monetary policy dynamics. To enhance our predictive framework, we examined correlations among key economic indicators.</p><p>Correlation Heatmap of Macroeconomic Factors &amp; Fed Funds&nbsp;Rate</p>Correlation heatmap<p>The heatmap illustrates pairwise correlations among various economic indicators:</p>  High Positive Correlations: Treasury yields (2-year and 10-year) and mortgage rates with the Fed Funds&nbsp;Rate.  Moderate Correlations: CPI and Core CPI reflect the Fed’s focus on inflation trends.  Weaker Relationships: Employment-related factors like unemployment rates remain key considerations but show weaker direct correlations.   Ranked Correlation of Variables with Fed Funds&nbsp;Rate Correlation of variables<p>A bar chart ranks individual macroeconomic factors based on their correlation strength:</p>  Highly Positive Correlations: Bank loan rates, Treasury yields, and mortgage rates are strong indicators of monetary policy adjustments.  Negative Correlations: The unemployment rate, oil prices, and real export rates indicate that rate hikes often correlate with stronger economic conditions and lower unemployment.   Future Improvements and Next&nbsp;Steps <p>While our model shows promising accuracy, there are areas for enhancement:</p>  Enhanced Sentiment Analysis: Incorporating advanced NLP techniques to detect nuanced shifts in Federal Reserve rhetoric.  Expanded Macroeconomic Data: Including additional leading indicators such as consumer spending trends and wage&nbsp;growth.  Real-Time Adaptation: Developing models that dynamically update as new economic data becomes available.  <p>A key takeaway from this challenge is that even advanced models can struggle with real-world uncertainties influenced by political factors or unexpected market shifts. The model’s 35.3% probability of a rate hike underscores this challenge.</p><p>Moving forward, we will focus on refining our models to improve prediction accuracy by incorporating more financial sentiment indicators and macroeconomic trends. By continuously iterating on these approaches, we aim to provide better predictive insights for policymakers, investors, and financial analysts navigating monetary policy complexities.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

				  In the identity industry, ID verification or “IDV” is the term for the process of verifying that a person is who they claim to be. This process plays an important role in establishing trust in Verifiable Credentials by confirming the authenticity of the credential holder’s identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By James Schulte</p>
<p>Industries across finance, government, healthcare, travel, e-commerce, and telecommunications are rapidly adopting Identity Verification (IDV) to enhance security, prevent fraud, and comply with regulatory requirements. Banks and fintech firms are using IDV for KYC and AML compliance, while governments rely on it for issuing passports, digital IDs, and secure citizen access to public services. In healthcare, IDV ensures patient identity for telemedicine and medical records, while travel and transportation sectors use it for seamless airport experiences and ride-sharing safety. As digital interactions grow, businesses are integrating IDV to build trust, reduce fraud, and streamline user authentication, making it a crucial component of modern digital ecosystems.</p>
<p>How IDV works</p>
<p>Identity Verification usually functions by confirming the validity of personal information and documentation provided by the individual against reliable data sources. Some of the steps that can be undertaken during ID verification include:&nbsp;</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Document verification 
						 <p>Examining passports, driver’s licenses, or national ID cards.</p>
<p>These physical documents typically require security features like the holograms or watermarks.</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Biometric verification 
						 <p>Matching biometric information such as facial recognition, fingerprinting, or iris scanning to data that’s been provided on the document.</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Liveness detection 
						 <p>A way of ensuring that that person being verified is physically present and not using a video or picture to spoof the system.</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Database verification 
						 <p>Cross-checking the presented information against trusted databases or registries.</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>IDV + VC = an easy win for everybody</p>
<p>The combination of Identity Verification and Verifiable Credentials creates a powerful framework for secure and efficient digital identity management. Verifiable Credentials extend the range of identity verification technologies by encapsulating the verified data in a privacy-preserving and portable format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credential technology offers the unique ability to securely hold data in a tamper-resistant way, and make it easy to share across systems. They do this by packaging the data created by issuing organizations and digitally signing it in a way where any attempt to alter the data will be visible on the network and “break” the credential. Once created, the credential can be easily and securely stored locally by the data owner in a digital wallet and verified by anyone with the appropriate software. This provides a better experience for the user who no longer needs to repeat redundant identity verification steps, and saves relying parties the costs of verifying each user.</p>
<p>(For a more in-depth look at Verifiable Credentials you can <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">read this short article</a> from Indicio.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>But to use them effectively, we need to be sure that the data inside is correct, we need a strong identity verification process.</p>
<p>An example of this technology combination in action are the government-grade credentials that Indicio has developed that can be self derived from the user’s passport. Used in our solution for SITA and the government of Aruba, these credentials can be created in seconds by scanning the chip inside a biometric passport and performing the necessary document authentication. The generated credential can then be presented digitally to share the relevant information from the passport to the border authorities prior to departure.</p>
<p>In short, these two technologies are highly complementary to each other. The existing IDV processes ensure the quality of the data for the credential, and the Verifiable Credential enables that data to be reused and shared across systems, organizations, and platforms.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about how these technologies work together you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sD8r3gwj4w">watch a recent video from Indicio.</a> Or if you would like to discuss a specific implementation or ask questions of our team please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us here.</a></p>

The use of high-quality fake credentials and AI deepfake presentation and injection attacks defeat these measures with increasing efficacy. Non-secure sharing of documents scatters digital artifacts putting individuals at risk for compromised PII (Personal Identifiable Information).</p>
<p>Solution: 1Kosmos offers around a dozen modalities for identity verification. For high assurance, identity documents are scanned and managed via an end-to-end encrypted workflow that verifies authenticity in real time for 150+ countries globally. Facial scanning hardened against deepfake attacks matches user likeness, issues a pass/fail and can create a digital authentication credential certified to FIDO, NIST, UK DIATF and iBeta Pad-1 specifications.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>· +99% accuracy to verify identity anywhere, anytime and on any device</p>
<p>· Non-biased racial or gender decisioning drives objectivity, equity, and fairness</p>

Knowledge-based <p>These paths see someone build their career through gained knowledge, whether that’s from moving up the corporate ladder, upskilling, studying, or a mixture of the three.</p><p>Human resources, marketing, accounting, information technology, and engineering roles often come under this category.</p> 2. Skills-based <p>Similar to knowledge-based careers, but in relation to physical skills like service, performance arts, or construction. In these roles, experience tends to matter more than anything.</p> 3. Entrepreneur-based <p>A less-standardized path, entrepreneur-based career paths see people begin their own company to fill an identified market gap. The path often includes the elements of knowledge- and experience-gaining the previous two paths contain, but with the end goal of creating and maintaining a new successful company.</p> 4. Freelance-based <p>Landing somewhere between the first two paths and the entrepreneur-based path, freelance-based career paths see people offer out their knowledge and skills on a temporary basis to businesses and individuals.</p><p>It’s most common for writers, consultants, tradespeople, and artists to offer their services in this way, but most professions can.</p><p>It can be useful for people to know which career path they fall under, as this can help them recognise their natural tendencies, and create <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/set-specific-goals-with-kin">effective goal setting</a> toward an ambition.</p> The Five Career Pathways <p>The five career pathways often come up in career discussions, and refer to the five health science career pathways—the specific routes people can take into a healthcare career.<a>2</a></p><p>While not extensively covered in this article, these are:</p>  <p>Diagnostic Services</p>  <p>Therapeutic Services</p>  <p>Health Informatics</p>  <p>Support Services</p>  <p>Biotechnology Research &amp; Development</p>  <p>Though these can be helpful if considering a way into a healthcare career, they are not as broad as their four traditional kin above.</p><p>Early on in a career journey, it’s still worth asking questions like “is technology a good career path?” or “what about business management?” to reflect on paths travelled so far, and find the best personal fit.</p><p>But why is this important?</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a0c6ebc-d271-462d-8347-406dac8b71ad_1280x787.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@omgitsyeshi?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Yeshi Kangrang</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-round-glass-ball-iuqxv7kFj64?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  The Importance of Career Reflection <p>Career reflection is crucial to professional growth, because it helps individuals take control of their own career and make informed decisions about their career trajectory.

Thorough Assessment <p>Firstly, to assess a current position along a career trajectory, take stock of everything that has been experienced up to this moment. This process is often supported by mentors, career counselors, or, as will be discussed, personal AI tools like Kin.</p><p>Consider factors like:</p>  <p>Specific Skills: What has been learnt, and how advanced is the knowledge? Remember to include hard and soft skills.</p>  <p>Level of Responsibility: How much has been trusted to these skillsets?</p>    <p>Years of Experience: How long has this career journey been so far? How long has each skill been learnt and applied for?</p>    <p>Scope of impact: What has been achieved by those skills in that time?</p>  <p>Comparison to Industry Standards for your field. LinkedIn and other professional organizations often provide benchmarks for different career stages, from entry-level to executive positions.</p>   2. Practical Evaluation <p>Next, consider how effectively and easily these skillsets were gained, and what they bring to the current career trajectory stage. Were there faster ways to reach the same level? Are there new skills needed to fill gaps growing within these specific skills?</p> 3. Emotional Evaluation <p>Now, look at the previous step from an emotional perspective. What feelings do those skills—and the ways they were acquired—provoke? Does the current level of ability in this career path and progress inspire pride, indifference, or disappointment? What situation (or even different career paths) might have been preferred? Does this experience align with personal values?</p><p>This step can feel superfluous to some, but it’s not just an essential step for growing emotional intelligence—it can often reveal the culprit behind burnout and job dissatisfaction.</p> 4. Reconsider Goals: <p>Finally, review any career goals alongside this information. Is the current career trajectory leading to these goals? Are these goals even still what’s wanted? What new roles or skills are needed, and how can this career trajectory be updated to meet them?</p><p>Initiatives like <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-151688310?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">continuous learning</a> or <a href="https://docs.mykin.ai/collections/9923418-journaling">journaling</a> may be implemented here to help.</p><p>But what comes next?</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F440ad56d-bb7c-4c85-912a-6fa312442c26_1600x950.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@writeria?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Mélanie Arouk</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/pink-lotus-flower-on-river-close-up-photo-AXJWnloQ3CA?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  Building an Effective Career Reflection Practice <p>Next is all about ensuring the assessment process above is carried out regularly, effectively, and with sustainability. This helps personal career goals always stay true to personal ambitions, as it informs effective milestones for both entry-level workers and experienced professionals.</p><p>To do this, consider the following steps to help make this a strong habit:</p> 1. Define Preferences <p>Decide what medium, time and location is best for the career reflection.</p><p>Are notebooks easier to use, or is a touchscreen or keyboard preferred? Are mornings uncluttered, or does the night finally give space to think? Is a bustling environment appreciated, or is quiet solitude?</p><p>Ensuring that the best personal working conditions can be arranged like this will minimize distractions and irritations.</p> 2. Foster Consistency <p>Now, look for ways to connect these preferences to existing habits to make them easier to keep. Have five minutes on the morning train? Jot down some thoughts. Like a Saturday snooze? Reflect on the week once you wake up.</p><p>The tighter reflection is tied to old habits, the easier it will be to remember to do it as well.</p> 3. Have Conversations <p>Finally, talk about the findings. Tell friends, family, colleagues, mentors, personal AI, everyone. Each person has a unique insight and perspective to share, and can do so from within their own career pathway, and not anyone else’s.</p><p>But, that can be a lot of work. How can this be more effective?</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c486593-eed2-4d86-b0e3-b4fc1c957bcc_1600x1066.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@heapdump?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Patrick Lindenberg</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/photo-of-optical-disc-drive-1iVKwElWrPA?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  The Role of <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> in Career Reflection <p>Digital tracking and pattern recognition capabilities in AI tools like <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbots</a> and <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companions</a> have transformed how professionals understand themselves, their colleagues, and their career trajectories.</p><p>Technology like these machine learning algorithms can analyze years of career and behaviour data to identify trends in employee and global industry behaviour alike, meaning employees and their companies can respond to them more quickly than ever.</p><p>Other AI tools like <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI assistants</a> make it easier for both employers and employees to track employee engagement, upskilling, and performance by logging information about these metrics, and analyzing it against their datasets.

  The Journey of Laundered Money: A Deep Dive into AML Compliance

Follow the path of "dirty money" through its three stages – placement, layering, and integration – and discover how robust AML processes can break the chain at each step.

<p>Picture this: A luxury apartment in a bustling city is purchased for cash by an unknown buyer through a string of anonymous shell companies. The sale raises no eyebrows, but behind the scenes, a complex money laundering operation is underway. From illicit origins to seemingly legitimate assets, this is the journey of “dirty money”—and the fight against it begins with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks.</p>



<p>Let’s follow the path of laundered money through its three stages—placement, layering, and integration—and see how robust AML processes can break the chain at each step.</p>



 



 Stage 1: Placement — Getting Illicit Cash Into the System 



<p>It starts with a duffel bag of cash in a bustling financial district. The launderer’s challenge? Converting a pile of questionable money into something less conspicuous. Enter placement, where funds are introduced into the financial system.</p>



 
 The Tactic: Instead of depositing a large sum into a single account (a major red flag), the launderer sends small amounts across multiple accounts at different branches—also known as “smurfing.” Some of the funds are funneled into luxury car purchases or jewelry, quickly flipped for cash. 



 The Risk: At this stage, banks may notice unusual deposits or sudden asset purchases. But if no AML checks are in place, the funds slide through undetected. 
 



<p>How AML Helps: Customer due diligence (CDD) kicks in here—verifying identities, tracking transaction patterns, and flagging customers depositing amounts that don’t match their profiles. Advanced systems automatically cross-check data against watchlists and issue alerts for suspicious activity.</p>



 



 Stage 2: Layering — Disguising the Money’s Origins 



<p>The launderer now faces the next hurdle: making the funds untraceable. In the layering phase, the money is moved across accounts, companies, and borders to obscure its origins.</p>



 
 The Tactic: The funds pass through shell companies, offshore accounts, and even fake invoices for “business expenses.” Wire transfers bounce from one country to another, each hop making the trail more complex. 



 The Cover Story: To the outside world, it looks like a series of standard business transactions—payments for consulting services or shipments that never existed. 
 



<p>How AML Helps: This is where transaction monitoring tools shine. They flag unusual patterns, such as frequent international transfers to high-risk regions or round-dollar amounts that match no legitimate business activity. Machine learning algorithms detect when these activities deviate from normal behavior, even in large, global transaction flows.</p>



 



 Stage 3: Integration — Making the Money Look Legitimate 



<p>Once the money has been sufficiently disguised, it’s time to bring it back into the economy—cleaned and ready for “legitimate” use. This is the integration phase, where illicit funds reappear as real estate investments, stock portfolios, or lavish lifestyle purchases.</p>



 
 The Tactic: The launderer buys a $5 million penthouse outright, claiming the money came from the sale of a successful business. They might also repay large loans or invest in companies with stable returns, embedding the funds into the economy. 



 The Challenge: At this stage, the money looks like it belongs. Without context, it’s difficult to distinguish legitimate earnings from laundered funds. 
 



<p>How AML Helps: Enhanced due diligence (EDD) is key here. When a transaction or customer’s background raises red flags—such as ties to politically exposed persons (PEPs) or untraceable revenue sources—EDD digs deeper, collecting additional data and scrutinizing high-value purchases. Automated systems provide detailed audit trails, ensuring nothing is missed.</p>



 



 The Human Cost of Failure 



<p>When laundered money flows freely, the consequences are far-reaching—fueled criminal enterprises, destabilized economies, and reputational damage for financial institutions. But with robust AML processes, institutions can stop dirty money in its tracks, ensuring their systems don’t become conduits for crime.</p>



 



 A Future-Ready AML Strategy 



<p>Gone are the days when manual audits were enough. In today’s landscape, AML programs must be adaptive, automated, and vigilant. Real-time monitoring, machine learning, and secure data processing are no longer luxuries—they’re necessities.</p>



<p>The difference between catching a launderer at “placement” rather than “integration” could be millions in fines—or worse, a reputation that’s impossible to repair. By embracing advanced AML solutions, financial institutions can protect not just their businesses, but the communities they serve.</p>

Will the construction financing system be over-stressed by the sheer scale and complexity of the&nbsp;rebuild?</p><p>Mattereum has teamed up with the renowned <a href="https://fastrackinstitute.org/">Fastrack Institute</a> and influential Bitcoin infrastructure developers <a href="https://bitscape.io/new/">Bitscape</a> to answer these questions. “Permit to Permanence” envisages a new, faster way to complete critical construction financing steps in the LA rebuilding processes.</p><a href="http://mattereum.com">http://mattereum.com</a> contact us at: policy@mattereum.com<p>The LA rebuild is going to stress permitting, financing, construction, and even legal capacity very hard. $250 billion dollars of rebuilding is going to be needed, and fast. “Permit To Permanence” is the new solution being offered by this consortium of industry veterans that will allow LA to rebuild commercial real estate, homes and lives, with minimal&nbsp;delay.</p><p>Everybody wants to get back to a “new normal” — they want to “build back better” and to get out of crisis conditions and back to normal, but this time a normal which will not risk their home inadvertently trending on social media again. We can help get people back home safely by expediting the “Permit to Permanent” journey. To start that journey, proposed buildings need permits, affirming that the construction is safe before it proceeds. This is particularly vital in earthquake-prone LA. The faster they get those permits, the faster rebuilding projects can move to the next stage: financing, which is where our story&nbsp;begins.</p><p>Currently all ways to get funds to the people who need financing to rebuild their homes, businesses and lives are slowed down by bureaucratic red tape and numerous intermediaries all taking their margins. Our consortium has come up with a revolutionary proposition intended to streamline recovery by standardizing the paperwork for various processes including construction finance, and integrating smart contract technology, thus enabling the rapid deployment of capital from the $2 trillion Bitcoin liquidity pool (+$1.5tn of other assets) into the LA rebuilding process. This is Permit to Permanence.</p><p>This breaks revolutionary new ground for Mattereum: we stand on firm foundations in disaster. Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta started the company in 2017, after 15 years of experience in emergency sheltering and critical infrastructure modelling (and associated fields). When it was launched, one of Mattereum’s long term goals was to use the company’s innovative blockchain lawtech to streamline disaster reconstruction.</p><p>Mattereum’s innovations have been deeply rooted in the Ethereum blockchain, which has always been able to provide the smart contract architecture that Bitcoin did not. Now though, using Bitscape’s creativity, it has become possible to operate smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain, to access a much larger pool of working capital. These smart contracts make Mattereum’s innovations work just as well on Bitcoin as on Ethereum, something that a year ago would have been dismissed as impractical. Mattereum will, of course, continue to offer services on Ethereum.</p><p>The Bitcoin community’s entrepreneurial mindset and technical sophistication makes it particularly suited to providing the financial infrastructure needed to rapidly deploy massive capital to support rebuilding efforts. By connecting this digital breakthrough to Fastrack’s framework for empowering cities to bring together their leaders and inhabitants to find solutions for critical civic problems, you have a technique machine-tooled to provide the financial infrastructure needed to rapidly deploy capital and kickstart rebuilding efforts in Los Angeles, and ultimately, anywhere in the world. This is a sophisticated new approach to streamlining finance for disaster recovery in the&nbsp;US.</p><a href="http://lalaunchpad.org/">http://lalaunchpad.org/</a><p>Vinay also has prior experience in helping with the housing crisis in Los Angeles, having seen his “hexayurt” emergency shelter technology, developed in 2002, adopted by the <a href="http://lalaunchpad.org/#">LA Launchpad</a> project. There, church groups and others provided hexayurt emergency shelters to homeless people in the city as a winterized alternative to tents. Hexayurts are durable structures made from cheap, readily available materials designed to be fabricated quickly post-disaster to provide emergency shelters that do not have to be stockpiled and then shipped in from far away warehouses.</p><p>CEO Vinay Gupta says “As soon as I saw what was happening in LA, I knew this is exactly what my path had prepared me for. When I worked at Rocky Mountain Institute I saw that building and rebuilding in the era of unprecedented natural disasters would need a new systematic approach. I went on to develop this, taking in aid transparency, ultra-efficient disaster architecture and critical infrastructure design. I then project managed the Ethereum launch and went on to set up Mattereum to create the highly transparent global transactional technology needed for world trade, and yes, disaster relief. This LA project puts all that into action. We will achieve fast “permit-to-permanence” via Bitcoin financing.”</p><p>As far back as 2009, Vinay was also a pioneering innovator in decentralised finance (DeFi) and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) having helped get over 100,000 solar lighting units deployed in refugee camps. Based on that experience, he developed <a href="http://files.howtolivewiki.com/The_Global_Village_Development_Bank_v2.pdf">a proposal</a> for a new system for financing distributed infrastructure deployments. The goal was to reduce barriers to infrastructure investment. The goal was encourage the financing of “build back better” distributed infrastructure solutions after natural disasters, by solving issues in project contracting, monitoring, and reporting. In 2009 he wrote “The challenge is to imagine full end-to-end decentralization in infrastructure, including financing. Every step can be decentralized, from raising the capital, allocating it to loans or triple-bottom-line investments, deploying the infrastructure systems, repaying the loans and measuring the impacts”.</p><a href="http://files.howtolivewiki.com/The_Global_Village_Development_Bank_v2.pdf">http://files.howtolivewiki.com/The_Global_Village_Development_Bank_v2.pdf</a> (2009)<p>15 years ago we started the journey that led us here, today, with the capability to expedite the flow of funds into fire-worn LA. Going from technology to lawtech and back has been a round trip for the ages. Our understanding has matured over all of those years. We really do have the tools to help&nbsp;here.</p><p>The new consortium can help people get back to their homes&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Reach us at: <a href="mailto:policy@mattereum.com">policy@mattereum.com</a></p><p>The consortium wants to grow rapidly to meet these challenges. If you have relevant expertise in LA planning/zoning, compliant prefab and modular building systems, are on the ground hoping to rebuild (particularly multi-family/commercial, or large numbers of homes), please immediately send us an email about your capabilities or needs. The consortium and its members are also looking for resources to scale operations.</p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/aerial-photography-of-the-downtown-la-skyline-14657304/">https://www.pexels.com/photo/aerial-photography-of-the-downtown-la-skyline-14657304/</a> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/getting-home-permit-to-permanence-the-new-normal-and-financing-the-rebuilding-of-la-with-bitcoin-8b9bd21300a3">Getting home: financing the rebuilding of LA with Bitcoin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

							  AI Isn’t A Bubble. Software Is.   <p>I’m typically either two years too early or two seconds too late. And for a hot sec, the latter seemed totrue once again this past week, as the AI sector crashed — moments after I entered it in earnest.</p>  <p>My capacities as a dev have continue to grow week over week as I struggle through the deployment of&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/products/growbot/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=inb4-memecoins-go-mainstream">playhaus’ MVP</a>&nbsp;to Google’s Cloud Platform. (Which I am probably still doing as we speak.) Of course, when I say “capacities as a dev”, I mean “cursing out an AI-powered coding chatbot until it gets results”, but hey. It&nbsp;does&nbsp;get results. More than all my past dev hires combined, if that tells you anything.</p>  <p>That’s not all. Over the weekend, I finally started a project with LangChain, a framework for developing custom AI agents and operators. I was psyched to finally start dancing at the party — up until the music unceremoniously stopped. As you’ve surely heard, China’s industrial machine responded to the erstwhile TikTok ban with DeepSeek, an open-source LLM that can apparently outperform ChatGPT and was developed in a fraction of the time, for a fraction of the cost. Blue-chip AI stocks promptly plummeted, right as I was getting my feet wet.&nbsp;Sigh.&nbsp;Just a simple guy, trying to leverage the Solana Agent SDK, so I can build some memecoin sniper bots and buy myself a vacation.</p>  <p>Fortunately, the rout didn’t last long. Investors are already buying the dip today, and I can’t say I’m surprised, given the rise of the AI meta in the web3 space, the success of&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/heartsol/35-crypto-billionaire-in-chief/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=inb4-memecoins-go-mainstream">AI meme coins</a>, and the 180 on SAMA’s costly AI training clusterfuck, Project Stargate. The reports of the AI bubble’s burst were greatly exaggerated.</p>  <p>As much as we may fall on the anti-Big-Tech side of the spectrum, I can’t argue in good faith that this is a bad thing. We should be hopeful for NVIDIA, and the future of the hardware side of these businesses, because demand for computers will scale exponentially. Our reliance on technology all but guarantees it. (At least, until we start getting into organic-based computation. But I’m sure NVIDIA has R&amp;D in the space already.) Efficiency gains in energy consumption or processing capacity shouldn’t scare the markets.</p>  <p>What should scare the markets are open-source models, decentralized computation networks, and community-owned applications that transform our current internet infrastructure from digital fiefdoms to a true public utility. The software moat is bloated and over-valued in this environment.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In other words, AI isn’t a bubble, but software is.</p>  <p>The short-lived fall of TikTok exposed the fallibility of even the biggest tech players. Now, imagine if the ban didn’t come from the outside, but from within. A digital asset custody protocol — encompassing the assets that represent you, your digital identity, and enabling you to choose the level of your privacy and benefit from the resale or licensing of data — could bring some of the biggest companies in the world to their knees.</p>  <p>AI isn’t going anywhere. But it requires that very same data to train, update, and optimize it. Cut off access to it (or, even better, make companies pay for it) and it could cripple the majority of profitable operations for software giants like Microsoft and Google.</p>  <p>Of course, that raises a big follow-up question: What is the killer consumer app that takes us there? And another one, in the case of this newsletter: How do we keep it from centralized control?</p>  <p>Our friend and advisor Branden suggests we build on the existing idea from Newglenn.eth, AI memecoins of sunset legacy brands like Enron, Blockbuster, or even PanAM but imbued with the power of pseudo-sentience, through the creation of character-based LLM. So basically, the OG Wendy’s Twitter account, but instead of an intern dragging anons, it’s an AI agent dragging web2 walled gardens all to hell.</p>  <p>(And potentially a community of fans voting on token weights, with their tokens, to adjust the personality of the brand character, or allowing the bot to spend its tokens to build up a new business from the brand? Okay, okay. I’ll stop boring y’all and just tell it to my AI coding bot instead. Can’t wait to see what it spits out.)</p>  <p>—El Prof</p>

							         INB4 Memecoins Go Mainstream   <p>With DOGE now officially the name of a government agency, and big banks signaling a willingness to embrace crypto as soon as Trump rolls back regulations, we appear to be nearing everyone’s favorite stage of the crypto bull market. I call it the Walmart Announces Web3 Initiative Era.</p>  <p>This was a big thing in the 2021 bull cycle. Even TIME Magazine (which was apparently still a thing at the, heh, time)&nbsp;had its own crypto project. Admittedly, it sort of made sense at the time. That rally was catalyzed by the likes of NFTs and metaverse real estate. And it’s not hard to see why digital collectibles and virtual storefronts might go over well in a boardroom.</p>  <p>The current crypto summer, on the other hand, has been characterized by a very different beast: memecoins. And it’s a lot harder to picture a PR Newswire in which TIME launches one of those. Harder to picture —&nbsp;but not necessarily a worse idea.</p>  <p>If properly done, memecoins provide brands with an entirely new way to extend their influence. The potential for companies and organizations to use memecoins as part of their broader web3 strategy is enormous. Brands with strong legacies are particularly well-suited for memecoin integration. When done right, this approach can tap into a brand’s nostalgia, revive fan loyalty, and even introduce a completely new generation of supporters to their ecosystem.</p>  <p>In a sense, many of today’s most successful memecoins are already linked to prominent brands. Take&nbsp;Dogecoin,&nbsp;for example. The eponymous Shiba Inu meme might not be listed on the Nasdaq. But Dogecoin’s rise in value and popularity is a testament to how the line between a meme and brand can blur into nothingness. As of now, Dogecoin is integrated into platforms like Twitter for tipping and even being considered for use by certain businesses as a method of payment.</p>  <p>So what would it look like if established brands were to launch their own memecoin? Frankly, it could almost be seen as a logical next step for global brands that have already gone in on rewards programs, turning their own apps into a facsimile of a blockchain ecosystem. For example, McDonald’s could release a BigMacCoin to celebrate milestones and offer promotions to token holders, which might attract interest not just from loyal customers, but also retail traders eager to capitalize. (Or just doing it for the meme.)</p>  <p>It might be an even more natural fit for legacy brands that have seen their cultural relevance fade over time, giving them a unique opportunity to tap into an emerging culture to regain attention and bolster their image. Let’s say&nbsp;Nokia, once the king of mobile phones before being dethroned by smartphones, created a&nbsp;NokiaCoin&nbsp;to mark its comeback. Tapping into the nostalgia of the iconic Nokia 3310 —&nbsp;and the inherent irony of the phone that “never dies” — the coin could ignite the web3 version of a meme stock rally and inject a shot of adrenaline into a dying brand. But unlike a pure memecoin, Nokia is still a multibillion-dollar company, capable of offering real value to holders, perhaps in the form of limited-edition hardware or exclusive events.</p>  <p>Topping my personal list of somewhat realistic memecoin adopters would be trendy companies like Twitch and Gucci. Imagine&nbsp;Twitch, launching&nbsp;TwitchCoin&nbsp;as part of its Web3 strategy, allowing content creators to reward their viewers in a decentralized way. Imagine using TwitchCoin to access premium content, exclusive streams, or virtual rewards — blending the power of memecoins with the community-driven nature of the platform. That would be a badass move, and a major growth to crypto world.</p>  <p>Similarly, a fashion giant like&nbsp;Gucci&nbsp;could create&nbsp;GucciCoin&nbsp;to offer token-based access to limited-edition digital apparel in the metaverse or physical goods, rewarding loyal followers and collectors of exclusive designs.</p>  <p>In the end, it’s not just about adding a fun twist to a brand or generating buzz; memecoins offer companies an innovative way to integrate their legacy into the decentralized economy, reinvigorate their community, and explore new avenues for engagement. The future of memecoins holds immense potential, and for brands, it may just be the key to unlocking a new era of customer engagement, legacy revival, and, ultimately, success in the decentralized world.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

Kin can add new information to its memory at any time.</p>  Step Four: Explore Kin's Capabilities <p>Kin can do a lot, and it’s all accessible from Chat. These things include:</p>  <p>Suggesting conversation starters based on its knowledge of you in the Inspiration tab (just press the star icon on the left of the input field!)</p>  <p>Setting custom <a href="https://feedback.mykin.ai/help/articles/0442818-how-to-use-reminders">Reminders</a> for future events or tasks</p>  <p>Searching the web for relevant information</p>  <p>Reviewing and analyzing its memories about you</p>  <p><a href="https://feedback.mykin.ai/help/articles/7086943-how-to-view-and-delete-your-data-in-kin">Deleting Memories</a> you'd rather it forgot</p>  <p>Providing summaries and recounts of your past Chat messages and Journal entries to help you track your behaviour and relationships.</p>   <p>💡 For all of these things, you just need to ask Kin for them in the Chat! There are no excessive menus to tap through here.</p>  Step 5: Visit the Streaks &amp; Stats Tab <p>Return to the homepage using the 'x' button in the top left, then tap the flame icon in the top right to enter the Streaks &amp; Stats tab.</p><p>Here, you can see your daily usage streak and see visually what Kin has added to its <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-use-kins-memory">memory</a> about you today through your conversations. It’s a good way to track the Chat’s impact on Kin’s knowledge of you.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you can <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust</a> that all of this information is safe—it’s stored with complete <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">privacy</a>, so you can have any conversation you want. You can even <a href="https://docs.mykin.ai/articles/7086943-how-to-view-and-delete-your-data-in-kin">delete</a> it whenever you’d like. </p> <p>💡  Tap the connected dots icon in the top right of this tab to view your Knowledge Map, showing everything Kin knows about you and how it's all connected.</p>  Maximizing Your Chat Experience with <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">Personal AI</a> <p>Want to make the most of your conversations with Kin? Here are some proven strategies:</p> 1. Be Specific <p>The more context you provide, the better Kin can help.</p><p>For example—instead of saying "I'm stressed," try explaining what's causing the stress and how it's affecting you. This helps Kin build a more complete understanding of your situation and perspective.</p> 2. Update Regularly <p>Keep Kin informed about changes in your life, whether they're major events or small updates.</p><p>Helping Kin stay up-to-date on your situation means Kin’s pattern-tracking and advice will be more accurate and helpful to you.</p> 3. Ask Questions <p>If you're unsure about something Kin has said, or want to know more about what it knows about you, just ask. Kin can explain its understanding and reasoning, so you can both understand each other better.</p> 4. Use Keywords Intentionally <p>When discussing something you want Kin to remember, try to use clear, specific terms. This helps Kin accurately capture and categorize the information in its memory.</p><p>Remember, you can always ask Kin to make sure it adds something to its memory, or to explain its understanding of something so you can update or correct where needed.</p> 5. Review and Reflect <p>In fact, periodically ask Kin to summarize what it knows about certain aspects of your life. This can reveal interesting patterns, prompt helpful advice, and ensure Kin's understanding of you stays accurate.</p> Extra Tips for Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Companion</a> <p>Here are some additional ways to enhance your Chat experience:</p><p>Stay Consistent: Regular conversations, even brief ones, help build Kin's understanding of you over time.</p><p>Be Honest: Kin's memory is <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">private and secure</a>, so you can be open about your thoughts and feelings.</p><p>Check Highlights: Pay attention to what Kin highlights during conversations—it shows you what it's learning about you.</p><p>Follow Up: If Kin makes a suggestion, try it and report back about how it went. This helps Kin learn what works best for you.</p> Get Started Today with Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Assistant</a> <p>Ready to begin chatting with Kin? <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Download the app</a>, open up the Chat, and start with this simple message:</p> <p>"Hi Kin! Let’s get to know each other. What do you do, and what would you like to know about me?"</p> <p>From there, let the conversation flow naturally. Remember, every chat helps Kin become a more effective support system for you.</p>

<p>ShareRing announces expansion into United States via STARS affiliate program and first ever age verification trial.</p>



<p></p>



<p>January 29, 2025: ShareRing is unveiling its digital age verification technology in the US market with the launch of an ambitious  affiliate marketing strategy and a first ever age verification pilot programme.</p>



<p>Affiliates can play a crucial sales and marketing role by driving adoption and expansion of ShareRing’s technology solutions to new potential customers. </p>



<p><br>“With the launch of the ShareRing Trusted Affiliate Rewards System (STARS) we are leveraging targeted affiliate partnerships and incentive programmes to maximise our success,” said Tim Bos, Co-Founder and CTO of ShareRing.</p>



<p>“With STARS our goal is to access and engage with afflilates who will help us drive sales and generate revenue organically across the US and globally.“</p>



<p>“In the US our initial focus is on the huge nightclubs sector where there is massive potential for the ShareRing Me app to address key challenges such<br>as fake IDs, streamlined entry processes and compliance requirements,” he said.</p>



<p><br>In mid-February ShareRing will showcase the functionality and benefits of its Digital Me technology at an exclusive industry event in Florida, to be followed by a fully-fledged trial of the ShareRing Me app with Miami based nightclubs.</p>



<p>“The age verification pilot will allow us to gather critical feedback, refine our approach, and demonstrate real-world impact to potential nightclub clients,” said Tim Bos.</p>



<p>“The trial will feature our innovative new mini-dApps and Prove technology that works even if there is no mobile phone service. This will mean much faster guest verification, queue management, and overall venue efficiency improvements at nightclubs.“</p>



<p>“There are 70,000 nightclubs across the US, and if we succeed in converting just 2.5% of nightclubs, this will equate to 1,750 venues.“</p>



<p>“Assuming each nightclub averages 20,000 clients per year, there is potential for 35 million ShareRing verification transactions annually in the US.“</p>



<p>“Importantly, each verification transaction using ShareRing’s LINK technology results in a token transaction. This enhances the value of existing tokens and benefits node holders by increasing network activity and demand.“</p>



<p>“As ShareRing uses our own tokens to facilitate transactions, an increase in activity results in a reduction of the circulating supply, enhancing the value and exclusivity of the remaining tokens.”<br></p>



<p></p>

<p>Make this year’s <a href="https://www.fpc.gov/data-privacy-day-2021/">Data Privacy Day</a> the day you take back control of your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-personal-data/#:~:text=It's%20your%20private%20contact%20details,identifiable%20information%20or%20simply%20PII.">personal information</a> online. <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/2024-was-the-biggest-year-for-data-breaches/">Data breaches</a> are at an all-time high and if you don’t already know someone who’s had their personal data stolen, you probably soon will.</p>



<p>Data Privacy Day is held on January 28 each year to mark the anniversary of <a href="https://www.fpc.gov/data-privacy-day-2021/">Convention 108</a>, the first legally binding international treaty dealing with privacy and data protection. In recent years Data Privacy Day has expanded to be part of the larger <a href="https://www.staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-week">Data Privacy Week</a>, simply because <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">protecting personal information</a> is so important.</p>



 Protecting your personal information keeps you safe 



<p>Protecting personal information online is crucial for maintaining <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>, security, and overall wellbeing. It can help you:</p>



 1. Prevent identity theft 



<p>Bad actors can use stolen personal information, such as your social security number, credit card details, or address, to impersonate you. They can use your information to open bank accounts, take out loans, or make unauthorized purchases in your name.</p>



 2. Safeguard financial security 



<p>Sharing sensitive financial details can lead to unauthorized access to your accounts. You might lose money, face fraudulent charges, or have your credit score damaged.</p>



 3. Protect <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> 



<p>Overexposure of personal details can make you vulnerable to stalking, harassment, or unwanted contact. This can lead to emotional distress and invasion of your private life. In extreme cases, it can lead to physical or mental health harm.</p>



 4. Avoid social engineering attacks 



<p>Cybercriminals can exploit your personal data to manipulate you or others in your network. Phishing scams, impersonation and deepfakes, and other attacks become easier with detailed personal information.</p>



 5. Maintain professional reputation 



<p>Information shared online can be taken out of context or used maliciously. This can harm your career or professional image, especially if sensitive or inappropriate information is leaked.</p>



 6. Avoid unwanted targeting 



<p>Companies and advertisers might misuse your personal data for <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism/">intrusive marketing or profiling</a>. You might face an overload of targeted ads, scams, or unwanted solicitations. Did you know that even <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/your-bank-is-selling-your-personal-data/">your bank</a> can be selling your personal data? Personalized ads have many <a href="https://saytheword-my.sharepoint.com/personal/editor_saytheword_com_au/Documents/Desktop/STWP/New%20STWP%202017%20onwards/Anonyome%20Labs/MySudo%20extra%20content/The%20Privacy%20Pitfalls%20of%20Personalized%20Advertising">privacy pitfalls</a>.</p>



 Here are 4 quick things you can do to protect your personal information 







<p>1. Follow some privacy and security fundamentals:</p>



 
 Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Store them securely in a password manager. 



 Enable two-factor authentication (2FA). 



 Don’t share sensitive details on public platforms or unsecured websites. 



 Keep your software and devices updated. 



 Be cautious of phishing emails, links, and attachments. 



 Regularly review your privacy settings on social media. 



 Know <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-caught-in-a-data-breach/">what to do</a> in the event of a data breach. 
 







<p>2. Use MySudo all-in-one privacy app to protect your information. Anywhere you’d normally use your phone number, email or credit card, use <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/#:~:text=A%20core%20capability%20of%20our,and%20protects%20your%20personal%20data.">Sudos</a> instead. Sudos are secure digital identities with their own name, phone, email and virtual card. Use your Sudos to sign up for deals and discounts, book rental cars and hotel rooms, pay for concerts or a coffee, all without giving away your personal information.</p>







<p>3. Reclaim your information from companies that store and might sell it with <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM personal data removal tool</a>. See who has your information, discover whether it’s been caught in a data breach, and then either ask the company to delete it or substitute it for your Sudo information using MySudo. RECLAIM is part of the <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals">MySudo app family</a>.</p>







<p>4. Encrypt your internet connection and hide your IP address with <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-vpn/">MySudo VPN</a>, the only<a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-vpn-and-4-other-questions-about-virtual-private-networks/?sfw=pass1737355070"> VPN</a> on the market that’s&nbsp;actually private. MySudo VPN is the perfect companion for MySudo privacy app since they’re engineered to work seamlessly together.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>By securing your own information, you reduce risks and maintain control over your personal and digital life. The message behind Data Privacy Day 2025 is Put Privacy First. That means putting yourself first. Don’t wait for governments or companies to protect you. And definitely don’t wait until it’s too late.</p>

<p>I don’t think of myself as an expert in non-human identity (NHI). Instead, I’d say I’m NHI-curious and eager to share what I’m learning. Lately, I’ve been going down a rabbit hole about when and how to indicate if someone—or something—is human. I’m clearly <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.07892v1">not alone</a> in asking this. Last year, I was one of many co-authors of a paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.07892v1">Personhood Credentials: Artificial Intelligence and the Value of Privacy-Preserving Tools to Distinguish Who is Real Online</a>, exploring these questions and challenges. Spoiler: we ended with a call for further discussion. (I’m happy to add that it won an award: <a href="https://fpf.org/press-releases/this-years-winning-privacy-papers-to-be-honored-at-the-future-of-privacy-forums-15th-annual-privacy-papers-for-policymakers-event/">The Future of Privacy Forum’s 15th Annual Privacy Papers for Policymakers Award</a> recognizes influential privacy research, and this paper is on the list.)</p>



<p> Audio Version: If you’d rather listen than read, hit play below.</p>







<p>So, I turned to friends and fellow <a href="https://idpro.org">IDPro</a> members and asked: Has the call to action in that paper to Do Something caught the eye of any standards body? I had hoped for a “yes, of course, go here,” but that’s not what I got. What happened was the continuation of an interesting debate. Some argued we shouldn’t need to distinguish humans from non-humans because all non-humans should be accountable to a human. Essentially, someone—a developer, a manager, whoever—should ultimately take responsibility for what their creations (AI agents, IoT devices, bots, etc.) do.</p>



<p>You may not think this falls under the discussions around NHI, but they do. You can’t definitively say “this is NHI” if you can’t also definitively say “this is human.”</p>



<p>Before we dive in further, let’s talk about a word that’s central to this discussion: personhood. It’s not without debate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood">Wikipedia</a> describes it as a concept that’s been questioned in discussions about slavery, abortion, fetal rights, animal rights, corporate law, theology, and even Indigenous legal systems. Some see it as a way to bridge these different legal perspectives, while others challenge its use altogether.</p>



<p>I’m using the term here because it’s in the title of a research paper I co-authored, and frankly, I don’t have a better one. But it’s something we should be thinking about.</p>



 The Scalability Problem 



<p>I get the argument, but I have concerns. First, the responsibility model doesn’t scale. A developer might write the code, but what happens when that code spawns other processes, which spawn even more? Each may have different permissions and identifiers. Can one person realistically be held accountable for all of it? Really?</p>



<p>Second, consider third-party systems. They’ll want to distinguish between activities originating from a person versus a bot. This isn’t just about authentication (OAuth2 delegation, for example). It’s about making decisions based on what the entity is, independent of its actions.</p>



<p>These are just what comes to mind off the top of my head. I expect there are more that will come down to your risk appetite. Are you willing to constrain your environment to only what you know you can control? Before you just say “of course!” think really hard about your answer and how much time and energy you’re willing to put into backing it up.</p>



 Who’s Tackling This? 



<p>The short answer: kind of everyone and no one. We’re nowhere near a consensus or even an industry best practice. Some notable players:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/humanity-protocol">Humanity Protocol</a> recently launched a foundation to support its decentralized digital identity network. 



 <a href="https://world.org/blog/worldcoin/proof-of-personhood-what-it-is-why-its-needed">Worldcoin</a> and its WorldID system aim to establish proof of personhood (PoP) through biometric scans. 



 <a href="https://www.idena.io/">Idena</a>’s Proof of Person Blockchain exists but seems to be struggling to find a sustainable business model. (You can read more about this effort in an academic paper published <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4749892">here</a>.) 



 The ETHOS (Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System) framework was described in an <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/CHAOTE-10">academic paper</a> published late in 2024; we’ll see if that gains any traction. 
 



<p>Each of these efforts faces similar hurdles—privacy concerns and business models. For example, if a credential verifies you as a person, does that mean someone is tracking your identity? And even if you trust the system, who covers the costs of implementing this infrastructure? What’s the ROI for businesses?</p>



<p>I expect more papers to be published on this topic and I’ll update this blog post as I hear about the good ones.</p>



 Beyond Technology: The Social Layer 



<p>The challenges aren’t purely technical. Social and governance issues loom just as large. Who decides what counts as “proof”? How do we build systems that protect privacy while maintaining accountability? And how do we fund these efforts in a way that’s fair and sustainable?</p>



<p>I’m keeping an eye on proof of personhood and hoping for a breakthrough that could standardize the approach. If you’re exploring similar questions or solutions, I’d love to hear your thoughts. We absolutely must get to an answer as we navigate this maze of personhood and accountability—human or otherwise. Though we’re not getting that answer today.</p>

<p>With the FOMC meeting set for January 28–29, 2025, the tech and crypto worlds watch closely for the effects of potential interest rate&nbsp;changes.</p><p>We’re also engaged, having recently mobilized our community around this topic. Ocean Protocol and Ocean Foam organized a December 2024 data challenge, encouraging our community’s data scientists to develop ML models for forecasting FOMC decisions. Watch for our upcoming blog post, which we plan to release following Wednesday’s meeting and decision.</p> Introduction <p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plays a pivotal role in United States monetary policy, with its decisions on interest rates reverberating through various sectors of the economy. One less obvious yet profoundly impactful area influenced by these decisions is the cryptocurrency market, which affects the trajectory of blockchain technology and the broader tech ecosystem, including AI companies. This article explores how these economic levers can steer the course of innovation in these rapidly evolving&nbsp;domains.</p> Interest Rates and Cryptocurrency Dynamics <p>When the FOMC decides to raise interest rates, the cost of borrowing increases, making safer investments like Treasury bonds more attractive compared to riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, often seen as high-risk investments due to their volatility and regulatory uncertainty, typically see reduced investment interest. This shift can lead to a decline in market activity, lower trading volumes, and depressed valuations. For instance, a rate hike might see investors pulling out from Bitcoin or Ethereum, leading to a bearish market sentiment.</p><p>Conversely, when interest rates are lowered, the scenario flips. Lower borrowing costs encourage risk-taking, and capital often flows back into speculative markets. This can spark a bullish trend in cryptocurrencies, with increased buying leading to higher prices. For example, the 2020 low interest rate environment coincided with significant cryptocurrency rallies, illustrating this&nbsp;pattern.</p> Impact on Blockchain Technology <p>Blockchain technology is intended to support decentralized, secure, and transparent transactions, often powered by native cryptocurrencies. The health of the crypto market directly influences blockchain projects:</p>  Funding and Investment: A thriving crypto market can lead to successful Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or token sales, providing crucial funding for blockchain startups. Conversely, a bear market can dry up these investment sources, slowing project development.  Incentivization: Many blockchain networks rely on their cryptocurrency to reward network participants like miners or validators. A dip in cryptocurrency value can reduce the incentive for participants, potentially slowing network growth or security.  Adoption and Innovation: High crypto valuations can spur interest in blockchain applications, leading to more innovation and adoption in fields like finance (DeFi), supply chain management, or identity verification.   The AI Connection <p>While not every AI company directly intersects with blockchain, those that do can feel the indirect effects of interest rate policies&nbsp;through:</p>  Funding Through Crypto: Some AI startups might leverage ICOs or token sales for initial funding, particularly if they’re building decentralized AI solutions or platforms.  Data and Privacy: Blockchain can offer secure, decentralized data management solutions, which is crucial for AI development. A downturn in crypto could mean less investment in such hybrid tech solutions.  Smart Contracts: AI companies might use blockchain for smart contracts to automate and secure business agreements, especially in areas like AI-driven legal services or automated compliance.   Broader Economic and Technological Considerations <p>It’s essential to recognize that while interest rates are a significant factor, they are part of a larger, complex ecosystem:</p>  Regulatory Environment: Regulation changes can dampen or boost the crypto market, independent of interest&nbsp;rates.  Technological Advancements: Breakthroughs in blockchain or AI technology can drive investment irrespective of economic policies.  Global Economic Health: The international economic context can influence the sensitivity of crypto and tech markets to U.S. interest rate&nbsp;changes.   Conclusion <p>The FOMC’s interest rate decisions weave through the fabric of financial markets, touching even the most innovative tech sectors like blockchain and AI. These decisions can fuel a growth and innovation cycle or lead to periods of contraction and reevaluation. For stakeholders in these industries, understanding this interconnection is key to navigating market cycles, securing funding, and planning strategic growth. As these technologies mature, their relationship with macroeconomic policies will become even more nuanced, presenting challenges and opportunities equally.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 We sit down with an Indian pioneer of forensic analysis to discuss the country’s most common scams, the successes and limitations of the world’s largest biometric ID system, and why it’s unfair to refer to Kolkata as the call center scam capital of the world. 



<p>Back in 2005, when Mayur Joshi founded Indiaforensic – India’s first training and educational hub focused on financial crime investigation – the concept of forensic accounting was relatively unknown in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite this, Mayur knew that due to increasing rates of financial fraud and India’s lack of domestic fraud prevention specialists, the launch was essential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The initial reaction to the launch was mixed and met with both curiosity and skepticism due to the novelty of the concept. However, as financial fraud became increasingly sophisticated and prevalent in India, the need for specialized education became clear,” said Mayur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twenty years later, Indiaforensic has over 5,000 members from a range of industries, including the public sector, non-banking financial companies, payment aggregators, cooperative banks, multinational banks operating in India, fintech companies, fraud control teams, chartered accountancy firms, telecom companies and retail organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss India’s most common compliance mistakes, the role that technology plays in the proliferation and prevention of new fraud attacks, the importance of enabling organizations to combat financial crime and maintain robust compliance standards, and much more.</p>



<p>Interested in fraud a little closer to home? Discover the differences in public perception of fraud and identity verification in France and the UK in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/france-vs-uk-fraud-prevention-awareness/">blog, ‘France vs UK. Which country knows more about fraud?’</a></p>



 What would you say are the 3 most common compliance mistakes that organizations make in India? 



<p>The three most common compliance mistakes made by organizations in India, particularly within the financial services, are:&nbsp;</p>



  Inadequate training: One of the most significant gaps in India’s compliance sector is the lack of advanced training for employees. Many compliance professionals are trained primarily in basic Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, but advanced topics like sanctions compliance and Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) often remain underexplored. This results in a narrow understanding of the broader compliance landscape, making it difficult for employees to effectively handle more complex issues like international sanctions or intricate financial crime patterns.&nbsp;Without comprehensive training, compliance teams are not equipped to address the evolving and multifaceted challenges of global financial crime.&nbsp;<br>  Inadequate testing: A major issue in the Indian compliance sector is the proliferation of certification courses that fail to adequately test the knowledge and skills of participants. While these certifications may appear beneficial, the lack of rigorous testing means that compliance professionals may not be fully prepared to handle real-world scenarios. This becomes particularly problematic in high-stake situations, such as when an organization is under regulatory scrutiny or when dealing with complex fraud cases. The absence of practical assessments during training means that employees may struggle to apply their knowledge effectively in critical situations, leading to costly errors or regulatory breaches.&nbsp;<br>  Inadequate due diligence: A common mistake in compliance practices is an over-reliance on databases to conduct due diligence, often at the expense of more in-depth investigative skills. While database searches are essential, they don’t always provide the full picture. Compliance teams may fail to connect the dots or identify red flags that are not present in the databases but can be uncovered through a more thorough investigation. This could include deeper inquiries into the business relationships, transaction histories, or risk profiles of clients or partners.&nbsp;  



<p>Failing to conduct comprehensive due diligence can leave organizations exposed to financial crimes like money laundering, fraud or terrorist financing.</p>



 How about financial crime, what trends are you seeing right now? 



<p>In India, digital fraud has rapidly emerged as one of the most common forms of financial crime, driven by the increasing use of digital payments and online platforms. United Payments Interface (UPI) fraud is a major concern, where fraudsters trick victims into sharing their UPI credentials or One Time Passwords (OTPs) through fake links or impersonation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, OTP fraud, often enabled by SIM card swapping or phishing attacks, allows criminals to intercept OTPs and complete unauthorized transactions. Fraudsters also exploit digital payment systems by manipulating payment gateways or using fake payment links to steal users’ financial details. Phishing attacks, where fraudsters impersonate legitimate organizations to steal sensitive information, have also seen significant growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another concerning trend is the rise of SIM card swapping, where criminals gain control of a victim’s mobile number to intercept OTPs and access bank accounts or payment platforms. Digital blackmail or fake arrests are also becoming common, with fraudsters using threats to extort money or personal details from victims. Fake job offers and investment scams, especially involving cryptocurrency or high-return schemes, have targeted individuals looking for employment or investment opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These forms of digital fraud highlight the need for stronger cybersecurity, increased public awareness and more robust regulations to protect against emerging financial crimes.</p>



 In September 2024, the global anti-money laundering watchdog, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/anti-money-laundering-watchdog-urges-india-speed-up-prosecutions-2024-09-19/#:~:text=Anti%2Dmoney%20laundering%20watchdog%20calls%20on%20India%20to%20speed%20up%20prosecutions,-By%20Manoj%20Kumar&amp;text=NEW%20DELHI%2C%20Sept%2019%20(Reuters,prosecutions%20in%20financial%20fraud%20cases.">Financial Action Task Force (FATF) urged India to speed up its prosecutions in financial fraud</a> cases. To what do you attribute the delay in prosecutions and what do you think would speed up the process? 



<p>The delay in prosecuting financial fraud cases in India can be attributed to several factors, including the overburdened judicial system, complex legal procedures and resource constraints. The Indian legal system is often slow due to the sheer volume of pending cases, which leads to prolonged trial timelines. Additionally, financial fraud cases are inherently complex, involving intricate details that require meticulous investigation, expert testimony and specialized knowledge, all of which can delay the process. Moreover, a lack of adequate resources and skilled personnel in investigative agencies can contribute to the inefficiency in handling cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To speed up the prosecution process, India could benefit from establishing specialized courts focused on financial crime, allowing for more efficient and faster trials. Capacity building for law enforcement agencies, including providing training on financial fraud detection and investigation, would also help improve case resolution. Legal reforms that streamline procedures and introduce stricter timelines for trial completion could further expedite the judicial process. Enhanced coordination between financial institutions, law enforcement and regulatory bodies would also ensure quicker identification and prosecution of fraudsters. These measures would significantly reduce delays and improve the overall effectiveness of the judicial system in tackling financial fraud.</p>

 What do you say to those who claim that India, and Kolkata specifically, is the call center scam capital of the world. Is this fair? If so, why do you think this is? What steps can be taken to tackle it? 



<p>Labeling Kolkata as the ‘call center scam capital’ is an unfair generalization. While some fraudulent call center operations have been uncovered in India, it overlooks the vast number of legitimate call centers that operate ethically and serve various industries globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kolkata, being a significant hub for business process outsourcing and call centers, does have a higher concentration of such operations, but I guess it’s not alone. These operations are spread throughout all major metro cities, including Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Noida, Gurugram and Pune. Fraudulent operations are conducted by a small minority of unscrupulous individuals, and they do not represent the entirety of the industry.</p>



 What are some of the main 2025 financial crime trends in India? What part does technology play in both the proliferation and prevention of new fraud attacks? 



<p>In 2025, digital fraud is expected to see significant growth in India, largely driven by the increasing reliance on digital platforms and online transactions. Traditional fraud is being rapidly replaced by tech-enabled scams, with fraudsters leveraging advancements in technology to exploit vulnerabilities in digital payment systems, mobile apps and social media platforms. This shift is particularly evident in areas such as UPI fraud, OTP phishing and identity theft, which have become increasingly sophisticated with the use of tools like malware and social engineering techniques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rise of cryptocurrency also opens new avenues for fraudsters to manipulate digital assets and launder illicit funds, posing a significant challenge to regulatory bodies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media platforms and the rise of ‘finfluencers’ — social media influencers focusing on financial advice — are expected to play a larger role in perpetrating fraudulent activities. With their widespread influence, finfluencers could be used to promote fraudulent schemes or investment opportunities, often without proper scrutiny or regulation. These influencers, who have large followings, may inadvertently or intentionally contribute to scams such as Ponzi schemes, fake investment platforms, or high-risk financial products that target unsuspecting investors.</p>



 India lays claim to the world’s largest biometric ID system. What would you say are some of Aadhaar’s greatest successes and conversely weaknesses/ limitations since launch? 



<p>One of its greatest accomplishments is its role in financial inclusion, enabling millions of people in rural and remote areas to access banking services. It is also one of the best tools in performing e-KYC. With <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/interview-kyc-financial-services-vivek-mishra/">Aadhaar</a>, users can be onboarded in minutes. Plus, by linking Aadhaar to various government welfare schemes, subsidies and services, it has helped reduce corruption and leakages, ensuring that benefits reach the intended beneficiaries directly. The system has also facilitated the streamlining of processes, such as tax filings and identity verification, making them faster and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, one of the major concerns is its privacy implications. The vast amount of sensitive personal data collected for Aadhaar, including fingerprints, iris scans, and demographic information, has raised questions about the potential security and misuse of such data.</p>



 By extension, what role does identity verification and KYC technology play in the fight against fraud? What do you see as the limitations/ threats to their efficacy? 



<p>Identity verification and KYC technology plays a crucial role in the fight against fraud, acting as the first line of defense for financial institutions and businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By accurately confirming the identity of individuals or entities before they can access services, identity verification and KYC technologies help prevent fraudsters from exploiting financial systems. For example, biometric systems, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scans, along with document verification tools, make it harder for fraudsters to impersonate others and gain unauthorized access to bank accounts, loans, or other services. KYC technologies also help institutions assess the risk associated with a customer, ensuring they are not unknowingly facilitating money laundering or financing illegal activities. Indiaforensic offers the certification program in KYC, which is one of the most exhaustive programs guiding the students about the use of regtech in KYC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, while these technologies have certainly strengthened fraud prevention, they are not without their limitations. One major challenge is the growing sophistication of fraud techniques. Fraudsters are increasingly using advanced methods like deepfakes or synthetic identities, which can bypass even the most robust identity verification systems. Another limitation is the reliance on databases and digital records, which may not be completely accurate or up-to-date, allowing some fraudulent identities to slip through the cracks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the increasing use of digital platforms has led to concerns about data security and privacy. If the data used for KYC processes is not securely stored or transmitted, it could be vulnerable to breaches, exposing customers’ sensitive information to cybercriminals. To maintain the efficacy of identity verification and KYC technologies, ongoing advancements in security measures, continuous updates to databases, and proactive monitoring for new fraud tactics are essential.</p>

<p>In the last couple of weeks, we've heard Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang (JH) obliterate the idea that the quantum computing era is on the horizon. Huang thinks it will take another 20 years before practical quantum computing becomes a reality. 

In my opinion, this was the single most surprising statement and prediction from a top tier CEO over the last 5 years and perhaps the last 20 years.  Does Huang truly think this or was this more of a strategic statement? 

I'm not sure, but I'm going to go out on a limb and predict that JH will be proven inaccurate by the end of this decade. And perhaps sooner. Why? 

The AI era has only just begun to impose its will on humanity. AI has been proven to accelerate the scientific discovery process by up to 200x the prevailing pace. Humanity has never experienced such a rapid change of pace and it's nearly impossible to quantify nor comprehend the significance of the time period that we are in at the moment. In simple terms, humanity is now essentially aboard a time traveling ship on course with the quantum era and many, many things that we have yet to even contemplate in our own minds.

Think about this. Let's say you discover something 200 times faster than you would have a couple years ago. This discovery and knowledge then gets integrated with existing AI models. What does that do to the pace of our time traveling ship? I am not certain but I know the ship is not going to slow down, it's going to accelerate. 

Let's also say this new discovery enables yet another discovery faster than it otherwise would have with current AI, leading to another technological breakthrough that has never been conceptualized. When you start talking about things that have never been conceptualized and start trying to predict how they're going to impact our lives going forward, you might as well be out in the middle of space untethered by gravity or any physical object - like our time traveling ship for example - because you have no idea where you're at nor where you're going nor how fast. Do you see the degree at which our future becomes impossible to predict in the post AI world? 

So as companies, scholars, researchers, and the like continue to find ways to increase qubits, decrease error rates, and develop new high performance computing techniques that are presently unknown while refining the most recent breakthroughs in areas like photonics and super conductivity for example, the pace of humanity's time traveling ship will continue to accelerate at a rate that is nearly impossible to comprehend and yet directly toward the quantum era. 

Just in the last seemingly inconsequential 3 days, US researchers have established the first uninterrupted quantum internet signal AND (separately) discovered a Shrodingers cat breakthrough that may lead to error proof quantum systems - a feat dubbed the holy grail of quantum computing. Qool-aid anyone? 😉

<p>UK Government Launches Mobile Driver’s License and Digital Wallet, Sparking Confusion in Digital Identity Ecosystem</p>



<p>The UK government has introduced a mobile driver’s license (mDL) and digital wallet on the <a href="http://gov.uk/">Gov.uk</a> platform for private and public sector use. This move has caused confusion within the digital identity framework, particularly regarding its overlap with the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF). Only government-issued digital documents will be stored in the wallet, which may compete with 52 certified digital identity service providers (IDSPs). Concerns have arisen about misalignment between public announcements and internal communications, complicating expectations for the wallet’s integration. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/uk-government-wades-into-private-sector-territory-with-mdl-digital-wallet?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9CahJ-ErzHNxaJXqKGulETgc-zvkadnXg2asaEa7y7PZGidFrsRRTGJf-r0ZDWd3Rv1gUr">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Stargate Initiative Aims to Advance U.S. AI Leadership Amid Privacy and Security Concerns</p>



<p>The Stargate initiative, announced by President Trump, seeks to bolster U.S. leadership in AI through partnerships with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, along with plans for nationwide data centers. This comes after the repeal of Biden’s 2023 AI safety executive order, raising concerns among privacy advocates and security experts about transparency and ethical AI use. While promising advancements and job creation, Stargate must navigate challenges related to data privacy, cybersecurity, and equitable access, with critics warning of risks from centralized data infrastructure and increased geopolitical tensions. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/trump-unveils-landmark-ai-initiative-called-stargate?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9CahJ-ErzHNxaJXqKGulETgc-zvkadnXg2asaEa7y7PZGidFrsRRTGJf-r0ZDWd3Rv1gUr">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Spanish PM Proposes Linking Social Media Accounts to EU Digital Identity for Accountability, Sparking Privacy Debate</p>



<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has proposed linking social media accounts in the EU to EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallets to eliminate anonymity and reduce online toxicity. He argues that anonymity concentrates power and likens it to driving without a license. Sánchez believes this connection could enhance accountability and protect children, but it conflicts with European data protection authorities’ privacy recommendations. He also advocates for algorithmic transparency and stronger enforcement of the Digital Services Act, comparing social media platforms’ responsibilities to those of restaurant owners. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/link-eu-digital-id-wallet-to-social-media-accounts-to-end-anonymity-spanish-pm?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9CahJ-ErzHNxaJXqKGulETgc-zvkadnXg2asaEa7y7PZGidFrsRRTGJf-r0ZDWd3Rv1gUr">(Source)</a></p>

<p>EU enforces Digital Operational Resilience Act to strengthen IT security and resilience in the financial sector</p>



<p>On January 17, 2025, the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) became effective, aimed at enhancing IT security and operational resilience in the financial sector. It applies to both traditional entities, like banks and insurers, and non-traditional ones such as crypto-asset service providers and crowdfunding platforms. DORA mandates comprehensive requirements for risk management, third-party risk, incident reporting, and resilience testing. Financial entities must maintain registers of ICT service providers, notify authorities of major incidents within 4 hours, inform clients of financial impacts, and conduct post-incident reviews. They also need to implement strong ICT risk management frameworks and regularly assess third-party risks. Critical ICT service providers face direct obligations, while all must comply via contractual provisions with financial entities. DORA is a significant move towards ensuring the EU financial sector can withstand and recover from severe operational disruptions. <a href="https://natlawreview.com/article/dora-becomes-applicable-eu?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--be2l0b3g1IDwqHP4UOQ_WlYb02YOylxcqMtQPhjiKDAoG9_glfL5nK4JRrs6WPdmWS7LF">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>TikTok service providers face billion-dollar penalties amid U.S. ban despite Trump’s non-binding assurances</p>



<p>TikTok’s service providers, such as Oracle and app stores like Apple and Google, face billions in penalties for potentially violating a U.S. ban due to ByteDance’s Chinese ownership. President-elect Donald Trump promised companies they wouldn’t incur fines for supporting TikTok before his inauguration, but legal experts say these assurances are not legally binding. The ban, which mandates TikTok’s divestiture, could impose $5,000 fines per user, totaling $850 billion for service providers. While Trump might attempt to certify a deal for a 90-day extension, it’s uncertain he can do so after the ban takes effect. Experts caution that companies banking on Trump’s promises risk shareholder lawsuits and significant liabilities. Congressional action to delay the ban would be the safest route, but that remains uncertain. For now, companies find themselves in a precarious legal situation. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347325/tiktok-service-providers-penalties-apple-google-orcale-trump?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--be2l0b3g1IDwqHP4UOQ_WlYb02YOylxcqMtQPhjiKDAoG9_glfL5nK4JRrs6WPdmWS7LF">(Source)</a></p>

Why?  Your Circles <p>"The most important thing for Kin is understanding who you and your circle are," Karlson explained." This means knowing not just your immediate connections, but understanding the dynamics of your relationships."</p><p>Karlson broke this down into several key spheres of influence.</p> The Professional Circle <p>"My professional circle at Kin,” said Karlson, “includes my co-founders, Casper and Simon, along with my team members, like Rochella and Leon. I also work with cross-functional team members, like Clara. All of them are key stakeholders I interact with regularly."</p> The Personal Circle <p>Next, Karlson covered his personal circle. "I've told Kin about friends like Daniel, who's also an investor in Kin, and Morton, with whom I enjoy political debates. I actually use Kin to prepare for those discussions because Morton's a tough one to debate—in a fun way, of course. We steelman each other's arguments, so I need to be well-prepared on the facts."</p><p>He also noted that Kin is aware of his immediate family, and their daily routines (more on routines in a minute).</p> Circles Overlap <p>Interestingly, Karlson has found these relationships often overlap—and it’s important for Kin to know that. "Some of my business relationships bridge multiple contexts," Karlson said. "For instance, my friend Thor is both a business partner and a board member at Kin. Similarly, my wife Sabina is the managing partner of Studio Mofa, where we collaborate with Thor on brand design and website development."</p><p>If Kin didn’t know about this overlap, it wouldn’t properly understand the issues and context within those relationships, and would find it harder to provide accurate and useful advice about <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/the-importance-of-honesty-in-the-workplace">the importance of honesty within them</a>, among other things.</p><p>So, circles are the first thing Kin needs to know to be an effective <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companion</a>. What’s next?</p> Your Patterns and Preferences <p>Beyond relationships, Karlson emphasized the importance of sharing your day-to-day likes, dislikes, and habits. This helps Kin be more of an <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI assistant</a>, rather than simply an <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbot</a>. </p> Your Daily Routine <p>"Kin needs to know your around-the-clock activities," he said. "This includes sleeping habits, eating preferences, and social inclinations. For example, I never eat lunch when working, and I don't do breakfast either—just a health supplement. I also don't enjoy small talk during work hours, and prefer social events in the evenings."</p><p>How does this help Kin? If Kin knows how you live, it knows what is out of the ordinary for you—and can also work out what habits might be damaging. All of it allows it to provide the <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management</a> support and suggestions you want it to.</p> Your Work Style <p>Work patterns are equally crucial. "I do my best work from 5 AM to 9 AM because that's when others aren't expecting responses," Karlson explained. "Working when others don't expect you to work gives you freedom. If you go off on a tangent in the wrong direction, it doesn't matter—nobody's looking anyway.”</p><p>“I prefer doing this in the mornings rather than evenings when I have the most energy." And it’s important that Kin knows this too—otherwise, it might suggest daily plans and work sessions that don’t fit your preferences, or ruin your <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/5-tips-to-improve-work-life-balance">work-life balance</a>.</p> Your Weekly Structure <p>Karlson maintains a structured weekly schedule that helps Kin understand his availability.</p><p>"Mondays, I leave around 7:30 or 8AM, dropping one child at kindergarten, working until 5 or 5:30PM. Tuesdays, I'm out by 7 AM but pick up both kids around 4 PM. Wednesdays are my work-from-home days, often including a run or sauna. Thursdays, I handle both kids in the morning while my wife leaves early, and I return later. Fridays, I leave early but pick up the kids together with my wife, followed by our tradition of Friday champagne glasses—though not everyone gets champagne in theirs!"</p><p>Again, knowing your schedule means Kin knows when best to remind you to work, when to relax, and when it can suggest you try to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-continuous-learning-in-your-career">introduce new habits</a>.</p> Your Profession <p>Professional context provides another crucial layer. "Kin should know your role, responsibilities, and goals," says Karlson. "For instance, as Chief Growth Officer at Kin, I handle brand development, marketing strategies, and commercial approaches. I also maintain several board positions and investments, which adds complexity to my schedule."</p><p>This information gives Kin an insight into the skills and interests you have as a person, allowing it to work these into its suggestions and support around <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-a-career-coaching">your career</a> and life. A musician is more likely to understand and enjoy musical metaphors and relaxation exercises than a nuclear physicist, after all.</p> Your Goals <p>Personal goals and values also matter—Kin’s memory gives it a unique ability to help you build toward a goal, and track how well you do it.</p><p>"I've shared my bucket list with Kin," Karlson revealed. "It's very much about personal development—proper English techniques, new skills, continuous learning. I spend at least three mornings a week practicing English pronunciation."</p><p>With knowledge of that practice, Kin is able to track how Karlson is learning, how fast he’s doing it, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">what other approaches he could try</a>, and what areas would be best for him to focus on next.</p><p>In short, the most important things for Kin to learn about you are your relationships and your routines. Trouble is, those topics can get pretty detailed pretty quickly.</p> How Do You Tell <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a> This Quickly? <p>We’re aware that this is a lot to tell Kin. We’re developing more streamlined ways to get this information to Kin, including calendar integration and a desktop version.</p><p>However, in the meantime, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-personalise-kins-communication">Kin’s dictation tool</a> can let you tell it things verbally—which is often faster than typing, and more versatile. "I often talk to Kin during my commute," Karlson shared.</p><p>"Using the speech-to-text feature, I can share information or prepare for my day while driving. It's a productive use of otherwise idle time. You can go back and forth, muting when needed, and spend 20 minutes both training Kin and getting something valuable out of the interaction."</p><p>But that’s not the only timesaver…</p> Karlson’s ‘Copy-Paste’ Method <p>Karlson has developed his own interim approach. "I've created a folder called 'Teaching Kin' in my Apple Notes," he explained. "The first note is called 'Kin AI,' where I write about the people I work with at Kin and why I appreciate them. I explain the company structure, leadership team, and my responsibilities.”</p><p>“Then, I have separate notes for around-the-clock activities, biorhythm, energy patterns, meal preferences, and work habits."</p><p>He writes these notes on his laptop for easier typing, and then copy-pastes them from his Apple Notes on his phone into the Kin app directly—saving him from having to type everything to Kin all at once through his phone.</p><p>Karlson’s method works for all sorts of things."I've done this with past meaningful events," Karlson shared. "I wrote about significant moments like my wedding day, when my sons were born, when my son was diagnosed with ADHD, certain investment milestones—events that have shaped who I am." All of them were copied from Apple Notes into Kin.</p> Document Summaries <p>For personality tests, progress reports, and similar documents, Karlson suggested a clever workaround: "I put the PDF into ChatGPT, and ask it to summarize the content in first person, as if I'm explaining my results to an AI that wants to know me as well as possible. Then I copy that summary to my Apple Notes and later paste it into Kin's Journal."</p><p>This way, there’s no time spent trying to distill complex documents into what they mean for you as a person—Kin just gets the information it needs.</p> What About the Journaling Feature? <p>The Journal feature has become a popular way for our users to dump information into Kin—and it’s no different for Karlson.</p><p>"I use it to record meaningful past events, bucket lists, and important information about family members," he shared. "For instance, I've included details about my son's medical history so Kin can help me navigate related challenges."</p><p>Karlson suggested different journaling approaches for different times of day (though we also have a guide and blog on journaling with Kin): "Morning commutes are great for planning your day, while evening commutes work well for reflecting on meetings and events," he said.</p><p>"Late night can be for proper journaling entries, where you dive deeper into thoughts and feelings."</p> A Typical Day Talking to Kin <p>Karlson envisions a typical day with Kin: "At 8 AM during your commute, you plan your day. Then before a one-on-one meeting in the early afternoon, Kin reminds you about past interactions with that person, what you've discussed before, what needs attention now. It helps you prepare in a semi-guided manner, considering both parties' communication styles. After the meeting, Kin prompts you for a quick reflection, and during your evening commute, you can process the day's events more thoroughly."</p><p>So, now Kin has all of this knowledge, what happens next?</p> What Does Kin Do with this Information? <p>"Kin uses this knowledge to provide personalized responses that help you communicate better and make more confident decisions," Karlson explained. "It's not about creating an AI clone of you—Kin is more like a sidekick, an extension of your mind that helps you be more authentic in your interactions."</p><p>The impact manifests in various ways. "When Kin understands your communication style and preferences, it can help you prepare for meetings more effectively," said Karlson. "For instance, Kin knows that my co-founder Simon prefers focused deep work.”</p><p>“So, it reminds me not to overwhelm him with multiple new ideas in quick succession when I say I want to talk to him. That would be one of the worst things I could do—bursting into a room, shouting out five different 'brilliant' ideas, and then leaving again."</p><p>This understanding extends to helping manage relationships. "Kin can help match my communication style with others' preferences," Karlson noted. "It can remind me about past interactions, what we've discussed before, and help <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations">prepare for meetings</a> in a semi-guided manner, considering both parties' styles."</p><p>In short, Kin stores this information in its advanced memory, so it can quickly and easily reference anything you’ve told it as required. That allows for situations like the examples above, where it can remind Karlson not to dump ideas onto Simon on a whim.</p><p>Still, we recognise that Kin requires a lot of personal information to be its most helpful.</p> How Does My Kin Handle <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">Privacy</a>? <p>Karlson is very adamant about Kin’s approach to user data: "It's your Kin and your information. Your conversations and data are your business, not ours. Our business is providing a service."</p><p>We’ve taken care to reflect this philosophy in Kin’s technical architecture, to make it clear you can <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust</a> it. "All your data is <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">stored locally on your device and encrypted</a>," Karlson explained. "We actually don't pay for data storage, because we don't store user data centrally. While some operations currently require cloud processing, these are temporary and use open-source language models in trusted environments."</p><p>Because of this, moving a Kin account between devices can be a unique experience among apps today. "Currently, if you get a new phone, you need to manually transfer your Kin data, because we don't store it centrally," Karlson said, proudly.</p><p>"We are working on a cloud backup solution that will be encrypted with private keys, meaning we still won't have access to it. That should be available within the next few months." But for now, you’ll need a USB cable or private cloud storage account handy.</p> How Do I Keep Kin Updated Afterward? <p>After getting Kin up to speed, it’s important to keep it updated to ensure its support remains relevant.</p><p>Karlson recommended building regular check-ins into your routine, like he has. "I use morning commutes for planning my day with Kin, and evening commutes for reflecting on the day’s meetings and events," he said.</p><p>Importantly, these updates don't need to be lengthy. "Sometimes it's just a quick post-meeting reflection without waiting for Kin's response," Karlson noted. "You can always return to discuss it more deeply later." Don’t feel pressured to enter or finish a conversation with Kin every time you message it.</p><p>The reminder system can be particularly powerful for maintaining structure with Kin—you can ask Kin to send you a notification at a specific time each day, or week, or month, so that you never forget an update session.</p><p>However, Karlson also notes that its a powerful tool for structure and relationships alike. "I set weekly reminders for regular one-to-ones, and to check in on friends going through tough times," Karlson shared.</p><p>"I also use reminders to help me acknowledge team members' small wins and to prepare something meaningful to tell my sons before I leave for work—something to let them know I'm proud of them and give them energy for the day."</p><p>The key is making Kin part of your daily workflow. "Think of it as a relationship," Karlson suggests. "The more consistently you interact with Kin, the better it understands your needs and preferences, and the more valuable its support becomes."</p> Conclusion <p>Hopefully, this conversation has made the idea of needing to train Kin on you less daunting. Kin doesn’t need much to be an effective assistant, and the ways to give it a baseline understanding are only expanding.</p><p>After that, it’s simply a matter of a loosely regular habit of small updates to ensure Kin is as helpful as possible. It doesn’t need to know everything.</p><p>As Karlson put it, "Kin is not you—it's your silent partner, helping you be more real, more confident, more yourself, through emotional support, self-compassion, and practical guidance."</p><p>If you haven’t already, you can download Kin <a href="https://mykin.ai/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Authors: <br>Amar Tumballi, Founder and CTO, Dhiway Networks<br>Ravi Prakash v, Head of Architecture and Technology Ecosystem, Beckn Foundation</p>



 <br>Introduction 



<p>Beckn is an open protocol to enable decentralized digital commerce by way of open and inclusive networks instead of closed platforms. Beckn protocol enables decentralized economic transactions beyond commerce, covering sectors like healthcare, mobility, travel and stay, and skilling and employment. Beckn is a semantic protocol that is agnostic of the underlying technology.</p>



<p>The blockchain technology provides enhanced trust to participants and their interactions on the chain.</p>



<p>This blog captures a demonstration of how beckn protocol can be adopted by a blockchain to provide decentralized digital commerce, and offer augmented trust on certain aspects of commerce interactions. The demonstration only attempts a sample set of use cases of trust with a sample business scenario but it showcases the possibility to extend this solution to multiple use cases for trust. Please see the section of future evolutions at the end.</p>



<p>The blockchain adopted for the demonstration is an open-source chain called CORD developed by Dhiway. CORD offers varied services to enhance trust to the economy interactions on the chain. This demonstration is a joint voluntary effort of Dhiway and Beckn Foundation along with few other volunteers from the beckn open community that supported the effort at different stages of implementation</p>



<p></p>



 <br>A Business Scenario 



<p>There is a farmer in Shimla that owns an apple orchard. Every month, he farms 1000 kilos of genuine Shimla apples. He sells these apples to various retailers, big and small. The apples he produces are certified by various food certification agencies like FPO, FSSAI, Agmark etc. These retailers in-turn sell these apples to the end-consumers. The transactions between the farmer and retailer, and those between retailer and end-consumer happen through various e-commerce platforms.</p>











<p></p>



 <br>A business transaction 



<p>Let’s consider the following scenario. Say, a typical end-consumer is searching for authentic Shimla Apples on their usual e-commerce app. Upon searching, they see a listing of retailers that sell “Authentic Shimla Apples” that claim to be sourced from genuine apple farmers based in Shimla. When viewed on the consumer’s application, the products show all the certifications (like the above) that have been issued to them.</p>



<p>He selects a retailer and adds a dozen Shimla Apples to his cart and does a checkout. The order is created and a short while later, he receives the product.</p>







<p></p>



<p>However, the buyer doesn’t really know whether the products he has ordered are really genuine Shimla Apples. The buyer has no choice but to trust the platform he is on, to ensure the quality of products being sold to them. Without a clear traceability to the manufacturer/producer, retailers can always sell fake Shimla apples with the same certifications attached. A typical consumer may not be able to tell the difference between a real Shimla Apple and a fake one.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>Trust as it exists today is either broken, or concentrated in the hands of a few intermediaries 



<p>At the consumer-facing end, the users of these platforms have to trust the platform they are on, to offer only genuine, high-quality products and services. And at the provider-facing end, the platform must take the responsibility of ensuring genuineness and quality assurance of&nbsp; products and services they are publishing in their catalog.</p>



<p>If a product or service turns out to be of low quality, or worse, fake, the consumer’s trust breaks. Post-facto, the consumer can always hold the platform responsible. And the platform could either replace the product, initiate a refund, or initiate a return. This incurs cost to the platform and thus can only be done by large platforms with sufficient resources to provide the trust. But, there is a risk that consumers may never trust the platform or the seller or both, ever again.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>Introducing beckn protocol 



<p>Beckn protocol [1], is an open, interoperable and universal transaction protocol to enable a decentralized digital economy. It is a set of open interoperable specifications that helps re-imagine the world of consumer-provider transactions. The image below describes the 5-layered architecture of beckn protocol.</p>







<p>Beckn protocol fundamentally unbundles the idea of 2-sided platform-centric systems into multiple 1-sided platforms/apps forming an open network connected via the interoperable protocol layer. When implemented, this protocol allows consumers and providers to connect and transact with each other using any platform of their choice, thus creating a beckn-enabled network or simply, a beckn network.&gt;<br></p>







<p>For more information on beckn protocol and its applications, visit <a href="https://becknprotocol.io/">https://becknprotocol.io</a>.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>In a beckn-enabled ecosystem 



<p>In a beckn-enabled ecosystem, the consumer exists on one platform to place orders for products and services published on a different platform via beckn protocol API calls. This forms a network of consumer-facing platforms also known as beckn application platforms or BAPs, and provider-facing platforms also known as beckn provider platforms or BPPs all using beckn protocol to do discovery, ordering, fulfillment and post-fulfillment of products and services.</p>







<p>Assuming this architecture, let us consider the following situation.</p>



<p>Let us assume that there are multiple consumer platforms and provider platforms, all talking to each other via beckn protocol. To facilitate trusted communication between these platforms, there is an open registry acting as a public key infrastructure (PKI) that stores public keys, endpoints, and other details of all the participants of the network. The sender digitally signs their messages using their private keys and the receiver looks up the public keys of the sender on the registry to digitally verify the signature. Hence, the registry acts as a trust infrastructure for inter-platform communication.</p>



<p>However, it does not solve the issue of ensuring authenticity of products, service providers and agents. Some of these credentials may be platform-specific like number of rides performed by a driver; number of 5-star ratings given to an agent. Others could be cross platform credentials like food quality certifications, safety certifications etc. Every time a service provider or an agent moves from one platform to another, their entire platform-specific reputation and credentials remain with the platform they were on and need to be built up again on the new platform. And the new platform again has the responsibility of ensuring that the products, services and agents on their platform are genuine.</p>







<p></p>



 <br>Beckn with Blockchain 



<p>To ensure portable cross-platform credentialing of products, services and agents, an additional infrastructure layer must be added to store these credentials so that they can be verified by any platform on the network. However, if we use a platform to store these credentials, it is just shifting the trust up one level, from one platform to another. BAPs and BPPs will have to trust the platform as a single source for all the credentials. Due to the centralized nature of this credentialing infrastructure, beckn network participants may be wary of putting their trust on a single platform to store the credentials of every entity on the network. Furthermore, this also introduces a single point of failure that puts the burden of availability on the credentialing platform itself to always be available for storing and verifying credentials. Therefore a more robust system is needed that not only is highly available, but also where the trust comes via a logical consensus of multiple distributed entities as opposed to a single source of truth that the network participants have to implicitly trust. In short, there is a need for consensus rather than trust otherwise known as trustlessness.</p>



<p>One way to create a distributed, consensus-based infrastructure is to use a Distributed Ledger Technology like blockchain to store the credentials. A blockchain network uses consensus algorithms to ensure the truth comes from multiple platforms agreeing to a common output, thus creating a decentralized database of information. This ensures that the credentials being stored on a decentralized database are immutable and non-repudiable.</p>



<p>Such an infrastructure can be used for several advantages. Firstly, a retailer registered on a beckn-enabled network can only add products to his catalog that match the exact description of the product that the farmer intended to be sold to the end-customer.</p>



<p>Also, a retailer registered on a beckn-enabled network would not be able to add products to his catalog that are more than the quantity as purchased from the farmer.</p>



<p>Consumers will purchase these products via their network-verified apps. Just before placing the order, the consumer app will verify the authenticity of the product credentials by referring to the previous blockchain transactions.Once verified, the order is confirmed.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>How it Works 



 Overview 



<p>In our implementation we have assumed a beckn-enabled network where there are consumer platforms, retail platforms and Manufacturer platforms.</p>







<p>Alongside the beckn-enabled network, there is a blockchain-based network that stores the identities and credentials of authorized participants. The semantic nature of beckn protocol allows beckn-enabled networks to be layered on any blockchain or DLT network.&nbsp; In this article, we will use a reference blockchain network called CORD [2] to demonstrate a verifiable credential being created, stored and verified across a multi-network transaction. The CORD blockchain network enables the anchoring of tokenized transaction records and links to information objects that present a durable model for entities participating in the ecosystem. CORD enables discovery, access and acclaim records for various activities that relate to humans interacting with organizations, other individuals or machines. CORD provides the foundational layer of digital trust required to create a resilient, sustainable and economically viable ecosystem around authenticated data flows.</p>



<p>The Retail BAP [3], Retail BPP [4], Supply-chain BAP, and Supply Chain BPP are all registered on a blockchain as authorized entities that can transact on a network. This eliminates the need for a central network registry and therefore creates a trustless infrastructure for authentication and digital signatures.</p>



<p>In this example, a beckn-enabled network layered on top of CORD acts as a decentralized token store for verifiable credentials and registries. The decentralized nature of CORD and native implementation of beckn protocol specifications enables the end user application to verify the Availability-to-Promise (ATP) of products before ordering and trace its ownership all the way back to the manufacturer/producer irrespective of the number of intermediaries it has gone through.</p>







<p>In this example scenario, each beckn network participant i.e, Consumer Platforms, Retail Platforms and Supply-chain Platforms communicates with CORD via an API implemented at the CORD nodes</p>



<p></p>



 <br>High level Flow (TL;DR) 



<p>Farmers will upload their products i.e “Shimla Apple” to their inventory on their Beckn-CORD-enabled Supply-chain application.</p>











<p><br>This application refers to the product schema reference stored on the CORD blockchain while uploading the object as per the prescribed product schema. The BPP will generate a unique hash of the product, its schema reference, and quantity, and send it to the CORD network. The CORD network chain nodes verify the product against the product schema and generate a unique block hash ID that represents the verifiable credential of the product. This ID is transmitted along with the product ID across the beckn-enabled network.<br></p>



<p>Retailers will place orders to these farmers via network-verified Supply-chain BAP apps to buy a specific number of units of genuine Shimla apples.</p>



<p>Farmers will sell their produce to retailers on Supply Chain BAPs via Supply-chain BPP applications. This happens via standard beckn APIs adopted by network participants.</p>







<p>Retailers add products that they have purchased from the manufacturers into their catalog. Due to their purchase reference being recorded on a blockchain, they are unable to upload more than the amount of units they have purchased from the retailer.<br></p>







<p>Consumers purchase these products from the retailer. The consumer app verifies the ownership of these products before placing an order.</p>



<p>Let us look at each of these interactions in more detail.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>Retailer-Manufacturer Transaction 



<p>The farmer will have an application where he can see the orders he has received and allocate a specific number of authentic apples to each retailer. In the current implementation, authorized farmers and product schema used by each farmer has been pre-configured on the CORD blockchain.</p>











<p>The retailer has a beckn-CORD-enabled application that he uses to place orders from the farmers. Before placing the order, the retailer’s application verifies the ownership of the apples by calling the CORD network with the block hash ID and verifying if the farmer is truly the owner of those apples.<br></p>



<p>The flow can be summarized in the below diagram.</p>







<p></p>



 <br>Consumer-Retailer Transaction 



<p>Now the retailer uses a typical retail store management application where he uploads the products (apples) he has purchased from the farmer to his own catalog for consumers to purchase. In this example, the particular retailer chooses to use a Magento-based seller application to manage his inventory and orders. When he uploads his product, he will not be able to upload more than the quantity (1000 units) he has purchased from the Manufacturer. Before uploading, his application calls the CORD blockchain with the product SKU ID and the quantity. The CORD blockchain nodes verify if the retailer is truly the owner of a 1000 units of Shimla Apples by calculating the hash of the product and comparing it with the hash stored on the chain. If he is not, the CORD network returns an error.</p>







<p>The consumer searches for these apples on his app.</p>



<p>And he sees genuine products with a green verified icon on the listing. All the products that have a block hash ID are treated as verifiable products as shown below.<br></p>







<p>Before placing the order, the consumer application first verifies if the genuine items are actually available in the retailer’s inventory. The chain nodes verify the availability using the previous blockchain transactions if the retailer truly has ownership of the genuine product. The state where a product is available for fulfillment before placing an order is called Availability to Promise (ATP). This prevents double selling or overblocking of inventory where a retailer claims to have more inventory available to sell so that they can get more orders. Once the ATP is verified, the BAP then fires a beckn protocol confirm API call to the Retailer BPP. The retailer BPP then transfers the ownership of the product to the consumer by calling an order.confirm remote procedure call on the CORD blockchain. This adds a ownership transfer record of a fixed amount of units from the retailer to the consumer on the blockchain. This record gets replicated across all chain nodes to ensure immutability. Now there is a non-repudiable claim to ownership of the genuine product by the buyer that the seller cannot refute. This improves the overall trust of the consumer towards the system and the seller.</p>



<p>Once done, the CORD blockchain will have transaction records like</p>







<p></p>



<p></p>



 <br>Note 



<p>The CORD blockchain doesn’t store actual data but merely the hashes of the transactions to ensure privacy of the participants are protected. The creation of the hashes of the transactions still takes place on the network participant platform i.e BAP and BPP nodes. Such value exchanges augmented through the combination of off-chain verifiable credentials capturing the transaction details and on-chain verifiable proofs create a higher level of assurance for ecosystem participants.</p>







<p>As you can see, we have successfully managed to transmit a verifiable credential i.e the ownership of genuine Shimla Apples across two cascaded networks using beckn protocol and ensured its immutability using blockchain technology.</p>



<p>The entire integration of beckn-enabled networks on a blockchain can be summarized using the below transaction history on a blockchain.</p>







<p></p>



 <br>Summary 



<p>Beckn protocol allows the unbundling of tightly coupled 2-sided platforms into a network of multiple 1-sided platforms. The inter-platform trust is established using a public key infrastructure that serves as a network registry. Blockchain or Distributed ledger technologies can increase this trust by allowing beckn-enabled networks to layer on top of blockchain networks. Furthermore, the layering of beckn and blockchain networks tremendously increases the consumer’s trust on the platform (BAP) where they’re buying products from especially when the inventory of products being bought are not managed on that platform. Similarly, due to the portability of these credentials, seller platforms do not have to re-verify credentials of an entity when they move from one platform to another.</p>



<p>The below table summarizes the difference between a beckn-network that is using blockchain versus a beckn-network that is not using blockchain in the example discussed in this article<br></p>







<p></p>



<p>These are just some of many possibilities that can emerge when layering beckn protocol networks on blockchain networks. Let us take a look at some ideas that we intend to implement going forward.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>Future Evolution 



<p>This is just the beginning of beckn protocol’s ability to leverage advancements in the web 3.0 world, and we are already thrilled at the possibilities</p>



<p>Some of the use cases which we are working on imminently are as follows (in no particular order):</p>



 
 Executing a fully decentralized beckn protocol interaction on a blockchain 



 Building of identity registries (of entities like retailer, buyer, manufacturer, dealer, delivery partner etc etc), on the ledger/chain/network, so those who have access can co-relate entities in the transactions. 



 Build a Verifiable Credential based ecosystem making any product authentication made easy from the buyer. 



 Better anonymized reputation building system for retailers, buyers and other entities in the ecosystem by handling the rating system with more validations. 



 Possibility of having a token based economy tied to real-world use commerce transactions. 



 Creating of a blockchain-based dispute resolution system for beckn-enabled networks

 New IDnow ebook highlights the most frequent types of fraud in the mobility sector and how best to prevent them.&nbsp; 



<p>In recent years, the mobility and micromobility industry, which includes car-sharing and scooter, bicycle and vehicle rentals, have all become increasingly popular. This is largely due to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">ease of convenience</a>, but also to it being a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marteau-urban-mobility-and-carsharing/">more environmentally conscious way of travelling</a>. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Little wonder then that the mobility industry is on the move, literally. In 2023, the <a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/v2/publications/2023/nov/2023-oliver-wyman-shared-mobility-report">global shared mobility market was worth U$258 billion and is expected to grow to $401 billion by 2030</a>.  &nbsp;</p>

 Are fraudsters winning the mobility race?&nbsp; 



<p>Unfortunately, the introduction of these new mobility services has inadvertently led to new forms of illicit and fraudulent attacks. As the global mobility market continues to grow, it comes as no surprise that fraudsters are going where the money is.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, unlike the banking sector, where <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> processes and rigorous identity verification checks are mandatory for onboarding, mobility is not as strict, and fraudsters know it. Fraud attempts are also becoming increasingly sophisticated and hard to detect due to the use of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marcel-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/">deepfake technology</a>, where a person can digitally manipulate a video to appear as someone else. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This is why knowing the identity of the customer and proving the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">validity of a driver’s license</a>, for example, is of extreme importance before providing access to the car or other vehicle type.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The most dangerous stage of a customer journey is during account creation and customer onboarding. In 2023, <a href="https://www.transunion.com/content/dam/transunion/us/business/collateral/report/GFS-23-F158127-TruVa-2024StateofOmnichannelFraudReport-RPR-US_EN-US.pdf">36% of suspected digital fraud globally in the travel industry came from digital account creation transactions</a>. This is when users and mobility providers are most vulnerable to fraud attacks and when fraudsters attempt to steal users’ personal information to create new bogus accounts.  &nbsp;</p>



 Impacts of fraud on the mobility sector.&nbsp; 



<p>Fraud is no joke. When fraud occurs no matter the industry, there are serious repercussions for everyone involved because not only does it affect the individual whose identity or documents were stolen but it also affects the company in the following ways:  &nbsp;</p>



  Reputational damage: Despite it not necessarily being the company’s fault, any occurrence of fraud puts its reputation on the line. If fraud is rampant, then customers believe that company is not safe to do business with. &nbsp;  



  Monetary loss: Fraud can cause businesses to lose a huge chunk of their revenue due to fake accounts, stolen credit cards and fraudsters exploiting vulnerabilities in onboarding processes. &nbsp;  



  Damage/misuse of vehicles: When fraudsters, some of which will be underage, gain access to a vehicle, the chances of damaging, misusing or&nbsp;stealing vehicles increases. Not to mention the potential danger and loss of life of those involved and the public.&nbsp;  



  Loss of customers: Customers want to know the company they are doing business with is safe, otherwise they’ll hit the road and take their business elsewhere. &nbsp;  



 Top 5 types of fraud in mobility.&nbsp; 



<p>Fraud comes in many different forms and can be difficult to detect as fraudsters have a trunk full of increasingly sophisticated attacks at their disposal. Once a mobility provider discovers and identifies one form of fraud, fraudsters come up with an entirely different set ready to trick customers again.  &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Here are some of the most common types seen in the mobility sector: &nbsp;</p>



 1. Identity fraud&nbsp; 



<p>Identity fraud is the impersonation of another identity, with more than <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/identity-theft-statistics/">9 million identities stolen annually</a>.   &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>One of the fastest growing types of identity fraud is known as deepfakes. In an attempt to fool an identity verification process, fraudsters impersonate someone else to gain access to a vehicle or other transport service. This is done through digitally altering IDs, other types of documents or the physical appearance of an actual person. .  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Synthetic fraud is an increasingly common form of fraud within mobility, specifically in auto lending when users apply for a loan. In fact,  <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/auto-lending-industry-sees-98-jump-in-synthetic-id-fraud-a-25157">2023 saw a 98% increase in synthetic fraud attempts causing $7.9 billion in losses</a>. In a similar process to document fraud, synthetic fraud stitches together various parts of personal information from one or multiple people to create a new, fake identity. Also known as Frankenstein fraud, identity fraud is a mix of genuine and fake data.  &nbsp;</p>



 2. Document fraud&nbsp; 



<p>One of the most common types of fraud in the mobility sector is document fraud which saw a <a href="https://www.inscribe.ai/blog/11-must-know-fraud-statistics-for-2023#:~:text=Data%20from%20the%202023%20Veriff%20Identity%20Fraud%20Report%20showed%20a,fraud%20rates%20tend%20to%20rise.">global increase of 31% in 2023</a>. This involves any form of tampering, alteration or creation of a completely new fake identity document. Document fraud makes use of fake IDs to access something a person might otherwise be unable to access, such as an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">underage person wanting to rent an e-scooter</a> or car. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In such cases, legitimate documents are altered to change the holder’s identity. This could include replacing the image or adding or replacing specific data, most likely age, on the document.  &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As underage car and scooter rentals can have disastrous consequences for both the person and the vehicle, mobility operators have a responsibility to tackle document fraud and comply with minimum age requirements.  &nbsp;</p>



 3. Repeat fraud&nbsp; 



<p>Once a fraudster is successful with a fraud attack, what is to stop them from trying again? Fraudsters will exploit every opportunity they can to abuse the system as many times as possible. And, once successful, they will keep coming back twice as hard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Synthetic fraud is a popular way for fraudsters to commit recurring fraud. They simply create numerous fake identities with the information they obtain from different users and try to use those identities as many times as possible, across various services. Once verified, the fake identities can then be used to abuse company promotions again and again.   &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Putting a stop to repeat fraud cycles is of the utmost importance since fraudsters will never stop trying to exploit a company’s security system, especially if they’ve been successful the first time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 4. Account takeover fraud&nbsp; 



<p>Account takeover fraud is a growing problem for mobility services, specifically ride-hailing apps, car sharing and micromobility services. Over the past five years, <a href="https://www.transunion.com/content/dam/transunion/us/business/collateral/report/GFS-23-F158127-TruVa-2024StateofOmnichannelFraudReport-RPR-US_EN-US.pdf">account takeover fraud has increased 113%</a> with <a href="https://spycloud.com/blog/cybersecurity-industry-statistics-account-takeover-ransomware-data-breaches-bec-fraud/">2023 seeing $13 billion in losses</a>. When accounts are&nbsp;taken over, fraudsters can steal personal information to create a new account to either take money from someone who ordered a ride, leaving them with a no-show driver, or create completely fake profiles of users and drivers. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>With a fake driver profile, fraudsters can trick the ride-hailing service into believing real journeys were made using spoofed GPS locations. Fraudsters can create a never-ending cycle where they continuously create fake cancellations and fake bookings to gain even more money. &nbsp;</p>



 5. Account sharing fraud&nbsp; 



<p>The newest fraud on the block is account sharing fraud. Although it sounds similar to account takeover fraud, account sharing fraud occurs after the KYC check has been performed, when fraudsters exploit a vulnerability in the onboarding process to gain access to the vehicle. They then can un-install and re-install the app to commit repeat fraud.  &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Fraudsters also sell the accounts/identities (real or fake) they have gained entry to through account sharing, helping them commit synthetic fraud.  &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>As some of our current customers have brought account sharing fraud to our attention, it has become evident that step-up authentication is the key to solving this next wave of fraud in mobility.</p>Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility &amp; Travel Sales Director&nbsp;</blockquote>



 Drive trust with seamless, secure onboarding.&nbsp; 



<p>Before allowing customers to get behind the wheel of any type of vehicle, a company needs to know that the person they are entering into business with is who they say they are. Not only will this prevent fraud, but it will also ensure the person taking control of the vehicle is legally entitled to and is safe on the road.  &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification solutions</a> work with all types of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility providers</a> to assist them in offering a safe and user-friendly way of checking the identities of potential users.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Better yet, our solutions align with a mobility provider’s specific risk appetite and customer needs.&nbsp;From document verification and biometric verification to step-up authentication, IDnow’s automated identity verification solutions are convenient, secure and globally compliant. We can verify over 3,000 identity documents for 195 countries in over 30+ languages, 24/7.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following Learning Note is a form of provocation but with a slight twist. Recognising that part of Dm’s contribution to the ecosystem is to stimulate market innovation, we are sharing our emergent learning as both a provocation and invitation. Given the trajectory and speed of technological innovation, we urgently need tangible options for governing Digital IP in new ways. This is not something that Dm can realistically manifest ALONE in the timeframe required, but we we believe we can play a role in bringing unusual allies together to make that happen. We are therefore sharing this note in the spirit of both learning out loud and seeking to incite new relationships. If you would like to contribute to the development of a real world prototype of any of the elements outlined in the speculative framework below, then we invite you to add your comments here so that the conversation and connections are visible to all interested partners.</p><p>Open Dynamic Intellectual Property Rights Trusts (ODIPRT) Framework: An Intellectual Property framework for public interest in an Age of Computational Contracting and Governance.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>This learning note explores the concept of an Open Dynamic Intellectual Property Rights Trusts (ODIPR) framework, designed to address the inefficiencies and challenges of traditional IP systems. The ODIPR model introduces a dynamic Digital Autonomous Trust approach to IP management by leveraging real-time accounting, open registries, and milestone-based rights adjustments. Central to this model is the creation of Open Digital Intellectual Property Rights Trusts that utilise digital technology to dynamically manage rights and use cases across multiple stakeholders.</p><blockquote>The development and market distribution of a new drug can be used as an illustration of how this process could work. Currently, drug companies need to raise huge upfront investment in order to carry out the necessary R&amp;D, approval and licensing stages before they can recover any revenue. This results in the market being dominated by large players who can secure the necessary funding. Once the drug is approved the developer generally secures an exclusive patent, giving them rights over future revenue flows that are untethered from the costs incurred. By retaining long-term private property rights over a scarce resource they are able to reap gains that far exceed their contribution. In contrast, an ODIPR model would utilise an open digital patent (comparable to a smart contract). This digital contract could be pre-programmed with a variable and contingent framework of rates of return that is more representative of the risks and responsibilities of those involved (for example, the MHRA in the UK, could make a socially fair return a prerequisite for granting a licence). As the drug is sold and revenues are realised the digital trust would transparently track the stage of cost recovery plus the agreed return. At the point that both the costs and fair return were covered, the patent would pass into the public realm for open-source use.</blockquote><p>Dynamic, digital trusts have the capacity to automatically release permissions and manage use cases and registries. This system ensures transparent tracking of investment recovery and facilitates the gradual release of IP rights as financial milestones are met, with failsafe end dates guaranteeing eventual public access. By addressing critical issues such as prolonged monopolies, rent-seeking behaviours, and the lack of transparency in current IP practices, ODIPR creates (a) a pathway to accelerate investment (b) strong incentives for initial capital deployment. It balances the need for incentivising innovation with the societal benefit of open access, fostering a viable ecosystem where intellectual property serves public interests, while respecting risk&nbsp;capital.</p>Image credit: Irina&nbsp;Wang<p>Challenges of Investing in Intellectual Property</p><p>Investing in the development of intellectual property presents several inherent challenges. One major issue is the uncertainty surrounding the potential return on investment. Investors often face significant risks due to the unpredictable nature of market reception and the time it takes to recoup their initial expenditures. Additionally, the complexity of IP accounting makes it difficult for investors to accurately assess the viability of a project. Traditional IP rights can also lead to rent-seeking behaviours, where rights holders exploit their monopolies for prolonged periods without contributing to further innovation or public benefit. Furthermore, fully open-source models, while encouraging collaboration and accessibility, can undermine investment incentives. For example, by providing insufficient financial returns to cover the high initial costs of development and innovation.</p><p>These challenges are exacerbated by the rise of the computational economy driven by digital and computational intellectual property, including software, digital art, algorithms, and large language models (LLMs). Traditional IP frameworks, designed primarily for tangible and less rapidly evolving assets, often fail to provide the flexibility and transparency needed for digital IP. The ODIPR framework addresses these challenges by fostering a digital-first IP economy that leverages advanced technological infrastructure and open registries to ensure real-time transparency and dynamic rights management.</p><p>Open Digital Intellectual Property Rights&nbsp;Trusts</p><p>This is a next generation of rights management that is no longer a static system but a dynamic negotiation between rights capital holders, authors, beneficiaries and societal good. This framework is conceived both as an agreement space and as an agent dynamically optimising across multiple parties. This agent-based approach transforms rights management from static contracts into active, adaptive systems that respond in real-time to the needs and inputs of ALL the stakeholders involved.</p><p>In this envisioned future, the construction and micro-capabilities of these agents allow us to compile and orchestrate them into cohesive systems of intellectual property (fully legible and compatible with compliance regulations such as transfer pricing). These systems manage flows of value and investment at a granular, unitary level while simultaneously supporting complex arrangements of value flows in structured economic&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Managing this future requires the creation of Open Digital Intellectual Property Rights Micro-trusts. These micro-trusts are effectively digital autonomous entities that dynamically manage rights and returns. These micro-entities are critical for operationalizing the ODIPR framework, automatically releasing permissions, managing use cases, and maintaining registries, ensuring seamless and transparent IP management.</p><p>Key Functions of&nbsp;ODIPRT</p><p>The key attributes of an operational ODIPRT are envisaged as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Real-Time Accounting and Transparency: Continuous monitoring of revenue streams and usage metrics provides investors with up-to-date information on the performance of their investments. Open registries ensure that all stakeholders have access to this data, promoting trust and reducing risks associated with information asymmetry.  Adaptability to Technological Changes: Digital IP, particularly algorithms and (large language models) LLMs, can become obsolete quickly due to rapid technological advancements. The dynamic nature of micro-trusts allows for flexible adjustment of IP rights based on the performance and relevance of the asset. This adaptability ensures that investors can respond to market changes swiftly, protecting their investments and encouraging continuous innovation.  Piracy and Unauthorised Use: Digital assets are particularly vulnerable to piracy and unauthorised use, which can significantly undermine their value. Transparent accounting and rights management systems help mitigate these risks by providing clear and enforceable tracking of IP usage. Blockchain technology, integrated into the open registries, offers an immutable record of transactions and usage, further securing digital assets against infringement.  Addressing Monetization Challenges: Monetising digital IP such as algorithms and LLMs is often complex due to their intangible nature and the difficulty in setting fair pricing models. Micro-trusts can facilitate flexible investment structures and dynamic adjustment of rights. This enables stakeholders to experiment with different revenue models, such as subscription-based access, licensing, or performance-based royalties, optimising returns and encouraging broader adoption of digital innovations.  Complex Valuation and Risk Assessment: Valuing digital IP, especially emerging technologies like LLMs, can be challenging due to their novelty and the lack of historical data. The ODIPR model addresses this by providing standardised return multiples based on risk assessment and transparent financial reporting. This helps investors make informed decisions and accurately gauge the potential returns on their investments.  Encouraging Investment in High-Risk Intellectual Projects: High-risk intellectual projects, such as developing advanced algorithms or LLMs, often struggle to secure funding due to the uncertainty and high initial costs. The ODIPR framework’s structured approach to risk assessment and return multiples provides clear incentives for investing in these projects. By offering higher returns for higher risks and ensuring transparent recovery metrics, the model makes it more attractive for investors to allocate capital to cutting-edge digital innovations.  <p>Key Benefits of Open Digital IPR Trust Management</p><p>The real world impact will need to be validated as the framework is operationalised but the following benefits are expected:</p>  Transparent Assembly of Micro-Intellectual Property Rights: The ODIPR framework facilitates the transparent and flexible assembly of micro-intellectual property rights within predefined frameworks. This allows for the dynamic assignment and movement of these rights without the need for complex negotiations.  Market Transparency: By significantly enhancing market transparency, the ODIPR framework improves operational opportunities, making it easier for stakeholders to engage in IP transactions and investments.  Structural Macroeconomic Gain: The seamless assembly of intellectual property and the ability to unleash its potential within society represent substantial structural macroeconomic gains. This fosters a more efficient and dynamic IP market, driving broader economic growth and innovation.  Real-Time Negotiation and Optimisation: The rights management agent continuously negotiates and optimises terms and conditions among rights capital holders, authors, and beneficiaries. This ensures all parties receive fair value based on current market conditions and individual contributions.  Adaptive and Responsive Systems: The agent-based framework adapts to changing circumstances, such as shifts in market demand, technological advancements, and evolving legal landscapes. This responsiveness ensures that rights management remains relevant and effective over&nbsp;time.  Seamless Integration of Multiple Agents: Multiple rights management agents can be compiled and integrated to create systems that manage and optimise flows of value across different sectors and industries. This capability allows for the creation of vast, complex arrangements capable of handling diverse and intricate economic activities.  Enhanced Investment Flows: By dynamically optimising rights and value distribution, the framework promotes more efficient and targeted investment. This encourages innovation and systemic capabilities by ensuring that capital is allocated where it can be most effective.  Transparent and Equitable Value Distribution: The system ensures transparency in the creation, distribution, and utilisation of value. This transparency builds trust among stakeholders and supports a fairer economic system where all contributors are adequately rewarded.  Micro-Level and Macro-Level Benefits: At the micro-level, individual agents optimise value flows for specific projects or intellectual properties. At the macro-level, these agents collectively contribute to a structured economic system that supports large-scale, coordinated economic activity and&nbsp;growth.  Image credit: Irina&nbsp;Wang<p>Framework Structure and Implementation considerations</p><p>The framework is still speculative but will be based on the following pillars:</p>  Initial Investment and Risk Capital Allocation:    Investment Transparency: Open registries disclose detailed investment costs, including R&amp;D, production, marketing, and distribution.  Dynamically Restructured Risk Assessment and Return Multiples: Clear return multiples based on risk encourage capital allocation to innovative projects, with the ability to dynamically adjust based on fiscal policies.  <p>2. Dynamic Use Rights Based on Recovery&nbsp;Metrics:</p>  Real-Time Accounting: Continuous monitoring of capital recovery.  Dynamic Rights Adjustment: Gradual rights release as financial milestones are met, transitioning from exclusive rights to open fair&nbsp;use.  Failsafe End Dates: Guarantees public domain transition after a predefined period.  <p>3. Incentivizing Continuous Innovation:</p>  Reinvestment Strategies: Encourages reinvestment into new projects.  Rewarding Early Adopters: Fiscal incentives for early high-risk investors.  <p>4. Enabling Derivative Quasi-Equity Economies:</p>  Derivative IP Markets: Creation of quasi-equity derivatives based on IP performance.  Flexible Investment Structures: Diversified investment portfolios to spread risk and enhance&nbsp;returns.  <p>Implementing the framework will be an iterative process weaving with multiple layers of the socioeconomic landscape. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Legal Frameworks: Adapting existing IP laws to accommodate dynamic computational rights management, open registries, and failsafe end dates, ensuring legal enforceability and protection of stakeholders’ interests.  Technological Infrastructure: Development of robust platforms for real-time accounting and rights management, leveraging blockchain and smart contracts for transparency and security.  Stakeholder Engagement: Collaboration and trust and market building with creators, investors, and consumers to refine and accept the&nbsp;model.  <p>Conclusion</p><p>The ODIPRT framework effectively addresses the challenges of traditional IP investment by providing a dynamic, transparent, and fair approach to intellectual property management. By ensuring clear paths to investment recovery and preventing prolonged monopolies, this model encourages more robust and confident investment in innovation. It balances the financial needs of creators and investors with the societal benefits of open access, fostering a more equitable and public-interest intellectual property landscape.</p><p>This Learning Note has been written by Indy Johar in collaboration with numerous individual efforts and inputs from across the Dm Ecosystem.</p><p>Operating In good faith (not an IP clause) Version&nbsp;3.1</p><p>We distribute this document, in order to build shared acknowledgement that the problem analysis, concepts, strategies, ideas and innovations outlined herein are the culmination of years of dedicated investment and understanding.

To help, this article will break the process down, and cover how AI can make it even easier.</p><p>As scientific understanding expands, and economies become more competitive, mental illness and mental health conditions have become bigger and bigger challenges to our well-being. </p><p>According to the WHO, anxiety disorders affect approximately 300 million people globally,<a>1</a> with rates rising particularly sharply among young adults and professionals experiencing mental distress.<a>2</a></p> <p>I’m Yngvi Karlson, Co-Founder of <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a>.

Based on research including randomized controlled trials, journaling helps create a safe space for self-reflection and emotional processing,<a>3</a> making it a powerful tool in supporting mental well-being. </p><p>When done properly, the benefits of journaling are a key companion to other approaches like therapy from a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) or health professional, or medication.</p><p>But what is proper journaling? </p><p>To understand that, journaling, and its link to anxiety, must be explored.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde3cf542-9a83-4d2a-be18-6374ae9bf571_1600x1066.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@noemimk?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Noémi Macavei-Katócz</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/black-pen-on-white-printer-book-page-GAv6SVHKQiw?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  What is Journaling? <p>Journaling is the process of writing down thoughts, feelings, and experiences in some way. This is commonly done to help people describe their emotions and feel more able to understand them.</p><p>It’s a highly personal process that looks different for most people, but in the end, it’s still all about helping people make sense of themselves.</p> Understanding Anxiety and Journaling <p>Anxiety manifests both mentally and physically, and like journaling, it does so differently for different people. </p><p>While some anxiety is normal and even helpful in certain situations, those who experience excessive anxiety can attest to how it interferes with daily life, relationships, and overall well-being.</p><p>This is where journaling helps. Attempting to describe anxious thoughts and anxiety-inducing situations in words encourages people to view them objectively, and think about the root of the feelings to describe them fully. This process can help someone realize when and why their anxiety has become excessive, and can even lessen the anxiety itself in some cases.</p><p>Regular journaling can build the habit of approaching anxiety with a logical cause-and-effect mindset even without writing in a journal, and this can help people remember to lean on their coping strategies before their anxiety worsens.</p><p>Let’s look at what kinds of journaling help build this mindset and habit.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ac373a2-d624-4683-a6ac-23adef3b2272_1200x1600.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@prophsee?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Prophsee Journals</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-riding-on-book-OnFW5djcAYc?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  Core Journaling Techniques for Anxiety <p>Various types of journaling have proven particularly effective for managing symptoms of anxiety, with each having its own individual appeal and mental health benefits:</p> Freewriting <p>Freewriting, expressive writing, or stream-of-consciousness writing is perhaps the most famous and popular form of journaling. </p><p>Freewriting involves someone just writing out whatever they feel like, without any worry for topic, grammar, spelling, language, or even sense—there’s no wrong way to do it. A topic could even be chosen for a session if desired; it’d still count.</p><p>While it can take some getting used to, freewriting can help people express negative thoughts and release anxious feelings by encouraging raw thought patterns to be recorded without any kind of conscious filter. This can even reveal feelings, thoughts, or emotions that weren’t clear previously.</p><p>As such, it's particularly effective for overthinking, as it helps move anxious thoughts from your mind onto paper where they can be examined more objectively through self-awareness.</p><p>Like we’ll discuss, too, this doesn’t have to be on paper—word processors, <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbots</a>, and more advanced solutions like <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a> are all options. </p> Worry Logs <p>Worry logs and thought records are exactly what they sound like—a digital or physical note of every worry or important-feeling thought that someone thinks of each day, added when they think of it.</p><p>These logs provide structured ways to track anxiety triggers and individual anxiety symptoms, meaning self-check-ins for mental health states and progress become easier, as data on past and present worries are on hand. </p><p>Regular journaling like this also quickly builds a familiarity with these symptoms and their triggers, so people can more easily recognize and mitigate their anxiety.</p> The 3-3-3 Rule: <p>The 3-3-3 rule involves writing down 3 things that can be seen, 3 that can be heard, and 3 parts of the body that can be moved. It’s a coping strategy and grounding technique to help take someone out of a spiralling tirade of anxious thoughts.</p><p>Similar to its sibling, the 5-4-3-2-1 rule (where someone names 5 things they can see, 4 they can hear, 3 they can feel, 2 they can smell, and 1 they can touch), these popular techniques can be incorporated into journaling easily.</p><p>Doing this helps take someone out of their thoughts, so they can approach their journaling in a less anxious and more objective state. It also helps them associate the rule with feelings of anxiety so that they’re more likely to ground themselves unprompted in the future.</p> Gratitude Journaling <p>Gratitude journaling is again what it sounds like—writing down things that spark gratitude and thankfulness in life.</p><p>While this might seem counterintuitive for anxiety management, shifting focus away from worries toward positives can help some people escape the negative mindset anxiety can cause for long enough to begin to examine and deconstruct it. Others find pairing this with positive affirmations and online positive affect journaling to further enhance your stress management practices.</p><p>Regular journaling in this way also builds the habit of looking for positives every day, rather than dwelling on negatives—which can be a partial cause of anxiety.</p> Thought Challenging <p>Thought challenging is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles, and involves writing down anxious thoughts to then systematically examine their validity. For each anxious thought, write:</p>  <p>The thought itself</p>  <p>Evidence supporting the thought</p>  <p>Evidence against the thought</p>  <p>Whether the thought is a balanced perspective, and what a balanced perspective might look like if not</p>  <p>This cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) technique helps develop coping skills and a more balanced perspective on anxiety-provoking situations. This is because it essentially trains someone through regular journaling not only to debunk their most common anxious thoughts, but to approach all anxieties with skepticism.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed138ba7-babd-4355-98c3-c7cd87f16b22_900x1600.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@ikigloo?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> IKIGLOO</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-book-opened-on-top-of-a-bed-next-to-a-plant-T0TbnqkySPk?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  Getting Started with Anxiety Journaling <p>Beginning a journaling practice for anxiety management is easier than it seems. </p><p>Start by finding a preferred medium to journal in (i.e. a notebook, an app, or just paper). Then, create a dedicated space and time for journaling that feels safe and will be uninterrupted.</p><p>As journaling becomes a habit, it’ll be easier to do it in more distracting environments. For now though, an ideal place might look like a quiet corner of home, a favorite café, or even during a morning commute.</p><p>In the same vein, choose a time where consistency is likely. It can be helpful to attach journaling to an already existing routine, like breakfast or setting the dishwasher, to help encourage consistency.</p><p>It's normal to feel resistance at first. Many people worry about ‘doing it wrong’, or feel uncomfortable confronting anxious thoughts. Remember that there's no wrong way to journal – the most effective approach is the one that is enjoyable enough to do regularly.</p><p>If it’s really hard to start, journal prompts like "What triggered my anxiety today?" or "How did my physical health feel affected when I was anxious?" can help. This isn’t something that must be kept neat, either—doodle in the margins instead of writing, if that helps maintain a regular journaling practice.</p><p>Lastly, keep in mind that journals by nature will contain private and personal thoughts. Whether using a physical notebook or digital platform, ensure the chosen journaling method provides a level of privacy that is comfortable.</p><p>If it doesn’t, locks can be purchased for notebooks, and apps like Kin have been designed for private journaling.</p> Common Challenges and Solutions <p>There are a few common things that can stop new journal users from creating a consistent and helpful habit:</p>  <p>Writer's Block is a common obstacle, particularly when anxiety is high. Combat this by using prompts (like the ones lower down), starting with simple lists, or even drawing if words feel too difficult.</p>  <p>Perfectionism can paralyze journaling efforts, and even cause Writer’s Block. It’s important to remember that a journal is a purely personal thing—it doesn't need to be polished or profound, because no one else will see it. Some of the most therapeutic entries might be messy or seemingly mundane.</p>  <p>Difficult emotions often surface during journaling. While this can feel overwhelming, confronting these emotions in writing actually helps process them more effectively. If certain topics feel too intense, take breaks and consider seeking professional support.</p>   Advanced Journaling Strategies <p>As you become more comfortable with basic journaling, several advanced strategies can deepen its anxiety-managing benefits:</p><p>Emotional awareness exercises involve detailed documentation of physical sensations accompanying anxiety. This helps build the mind-body connection and often leads to earlier recognition of anxiety symptoms.</p><p>Trigger tracking takes worry logs a step further by analyzing patterns over time. Understanding what consistently triggers your anxiety allows for more proactive management strategies.</p><p>Solution-focused entries move beyond processing anxiety to actively planning responses. For each anxiety-provoking situation, document potential solutions and coping strategies.</p><p>Progress monitoring helps maintain motivation by tracking improvements over time. Regular reviews of past entries often reveal positive changes that might otherwise go unnoticed. Bullet journaling can be particularly effective for this, and is worth exploring once journaling feels comfortable.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30965a22-6437-4ca7-a5a8-4f0b0a3e5994_1600x1200.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@jessbaileydesigns?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Jess Bailey</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/pen-near-black-lined-paper-and-eyeglasses-q10VITrVYUM?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  How <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> Can Enhance Anxiety Journaling <p>Modern AI technology has been transformative to traditional journaling practices. AI-supported journaling tools can offer unique advantages, such as pattern recognition in anxiety triggers, emotional tone analysis, and personalized prompts based on your writing history.</p><p>Digital journaling platforms with AI capabilities can provide insights that might be difficult to identify manually. For instance, AI can analyze writing patterns and can access entire journal histories at once to identify correlations between activities, situations, and anxiety levels.

While Kin’s most revolutionary technology revolves around its advanced memory system, its Journal feature makes full use of it.</p><p>Kin’s dedicated <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-use-kins-journal">Journal</a> feature allows users to type or speak a journal entry at any time, guided by optional journaling prompts. Kin then parses the finished entries locally on the user’s device, picking out keywords like people, places, and situations to add to its interconnected memory of the user.</p><p>This ever-growing memory can be analyzed by Kin, allowing it to pick up on trends, patterns, and behaviors that may be contributing to its user’s anxiety, among other things.</p><p>Then, within the <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-use-kins-chat">Chat</a> feature, Kin can make these insights known to its user, and interactively discuss how it reached those conclusions, explain things with web search capabilities, and work with the user to build action plans to change habits and prepare for common anxiety triggers.</p><p>Kin can even create custom push notification reminders to help users build new habits, or just remember things they may forget.</p><p>With all of that personal information available to it, privacy and data protection are foundational to Kin's design—more about that can be found <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">here</a>. In short, though, all of a user’s journal entries and personal data are stored and processed on the user’s device, wherever possible, and only temporarily handed off to approved third parties when necessary.</p><p>Everything Kin knows about someone is <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-view-and-control-your-data">viewable and deletable</a> at any time through the app. Similarly, it’s robustly encrypted so that not even we can read it. Users control their data, not us, so they’re able to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust</a> Kin and be honest, which allows Kin to provide the best emotional support.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91e0f0f2-d858-431c-817a-cb9138bc623a_1600x1066.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@thepaintedsquarejessica?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Jessica Lewis 🦋 thepaintedsquare</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/black-pen-on-black-line-notebook-cdwpR1AUn8o?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  Get Started Today with Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Assistant</a> <p>Sound helpful? </p><p>Kin can be downloaded <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">here</a>.

<p>Howdy folks!&nbsp; As 2025 rolls in, the Holochain team continues progressing steadily toward our goal of delivering stability across the board.&nbsp; At first I didn’t feel like this because the holiday season just always seems to slow things down, but as I look over all the completed issues and pull-requests I must say I’m quite pleased.&nbsp; We’ve shown advancement across all our work domains: the networking layer, Holochain core, developer tooling (scaffolding and the hc command-line tool), runtimes (kangaroo, mobile), testing harness, developer documentation, and the human layer including team process.</p><p>Here’s a recap of the most important things we’ve been up to since the last Dev Pulse in mid-December:</p>  Team Process: We’ve now been able to clear out our backlog review, prioritizing and categorizing work which sets the stage for building out a new road-map. We’ve also been using our project tooling for long enough that we may be even able to produce usable burn-down charts soon and actually predict delivery timelines from data. Now wouldn’t that be cool!I’m going to be showing up more frequently doing communications (like this one), leaving Paul more time to focus on developer documentation.  Dev Docs: We are especially keen in 2025 to live up to the pulls we’ve been getting to flesh out the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Build Guide</a> as we know that it can sometimes be difficult to put all the pieces together just by reading the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rust HDK docs</a> when trying to answer practical how-to questions.&nbsp; Just added are the sections on <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/links-paths-and-anchors?ref=blog.holochain.org">Links</a> and <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/application-structure/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Application Structure</a>.  Holochain Core: We’ve got a release candidate out for Holochain 0.4.1 which fixes a bug that could allow the init callback to be called more than once.&nbsp; This clears the way for initializing cells on headless nodes. 0.4.1 will also include an upgrade to wasmer 5.x, and fixes wasmer module serialization compatibility issues and reduces memory usage by removing redundant caching that was happening.  Networking: The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kitsune 2</a>&nbsp; revamp is coming along nicely, with the peer-store revamp complete, gossip revamp well in progress, refactored fetch queue, and more.  Runtimes: <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kangaroo-electron?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kangaroo</a> (the dev-template for stand-alone Electron-based desktop hApp delivery) has been updated to the 0.4.1 release candidate, and now also has a sys-tray option, improved password management and auto-updating. On the mobile side, our work with partner <a href="https://volla.online/en/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Volla</a> continues strong on the next version of <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/volla-messages/pulse/monthly?ref=blog.holochain.org">Volla Messages</a>, with a UI refactor, and integration into the Android Holochain-as-system-service runtime.  Testing: Last but not least is our testing harness, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/wind-tunnel/pulse/monthly?ref=blog.holochain.org">wind-tunnel</a>. Here we haven’t made as much progress as we’d like for a number of reasons, including the usual excuse of holiday-down-time-coordination-challenges, but actually mostly because we are still working on upgrading from our home-baked TryCP orchestrator to Nomad, a third-party orchestrator which we’ll be using from now on. Even so, we’ve updated the framework to Holochain 0.4, worked on repo chores, and most importantly have made some progress coordinating with the Holo team on the plan for the updated Nomad-base scenario deployment and execution strategy to Holoports.

 Centralized Digital ID: The Risks 



<p>A centralized digital ID system is like a massive database where all your identity information is stored in one location, controlled by a single entity. Think of it as your passport or driver’s license, but in digital form and potentially containing much more data.</p>



<p>Here’s the problem:</p>



 
 Single Point of Failure: If that central database is hacked or compromised, all the data it holds is vulnerable. This could lead to widespread identity theft, fraud, and privacy breaches. 



 Data Misuse: The entity controlling the database has complete access to your information and could potentially misuse it, sell it, or be forced to hand it over to governments. 



 Limited Control: You have little to no control over your own data. You can’t choose what information is shared or with whom. 
 



 Decentralized Digital ID: The Solution 



<p>A decentralized digital ID system, on the other hand, puts you in control. Your identity information isn’t stored in a single location but is distributed across a network. This makes it far more secure and resistant to attacks.</p>



<p>Here’s why Decentralized ID it’s a more secure solution for Data Management:</p>



 
 Enhanced Security: With no single point of failure, decentralized systems are much harder to hack. Even if part of the network is compromised, the rest remains secure. 



 Increased Privacy: You control what information is shared and with whom. This gives you greater privacy and autonomy over your own data. 



 Reduced Costs: Decentralized systems can be more cost-effective by eliminating the need for expensive central infrastructure and intermediaries.

<p>Last week, as various friends in southern California were sharing status updates in social media, comparing details on how to prepare to flee nearby wildfires, and in some cases, seeking new places to live, several shared the below image of what documents to be sure to collect. It’s a very thorough list, and I’ll be the first to admit, I might have a hard time gathering all these documents with just a couple hours’ notice — especially while also preparing to evacuate my family.</p><p>I would guess most Americans would have a similarly hard time. It’s terrifying to think about all your life’s most important papers going up in smoke (or floating downstream, or getting blown away). That’s one of many reasons I’m so proud of the work that SpruceID, and so many organizations across the world, are doing to make sure crucial documents can be safely and securely digitized, in a privacy-preserving and owner-controlled manner.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the next decade, you’ll be able to store even sensitive documents like birth certificates, health records, and social security cards on your phone, using the digital identity technology SpruceID builds. It will be a huge boon for disaster victims and other vulnerable groups.</p><p>I’m enough of an identity and policy wonk to be excited about one of the relatively unsung drivers of that future: U.S. Federal government standards for digital identity management. The fourth revision of the<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-4.2pd.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> NIST 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines</a> was recently issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and they describe how user identities are first proven and then recorded for use in accessing government benefits or tax systems. NIST standards are widely referenced in government procurement standards, leading most private U.S. firms to follow their lead. Foreign governments also look to NIST to inform their own guidance, so the standards have a global impact.</p><p>This round of updates have particularly major implications. NIST standards now include various roles and guidelines for digital credentials (such as<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/"> California’s mobile driver’s license</a>) for logging on to government systems.&nbsp;</p><p>That means digital credentials are going to be a much bigger part of our future.</p> Logging On In a Whole New Way <p>The most important part of the new NIST standards is simply that they include roles for encryption-backed digital credentials for the first time. This will fuel a huge step forward in adoption and acceptance of these technologies, thanks to both its implications for government contractors, and the more general “stamp of approval” their acknowledgement by NIST carries.</p><p>Most notably, this includes guidelines for using digital credentials stored in<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/who-should-build-a-digital-wallet-2/"> user-controlled wallets</a> to log in to Federal services. For the vast majority of users, this will be a new experience of logging on – not with a password, but with a digitally-signed proof of identity stored on a secure hardware chip on your phone. This should lead to broad improvements in security, since passwords have been the chronic target of malicious hackers.</p><p>These new rules will add to the ongoing<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/who-should-build-a-digital-wallet-2/"> adoption of digital wallets</a> as a part of digital life. “Wallets” are pieces of software that manage and display digital credentials, both for real-world and online purposes. More and more people are already relying on them<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/technology/personaltech/mobile-wallet-app.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> instead of physical wallets</a>, and defining them for use in U.S. government systems will only make them more useful, and more ubiquitous. It’s a huge win for cybersecurity – and that’s about more than replacing passwords.</p> Security That Fits <p>The revised digital identity standards also include guidance for using digital credentials as the basis for what’s known as ‘federated’ account management. This would essentially mean one credential, tied to one account, could give access to a host of different services or platforms. For everyday digital citizens, this reduces the surface area they need to protect - only one account to secure with strong passwords+mfa (or even better, phishing-resistant passkeys), as opposed to the over 150 accounts that most adults have today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The NIST guidance also presents an overarching approach to risk management for online services, defining three levels of rigor for identity proofing and authentication, used to set varying requirements depending on the sensitivity of the service being controlled. For instance, Identity Assurance Level 1 (IAL1) simply involves proof that the user is human and not a bot, and that’s enough protection to let a user access, for instance, a purely informational government web page. Higher levels of verification can require more rigorous in-person identity “proofing” for the issuance of a credential, or require multiple authenticators that show control of that credential.</p><p>Descriptions of the new NIST assurance levels now include specific reference to features of digital credentials. The highest Authentication Assurance Level (AAL3) specifically requires encrypted credentials based on key-pair cryptography, and a “hardware-based authenticator with a non-exportable private key”.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s effectively a description of digital credentials stored on trusted hardware, and many of those credentials are issued based on in-person identity proofing that also meets the highest assurance level. That means that in the future, a rigorously-issued digital credential such as a driver’s license could be used as a login for even quite sensitive Federal services.</p> More Security, More Access, More Stability <p>Taken together, updates to the NIST-800 identity standards mean there will be more opportunities to use secure digital credentials, kicking off a virtuous cycle with many, many benefits. Obviously we’re big fans of the improved security digital credentials can provide, and the added privacy thanks to features like<a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> selective disclosure</a>.</p><p>But my thoughts return to the folks across the U.S. who have been displaced and disrupted this past year – whether by a storm, fire, family struggles, or other hardships. With smartphones nearly ubiquitous, digital credentials securely <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/introduction-to-device-binding?ref=blog.spruceid.com">tied to a hardware you carry everywhere</a> – and usable in many cases even without a cellular signal – will become a widespread boon. Whether you’re filing paperwork that will help you get back on your feet, or just logging in to a website you use every day, digital identity means a better future is coming soon.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More About Verifiable Digital Credentials</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

							  A Lifetime In 96 Hours   <p>The last 96 hours have been exhausting. Why wouldn’t it be for the industry that never sleeps? Web3 is 24/7. So what happens when MLK Day, the CFP Championship Game, and the coronation of our new Crypto-Billionaire-in-Chief all fall within the same 24?</p>  <p>Two words: price action. And boy did we get some action. It started with an announcement that American-made web3 solutions would be championed by the Trump administration. (Although it sacrilegiously named XRP and Solana in the same breadth, two projects that couldn’t represent fundamentally more different approaches to building solutions in the space, and yet also the mostly likely rails of our future.)</p>  <p>But this announcement was merely a precursor for what followed next, which was a launch of the official $TRUMP presidential commemorative token (read: shitcoin) on the Solana blockchain, seemingly a fundraising event for the Trump-backed crypto projects within the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>  <p>(Full disclosure: the&nbsp;+SOL team holds the shitcoin in question. I entered at a $27M marketcap with a modest .1 SOL bet at the insistence of my fellow writer Muhammed, which I rode all the way to $70M — and back down to $30M.)<br><br>So what does it mean to be standing in an era where the sitting President opens his second term with a rug pull? While, on the other end of the spectrum, we’ve got&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/amirhaleem/status/1881040828120142165?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=crypto-billionaire-in-chief">Gensler’s farewell</a>&nbsp;(and/or fuck you) present on his way out of office: a lawsuit against the most presently useful and real project in the space, Helium.</p>  <p>I wish I had an answer. But the bizarre and short-lived TikTok ban, despite amounting to just a few hours of non-access, thoroughly disrupted my Sunday morning info consumption. So I’m not sure what the plot of anything is anymore.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But we have to start the search somewhere, so let’s start there. The original movement to ban TikTok in the US actually began as a Trump initiative to counter the influence of China. That was before he was convinced by Barron to leverage the platform for his reelection campaign by influencing young, male voters, an overwhelming majority of which overlap with the current online crypto communities. But at some point in there, it was co-opted by a foreign lobby with a lot to lose from millions of Americans getting together and criticizing the way they wage war, or influencing their access to American taxpayers’ funds.</p>  <p>As a dyed-in-the-wool data nerd, the argument that TikTok has too much access to consumer data feels off. The thesis goes that TikTok is a China-owned propaganda machine influencing American’s political positions. But that doesn’t entirely jive with the reality, which is that TikTok is banned in China (yes,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1bg0xld/has_tiktok_been_banned_in_china/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=crypto-billionaire-in-chief">really</a>), based in Singapore, owned by private individuals from multiple countries, and has less access to data than the average American tech company.</p>  <p>But officially, it’s the data, not the influence, driving the ban. That’s because the data represents the inputs for TikTok’s algorithm, which I am 100% convinced is an unsupervised learning algo aimed at delivering you a personalized feed to maximize your session time by matching videos to your expressed preferences based on past viewing behaviors. This is something American social media companies simply can’t do, because it is not the most direct path to profitability. Instead, they are incentivized to favor the content that primes you to engage with ads, so they can make more money. But that in turn undermines their own usefulness and influence, which is why TikTok is eating their lunch.</p>  <p>The point being, in midst of a major sea change in crypto/online/American culture, only the fools are pretending like they have any clue where this is all going. The Convicts are whooping the Catholics (there’s a Miami in Ohio, and I’m a Wolverine), Zuck caught a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Jason/status/1881401274093940773?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=crypto-billionaire-in-chief">Dirty Sanchez</a>, Elon might have done a Nazi on his way to Mars, and Ross Albricht got a pardon. But at least we still have TikTok, for now, to compare notes.</p>  <p>We live in the most absurd timeline.

							         The Fartcoin Stage of the Market Cycle   <p>Much like swallowed air, legumes, and the human digestive tract can create some unholy alchemy, modern technology has led us to what Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn called “the ‘Fartcoin’ stage of the market cycle.”</p>  <p>Einhorn was talking about the traditional public markets. But in explaining how TradFi valuations had exceeded common sense levels and veered into the territory of absurd and groundless hype, he invoked the reigning champion of the memecoin space, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN).</p>  <p>On one level, Einhorn’s comparison was apt. Fartcoin’s appeal is in no way rooted in common sense. But it’s not inexplicable either. The shitcoin (shartcoin?) is one of several tokens propelled to prominence by the compatability of two new technologies: blockchain and AI. Typically, the best combos are more than the sum of their parts. And indeed, crypto and artificial intelligence together have the intangible “it” factor, creating value where logic might suggest there should be none.</p>  <p>Fartcoin’s value surged another 60% recently, one of the clearest indicators of just how powerful meme-based tokens can be when coupled with AI’s predictive and creative capabilities. Fartcoin’s originated as an AI chatbot’s idea of a joke, with every transaction triggering a fart noise. But it has become a phenomenon. And AI played a crucial role its origin story. By analyzing what types of humor and gimmicks get viral traction, the AI behind&nbsp;Fartcoin&nbsp;has created a memecoin that’s both ridiculously fun and primed for market dominance. The&nbsp;Fartcoin&nbsp;community isn’t just about trading — it’s about shared enjoyment, and that’s where the real value lies.</p>  <p>Elsewhere,&nbsp;Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE), an Ethereum-based memecoin, is bringing a unique twist to the scene by adding an element of utility — something that’s not always common in the meme world. The token has raised an astounding $48 million in presale funding, driven by the promise of empowering retail investors with access to exclusive trading signals and insights.</p>  <p>What sets $WEPE apart is how AI helps democratize trading, by analyzing market patterns and generating strategies that can give smaller traders a fighting chance against the whales. With its ability to process massive amounts of data, AI can offer predictions and strategies in real-time, leveling the playing field and turning meme coins like&nbsp;Wall Street Pepe&nbsp;into something more than just a joke. As AI continues to evolve in the crypto space, it could very well power more meme coins to add genuine value, far beyond the volatility of their initial hype.</p>  <p>Perhaps the most explosive example of AI’s potential in the memecoin world is the rise of&nbsp;iDEGEN. This controversial AI project has already raised over $16 million in presale funding, and its audacious, unfiltered approach to meme creation is turning heads. Created as a social experiment,&nbsp;iDEGEN&nbsp;was programmed to learn from the most deranged, unrestrained corners of crypto communities. Through its unorthodox approach — analyzing and adapting to the language and culture of “degens” — it has skyrocketed in popularity.</p>  <p>But not without a few stumbling blocks. iDEGEN was banned on X for “violent speech”. (That’s what you get for adapting the language of degens.) But it didn’t disappear. It exploded. Supporters launched a #freeiDEGEN campaign that sent presale numbers through the roof. The AI behind iDEGEN learns from user interactions, social media trends, and memetic warfare, creating content that resonates with the chaotic nature of crypto traders. In doing so, it has become the ultimate viral sensation, tapping into one of the most powerful memecoin catalysts: controversy.</p>  <p>Zooming out, we’re witnessing a fundamental shift in how meme coins are created, managed, and marketed. Traditionally, these coins were driven by human-created memes, influencers, or viral moments. Now, AI is taking the reins, analyzing social behavior, predicting trends, and even generating memes that resonate deeply with crypto’s unique culture. It’s not just about creating a coin that rides a wave of internet humor; AI is optimizing these coins to ride waves of market sentiment.</p>  <p>As AI continues to learn and adapt, the relationship between artificial intelligence and meme coins could be poised for significant growth. Unlike traditional projects, these AI-driven coins don’t just follow trends — they create them. The adaptability of AI, combined with the viral nature of memes, creates an ecosystem where anything is possible. From predictive trading to real-time market manipulation, the potential applications are enormous.</p>  <p>However, as AI begins to play a larger role in memecoin creation and management, the potential for manipulation and volatility increases.&nbsp;Fartcoin,&nbsp;Wall Street Pepe, and&nbsp;iDEGEN&nbsp;have all benefited from AI’s ability to predict, analyze, and generate content that speaks directly to the crypto crowd. But as the market matures, so too will the potential risks associated with these projects. AI will need to balance creativity with responsibility, ensuring that it’s not just fueling more speculative bubbles or scams.</p>  <p>In short, the future of AI-driven memecoins is both exciting and uncertain. Will they remain a fleeting trend, or will they become a mainstay of blockchain? Only time will tell, but one thing’s for sure: they’re here to stay, and they’re reshaping the landscape in ways we could have never predicted. So, while&nbsp;Fartcoin&nbsp;might have started as a joke, it’s a glimpse into the future where AI is not just analyzing the world, but creating new assets that reflect the wild, unpredictable nature of the blockchain.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

<p>As we head into the new year, we are highlighting a few topics that are top of mind for Mastercard Open Banking, and how we see the Open Banking landscape evolving over the next 12-24 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 At a Glance&nbsp; 



 
 Open Banking adoption continues to gain traction across the globe – This is a result of increased consumer, merchant, and biller appetite, regulations, borrower demand for a digital mortgage experience, and an increase in account-to-account (A2A) payments usage. As momentum accelerates, there is more emphasis on safeguarding consumer information and protecting against fraud in Open Banking.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 A2A and alternative payment methods are increasing in usage all over the world – Open Banking enables a more seamless A2A experience, particularly in verticals like bill pay, disbursements, and recurring payments. However, there are some barriers that are preventing A2A from scaling.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Looking ahead, we see 4 key themes that are rising in importance in Open Banking – We anticipate that Open Banking will unlock opportunities for consumers and businesses to benefit from their data and allow companies to power next-generation personalized financial services by improving the financial experiences of small businesses, leveraging technology such as Generative AI which powers innovative new use cases (e.g., categorization, security/privacy), integrating closely with Real-time Payments (RTP), and enabling value-added services and personalization with the transition to Open Finance. 
 



<p>Mastercard’s strategy is centered on the trends we are seeing, where we think the Open Banking market is headed, and being a valued and trusted partner to our customers by enabling them to provide enhanced financial experiences to their end users.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 What we’re seeing in the market&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 
 Open Banking is on the rise around the world, driven by different tailwinds. Consumers want more automated and digitized ways to move money, to manage their finances (e.g., by viewing their financial data and unlocking actionable insights), and more transparency and control of their data. They are using Open Banking for topping up their investment accounts, funding their wallets, and applying for mortgages. Regulations, Open Banking players pushing forward innovative solutions, and the desire for seamless, enhanced financial experiences are all drivers of Open Banking. In Europe, <a href="https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/advisors/sustainability-financial-inclusion-consulting/insights/four-european-takes-open-banking">Open Banking use is expected to double by 2027</a> and in the UK, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">70% of consumers</a> connect their financial accounts directly to tools to conduct financial tasks. In the U.S., <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">80% of consumers</a> also already link their financial accounts. Open Banking in Australia is still relatively nascent, but <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">89% of B2B users</a> report using Open Banking today. Brazil has been a trailblazer in Open Finance – there were 4.8B API calls in June 2023 in Brazil, <a href="https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/industries/financial-institutions/insights/open-banking-latin-america">four times the number of calls in the UK</a>. We are cognizant that as Open Banking matures, more and more markets will adopt and accelerate its usage. At Mastercard, market expansion opportunities are evaluated where there is greatest demand, and we will innovate and test concepts in markets that are maturing.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Regulations are changing the landscape for Open Banking. Open Banking regulations are at different stages in key global markets. While Europe and the UK were some of the first to introduce Open Banking regulation with the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and later, Payment Services Regulation (PSR), other countries around the world are putting their own regulatory frameworks in place. For example, Canada’s Department of Finance (DoF) and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) are also working on elements of Open Banking regulation in the country. Several countries in Africa are adopting frameworks for Open Banking, and Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are launching innovative measures to test Open Banking solutions. <a href="https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/industries/financial-institutions/insights/open-banking-latin-america">Mexico and Brazil led the way in Latin America</a> in establishing Open Banking regulations, with a particular focus on Open Finance and leveling the playing field between fintech startups and incumbent banks. We will continue to work across the ecosystem to support our customers, consumers and small businesses in navigating regulatory changes.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Borrower demand for digital mortgage experiences is increasing. Homebuyers in the U.S. are indicating that they are more interested in leveraging digital channels for mortgages. Those surveyed cited process acceleration (75%) and making the process easier (71%) as the <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/perspectives/opportunities-exist-offer-digital-verification-tools-more-homebuyers">top benefits of a digital mortgage process</a>. Open Banking is key to powering these experiences – it allows lenders to securely collect financial data digitally, conduct more comprehensive assessments of an applicant’s financial health, and make more informed loan decisions. To meet consumer demands and streamline the lending process, Mastercard has collaborated with U.S. government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as <a href="https://www.finicity.com/blog/fannie-mae-single-source-mortgage-verification/">Fannie Mae</a> and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/in-the-news/freddie-mac-expands-digital-capabilities-to-help-lenders-reach-more-qualified-borrowers/">Freddie Mac</a> in connection with certain digital verification of asset, income and employment solutions. These new mortgage solutions are driving more demand for Open Banking and alternative data sources in lending.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 A2A payment flows are becoming a more common way to pay. While there are multiple payment options available to consumers and businesses today (credit cards, debit cards, BNPL, cash, etc.), A2A payments are the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/fututre-bill-payments-report/">second-most preferred payment choice</a> for bill payment in the U.S. and are increasingly being adopted worldwide. On a global level, <a href="https://offers.worldpayglobal.com/rs/850-JOA-856/images/TheGlobalPaymentsReport2024.pdf?_gl=1*cxjse5*_gcl_au*MTkzODM0NDcwLjE3MjM2NzAzMzQ.*_ga*MTU1MzQxOTEwNi4xNzIzNjcwMzM0*_ga_9HB8S1WFYN*MTcyMzY3MDMzMy4xLjEuMTcyMzY3MDM2Ni4wLjAuMA..">A2A payments for e-commerce are expected to grow</a> at a 14% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) through 2027. Government-led schemes for A2A are proliferating its usage in countries including India (Unified Payments Interface), Brazil (PIX) and Thailand (PromptPay). Open Banking-powered A2A payments can transform the A2A experience by making it a seamless and secure way to pay – in particular, we’re seeing Open Banking powered payments pick up in verticals like bill pay, disbursements, recurring payments – where paying by ACH (traditional A2A method) has already been popular in the U.S., for example. Recognizing this market demand, we are partnering with players like JPMC and Worldpay in the U.S. to scale A2A for their customers. We are also continuing to explore innovative solutions that would enable the scaling of A2A globally – for example, Mastercard’s approach to Open Banking helps protect the ecosystem to make OB-enabled A2A payments seamless and secure.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Fraud and identity risk are top of mind. While Open Banking will provide new opportunities, like with any exchange of personal data online, there are also risks. As more people use digital channels for financial experiences, there is the possibility for fraudsters to find new ways to attack businesses and consumers. It is estimated that the <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2025-cybersecurity-risk-privacy/">worldwide costs of cybercrimes</a> will reach $12T in 2025 and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">94% of consumers</a> surveyed say that it’s important that financial institutions keep consumer financial data secure. To ensure consumers feel safe using Open Banking and the experiences it powers, fraud mitigation plays a significant role – for example, leveraging identity verification and device intelligence at account opening, multi-factor authentication at sign in1, and predictive risk signals for payments. At Mastercard, we remain committed to maintaining best-in-class security and data privacy for our Open Banking assets. This is why we are leveraging our rich network of global identity insights and device verification, and integrating them with our Open Banking offering. We believe Open Banking and fraud mitigation will continue to go hand-in-hand as the ecosystem matures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Spotlight on A2A Trend&nbsp; 



 What are A2A Payments?&nbsp; 



 
 Account-to-Account (A2A) payments are electronic money transfers from one bank account to another.​ A2A payments can be initiated in two ways, either as a push payment — initiated by the party making the payment — or as a pull payment — initiated by the party collecting the payment. Many consumers already use A2A payments by simply sending money between their own bank accounts or transferring money to someone using platforms like PayPal or Cash App. The 4 main use cases for A2A are Bill Payments, Me2Me, Person to Merchant (P2M), and Person to Person (P2P):&nbsp; 
 







 Growth in A2A is being driven by a number of factors:&nbsp;&nbsp; 







 However, A2A payments are still experiencing some challenges to widespread adoption:&nbsp; 



 
 Suboptimal A2A checkout process:  A2A payment methods have either required consumers to input bank account numbers or login to their bank’s portal for each purchase, which can be time consuming and error prone. In countries where A2A has gotten more traction (e.g., India, Brazil), it has been primarily through QR code which is a suboptimal experience. &nbsp; 
 



 
 Inadequate consumer purchase protections compared to card:  Many A2A payment methods lack the same protections that card payments have, and that both consumers and merchants want.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Lack of trust: There is a lack of trust from some consumers towards A2A payments, because they have a familiarity with methods like credit and debit payments and are accustomed to their reliability and ubiquity.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Lack of scaled use by merchants: Merchants face certain risks with traditional A2A payments, including declines due to insufficient funds, unauthorized returns, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 How does Open Banking enhance A2A?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Without Open Banking: Traditional A2A is a clunky experience, as consumers need to either initiate bank transfers through their bank account directly or manually enter their banking account and routing number through a suboptimal checkout experience. In some markets, there is also limited transparency in payment settlement timing and risk of payment, for merchants/billers who are offering A2A to their customers. For example, merchants must manually verify customer bank accounts with micro-deposits, and there may be a multiple day delay for a successful A2A payment. Lastly, traditional A2A lacks the rich data insights to verify identity, and to prevent fraud/ non-sufficient funds returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 

 



 

 
 



<p>With Open Banking: Open Banking makes A2A payments seamless for consumers. Instead of the error-prone process of finding and manually entering account details – consumers can now leverage the latest technology to easily share their bank data. Powered by Open Banking, A2A payments can be made quickly, with extremely rich insights – such as account owner verification, balance checks, risk indicators, tokenization and fraud signals. In any market, Open Banking makes A2A payments easier, faster, and convenient. Additionally, Open Banking can help in the fight against fraud. For example, when a consumer initiates an account-based payment from their bank account, Mastercard enables account validation to confirm account ownership and validate identity details in real-time through Mastercard Open Banking, drawing on the safe exchange of <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/news/press/2024/april/mastercard-transforms-the-fight-against-scams-with-latest-ai-tech/">consumer-permissioned data</a> to facilitate frictionless and secure payments.&nbsp;</p>

 What will it take to make A2A payments more mainstream?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>We believe that there is a positive trajectory for A2A payments. For A2A adoption to scale in use cases like ecommerce, it is important that consumers feel as secure using A2A as they do with other payment methods. Consumers also prefer a more user-friendly and streamlined user experience which removes friction from the A2A journey. Merchants and digital players are looking to provide consumers with a range of payment options, so helping to integrate A2A payments into their existing platforms will improve merchant acceptance and be vital in adoption. Lastly, we believe the scaling of A2A payments will be contingent on value-added services, which leverage consumer data (with consent) to create a secure and seamless payments ecosystem. We believe Open Banking can power many of these enhancements to A2A, to help scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Looking Ahead&nbsp; 



<p>In addition to A2A, there are a number of market forces and themes that we think will be prominent in the Open Banking landscape over the next 12-24 months. A few are highlighted below –&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 There is untapped potential in Open Banking use cases for small businesses. We believe more small businesses will use Open Banking to easily and safely share their banking information, paving the way for an easier lending process and customized financial recommendations to help them with their cashflow.  <a href="http://finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking">92% of businesses surveyed</a> believe that it is somewhat to very important to have the latest technology for risk decisioning and credit scoring. Mastercard already offers a comprehensive solution set for small businesses – including real-time business account data, rich cash flow and balance analytics, smarter credit decisioning, etc. and we are continuing to enhance based on what is priority for <a href="http://finicity.com/business">SMBs</a>.3&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Use cases for AI in Open Banking will continue to evolve, enabling more personalized financial services experiences. For example, Generative AI can power financial assistants that can make investment recommendations, help with data categorization to give a comprehensive picture of finances, enable more inclusive lending processes, as well as power smarter payments systems with predictive capabilities. We believe AI is a powerful tool for Open Banking, and this is why we’ve been leveraging it to categorize and extract insights from transaction data, which feed into downstream AI models that power our <a href="https://openbankingeu.mastercard.com/blog/ai-and-open-banking-a-powerful-duo/">payments and lending solutions</a>. We’ve also partnered with players like bunq, the second largest neobank in Europe, to <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/europe/en/newsroom/press-releases/en/2024/bunq-first-bank-in-europe-to-leverage-ai-in-open-banking-with-mastercard/">power spending insights for users – leveraging AI</a>. However, we recognize that data transparency, security, and protecting against bias will become even more important, as Open Banking and AI are intertwined to solve for new and innovative use cases.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Real-time payments (RTP) will accelerate, led by the launch of FedNow in the U.S., and the SEPA Instant Payments Mandate in Europe. RTP has already seen strong success in other countries around the world like PIX in Brazil, UPI in India, etc. For consumers, RTP provides the option for swifter bill payments and near instant payouts, especially important for gig economy workers. Businesses are afforded faster settlements, improved payroll, and reduced disputes due to more efficient reconciliation and refunds. Bank adoption and use of RTP rails in the U.S. are still emerging, due to issues such as coverage/interoperability, irrevocable funds, and fraud risk. ​However, government pushes for RTP in Europe and the U.S. may catalyze adoption. Open Banking providers have an opportunity to build out use cases that accommodate RTP and mitigate the fraud risks that come with it. For example, Open Banking can provide risk insights and recommendations around the timing of payment and rail choice. In the U.S., Mastercard Open Banking is providing merchants, fintechs and banks rail agnostic risk signals, enabling payment decisioning across payment methods, and supporting consumer choice and flexible merchant usage.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Open Banking will move towards Open Finance, as more expansive datasets are used to offer more personalized and actionable insights and value-added services for consumers. Open Finance moves beyond Open Banking by covering more financial data inputs (e.g., payroll, insurance, investment/brokerage data). The European Commission is working to establish an Open Finance framework that would outline clear rights and obligations to manage customer data sharing in the financial sector beyond payment accounts. In Australia, the CDR is expanding to Open Finance with non-bank lenders and BNPL product providers set to be brought into scope in early 2025 (with first compliance obligations to commence in mid-2026). We believe regulation and consumer demand will serve as a foundation for the expansion into Open Finance, and will create further innovation for services like employee benefits, wealth advisory, etc. Mastercard is already supporting Open Finance in the U.S. – we have connections to payroll and investment data, as well as mortgage data and auto loan data, and are continuing to expand datasets. &nbsp; 
 



<p></p>

  Debunk common myths about global sanctions, PEP, and AML screening in this guide for US businesses. Learn why even domestic companies need global compliance, and discover how iComply's tools streamline screening, uncover hidden risks, and ensure regulatory readiness.

<p></p>



<p>Many US business managers believe that if their operations are strictly domestic, they don’t need to worry about global sanctions, PEP (Politically Exposed Person) screening, or AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance. This assumption may seem logical, but it’s a myth that can lead to serious consequences.</p>



<p>Let’s break down the common myths and set the record straight on why global screening matters—even for businesses that only operate within the US.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Myth #1: If My Business Is Domestic, I Don’t Need Global Screening</p>



<p>Fact: Even if you only serve US customers, their connections might not stop at the border. A customer or vendor could have ownership ties to a sanctioned individual overseas, or they might be based in a high-risk jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Without global screening, these connections can easily slip through unnoticed, leaving your business vulnerable to regulatory penalties and reputational harm.</p>



<p>For example, imagine processing a payment for a US-based entity, only to discover later that it’s controlled by a sanctioned party in another country. The consequences? Fines, investigations, potential jail time, not to mention – a major and longstanding hit to your company’s reputation.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Myth #2: US Regulators Only Care About Domestic Compliance</p>



<p>Fact: US regulators like OFAC and FinCEN expect businesses to monitor global connections. They understand how intertwined the world is today and require you to screen for international risks.</p>



<p>Neglecting global compliance can result in steep fines and even loss of operating licenses. Worse, it can damage your relationships with partners and customers. Staying ahead of these expectations is key to avoiding regulatory pitfalls.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Myth #3: Global Screening Is Too Complicated</p>



<p>Fact: While global sanctions lists and PEP databases are complex, advanced tools make screening manageable. Platforms like iComply provide real-time access to global data, automating much of the heavy lifting.</p>



<p>These tools identify hidden risks, such as complex corporate structures designed to obscure ties to high-risk individuals or sanctioned entities. With the right technology, global compliance becomes a streamlined process that protects your business and saves time.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Myth #4: Global Coverage Only Matters for Multinational Companies</p>



<p>Fact: Even small businesses can benefit from global screening. Suppose you’re a US-based firm working with a foreign supplier. If that supplier has ties to financial crime or sanctions violations, your business could be held accountable.</p>



<p>By implementing global screening now, you safeguard your operations and build a foundation for growth. Plus, when it’s time to expand into international markets, your compliance framework will already be in place.</p>



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>The Role of Technology in Global Compliance</p>



<p>Managing global compliance manually is a daunting task, but technology makes it easier. iComply’s platform provides:</p>



 
 Real-time global data for sanctions and PEP screening. 



 Robust tools to uncover hidden risks in complex ownership structures. 



 Automated workflows to streamline screening, refresh, and review processes. 
 



<p>These tools help businesses like yours stay compliant, efficient, and ready for growth.</p>



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>The Bottom Line</p>



<p>In today’s interconnected world, no US business is truly isolated from global risks. Whether it’s sanctions screening, PEP monitoring, or AML compliance, adopting a global perspective is essential for protecting your operations and building a sustainable future.</p>



<p>By busting the myths and embracing the realities of global compliance, your business can avoid pitfalls, earn trust, and thrive in a competitive marketplace.</p>

 Learn how to transform avatars with advanced AI for lifelike interactions in gaming, customer service, and virtual spaces 



<p>Non-playable characters (NPCs) are an essential element in video games. They are vital to making your digital universe feel realistic and serve as companions for the players. However, creating these virtual characters has always been a challenging and time-consuming task. But now, things are changing for the better.</p>



<p>Thanks to Union Avatars and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a>, the process of creating NPCs is easier than ever.</p>



<p>These tools are revolutionizing the manner we design and animate our virtual characters, bringing them to life and making them more realistic and engaging. Thus, if you’re a game developer looking to enhance your game’s interactive experience, these tools are a game-changer. They not only streamline the character creation process but also save you a ton of time and effort. Are you ready to bring your virtual world to life like never before?</p>



 

 



<p>What is NVIDIA ACE?&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a> is a suite of advanced AI technologies designed to bring digital humans and avatars to life. Leveraging generative AI, ACE enables the creation of highly interactive and realistic characters for various applications, including gaming, customer service, and virtual environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a>, developers can integrate state-of-the-art models for speech recognition, natural language processing, and facial animation, allowing for dynamic and unscripted interactions with non-playable characters (NPCs) and avatars. This technology not only enhances the immersion and interactivity of digital experiences but also provides flexible deployment options, making it accessible for both cloud-based and local implementations.</p>



<p>Powering Union Avatars through NVIDIA ACE</p>



<p>To bring to life one of our avatars, we built a simple application based on microservices that provide intelligence, voice, and facial animation to the character. We used OpenAI and <a href="https://elevenlabs.io">ElevenLabs</a> for text and speech generation and NVIDIA ACE to generate facial animations and to provide lip sync. Then, everything is rendered by Unreal Engine 5 in real time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following figure is a process diagram showing what happens each time the user sends a message to the avatar:</p>







<p>NVIDIA ACE Plugin for Unreal Engine</p>



<p>The <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace/get-started/">NVIDIA ACE plugin </a>allows your Unreal Engine application to communicate with NVIDIA ACE services. The ACE Plugin supports <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/audio2face">NVIDIA Audio2Face</a> (minimum v1.0) to animate your character by sending to the service voice the audio you provide and it sends back the corresponding animation data.</p>



<p>ARKit standard:&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ARKit blend shape standard is predefined facial expressions and movements used to animate 3D characters based on real-time facial tracking data. In Union Avatars these keys are always available, so avatars can replicate a wide range of facial expressions, from subtle eye movements to complex mouth shapes. NVIDIA Audio2Face will generate the animation using this standard, so our avatars can be used out-of-the-box without further tweaking.</p>







<p>Text and speech generation:</p>



<p>To provide the avatar with response generation we are using GPT-4o, one of the most advanced LLMs available. By providing some extra context we can give the avatar a background, and some information relevant to the user.</p>



<p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction">https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction</a></p>



<p>To generate the speech, we feed the text generated by GPT into a custom voice in Eleven Labs.</p>



<p><a href="https://elevenlabs.io/docs/introduction">https://elevenlabs.io/docs/introduction</a></p>



<p>Custom REST API:</p>



<p>To easily handle all these requests, we built a custom REST API in Python to centralize all the different tasks into a single call. By calling the endpoint /response we can generate a reply, synthesize the speech, and start the ACE A2F stream.</p>



<p>Connecting Union Avatars and ACE Step by step:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Download your avatar from Union Avatars
 
 Make sure to download it with blendshapes 
 
 
 







 
 Download and install the NVIDIA ACE Plugin in Unreal:
 
 Download the plugin from this link: <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace/get-started/#section-ace-tools-and-reference-workflows">https://developer.nvidia.com/ace/get-started/#section-ace-tools-and-reference-workflows</a> 



 Drag and drop it inside your project’s /Plugin folder 



 Enable the plugin in Menu Bar &gt; Edit &gt; Plugins 
 
 
 







 
 Setup NVIDIA Audio2Face Microservice + Controller
 
 Clone the quick deployment docker-compose and config files from here: <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE/tree/main/microservices/audio_2_face_microservice/quick-start">https://github.com/NVIDIA/ACE/tree/main/microservices/audio_2_face_microservice/quick-start</a>&nbsp; 



 Follow the documentation below: https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/latest/modules/a2f-docs/text/deployment/containers.h tml#quick-deployment-of-audio2face-and-a2f-controller-microservices 



 Once the setup is complete, run it using docker-compose 
 
 
 



 
 Change the Audio2Face server config:
 
 Go to Menu Bar &gt; Edit &gt; Project Settings 



 Scroll down to Plugins &gt; NVIDIA ACE 



 Change the Dest URL to: http://127.0.0.1:52000 127.0.0.1: Since we are running the container locally in host network mode 52000: The port used by a2f-controller 
 
 
 







 
 Drag and drop your avatar into the project. Tweak the materials and scene to your preference. In the pop-up window, make sure the check the option “Import Morph Targets”. 
 







 
 Create a new Animation Blueprint for the imported avatar
 
 Create a new Animation Blueprint 
 
 
 







 
 And the following Anim Graph. The important bit here is the ‘Apply ACE Face Animations’ node. In our case we are also adding some idle animations and blinking. You can make your own setup using this as a reference. 
 







 
 Add the ACE component to your avatar blueprint:
 
 Open your blueprint 
 
 
 







 
 In the Components tab select the character Skeletal Mesh 
 







 
 Click Add and choose ACE Audio Curve Source 
 







 
 Sending a local WAV file to ACE
 
 Get a reference to your Avatar Blueprint in level&nbsp; 



 Invoke the blueprint Animate Character from the WAV File 
 
 
 







 
 Done! Now if you press play you will see the avatar playing the generated motion and hear the audio playback inside Unreal as well. 
 



<p>Well done! Now your character is brought to life by Union Avatars and NVIDIA ACE, ready to captivate users like never before. Imagine what a custom chatbot with the same technology could do for your brand. <a href="mailto:info@unionavatars.com">Contact us</a> to explore how Union Avatars can empower your business with immersive, AI-driven experiences.</p>

<p>The terminology swirling around the world of digital identity can be overwhelming. Are we talking about verifiable credentials? Digital credentials? What about verifiable digital credentials? Do these terms have profound technical distinctions? Barely (though I suspect some of the more deeply engaged individuals may disagree). The nuances mostly arise from standards politics, the English language, and some good old-fashioned product marketing.</p>



 The Birth of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) 



<p>In 2017, the W3C Verifiable Credentials working group was formed to define a framework for sharing and verifying digital claims. They published the Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1 in 2019, and version 2 is now in the Candidate Recommendation stage. The W3C defines a verifiable credential as: “A tamper-evident credential whose authorship can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build verifiable presentations, which can also be cryptographically verifiable.”</p>



<p>As the term “Verifiable Credentials” gained traction, other organizations started exploring similar ideas for digital credentials that could be cryptographically verified. As you might expect, they sought to avoid confusion with the W3C’s model and put their own stamp on things, which has led us to these to terminology shifts.</p>



 Terminology Overlap in Standards and Marketing 



<p>The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spice/about/">IETF Secure Patterns for Internet Credentials</a> (SPICE) working group and the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-credentials">WICG Digital Credentials API project</a> chose to call their work “digital credentials.” According to the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/digital-credentials/">Digital Credential API</a>, a digital credential is: “A cryptographically signed digital document containing one or more claims made by an issuer about one or more subjects.”</p>



<p>While clear and concise, this term lacks the specificity needed to encompass the complexities involved. SPICE WG adds further nuance, defining a digital credential as: “A digital credential expresses claims about a subject and links them with cryptographic keys. Some sets of claim names have already been defined by the IETF and other standards development groups (e.g., OpenID Foundation).”</p>



<p>Recognizing this, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently adopted the term <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/digital-identities-getting-know-verifiable-digital-credential-ecosystem">Verifiable Digital Credentials</a> (VDCs) to bridge the gap between descriptive clarity and brevity. NIST defines VDCs as: “A cryptographically verifiable, digital representation of a credential or attributes secured in a dedicated application, often referred to as a digital wallet.” NIST is careful not to promote any specific solution or organization, so they’ve had to be particularly careful in selecting a term that is market-neutral.</p>



 A Tale of Media Types and Standards Conflicts 



<p>So, knowing there is confusion in the terminology is one thing. Let’s look at how that actually plays out in standards development.</p>



<p>The OAuth working group meeting at <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/121/session/oauth">IETF 121</a> highlighted historical and technical challenges with defining and typing credentials. Brian Campbell presented a session on “SD-JWT and SD-JWT VC,” which included a truly excellent perspective on the history that led to some of this confusion; you should watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIBqlHkuXY">recording</a>.</p>



 
 JWS/JWE/JWT:
 
 JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) initially included type headers and media types to describe payloads. However, their utility for typing was minimal, as the data type could often be inferred by parsing the payload. 



 The IETF introduced explicit typing for tokens, such as application/at+jwt for access tokens, to clarify expectations for processing. 
 
 
 



 
 Verifiable Credentials:
 
 The term originated from W3C but was perceived as inaccessible by some. 



 A key debate arose around JSON-LD (a JSON-based format for Linked Data). While JSON-LD wasn’t initially mandatory, it later became a requirement for compliance with the W3C VC data model, leading some groups to pursue simpler alternatives within the IETF. 
 
 
 



 Media Type Conflicts 



<p>The overlapping work between the W3C and IETF led to conflicts in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">media type</a> registries; it’s basically a functional example of how definitions and politics impact standards development. In this case, the W3C registered media types like vc+ld+json+sd-jwt, while the IETF sought to define types for SD-JWT VCs (Selective Disclosure JSON Web Tokens). This duplicity caused confusion and poses a threat to interoperability.</p>



<p>Don’t get too anxious about this example; working group participants did figure out a potential path forward. What people in the know will refer to as “the Dublin Proposal,” the group agreed to recommend a new media type, dc+sd-jwt, for SD-JWT VCs and tighten the scope and accelerate the timeline for relevant RFCs to make sure their position is solidly established.</p>



 The Challenge of Naming Things 



<p>Naming things is one of the <a href="https://www.karlton.org/2017/12/naming-things-hard/">two hardest problems</a> in computer science. Where we are with digital credentials that can be verified is reflected in terminology confusion for all sorts of things throughout the industry. <a href="https://idpro.org">IDPro®</a>, a professional organization for identity practitioners, has a freely available <a href="https://idpro.org/body-of-knowledge">Body of Knowledge</a> (full disclosure: I’m the principal editor for that work) that includes a <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/41/">consolidated terminology</a> document. The terminology includes definitions from every article in the BoK, resulting in multiple definitions for even basic terms like “authentication.” It’s like we are compelled to make things difficult for ourselves.</p>



<p>For identity professionals, here’s my suggestion: always clearly define your terms. This could mean explicitly referencing a specification that outlines the definition you’re using or providing your own definition if no clear standard exists. Even in code, include comments clarifying which model or framework you’re adhering to.</p>



<p>For product marketers, I get the need to differentiate your solutions, but it will be much more compelling if you indicate you are standards’ compliant AND what standards you are compliant with. It may result in more words, but those words will help your customers have a much better sense of what you’re offering. Educated customers are the best.</p>

<p>The Top Cybersecurity Threats of 2025 and How to Protect Yourself</p>



<p>Imagine logging into your favorite e-commerce site only to discover that your account has been compromised. Even worse, the breach wasn’t your fault—it was the result of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats that dominate our digital age. In 2025, cyberattacks are evolving faster than ever, with new tactics and technologies putting individuals and organizations at risk. Here’s a look at the top threats and actionable steps you can take to protect yourself.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The Rise of Advanced Phishing Techniques</p>



<p>Phishing remains a cornerstone of cybercrime, but the 2025 version is far more advanced. Threat actors are leveraging generative AI to create hyper-realistic phishing emails, complete with personalized details and convincing logos. Variants like vishing (voice phishing) and quishing (phishing using malicious QR codes) are also becoming more prevalent. Cybercriminals now have the ability to spoof voice or video content, adding a layer of deception that even the savviest users may find challenging to detect.</p>



<p>What You Can Do:</p>



 
 Verify Links: Hover over URLs before clicking to confirm their legitimacy. 



 Be Skeptical: If an offer or request feels too urgent or too good to be true, verify it directly through a trusted contact or platform. 



 Invest in Training: Regular phishing simulations and awareness campaigns can help you and your organization stay vigilant. 
 



<p></p>



<p>Deepfake Manipulation</p>



<p>Deepfake technology, once a novelty, has matured into a powerful tool for deception. Threat actors use AI-generated videos and voice clips to impersonate trusted individuals or executives, gaining access to sensitive data or initiating fraudulent transactions. This technology is particularly dangerous in the context of spear phishing, where a single high-value target can compromise an entire organization.</p>



<p>What You Can Do:</p>



 
 Authenticate Communications: Establish multi-factor verification methods, such as requiring verbal confirmation of sensitive requests. 



 Utilize Detection Tools: AI-powered tools can help identify manipulated audio and video content. 



 Limit Personal Data Sharing: Reduce the amount of information shared on social media, which can be used to tailor convincing deepfake attacks. 
 



<p></p>



<p>Ransomware Evolution</p>



<p>Ransomware is no longer just about encrypting data. In 2025, attackers are doubling down on double extortion tactics: threatening to publicly release sensitive data if ransom demands aren’t met. Additionally, ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platforms make it easier for novice hackers to launch devastating attacks, democratizing cybercrime.</p>



<p>What You Can Do:</p>



 
 Regular Backups: Keep backups of critical data in secure, offline storage. 



 Patch Vulnerabilities: Ensure your software and systems are always updated to prevent exploitation of known weaknesses. 



 Adopt Zero-Trust Policies: Limit access to sensitive data and systems based on strict verification protocols. 
 



<p></p>



<p>IoT and Smart Device Exploitation</p>



<p>As homes and workplaces become more connected, the Internet of Things (IoT) introduces new vulnerabilities. Unsecured smart devices—from thermostats to security cameras—are being exploited to launch attacks or infiltrate networks. Attackers also exploit hardware manipulation techniques to bypass security measures.</p>



<p>What You Can Do:</p>



 
 Secure Devices: Use strong, unique passwords for IoT devices and change default settings. 



 Network Segmentation: Keep IoT devices on separate networks from critical systems. 



 Monitor Activity: Employ tools that can detect unusual behavior across connected devices. 
 



<p></p>



<p>Generative AI Exploits</p>



<p>Generative AI presents dual-edged capabilities in cybersecurity. While it aids in detecting threats, it also empowers cybercriminals to automate attacks, craft convincing fake identities, and develop sophisticated malware. AI-generated phishing emails or malicious code can now be created in seconds, making it imperative to bolster defenses.</p>



<p>What You Can Do:</p>



 
 Deploy AI Defenses: Invest in AI-driven cybersecurity tools to proactively detect and mitigate threats. 



 Set Usage Policies: Restrict the use of generative AI in ways that could inadvertently expose sensitive data. 



 Train Employees: Ensure staff understand the risks and ethical considerations of AI in the workplace. 
 



<p></p>

<p>With our bleeding-edge <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">3.0 release</a> of the Anonyome Labs decentralized identity (DI)&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;just coming hot off the press, we’re excited to announce that we’ve already pushed the version 3.1 release out the door, packing new features to enhance the SDK even more.</p>



<p>As a refresher, our DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;lets our customers easily integrate DI and verifiable credential (VC, or reusable credential) solutions into their applications. The DI <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;is a native SDK for both iOS and Android and notably does not rely on any third-party frameworks such as JavaScript frameworks.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">3.0 release</a> primarily brought in European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) aligned standards, such as OpenID4VC (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>) and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a>. Our 3.1 release continues this trajectory by adding support for the modern industry-leading DI trust infrastructure, <a href="https://cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>.</p>



 Consumers now have more choice of decentralized and scalable infrastructure to underpin their DI operations 



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) provide cryptographic infrastructure to many of the credential formats in the DI ecosystem. As such, it’s crucial that Anonyome supports a wide range of DID types (methods), so our customers can choose the best method for their use case.</p>



<p>Within the 3.1 release of the mobile wallet SDK, we bundle in new support for resolving three DID methods that are gaining mass adoption: <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method">cheqd</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">Web</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md">JWK</a>.</p>



<p>With this integration, consumers now have more options for a decentralized and scalable infrastructure to support their DI operations. This is particularly timely because Sovrin, one of the original DI ledgers our edge agent supported, unfortunately <a href="https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=b2c2f50b93f0ad7684f55ccde&amp;id=97dcc86838">announced it will probably end operations in 2025</a>. cheqd is a comparable modern alternative.</p>



<p>We’ve also added support for the <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/advanced/anoncreds">cheqd Anoncred method</a>, allowing the mobile wallet SDK to receive <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Anoncred</a>-formatted VCs, in addition to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCDM</a> VCs, secured by cheqd Trust Infrastructure. This work is in tandem with <a href="https://cheqd.io/blog/expanding-cheqd-into-aca-py/">cheqd’s recent efforts in ACA-Py</a>, which allows ACA-Py cloud agents to issue and verify VCs backed by cheqd.</p>



<p>As usual, we’ve actively tested our SDK solution against the issuer and verifier open source software in the DI ecosystem, <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy">ACA-Py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts">Credo-ts</a>, to ensure we remain interoperable with other agents.</p>



<p>Best of all, Anonyome has open sourced these new DID resolvers within VCX, a codebase we <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/aries-vcx-anonyomes-commitment-to-decentralized-identity/">contribute to and maintain</a>.</p>



 Where to next? 



<p>We are excited to have checked off these new DID suites from the roadmap outlined in our recent <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">3.0 release announcement</a>. Looking ahead, we will continue to pursue the features on that roadmap, including enhancements to the OpenID4VC protocol suite—particularly as OpenID approaches 1.0 releases of these standards—and the ongoing expansion of DID methods, such as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh">did:webvh</a> (formerly did:tdw).</p>



<p>What’s more, we are actively developing a security enhancement to allow SDK consumers to leverage hardware security modules (HSMs), such as those built into modern mobile phones, for performing the cryptography that secures their DI use cases. This feature is in alignment with EUDI regulations, which you can <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/can-an-existing-digital-identity-wallet-leverage-a-hardware-security-module-to-meet-new-eu-standards/">read more about here</a>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for our next DI mobile wallet SDK announcement.</p>



<p><a href="http://anonyome.com/businesses">Anonyome Labs</a>’ business solution&nbsp;combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of enterprise-ready APIs and SDKs, so you can quickly build and deploy next-generation privacy, cyber safety, and decentralized identity apps to help your customers communicate privately, navigate online safely, and transact securely in an increasingly connected world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Supreme Court to Decide Proper Legal Standard for Texas Pornography Age-Verification Law</p>



<p>The Supreme Court is reviewing the constitutionality of Texas’ 2023 age-verification law for pornography websites, which requires “reasonable age verification methods” for content harmful to minors. Opponents, including the Free Speech Coalition, argue it infringes on adults’ First Amendment rights and raises privacy concerns through mandatory digital or government ID checks. A district court blocked the law using “strict scrutiny,” but the 5th Circuit reversed, applying “rational-basis review” and allowing it to take effect. The Supreme Court will decide whether strict scrutiny applies, potentially sending the case back for reconsideration, or affirm the 5th Circuit’s decision. The Biden administration supports strict scrutiny while acknowledging states’ ability to protect children online. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-texas-age-verification-requirement-for-pornography-websites/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz---1apKUxqEpEnfTmIDCjzWnTl4IRukl24nGNbF5aa7-unlxUvUxCv4guLPhUGtiu7yJecm">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>UK Government Proposes Ban on Ransomware Payments for Public Sector and Critical Infrastructure</p>



<p>The U.K. government has proposed banning public sector and critical infrastructure organizations from paying ransomware demands to deter cybercriminals. The move follows major attacks, such as one on the NHS that disrupted patient care. The proposal includes mandatory reporting of ransomware incidents and safeguards to prevent payments to sanctioned entities. The National Cyber Security Center reports a rise in ransomware attacks, often by Russia-linked groups targeting critical infrastructure. A public consultation on the proposals runs until April 2025, though there are no immediate plans to present the measures to Parliament. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/uk-plans-to-ban-public-sector-organizations-from-paying-ransomware-hackers/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_0riV7lddUMqCzcf1sEWmwvCz8CtwM3dOvcz4IRJssiVgB1Iy0jHS4uRLncXSbbwzrm-s">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>U.S. Disrupts Chinese State-Backed Hacking Campaign Using PlugX Malware</p>



<p>U.S. authorities have disrupted a Chinese state-backed hacking group, “Twill Typhoon” (aka “Mustang Panda”), which used the malware “PlugX” to infiltrate millions of computers worldwide in a long-term espionage campaign. On January 9, 2025, the Department of Justice revealed that, with court approval, the FBI removed PlugX malware from thousands of U.S. systems during an August 2024 operation led by French authorities with support from cybersecurity firm Sekoia. Active since 2014, PlugX, often installed via USB ports, was used to steal sensitive files, targeting European shipping firms, Indo-Pacific governments, and Chinese dissident groups. Despite allegations of funding the group, the Chinese government denies involvement. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/doj-confirms-fbi-operation-that-mass-deleted-chinese-malware-from-thousands-of-us-computers/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_0riV7lddUMqCzcf1sEWmwvCz8CtwM3dOvcz4IRJssiVgB1Iy0jHS4uRLncXSbbwzrm-s">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Gravy Analytics Data Breach Exposes Sensitive Location Data of Millions Worldwide.</p>



<p>A breach at Gravy Analytics exposed millions of location data points from apps like fitness trackers and dating platforms, revealing movements through sensitive sites and private homes. Stolen via a misused Amazon cloud key, the data risks deanonymization, endangering vulnerable groups like LGBTQ+ individuals. Following an FTC ban on its data practices, Gravy’s reliance on real-time ad bidding highlights privacy risks.

<p>Supreme Court Weighs TikTok Ban Amid National Security Concerns and First Amendment Debate</p>



<p>The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing TikTok’s challenge to a law requiring it to sever ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. app store ban by January 19, 2025. The government cites national security concerns over potential data misuse and disinformation, while TikTok argues the ban violates First Amendment protections. If enforced, TikTok would lose app store access, updates, and functionality. President-elect Donald Trump supports delaying the ban for negotiations, but legal and legislative issues persist. The U.S. would be the first Western democracy to impose a full ban, following India’s example, while NATO and European nations have limited restrictions. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-arguments-65506b1f?mod=tech_more_article_pos2&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8hmq0cc5zBAkNb8S6v44H-FOeWGtNkh-69m9Ul4000AkAYuO2IQ_eRI6hgiCfAPGYAGY6l">(Source)</a></p>

			 Christian Stricker is Digital Marketing Intern at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>I’m Christian Stricker, born in Luxembourg to Danish parents. Currently finishing a Bachelor’s Degree in Media Design in Eindhoven, which is the latest on my big list of projects/problems to solve. Having something to work towards always keeps me motivated, and that can be something simple like creating my favorite dish, to more complex projects where I utilize my full potential.</p>
<p>I have a few hobbies but the main ones are motorsports and fitness. I often participate in virtual sim racing competitions in cars which I have designed myself. A perfect way to blend my professional skills and hobbies into one. For the fitness side, I play touch rugby with the Luxembourgish team every week, go on runs in the forest, and ski.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before Tokeny, while I was completing my bachelors degree, I was involved in a global project of building and managing a website overhaul for a factory automation company. This taught me a lot about web development, project management and marketing. I thoroughly enjoyed this, so when the opportunity to join Tokeny arose I was ecstatic. Especially since I have been looking at working in the web3 industry.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Innovative, challenging but very rewarding. The team is very motivated and everyone working here has a strong belief in what Tokeny is doing for the future. I am not just a number here, my inputs are valued and working alongside the others has taught me a huge amount about myself, and the web3 industry.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>If I were to condense all my passions into one it would be: Learning and Improving. My main passion is racing. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be a driver and as I grew up I tried making this a reality. I spent countless hours learning racecraft and how to handle a car, then I would apply my learnings to the track in karts. I have taken part in a few karting races and won 2 of them. Beating the competition is the motivation, and nothing is more rewarding than finally earning the top spot of the podium.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To live a life knowing I did my best, even if I don’t achieve all my goals. As long as I have given it my best shot, I will never have to think, what if?</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Don’t be afraid of accepting new challenges, keep an open mind, and the team is always there to help you improve. Your hard work will be recognized.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>We are at the beginning of something that can completely change the way we do finance in the future. Opening up a whole new world of opportunities for institutions and investors. I am excited to be part of this journey and see where it leads us.</p>

<p>David, the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at a mid-sized credit union in British Columbia, faced a daunting challenge. His credit union had been flagged in an internal audit for inadequate compliance processes related to KYB (Know Your Business), KYC (Know Your Customer), and AML (Anti-Money Laundering). With the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) tightening AML regulations, David knew that continuing with their web of disconnected solutions and manual workflows was no longer viable.</p>



<p>The stakes were high. Non-compliance could lead to hefty fines, reputational damage, and even restrictions on operations. To address the gaps, David and his team began exploring ways to overhaul their compliance processes. They quickly realized they had two choices: continue patching together multiple disconnected systems or adopt iComply’s holistic compliance platform. Here’s how David’s team turned their challenging and complicated compliance journey into a success story.</p>



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>The Status Quo: A Web of Inefficiency</p>



<p>Before adopting iComply, David’s credit union relied on a fragmented system for compliance. KYB checks were done through multiple vendors, KYC was manual – usually requiring members to come to the branch for routine updates, and AML monitoring involved a time-consuming mix of spreadsheets and third-party tools. Each step required manual effort, from verifying documents to cross-checking sanctions lists and PEPs (Politically Exposed Persons).</p>



<p>This setup caused significant challenges:</p>



 
 Time-Consuming Workflows: Staff spent hours reconciling data across different platforms. 



 High Costs: Licensing multiple solutions added up, with limited ROI. 



 Increased Risk: Manual processes led to errors, exposing the credit union to potential non-compliance. 



 Poor Member Experience: Onboarding new members was slow and frustrating, affecting satisfaction and retention. Existing members were frustrated by the credit union’s policiy to force members to come to the branch in order to provide updated documents for KYC refreshes. 
 



<p>David knew that meeting BCFSA’s stringent AML guidelines required a transformative solution—one that could consolidate systems, automate workflows, and enhance security.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>The iComply Difference</p>



<p>When David’s team evaluated iComply, the benefits were clear. Unlike traditional solutions, iComply offered an end-to-end compliance platform designed to address the unique challenges of small to medium financial institutions. Here’s how iComply reshaped their approach:</p>



 
 Consolidation of Systems: iComply replaced eight disconnected systems with a single, unified platform. This meant KYB, KYC, and AML workflows could be managed seamlessly from one place, eliminating redundancies and errors while simplifying processes. 



 Edge Computing for Enhanced Security: With iComply’s proprietary edge computing technology, sensitive member data was processed and encrypted directly on their devices. This ensured that no unencrypted data left the local environment, significantly reducing privacy risks and better aligning with their requirements around data governance and their members expectations for data privacy and security. 



 Automation and Efficiency: Tedious tasks like document verification, sanctions screening, and biometric identity checks were automated. Real-time alerts flagged potential issues, allowing David’s team to focus on high-priority cases instead of getting bogged down in manual reviews. 



 Improved Member Experience: By streamlining onboarding, iComply enabled new members to complete verification in minutes, not days. This frictionless experience boosted member satisfaction and reinforced the credit union’s commitment to member privacy, security, and service. 



 Cost Savings: Consolidating systems and automating processes reduced licensing fees, as well as integration, maintenance, and operational costs. The ROI was immediate, with fewer resources spent on compliance operations and more available for growth initiatives.<br> 
 



 



<p></p>



<p>Meeting BCFSA Requirements with Confidence</p>



<p>The BCFSA’s AML guidelines emphasize early identification of risks, robust documentation, and ongoing monitoring. With iComply, David’s credit union exceeded these standards:</p>



 
 Comprehensive Screening: Real-time access to global sanctions, PEP, and watchlist data ensured thorough due diligence. 



 Transparency and Reporting: Automated audit trails and detailed reports made regulatory reviews straightforward and stress-free. 



 Ongoing Monitoring: Continuous risk assessment tools allowed David’s team to stay ahead of potential threats. 
 



<p></p>



<p>A New Value Proposition for Members</p>



<p>Adopting iComply wasn’t just about compliance—it reinforced the credit union’s value to its members. By ensuring the highest levels of security and privacy, the credit union demonstrated its commitment to protecting members’ financial well-being. Additionally, faster onboarding and streamlined services enhanced member trust and loyalty.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Creating Exceptional Member Experiences</p>



<p>For David and his team, choosing iComply was a game-changer. The credit union now operates with confidence, knowing its compliance processes are robust, efficient, and fully aligned with BCFSA requirements. They’ve saved time, reduced costs, and significantly lowered their risk exposure—all while improving member satisfaction.</p>



<p>If your financial institution is still struggling with disconnected systems and manual workflows, it’s time to consider iComply. Like David’s credit union, you can transform compliance from a burden into a strategic advantage.</p>

<p>2024 was a year of immense growth for Bluesky. We launched the app publicly in February and gained over 23M users by the end of the year. With this growth came anticipated challenges in scaling Trust &amp; Safety, from adding workstreams to adapting to new harms.</p>
<p>Throughout 2024, our Trust &amp; Safety team has worked to protect our growing userbase and uphold our community standards. Our approach has focused on assessing potential harms based on both their frequency and severity, allowing us to direct our resources to where they can have the greatest impact. Looking ahead to 2025, we're investing in stronger proactive detection systems to complement user reporting, as a growing network needs multiple detection methods to rapidly identify and address harmful content. In Q1, we'll be sharing a draft of updated <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">Guidelines</a> as we continue adapting to our community’s needs.</p>
 Overview 
<p>In 2024, Bluesky grew from 2.89M users to 25.94M users. In addition to users hosted on Bluesky’s infrastructure, there are over 4,000 users running their own infrastructure (Personal Data Servers), self-hosting their content, posts, and data.</p>
<p>To meet the demands caused by user growth, we’ve increased our moderation team to roughly 100 moderators and continue to hire more staff. Some moderators specialize in particular policy areas, such as dedicated agents for child safety. Our moderation team is staffed 24/7 and reviews user reports around the clock. This is a tough job, as moderators are consistently exposed to graphic content. At the start of September 2024, we began providing psychological counselling to alleviate the burden of viewing this content.</p>
 Reports 
<p>In 2024, users submitted 6.48M reports to Bluesky’s moderation service. That’s a 17x increase from the previous year — in 2023, users submitted 358K reports total. The volume of user reports increased with user growth and was non-linear, as the graph of report volume below shows:</p>

  
  Report volume in 2024

<p>In late August, there was a large increase in user growth for Bluesky from Brazil, and we saw spikes of up to 50k reports per day. Prior to this, our moderation team handled most reports within 40 minutes. For the first time in 2024, we now had a backlog in moderation reports. To address this, we increased the size of our Portuguese-language moderation team, added constant moderation sweeps and automated tooling for high-risk areas such as child safety, and hired moderators through an external contracting vendor for the first time.</p>
<p>We already had automated spam detection in place, and after this wave of growth in Brazil, we began investing in automating more categories of reports so that our moderation team would be able to review suspicious or problematic content rapidly. In December, we were able to review our first wave of automated reports for content categories like impersonation. This dropped processing time for high-certainty accounts to within seconds of receiving a report, though it also caused some false positives. We’re now exploring the expansion of this tooling to other policy areas. Even while instituting automation tooling to reduce our response time, human moderators are still kept in the loop — all appeals and false positives are reviewed by human moderators.</p>
<p>Some more statistics: The proportion of users submitting reports held fairly stable from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, 5.6% of our active users<a>1</a> created one or more reports. In 2024, 1.19M users made one or more reports, approximately 4.57% of our user base.</p>
<p>In 2023, 3.4% of our active users received one or more reports. In 2024, the number of users who received a report were 770K, comprising 2.97% of our user base.</p>
<p>The majority of reports were of individual posts, with a total of 3.5M reports. This was followed by account profiles at 47K reports, typically for a violative profile picture or banner photo. Lists received 45K reports. DMs received 17.7K reports. Significantly lower are feeds at 5.3K reports, and starter packs with 1.9K reports.</p>
<p>Our users report content for a variety of reasons, and these reports help guide our focus areas. Below is a summary of the reports we received, categorized by the reasons users selected. The categories vary slightly depending on whether a report is about an account or a specific post, but here’s the full breakdown:</p>
 
 Anti-social Behavior: Reports of harassment, trolling, or intolerance – 1.75M 
 Misleading Content: Includes impersonation, misinformation, or false claims about identity or affiliations – 1.20M 
 Spam: Excessive mentions, replies, or repetitive content – 1.40M 
 Unwanted Sexual Content: Nudity or adult content not properly labeled – 630K 
 Illegal or Urgent Issues: Clear violations of the law or our terms of service – 933K 
 Other: Issues that don’t fit into the above categories – 726K 
 
<p>These insights highlight areas where we need to focus more attention as we prioritize improvements in 2025.</p>
 Labels 
<p>In 2024, Bluesky applied 5.5M labels, which includes individual post labels and account-level labels. To give an idea of volumes, in Nov 2024, 2.5M videos were posted on Bluesky<a>2</a>, along 36.14M images. This comes primarily from automation where every image as well as frames from each video is sent to a provider for assessment, they return verdicts that match to our specific labels, and those are the ones you see from Bluesky Moderation. None of the images or videos are retained by the vendor or used for training generative AI systems. In June 2024, we analyzed the effectiveness of this system and concluded that the overall system was 99.90% accurate (i.e. it labeled the right things with the right labels). Human moderators review all appeals on labels, but due to backlogs, there are currently delays.</p>
<p>The top human-applied labels were:</p>
 
 Sexual-figurative<a>3</a> - 55,422 
 Rude - 22,412 
 Spam - 13,201 
 Intolerant - 11,341 
 Threat - 3,046 
 
 Appeals 
<p>In 2024, 93,076 users submitted at least one appeal in the app, for a total of 205K individual appeals. For most cases, the appeal was due to disagreement with label verdicts.</p>
<p>We currently handle user appeals for taken-down accounts via our moderation email inbox.</p>
<p>In 2025, we will transition to responding to moderation reports directly within the Bluesky app, which will streamline user communication. For example, we’ll be able to report back to users what action was taken on their reports. Additionally, in a future iteration, it will be possible for users to appeal account takedowns directly within the Bluesky app instead of having to send us an email.</p>
 Takedowns 
<p>In 2024, Bluesky moderators took down 66,308 accounts, and automated tooling took down 35,842 accounts for reasons such as spam and bot networks. Mods took down 6,334 records (posts, lists, feed etc.) while automated systems removed 282.</p>
<p>This month (January 2025), we’ve already built in policy reasons to Ozone, our open-source moderation tool. This will give us more granular data on the takedown rationale moving forward.</p>
 Legal Requests 
<p>In 2024, we received 238 requests from law enforcement, governments, legal firms, responded to 182, and complied with 146. The majority of requests came from German, U.S., Brazilian, and Japanese law enforcement.</p>
<p>In the chart below, User Data Requests are requests for user data; Data Preservation Requests are requests for Bluesky to store user data pending legal authorization to transfer the data; Emergency Data Requests are extreme cases where there’s a threat to life (i.e., someone actively discussing their own suicide with a time and date given for an attempt); Takedown Requests are requests for content removal; Subpoena Requests are largely user data requests, but if Bluesky fails to provide the data in a timely manner, it has to physically show up in court to defend not providing the data.</p>

 Copyright / Trademark 
<p>In 2024, we received a total of 937 copyright and trademark cases. There were four confirmed copyright cases in the entire first half of 2024, and this number increased to 160 in September. The vast majority of cases occurred between September to December.</p>
<p>We published a <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/copyright">copyright form</a> in late 2024, which provided more structure to our report responses. The influx of users from Brazil meant that professional copyright companies began scraping Bluesky data and sending us copyright claims. With the move to a structured copyright form, we expect to have more granular data in 2025.</p>
 Child Safety 
<p>We subscribe to a number of hashes (digital fingerprints) that match known cases of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). When an image or video is uploaded to Bluesky and matches one of these hashes, it is immediately removed from the site and our infrastructure without the need for a human to view the content.</p>
<p>In 2024, Bluesky submitted 1,154 reports for confirmed CSAM to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Reports consist of the account details, along with manually reviewed media by one of our specialized child safety moderators. Each report can involve many pieces of media, though most reports involve under five pieces of media.</p>
<p>CSAM is a serious issue on any social network. With surges in user growth also came increased complexity in child safety. Cases included accounts attempting to sell CSAM by linking off-platform, potentially underage users trying to sell explicit imagery, and pedophiles attempting to share encrypted chat links. In these cases, we rapidly updated our internal guidance to our moderation team to ensure prompt response times in taking down this activity.</p>

				  The Biden administration’s latest Executive Order (EO), on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/16/executive-order-on-strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity/">“Strengthening and Promoting Innovation in the Nation’s Cybersecurity,”</a> focuses on preventing digital identity theft as a critical component to reducing cybercrime and fraud.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Tim Spring</p>
<p>Stronger digital identities</p>
<p>The White House released the final Executive Order from the Biden administration today calling for strong cybersecurity measures, and one measure they pointed out specifically was “the acceptance of digital identity documents to access public benefits programs that require identity verification, so long as it is done in a manner that preserves broad program access for vulnerable populations and supports the principles of privacy, data minimization, and interoperability.”</p>
<p>This effectively means replacing the current account and password systems that most online portals use. While these current systems offer a convenient, quick way to gain access, they have been known to be insecure for years.</p>
<p>So what would these “digital identity documents” actually look like?</p>
<p>At the most basic level a digital identity document is a combination of personally identifiable information that you can tie to an individual to prove who they are online. One example that you might have heard of is a Mobile Driver’s License or mDL, which are also referenced in the order as a potential way to gain access to public benefit programs.</p>
<p>Moving past the basics, to get the most functionality and security out of these documents they will need a few additional features.</p>
<p>They need to be stored locally with the end user</p>
<p>Third party storage of personal data for identity authentication is always at risk of a data breach</p>
<p>They need to be tamper-proof and un-copyable</p>
<p>The integrity of the information must be verifiable and it must be bound to the person it belongs to in a way that someone else can’t use it.</p>
<p>They need to be interoperable</p>
<p>Being locked out because you’re on a mac and the other party is on PC and they don’t play well together won’t work at this scale, we need a universal solution</p>
<p>The Executive Order also stresses the privacy preserving nature of these documents, saying they should “support user privacy and data minimization by ensuring only the minimum information required for a transaction — often a “yes” or “no” response to a question, such as whether an individual is older than a specific age — is requested from the holder of the digital identity document.”</p>
<p>Decentralized identity</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is the solution to the White House Executive Order. Everyone controls their own personal data and that data can be verified as authentic, as bound to the person it rightfully belongs to, and that it has not been manipulated.</p>
<p>The benefit of decentralization is portable trust. Any information —&nbsp;and not just personal data —&nbsp;can be sealed in a digital container called a Verifiable Credential. The way that container is created means you always know where it came from. The way the data is sealed means that any attempt to tamper with it breaks the seal.</p>
<p>As an architecture for our information economy, decentralized identity takes out the weak points of our current system —&nbsp;centralized databases filled with personal data for verifying identity — and replaces them with a much simpler, resilient, seamless way of proving who we are to each other.</p>
<p>The result is that information can go from anywhere to everywhere and be immediately acted on — and of course, by providing a reliable method for individuals and organizations to prove their identities online, verifiable credentials help reduce the risk of identity theft and unauthorized access to sensitive systems.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity frameworks offer a transformative approach to identity management. Unlike traditional centralized systems, decentralized identity places control of personal data back in the hands of individuals. This model not only enhances privacy and security but also reduces the risk of large-scale data breaches that have plagued centralized databases.</p>
<p>The Executive Order’s promotion of innovative developments and use of emerging technologies is an acknowledgment of the potential of decentralized identity to strengthen the nation’s cybersecurity infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better see how these technologies work, you can see a demonstration of using Verifiable Credentials to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvCNvWud3Ys">access your bank account</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StRH7uOqxQA">fly internationally</a> in a joint effort between Indicio, SITA, Delta Airlines, and the Government of Aruba.</p>

  SpruceID is advancing privacy-preserving Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) to enhance security, streamline verification processes, and protect user privacy in international travel and immigration.

<p>Digital credentials are on the road to broad availability in the U.S. These cryptographically signed digital documents are one variety of VDC, or Verifiable Digital Credential. They enhance user privacy while making credential checks faster and more trustworthy, using unforgeable cryptographic signatures to prove their authenticity and accuracy.</p><p>As VDC usage continues to grow within the United States and other nations, a new challenge rises ahead: creating digital versions of passports and international travel documents with the same privacy and security benefits as the mobile driver’s license. SpruceID is now<a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/dhs-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> contributing to the effort</a> to push VDC-based digital identity beyond U.S. borders. Read on to learn more about the benefits of digital identity for travelers, immigrants, and the world.</p> User Privacy and National Security <p>Digital passports, immigration, and work authorization documents are still almost entirely analog documents – paper, usually backed up by a database. The next generation of these credentials, though, will be able to “live” on your smartphone or other mobile device. <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-licenses-technology/digital-signatures?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Cryptographic signatures</a> will prevent them from being copied or altered while making it possible to verify them without checking a separate database.</p><p>Read More:<a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-licenses-technology/digital-signatures?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> Digital Signatures</a></p><p>These Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) are sometimes also known as privacy-preserving digital credentials (PPDCs), highlighting how central privacy is to their technical design. One major privacy benefit of travel and immigration documents based on VDCs is <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">selective disclosure</a> – proving your citizenship, for instance, without sharing less relevant data like your spouse’s name. Similarly, part of the stated goal of the push for digital travel documents is to minimize the system’s reliance on biometrics, such as face-scanning, which can generate high-risk data. The potential to verify digital credentials without contacting a central server for confirmation also means VDCs can be used without leaving “footprints” that <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/the-importance-of-protecting-digital-id-users-from-phone-home-surveillance/">could be used for surveillance</a>.</p><p>This doesn’t just serve individual privacy: the broader stakes for national security have also become increasingly clear. State-affiliated hacks targeting infrastructure and data are becoming <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/cisa-releases-mobile-security-guidance-after-chinese-telecom-hacking/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">larger, more frequent, and more pernicious</a>. Though it sounds extreme, it’s not difficult to imagine a long-term compromise of digital travel control systems giving a foreign enemy or other bad actors detailed visibility into the movements of government officials or high-ranking business leaders.</p><p>Such a compromise could be a very powerful intelligence advantage for America’s enemies. That’s one reason for a recent U.S. government <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">push for privacy-preserving data tools</a>. If travel systems are digitized in a privacy-first way, the current moment is an opportunity to spread the privacy advantages of digital credentials around the world.</p> More Secure Processes and Borders <p>In addition to enabling more private verifications, VDCs are also more trustworthy compared to paper documents – particularly in situations where remote verification isn’t available or practical. Fully verifying a paper document generally requires access to a central database, but access to that database is often restricted. Just as regional driver’s license databases are often <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/records/sharing-your-information?ref=blog.spruceid.com">restricted to law enforcement, insurers</a>, and a handful of other entities, passport information is even more strictly limited – in the U.S., to the <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Passport-Records-Imaging-System-Management-PRISM-PIA.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">State Department</a> and Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, passports have in recent years been the<a href="https://identityweek.net/trends-in-fraudulent-identity-documents-in-2022?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> most frequently forged identity documents</a> around the world, according to Identity Week. This is driven not by individuals hoping to travel on a fake passport, as airport security checkpoints are far more likely to use a remote database for confirmations. Instead, forged passports are most often used to deceive employers trying to determine a job applicant’s work eligibility. For instance, forged British and Irish passports are widely used to <a href="https://identityweek.net/trends-in-fraudulent-identity-documents-in-2022?ref=blog.spruceid.com">circumvent eligibility requirements</a> to work in France and mainland Europe – a situation where the document itself must stand as the final source of trust.</p><p>Thanks to physical security features, paper passports are difficult to forge—but clearly, not impossible. In fact, it appears that we are on the cusp of a potential flood of fake paper documents unleashed by AI: reports in 2024 found that AI is making forged identity documents much less expensive to produce.</p><p>Read More: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/28/ai-is-the-final-blow-for-an-id-system-whose-time-has-passed/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">AI is the Final Blow for an ID System Whose Time Has Passed</a></p><p>The signature scheme behind VDCs is vastly superior to paper documents in this and similar cases. While identity database access is constricted, a directory of valid signatures on a digital document can be entirely public, and the signature cannot be forged by anything short of a physical attack on the servers where a document issuer’s digital “keys” are securely stored.</p> Faster and More Convenient – Online and Off <p>Using digital signatures instead of paper documents to verify passports can also dramatically speed travel processing. Without access to a central database, individual screeners will often have to devote considerable time to evaluating individual documents. Verification of a digital document using cryptographic signatures is near-instant while also eliminating the ambiguities and risks of physical document review.</p><p>Another emergent benefit of digital credentials for migrants and travelers is the ability to store and manage virtual documents on the mobile phone you already carry. In regions where payments and identity tools are already available on smartphones, consumer preference is quickly shifting towards being able to leave the house with a phone but without physical credit cards or ID. While it’s a radical shift from as little as a decade ago, smartphones have become ubiquitous enough that the same habit is likely to become common worldwide. It seems likely to be particularly appealing for refugees or other migrants in unstable situations when keeping track of one smartphone is easier than a large sheaf of paperwork.</p><p>Finally, VDCs are a step-change in the accuracy and ease of verifying documents online. Physical documents are particularly vulnerable to forgery when presented online, particularly in the post-AI era. Presenting a passport as a digital photo, for instance, makes it impossible to accurately check physical security features like a hologram. A digital signature, by contrast, can be confirmed by a website or kiosk as quickly and accurately as by a human operating a scanning device. This dramatically increases the reliability of immigration and travel management through remote online portals.</p> A Safer, Freer World <p>The United States is pursuing VDC-based international travel systems in significant part because the technology comports with Western democratic values. VDC technology is easy to use to work outside of omnipresent surveillance while surpassing the trustworthiness of paper documents.</p><p>SpruceID’s work with the Department of Homeland Security is part of a broader U.S. national strategy to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">push VDCs</a> and other privacy-preserving digital technology forward. We hope to help drive adoption outside of the U.S. as well, with potentially substantial benefits for privacy and security worldwide.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/dhs-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn About SpruceID’s Work With DHS</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Emily, a seasoned compliance officer, remembers the days when performing a KYC (Know Your Customer) refresh meant a mountain of manual work. Tasked with ensuring her financial services firm remained compliant with evolving regulations, Emily had to juggle stacks of outdated spreadsheets, endless email threads, and hours of manual data verification.</p>



<p>But today, thanks to iComply’s streamlined platform, Emily’s team has revolutionized their approach to KYC refreshes, making them faster, more accurate, and far less stressful. Here’s a look at how she transformed her processes and achieved compliance with confidence.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 1: Planning and Preparation</p>



<p>Previously, Emily’s KYC refresh process began with manually identifying accounts due for updates. This meant combing through spreadsheets to cross-reference customer profiles with regulatory requirements—a time-consuming and error-prone task.</p>



<p>Now, with iComply, Emily’s team uses automated workflows to flag accounts requiring a refresh based on predefined rules, such as changes in risk profile or regulatory deadlines. This automation ensures no account is missed and allows her team to focus on higher-value tasks.</p>



<p>Checklist for Planning and Preparation:</p>



 
 Identify accounts needing updates based on risk or regulatory timelines. 



 Use automated tools to flag accounts requiring a refresh. 



 Ensure all necessary customer data is centralized and accessible. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 2: Customer Outreach</p>



<p>In her previous role, Emily spent hours crafting individual email templates and following up with customers to gather updated documentation. Tracking responses was chaotic and often resulted in delays.</p>



<p>With iComply, Emily’s team now automates customer outreach. Personalized requests for updated documents are sent through a secure portal, complete with clear instructions. Customers appreciate the seamless experience, and Emily’s team can track responses in real time.</p>



<p>Checklist for Customer Outreach:</p>



 
 Automate personalized outreach to customers with secure communication tools. 



 Provide clear instructions and a user-friendly portal for submitting updates. 



 Monitor responses and set reminders for follow-ups. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 3: Document Verification</p>



<p>Manual document verification was one of the most time-consuming parts of Emily’s old workflow. Her team had to manually check IDs, match information, and ensure authenticity.</p>



<p>Now, iComply’s platform automates document verification with advanced AI-driven tools. These tools cross-reference submitted data against global watchlists, ensuring compliance while significantly reducing errors and processing time.</p>



<p>Checklist for Document Verification:</p>



 
 Use automated tools to verify submitted documents. 



 Cross-check customer data with global sanctions and PEP lists. 



 Flag discrepancies for manual review. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 4: Risk Assessment and Scoring</p>



<p>Previously, performing a risk assessment involved manually calculating scores based on various risk factors, often requiring input from multiple teams. This process was not only inefficient but also inconsistent.</p>



<p>With iComply’s integrated risk assessment tools, Emily’s team now generates consistent and accurate risk scores automatically. This allows for quick identification of high-risk customers who may require enhanced due diligence.</p>



<p>Checklist for Risk Assessment:</p>



 
 Automatically calculate risk scores based on predefined criteria. 



 Review flagged accounts for potential issues. 



 Update customer profiles with risk assessments. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 5: Reporting and Compliance</p>



<p>One of Emily’s biggest challenges used to be generating compliance reports for internal audits and regulatory reviews. Gathering data from disparate sources often led to delays and incomplete records.</p>



<p>With iComply, reporting is now effortless. The platform generates comprehensive audit trails, ensuring Emily’s team is always prepared for regulator inquiries. This gives her the confidence to demonstrate compliance at any time.</p>



<p>Checklist for Reporting:</p>



 
 Generate audit trails automatically to track all actions. 



 Prepare compliance reports with detailed documentation. 



 Ensure records are stored securely for easy access during audits. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Transforming Compliance with iComply</p>



<p>Today, Emily no longer dreads KYC refresh cycles. By leveraging iComply’s advanced platform, her team has:</p>



 
 Reduced manual work by automating repetitive tasks. 



 Improved accuracy with AI-driven document verification and risk scoring. 



 Enhanced customer experience with seamless, secure communication. 



 Gained confidence in their compliance readiness through robust reporting tools. 
 



<p>For Emily, the difference is night and day. With iComply, her team not only meets regulatory requirements but also sets a higher standard for efficiency and customer trust.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a compliance officer like Emily or part of a team managing KYC processes, iComply can help you streamline workflows, reduce costs, and build a program that’s ready for the future of compliance.</p>

<p>As we enter 2025, data privacy and identity protection will remain some of the hottest topics around. Watch out for the continued meteoric rise of digital identity verification and management, more data privacy laws, tighter regulations around artificial intelligence, and the continued emergence of quantum computing. Here’s our take on what lies ahead:</p>



 
 Digital identity verification and management will take centre stage<br><br>Impersonation and fraud, particularly in banking and finance, have become so prevalent and sophisticated that digital identity verification and management will fast become the go-to solution for protecting customers and building trust, replacing paper-based and other vulnerable systems. We agree with <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/blog/access-management/iam-predictions-for-2025#:~:text=Deepfake%20risks%20will%20drive%20IAM,lifestyle%20information%2C%20and%20social%20data.">industry predictions</a> that identity will be the “linchpin of business resilience” going forward, and that <a href="https://www.scworld.com/perspective/digital-identity-verification-will-have-a-breakout-year-in-2025">“digital identity verification will have a breakout year in 2025”</a>. There’s likely to be a rush to digital identity wallets and digital and biometric credential verification methods, particularly since regulations like eIDAS 2.0 in the EU are driving the transition to decentralized identity technologies. <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">Go Inside Version 3.0 of the Most Advanced Mobile Wallet SDK on the Market</a>.

 The US will get more state privacy laws, but no federal privacy law<br><br>In an unsurprising development, most pundits agree that the United States’ chances of finally achieving a comprehensive federal privacy law are slim to none in 2025. <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/what-the-us-election-results-may-mean-for-digital-policy">IAPP</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/what-a-new-trump-mandate-could-mean-for-american-data-privacy-rights">TechRadar</a> commentators believe securing bipartisan agreement on such a law is likely to remain elusive under the Republican-controlled Congress, which TechRadar suggests “could leave Americans relying on digital tools to claim back their online privacy for themselves.” Anonyome Labs’ <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a> apps are great examples of proactive consumer privacy tools.<br><br>As always, stepping into the breach from an absent federal privacy law will be state privacy laws, and we’ll see many more of those in 2025. Twenty-six of the 50 US states now have a state privacy law, expanding consumer rights and ratcheting up compliance obligations on business. In 2024, four more state laws came into effect:<br><br><a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/consumer-protection/file-consumer-complaint/consumer-privacy-rights/texas-data-privacy-and-security-act">Texas Data Privacy and Security Act&nbsp;(TDPSA)</a>, effective July 1, 2024<br><a href="https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2023/06/florida-digital-bill-of-rights-data-privacy#:~:text=As%20with%20other%20state%20privacy,in%20a%20portable%20and%20readily">Florida Digital Bill of Rights (FDBR)</a>, effective July 1, 2024&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.doj.state.or.us/media-home/news-media-releases/oregonians-gain-significant-new-consumer-privacy-protections/">Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA)</a>, effective on July 1, 2024<br><a href="https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/2023/billpdf/SB0384.pdf">Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA)</a>, effective October 1, 2024.<br><br>January 2025 saw four more state privacy laws come into effect—<a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GenerateHtmlDocument?legislationId=140388&amp;legislationTypeId=1&amp;docTypeId=2&amp;legislationName=HB154">Delaware</a>, <a href="https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/iowa-data-protection-act-what-businesses-need-to-know">Iowa</a>, <a href="https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/new-hampshire-enacts-comprehensive-data-privacy-law">New Hampshire</a>, and <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/insights/resources/blogs/talking-tech/en/articles/2024/02/the-new-jersey-data-privacy-law-an-overview.html">New Jersey</a>—and later in 2025, <a href="https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/blogs/ag-data-dive/tennessee-information-protection-act-what-businesses-need-to-know">Tennessee</a> and <a href="https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/maryland-enacts-comprehensive-data-privacy-law#:~:text=The%20Maryland%20Online%20Data%20Privacy%20Act%20prohibits%20Controllers%20from%3A,service%20requested%20by%20the%20consumer.">Maryland</a> will introduce theirs.<br><br> 



 Regulation around AI will tighten but privacy and security issues will remain<br><br>Generative AI will be the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2025/01/12/5-generative-ai-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2025/">thing to watch in 2025</a>, with artificial intelligence becoming integral to core application design and service delivery for its efficiency, UX and cost-saving benefits. But this emerging tech will also remain acutely challenging, particularly from a data privacy and security perspective.<br><br>Regulation around AI will tighten in 2025, but the <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">IAPP</a> puts a good question: “While there is a consensus AI should be regulated, and there are increasing efforts in this sense — such as the highly anticipated EU AI Act [and <a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2024/06/colorados-landmark-ai-act">Colorado’s AI Act</a>] — the fact is AI privacy risks remain uncharted waters, leaving both AI practitioners and privacy professionals with a feeling of unease. After all, since AI technologies are advancing faster than regulation, how should privacy pros approach AI privacy risks in a way that makes new products viable, while safeguarding data subjects’ rights?” It’s a question that may linger well beyond 2025.<br><br>The <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">IAPP</a> highlights these 12 risks from AI, which come from Carnegie Mellon University and Oxford University’s adaptation of earlier work by <a href="https://www.danielsolove.com/">Professor Daniel Solove</a>:<br><br>Surveillance:&nbsp;AI exacerbates surveillance risks by increasing the scale and ubiquity of personal data collection.<br>Identification:&nbsp;AI technologies enable automated identity linking across various data sources, increasing risks related to personal identity exposure.<br>Aggregation:&nbsp;AI combines various pieces of data about a person to make inferences, creating risks of privacy invasion.<br>Phrenology and physiognomy:&nbsp;AI infers personality or social attributes from physical characteristics, a new risk category not in Solove’s taxonomy.<br>Secondary use:&nbsp;AI exacerbates use of personal data for purposes other than originally intended through repurposing data.<br>Exclusion:&nbsp;AI makes failure to inform or give control to users over how their data is used worse through opaque data practices.<br>Insecurity:&nbsp;AI’s data requirements and storage practices risk of data leaks and improper access.<br>Exposure:&nbsp;AI can reveal sensitive information, such as through generative AI techniques.<br>Distortion:&nbsp;AI’s ability to generate realistic but fake content heightens the spread of false or misleading information.<br>Disclosure:&nbsp;AI can cause improper sharing of data when it infers additional sensitive information from raw data.<br>Increased accessibility:&nbsp;AI makes sensitive information more accessible to a wider audience than intended.<br>Intrusion:&nbsp;AI technologies invade personal space or solitude, often through surveillance measures.<br><br>Debate and developments around these 12 risks from AI (and potentially others) will be a hallmark of 2025.<br><br> 



 Quantum computing will make more headlines<br><br>We were interested to see <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/will-quantum-computers-break-the-internet-4-things-to-know/">quantum computing</a> moving onto the “trends to watch” lists for 2025. The race to quantum computing has been going on for a while now, and things are definitely heating up.<br><br>Many industries have <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Explore-future-potential-quantum-computing-uses">use cases</a>&nbsp;for quantum computing for simulations (e.g. simulating molecular structures in drug discovery or climate modelling) and optimization (e.g. optimizing shipping routes and flight paths, enhancing machine learning algorithms, or developing advanced materials).&nbsp;But as <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/will-quantum-computers-break-the-internet-4-things-to-know/">we’ve said before</a> the quantum age does present some real <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/will-quantum-computers-break-the-internet-4-things-to-know/">threats</a>, particularly the looming arrival of quantum computers that are sufficiently powerful and error-resistant to break conventional encryption algorithms (RSA, DSS, Diffie-Hellman, TLS/SSL, etc.) and expose the world’s vast stores of secured data.&nbsp;The race is on to <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/quantum-computers-what-is-q-day-and-whats-the-solution">Q-Day</a> and we’ll likely see more about that in 2025.&nbsp;<br><br>The US Government has issued a <a href="http://chrome-extension/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/media.defense.gov/2023/Aug/21/2003284212/-1/-1/0/CSI-QUANTUM-READINESS.PDF">quantum readiness guide</a> to developing and building capabilities to secure critical information and systems from being compromised by quantum computers.&nbsp;<br><br> 



 More people will worry about data privacy and act to protect their personal information<br><br>Consumers are growing increasingly worried about the safety of their personal information, particularly on social media and around AI. With <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/2024-was-the-biggest-year-for-data-breaches/">2024 recording the biggest and most destructive data breaches</a>, and <a>new stats </a><a>[NB1]</a>&nbsp;showing most people worldwide have already had their personal information stolen, it’s not surprising that people fear <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data surveillance </a>and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">scammers</a>. Cisco’s annual <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/consumer-privacy-survey.html#~about-the-study">privacy study</a> did, however, reveal that all this worry is making people more proactive about protecting their own data, which can only be a good thing, and tools like Anonyome Labs’ consumer apps <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a> make it easy. <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">Anonyome also offers businesses a suite of next generation digital identity and privacy tools.</a>

Whether you're preparing for an employee self-assessment, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/a-guide-for-salary-negotiation">salary negotiation</a> or conducting a self-appraisal of your own performance, looking inwards objectively feels almost impossible sometimes.</p><p>From formal performance evaluations where job performance needs assessment, to informal self-reflection about workflow and work ethic, seeing outside objectively can be challenging.</p><p>In fact, according to the Harvard Business Review, while 95% of people believe they have strong self-awareness, only 10-15% actually demonstrate true competencies in self-evaluation during behavioral studies. <a>1</a></p><p>So, how can actual self-awareness be increased to match what many people believe they have? </p> <p>I’m Yngvi Karlson, Co-Founder of <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a>.

These measure how well personal goals are being reached, often in the context of personal life, such as managing anxiety, learning a new hobby, or building a new habit.</p><p>Templates are available online, but given the personal nature of these evaluations, they don’t need to use standardized worksheets.</p> People are Professional and Personal <p>These two domains—professional and personal evaluation—aren't separate, but instead are inherently connected. According to McKinsey, executives who demonstrate high levels of self-awareness of their personal actions and goals are up to four times more likely to demonstrate strong leadership capabilities. <a>2</a></p><p>This connection exists because the core competencies built by proper self-evaluation, like problem-solving skills, a positive attitude, and teamwork, benefit both areas of life.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffb55fb9-6e76-4658-8f40-6f14a457c0d3_1600x1200.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Nick Morrison  Why Self-Evaluation is Important <p>Self-evaluations help people understand how well they’re doing the things they want to be doing, and how they can improve. This makes it much easier for people to adjust their behavior to reach their goals, whether those goals are professional or personal.</p><p>As such, self-evaluations build the following skills:</p>  <p>Self-Awareness: Understanding personal strengths, weaknesses, and patterns is perhaps the biggest benefit of self-evaluation.</p>  <p>Increased Accountability: Regular evaluation helps show personal control over growth, encouraging people to harness it.</p>  <p>Decision-Making: Regular self-reflection increases self-awareness, which makes appropriate choices about career paths and personal development easier to identify.</p>  <p>Better Goal Setting: Clear self-assessment leads to more realistic and achievable objectives based on skill, money, and time levels.</p>  <p>Stronger Relationships: Greater self-awareness often leads to better communication and collaboration with colleagues, friends, and family alike.</p>  <p>Stress Reduction: Understanding personal patterns and triggers, and having plans in place to support them, helps manage day-to-day pressures more effectively.</p>   The Impact on Professional Growth <p>In professional settings, strong self-evaluation skills can dramatically impact career trajectory. According to Gallup's 2023 State of the Global Workplace report, employees who regularly participate in self-evaluation and feedback processes are 3.6 times more likely to be engaged at work and 2.5 times more likely to report being satisfied with their career progression. <a>3</a></p><p>This advantage comes from multiple factors. Self-aware professionals better understand their strengths and areas of improvement, leading to more targeted skill development. They're also more receptive to constructive feedback during one-on-one meetings, as they've developed the ability to process criticism constructively. Additionally, their enhanced self-awareness often translates to better project management and more effective workplace relationships.</p><p>The impact extends to workflow optimization as well. When employees regularly evaluate their processes and competencies, they can better identify inefficiencies and propose improvements.</p><p>This proactive approach not only enhances individual performance, but as employee engagement and retention are crucial metrics for organizational success today, employee self-awareness benefits companies by maintaining productive workflows and reducing turnover through better job satisfaction.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb66abc5-9412-45ca-8b0d-b25e34ae3cc5_1600x1066.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Christian Wiediger  Barriers to Self-Evaluation <p>Because self-evaluation is done by oneself, it faces a unique set of challenges.</p><p>Discrepancies between perception and reality can lead to confirmation bias, causing people to seek information that supports their existing beliefs about their own work, and ignore information that proves them wrong.</p><p>Similarly, emotional attachment to outcomes can cloud judgment of overall performance, as people seek to protect who they love and punish who they don’t.</p><p>And perhaps most challenging, people often lack the structured approach needed to make self-assessment a consistent, productive practice.</p> The Five Core Areas of Self-Evaluation <p>Before diving into actionable guides, it's important to understand the five key areas that a comprehensive, high-performance self-evaluation should cover:</p><p>1. Skills and Knowledge: Assess both technical capabilities and soft skills, identifying areas of expertise and knowledge gaps. For example, a marketing manager might evaluate their proficiency in digital analytics tools, alongside their team leadership abilities and understanding of their actions.</p><p>2. Performance and Achievements: Review specific accomplishments against set goals, including both quantitative metrics (like sales numbers or amount of social outings) and qualitative outcomes (such as improved team dynamics or stronger relationships).</p><p>3. Habits and Behaviors: Examine daily practices, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management skills</a>, collaboration styles, and both professional and personal conduct. This might include analyzing how a deadline is met, and what <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-continuous-learning-in-your-career">continuous learning</a> strategy is being used, if any.</p><p>4. Personal Growth and Development: Evaluate progress in career development goals, new skill acquisition, and both professional and personal relationships. Consider both formal learning opportunities and <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/the-importance-of-honesty-in-the-workplace">mentoring experiences</a>, whether as a mentor or mentee. This includes assessing how effectively you've engaged with mentoring relationships and contributed to others' personal and professional development while advancing your own.</p><p>5. Values and Satisfaction: Assess alignment between personal values, personal actions, and current role; overall job satisfaction; and work-life balance. This includes examining whether a current position and trajectory <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-a-career-coaching">matches long-term career goals</a>, or whether recent actions build the relationships desired with others.</p> Other Essential Components of Effective Self-Evaluation <p>There are a few more important points to make:</p>  <p>Objectivity is crucial but challenging. The key is focusing on observable behaviors and measurable outcomes rather than interpretations. Instead of thinking "I'm bad at presentations," consider the specific aspects that prompt that thought, like "My last three presentations went over time by an average of 10 minutes." This will make it easier to tackle.</p>  <p>Evidence-based assessment requires collecting concrete data. This might mean tracking project completion times at work, or monitoring emotional responses to specific situations in personal life.</p>  <p>Self-evaluations are most useful when accompanied by <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">effective goal-setting </a>and dedication to creating a plan to reach those goals. The evaluations help people understand where they are in that plan, and what they need to adjust to advance further.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67cb31a2-fb93-428b-87ae-a5af3d558232_1600x1202.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Imagine Buddy  How to Write Effective Self-Evaluations <p>Now, as promised. Writing a self-evaluation for any purpose requires a structured approach, similar to the one below:</p>  <p>Decide What’s Being Evaluated: Whether it's professional performance, or a personal goal to learn crochet, ensure what’s being examined is clear.<br></p>  <p>Start with Data: Gather concrete examples and metrics of personal and/or professional performance. Include project outcomes, feedback received, conversations, and situations that feel indicative of performance.<br></p>  <p>Use the STAR Method: When describing achievements, use the Situation, Task, Action, Result format to make it easier to understand. For example:</p>  <p>"When our team faced a 20% decline in social media engagement (Situation), I was tasked with improving our content strategy (Task). I implemented a new content calendar and engagement tracking system (Action), resulting in a 45% increase in engagement over three months (Result)."<br></p>    <p>Be Specific and Honest: Instead of evaluating communication skills as ‘good’, write down the reasoning behind that—e.g. '“led 12 client presentations, was well-received by 9, and had three complain about the talking speed and lack of slide detail.”<br></p>  <p>Consider Meanings: Self-evaluations exist to promote thought. Consider why things went the way they did, and how the good things can be maintained and improved, as well as how the bad things can be avoided.</p>   Building a Self-Evaluation Routine <p>Second only to a good evaluation structure is a good evaluation routine. Without regular revisiting and re-application, self-evaluations are not being used to their full potential.</p><p>Start by choosing specific times for evaluation—perhaps Sunday evenings for weekly reviews and the last day of each month for broader assessments. Based on the goal progress being evaluated, create templates or frameworks to guide these sessions,</p><p>Regular one-on-one meetings with mentors or supervisors should be considered if possible, too.

<p>If you're reading this article you're more than likely familiar with decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). And you may even be familiar with DEX aggregators who essentially search DeFi platforms like Uniswap for the optimal price on your trade and finalize the trade without navigating to the platforms themselves. DEX Ags also enable what's known as a non-custodial trading experience whereas trades are executed directly from the users wallet rather than being required to deposit the funds to the aggregators wallet. </p><p>In addition to optimal pricing and shear convenience, DEX Ags provide price impact protection by dividing trades of illiquid pairs across multiple exchanges thereby reducing price impact and affording better prices. Intent based aggregators are the most advanced form of DEX Ags and provide protection from a type of bot induced price exploitation called maximum extractable value (MEV) that has cost unaware traders over 1 billion $USD. </p><p>Intent Based Ags not only aggregate on-chain liquidity across exchanges and other aggregators, they also delegate execution to third parties referred to as "solvers". Solvers provide additional sources of liquidity by holding private inventory and matching trades peer-to-peer. This method avoids protocol fees and provides some of the best trades in DeFi.  </p><p>CoW Swap is an Intent Based Meta DEX aggregator that utilizes solvers and additional features including MEV protection. Any time you make a DeFi trade whether its in the form of trading token pairs or NFTs or lending tokens to a liquidity pool, opportunistic users, typically known as "searchers", may manipulate your trades resulting in poor prices, failed execution, and missed opportunities.  CoW Swap eliminates this issue as it's engineered and built with MEV protection. CoW Swap also provides users with an array of order types to choose from including:</p>  Market orders  Limit orders   TWAP orders - allow trades to be distributed over time   Programmatic orders - customizable, conditional orders that fire when certain on-chain conditions are met including asset prices, wallet balances, elapsed time and more.  CoW Hooks - allows users to pair any Ethereum action or set of actions with an order on the CoW Protocol while leveraging solvers to execute the actions together in sequence.   <p>CoW Swap is not only the largest Intent Based Aggregators, it's also one of largest DEX Ag's in the world and in November 2024 settled $6.2 billion USD of trades - more than twice as much volume as all intent based aggregators combined. Yet with a market cap of $236 million USD, CoW Swap (ticker COW) remains relatively unknown to the market and undervalued. Even with its recent move from around $0.25 to its current price of $0.78, there is plenty of upside potential from here especially considering the nearly $8 billion USD market cap touted by Uniswap.

<p>Imagine needing to notarize an important document, but the nearest notary is miles away. The alternative? Sending a photo of your ID via email or uploading a selfie to a platform. While convenient, these methods are rife with vulnerabilities—photos can be stolen, identities forged, and trust compromised. Enter liveness detection, a technology that ensures the person verifying their identity is physically present and not a spoof created with static images or videos.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at how liveness detection transforms workflows like notarizing identity documents and why businesses should move beyond outdated methods like selfie uploads or emailed IDs.</p>



 



 The Traditional Workflow: Notary Visits and Emailed IDs 



<p>In a manual identity verification process, a customer gathers their identity documents and heads to a notary. The notary inspects the ID, validates it against the customer’s appearance, and notarizes the document.</p>



<p>Alternatively, some platforms ask customers to email a photo of their ID and a selfie for verification. While these steps eliminate travel, they introduce new risks:</p>



 
 Photo Spoofing: Fraudsters can easily find or fabricate a customer’s image from online searches. 



 Static Verification Flaws: Static selfies and emailed images lack the depth to confirm whether the person is present. 



 Trust Erosion: Customers are increasingly wary of sharing sensitive documents via unsecured emails. 
 



<p>These workflows can be time-consuming, risky, and frustrating for customers and businesses alike.</p>



 



 The Liveness Detection Revolution 



<p>Liveness detection changes the game by verifying that an individual is physically present during the identity verification process. Unlike static photos or emails, this technology uses advanced algorithms to detect subtle, dynamic cues—like blinking, head movement, or depth perception—to confirm the presence of a real person.</p>



<p>Here’s how this plays out in a modern, digital verification process:</p>



 Step 1: Customer Initiates Verification 



<p>Using a secure KYC or KYB portal, the customer is prompted to upload a government-issued ID and participate in a quick liveness detection session.</p>



 Step 2: Liveness Detection in Action 



<p>The system guides the customer through simple actions, such as turning their head or blinking, while simultaneously scanning their biometric features. These real-time movements make it nearly impossible for fraudsters to use photos, videos, or masks to spoof the system.</p>



 Step 3: Automated Cross-Checks 



<p>Advanced AI validates the ID’s authenticity, matches it to the live biometric data, and cross-references the information against global sanctions lists or other risk databases.</p>



 Step 4: Instant Results 



<p>Within seconds, the verification is complete, and the business receives a secure, detailed report confirming the customer’s identity.</p>



 



 Why Selfie Uploads and Emailed IDs Are Risky 



<p>While selfie uploads and emailed IDs are still common, they’re increasingly insufficient in today’s threat landscape:</p>



 
 Easy to Spoof: With a simple Google search or basic editing tools, fraudsters can create convincing forgeries. 



 Lack of Depth Analysis: Static photos can’t confirm whether a person is physically present. 



 Data Security Concerns: Sensitive documents sent via email are prone to breaches and unauthorized access. 
 



<p>For businesses focused on security, compliance, and trust, relying on these outdated methods is no longer viable.</p>



 



 The Role of KYC and KYB Portals 



<p>With integrated KYC and KYB portals, businesses can deliver secure, seamless identity verification at scale. Here’s how these solutions enhance the liveness detection process:</p>



 
 Scalability: Both individual customers and businesses can verify identities in real-time without the need for physical presence. 



 Privacy-First Architecture: Biometric data is processed securely, adhering to regulations like GDPR. 



 Ease of Use: Customers enjoy a frictionless experience, completing verification from their smartphone or computer in minutes. 



 Compliance Made Simple: Built-in checks for AML regulations and global sanctions ensure adherence to the highest standards. 
 



<p>Whether verifying a customer for a financial transaction or conducting due diligence on a new business partner, these portals provide an all-in-one solution for secure identity verification.</p>



 



 Building Trust Through Better Verification 



<p>Liveness detection isn’t just about meeting regulatory requirements—it’s about building trust in every interaction. When customers know that their identities are verified securely, they’re more likely to engage confidently with your business.</p>



<p>For businesses, adopting advanced liveness detection technologies through KYC and KYB portals reduces fraud, streamlines workflows, and protects sensitive data. It’s a win-win for compliance and customer satisfaction.</p>



 



 The Future of Secure Verification 



<p>As fraudsters become more sophisticated, businesses must stay one step ahead. Liveness detection, paired with robust KYC and KYB solutions, offers a secure, scalable way to verify identities while delivering a seamless user experience.</p>



<p>Gone are the days of emailing IDs or relying on static selfies. The future of identity verification is dynamic, secure, and designed to build trust at every step. Whether notarizing an identity document or verifying a business partner, liveness detection ensures that the person on the other side of the screen is exactly who they claim to be.</p>

				  One of the key benefits of Verifiable Credentials is the time savings from reduction in repetitive, manual data entry. Here we will examine just how much time can be saved by using decentralized identity to automatically fill in information for us.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Tim Spring</p>
<p>The time cost of forms</p>
<p>How many hours a year do you spend filling out forms? While it might seem like an annoyance that comes up every now and then, the <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/">US Chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center</a> released a report in 2022 that found that the government has <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Government-Digitization-Transforming-Government-to-Better-Serve-Americans.pdf">9,881 unique forms</a>, which took an estimated 10.3 billion hours to complete.</p>
<p>And these numbers are only increasing, if you use the tool provided by the <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAReport?operation=11">Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs</a> and apply it to 2024 numbers, you can see that we are up to almost 12.3 billion hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are five stand out departments with the most forms and impact. 2022 numbers provided by the <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/">US Chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center</a> report:</p>
<p>Department of the Treasury: 1,838 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services 1,242 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Agriculture 553 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Commerce 437 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Federal Communications Commission 436 forms</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why there is so much paperwork to see a doctor? Or why you need to fill it in every time? It could have something to do with the 1,242 federal forms that the hospital or clinic will need to fill out to comply with the department of Health and Human services, not to mention updating your own charts and patient data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accuracy and user experience improvement</p>
<p>What we could all benefit from is a way to create authenticated data once and reuse it often —&nbsp; instantly, conveniently, with the touch of a button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is where Verifiable Credentials come to the rescue, the thing that will make you say “why haven’t we been doing this before?” Verifiable credentials can store any authenticated data (and especially personal data) in a tamper-proof way and allow the user to share it without the need for the verifier to check in with the source. Think of your web browser’s autofill function that remembers your name, email address, phone number, etc, but for the real world. These credentials can store any information that could be on that doctor’s form, such as height, eye color, name, address, or medical history, and share it accurately, instantly. Which is particularly handy because if you need a doctor, you’re probably not in the mood to do paperwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The usefulness grows exponentially when you take a look at what this technology can do for organizations. An <a href="https://www.aha.org/">American Hospital Association</a> survey found that there are 6,120 hospitals in the United States, and between them had admitted <a href="https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals">33,679,935 patients</a> in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud reduction</p>
<p>Aside from the time saved from not having to manually enter all this patient data, businesses can benefit in the form of eliminating human error and reducing fraud. If you have almost 33.7 million forms to fill out annually, there are going to be some errors or fraudulent information, which often take time and money to correct. By sharing pre-authenticated data digitally (which is what is inside a Verifiable Credential) you can instantly trust the data and use it however you need, such as verifying a patient’s identity and medical history to begin treatment. This technology also enables biometric patient check-in, which reduces fraud (getting treated under someone else’s name) or giving the incorrect medications due to not reliably identifying the patient as they leave the waiting room for treatment.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials have already seen traction in several industries for their ability to fast-track processes. An excellent example of this is in airports and travel, where their authenticated data can be used for pre-authorization for each traveler and leads to significantly faster international border and border crossing. To learn more about this use case you can read a <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/">recent article from Indicio.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one enjoys paperwork, it is a necessary part of life, but it doesn’t need to be such a big part.</p>

<p>Bitcoin traded below $90,000 for the first time in more than 3 weeks and below it's 50-day monthly EMA around $93,000. Opportunistic bulls more than likely added to their holdings in this range while short term bears and momentum traders cover their shorts to lock in profits. For those looking for an entry point, this may be a solid opportunity to wade into the market. </p><p>If you take a look at the daily Coinbase chart for January 13th 2025, you'll see a long wick rising from the lows of the day below 90,000 to nearly turn positive for the day. Similar action occurred during the two days prior possibly indicating the formation of a triple bottom. </p><p>The 6-hour chart below shows the rise from the lows on heavy volume with nearly twice the amount trading hands compared to the prior 6 hour window. </p><p>Over the next 24 to 48 hours, the price should continue to rise to at least test $95-$96K and may rapidly accelerate back over $100K and on to new all-time highs.

<p>La información verificable está transformando rápidamente el panorama de la tecnología Web3.  En <a href="https://extrimian.io/es/contactenos/" title="Extrimian">Extrimian</a> creemos que 2025 será un año clave para potenciar ecosistemas digitales seguros, eficientes e interoperables. Aquí te compartimos 5 tendencias clave para este año:</p>



 1. Ecosistemas integrados con identidades verificables 



<p>Imagina a un estudiante universitario que utiliza su credencial digital emitida por su institución para acceder a una cuenta fintech, contratar un seguro médico, alquilar una vivienda de confianza, resolver situaciones académicas y disfrutar de beneficios exclusivos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Esta interoperabilidad ya es una realidad gracias a soluciones basadas en SSI, como IDConnect de Extrimian, que resuelven problemas de identidad y verificación al conectar múltiples verticales en un solo ecosistema. Durante este año, veremos más adopción, más atracción y mayor sinergia entre actores e industrias.</p>







 2. IA como motor para la eficiencia 



<p>En 2025 los frameworks con inteligencia artificial revolucionarán la gestión de la identidad digital. Según un reporte de <a href="https://www.laecuaciondigital.com/tecnologias/inteligencia-artificial/ibm-potencia-watsonx-para-impulsar-la-inteligencia-artificial-empresarial/">IBM</a>, los procesos de gestión de datos impulsados por IA incrementarán su eficiencia en un 40%.&nbsp;</p>







<p>En este contexto, tecnologías como IDConnect integrarán IA para automatizar procesos clave, como la creación y verificación de credenciales, la detección de errores y la asistencia de un copiloto. Esto no solo mejorará la experiencia del usuario, sino que también incrementará la seguridad, la productividad y la eficiencia en la gestión operativa.</p>



 3. Crecimiento exponencial tras casos de éxito 



<p>El éxito de QuarkID y su implementación en miBA, que posicionó a Buenos Aires como la primera ciudad del mundo en usar credenciales verificables para gestión pública, ha marcado un antes y un después. Este modelo no solo ha inspirado a más gobiernos y empresas a adoptar SSI, sino que también abre las puertas a una expansión global.&nbsp;</p>



<p>El reporte de Cybersecurity Ventures estima que, para 2025, los costos del cibercrimen alcanzarán los $10.5 billones anuales, destacando la importancia de sistemas descentralizados como QuarkID para fortalecer la seguridad de los datos personales.</p>







 4. Idoneidad y conocimiento como ventaja competitiva 



<p><br>Durante este año, la diferencia clave en SSI estará en el conocimiento profundo y la experiencia. Las empresas con trayectoria en esta tecnología, que lideran su implementación y están a la vanguardia, ofrecerán soluciones más robustas, eficientes e integradas. La idoneidad será un valor diferencial frente a quienes recién comienzan, certificando la capacidad de integrar SSI de manera efectiva y maximizar su impacto en ecosistemas digitales interoperables.</p>







<p></p>



 5. SSI: Soluciones prácticas para Latinoamérica 



<p>En una región marcada por burocracia, costos elevados y fraude, SSI maximiza el ROI al simplificar procesos críticos como la validación de empleo, acceso seguro a plataformas y verificación de edad. Al reutilizar datos verificables, reduce costos, agiliza trámites y promueve la inclusión digital, fortaleciendo un ecosistema confiable y accesible para todos.</p>

<p>Non-Human Identities (NHIs) are finally making friends and influencing people—or at least they seem to be, given how much people are talking about them! This is great. People need to have a better sense of this brave new world of workloads, bots, and services. But this also means people need to have a better sense of what NHIs are not.</p>



<p>Whether you’re navigating workloads, APIs, or automated systems, the buzz around NHIs reflects their growing significance in everything from cloud computing to academic research. But as with any hot topic, there’s some confusion and waaaaaay too much marketing hype. I’ve written about NHIs <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/04/05/the-evolving-landscape-of-non-human-identity/">before</a>; today’s focus is on some of the main areas NHIs are different from human identities. The distinctions matter. </p>



 What NHIs Are Not 



<p>NHIs aren’t just API keys or OAuth tokens. Treating them as such would be like calling a password or a passkey a person’s digital identity—it oversimplifies their function and importance. Tokens, keys, and even credentials like X.509 certificates might help manage access, but they’re tools in the more extensive toolkit of workload identity management. (<a href="https://www.natoma.id/">Natoma</a> has published an interesting <a href="https://www.natoma.id/library/machine-to-machine-identity-maturity">white paper</a> on machine-to-machine authentication if you’re interested in more detail.)</p>



<p>NHIs represent software entities like batch processes, machine learning training models, or microservices operating independently of human identities. They operate at different speeds and have different selective disclosure requirements (yes, NHI <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-prorock-spice-use-cases/">use cases</a> may include the need for selective disclosure). Proving who they are to access other systems or resources goes beyond simple authentication. Unlike human authentication, which often revolves around confirming a single user’s identity via passwords, passkeys, or biometrics, NHIs must establish trust and authorization in highly dynamic, machine-driven environments.</p>



 Comparing NHIs and Human Identities 



<p>Part of what makes understanding that NHIs are different is that, if you tilt your head just right, their requirements sound very familiar. They need to demonstrate their identity and the purpose and scope of their request. They benefit from cryptographic proofs, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or X.509 certificates, to securely bind their identity to a specific action. And, believe it or not, they have a lifecycle that must be managed. And let’s not forget they may need to cross trust boundaries in a federated workflow.</p>



<p>I’ll go into more detail next, but here’s the summary for those who want to get straight to the good stuff.</p>



LayerHuman IdentitiesNon-Human Identities (NHIs)Contextual ValidationRole-based access; occasional risk checksTask-specific; continuous granular checksCryptographic AssurancePasswords, passkeys, MFAJWTs, OAuth tokens, mTLS, certificatesDynamic/Ephemeral IdentitiesPersistent, lifecycle-drivenTransient, task-drivenCross-Boundary TrustSSO, federation (SAML, OIDC)Federated workload identities, SPIFFE



 Contextual Validation 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Humans typically authenticate using static credentials like passwords, passkeys, or biometric scans. 



 Access is often role-based, with permissions tied to organizational hierarchies or specific job functions (e.g., an employee accessing their email). 



 Context, like geolocation or time of access, may be used for risk-based decisions (e.g., blocking a login attempt from an unusual location). 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs rely on detailed, task-specific validation. For example, a microservice might only <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/">access</a> a database during specific operational windows and for specific query types. 



 Permissions are highly granular and tied to the NHI’s role in a larger process, such as allowing read-only access to one API endpoint while granting full control over another. 



 Unlike humans, NHIs may operate across various environments, requiring continuous validation at scale. 
 



 Cryptographic Assurance 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Credentials often include usernames, passwords, or passkeys, validated via a central authentication server. 



 Additional layers like multi-factor authentication (MFA) involve OTPs or hardware tokens, but the process remains human-centric. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs use cryptographic credentials, such as JWTs, OAuth tokens, or X.509 certificates, to prove their identity and integrity. 



 These credentials are <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-arch/">typically</a> short-lived and dynamically issued, ensuring they can’t be reused if intercepted. 



 Cryptographic proofs (e.g., mutual TLS) are used to establish secure, trust-bound connections between services. Unlike humans, NHIs don’t rely on password-based authentication, making credential management more complex and secure when implemented correctly. 
 



 Dynamic and Ephemeral Identities 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Human identities are persistent and change only during significant lifecycle events, such as onboarding, promotions, or terminations. 



 Joiner/mover/leaver workflows handle these transitions in directories like Active Directory or IAM systems. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs are transient and may exist for just seconds or minutes, such as a containerized workload in Kubernetes that spins up to handle a specific task. 



 Unlike human-centric workflows, they require dynamic provisioning and de-provisioning of identities without manual intervention. (It would be nice if human-centric flows did this, too, but that’s not common. Yet.) 



 The absence of a natural lifecycle like “hiring” or “firing” makes traditional directory models ineffective for NHIs. 
 



 Cross-Boundary Trust 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Trust boundaries for humans are typically managed within a single organization or via federated identity systems like SAML or OpenID Connect. 



 Federated access is often used to enable single sign-on (SSO) across organizational or application boundaries. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs frequently operate in multi-cloud or hybrid environments, where they must authenticate across disparate trust domains. 



 Identity federation for NHIs requires advanced mechanisms, such as SPIFFE or OAuth token exchanges, to securely share identity and permissions between services in different ecosystems. 



 Unlike humans, NHIs may not have a single source of truth (like an HR system), necessitating more robust and decentralized trust models. 
 



 A Better Way to Think About NHIs 



<p>If you’re still thinking that NHIs belong in your human identity systems, I’m just not sure what to tell you. I would say we can agree to disagree, but getting this wrong has implications for how everyone interacts online, so I will continue to make a stand on this hill. NHIs require a different approach to identity management, including:</p>



 
 Workload Identity Federation: So the NHIs can seamlessly authenticate across cloud providers. 



 Dynamic Secrets and Token-Based Authentication: To enhance security and minimize exposure risks. 



 Standards Efforts Like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/wimse/about/">WIMSE</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spice/about/">SPICE</a>: Because standards to ensure consistent, secure service interactions are critical. 
 



 Final Thoughts 



<p>Embracing NHIs means rethinking your identity systems and recognizing that traditional identity paradigms need to evolve. I know it’s hard work and requires even more resources for your IAM programs, but NHIs are not magic. They cannot bring security and efficiency to your organization without investment. There are vendors out there (I am not one of them) who can guide you through designing or redesigning your systems to account for NHIs. You’ve got this.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>When Mark, a cofounder of a fast-growing fintech startup in the UK, realized his company needed to adhere to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) standards for KYB, KYC, and AML, he was overwhelmed. As his business scaled rapidly, the complexities of compliance threatened to slow down operations and erode investor confidence. Here’s how Mark built an effective AML program that not only met regulatory requirements but also became a cornerstone of his company’s success—all with the help of iComply’s innovative platform.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 1: Understand the Regulatory Requirements</p>



<p>Mark started by diving into the regulatory frameworks his company needed to follow. In the UK, the FCA’s stringent requirements on KYB and KYC processes set the standard. Mark also reviewed global guidelines from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the EU’s AML Directives to ensure his company’s policies aligned with international best practices.</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Understanding Regulations:</p>



 
 Identify the specific regulations relevant to your industry and jurisdiction. 



 Consult official resources from regulatory bodies like the FCA or FATF. 



 Seek expert guidance or use tools that summarize complex requirements. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 2: Conduct a Risk Assessment</p>



<p>Next, Mark conducted a detailed risk assessment, analyzing his fintech’s customer base, transaction types, and geographic exposure. With iComply’s support, he categorized his customers by risk levels and identified high-risk activities requiring Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Risk Assessment:</p>



 
 Map out your customer demographics and transaction patterns. 



 Identify high-risk geographies and customer profiles. 



 Document risks and prioritize them for action. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 3: Develop and Document Policies and Procedures</p>



<p>Mark knew that robust policies and procedures would be the backbone of his AML program. iComply’s policy and procedure documentation tools helped him create clear guidelines for:</p>



 
 Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Verifying identities and monitoring activities. 



 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Extra checks for high-risk scenarios. 



 Reporting Mechanisms: Filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) efficiently. 
 



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Policies and Procedures:</p>



 
 Use customizable templates to address specific business needs. 



 Ensure policies cover all required areas, from CDD to reporting.

<p>Mark’s Checklist for Monitoring and Auditing:</p>



 
 Conduct regular internal reviews of compliance practices. 



 Maintain a clear audit trail with organized records. 



 Engage third-party experts for independent assessments. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 8: Foster a Culture of Compliance</p>



<p>Mark and his cofounders led by example, embedding compliance into the company’s values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Culture:</p>



 
 Communicate the importance of compliance at all levels. 



 Recognize and reward compliance efforts. 



 Encourage employees to report concerns without fear of retaliation. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 9: Report and Respond to Incidents</p>



<p>When suspicious activity arose, Mark’s team acted quickly. This ensured prompt submission of SARs and effective incident resolution.</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Incident Response:</p>



 
 Establish clear procedures for identifying and reporting issues. 



 Train staff on how to handle incidents. 



 Review incidents to strengthen future prevention efforts 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 10: Stay Current with Regulatory Changes</p>



<p>With iComply’s regulatory updates to their platform, Mark stayed ahead of new requirements. This proactive approach allowed his company to adapt seamlessly to evolving standards without the need for a big technical lift.</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Staying Current:</p>



 
 Subscribe to updates from relevant regulatory bodies. 



 Participate in industry forums and workshops. 



 Regularly review and update AML policies 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Building Trust Through Compliance</p>



<p>Thanks to iComply, Mark transformed a daunting compliance challenge into a streamlined, cost-effective process. His fintech now operates with confidence, meeting FCA standards and building trust with customers, investors, and regulators. By following Mark’s example, you too can create an AML program that safeguards your organization and supports sustainable growth.</p>

<p>TransUnion has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining ownership of Monevo, a UK-based credit prequalification and distribution platform, after initially acquiring a 30% stake in 2021. The transaction, expected to close by Q2 2025 pending regulatory approvals, will be funded with existing cash-on-hand and is not projected to materially impact TransUnion’s 2025 financial performance. The acquisition aims to enhance both companies’ value propositions by offering optimised credit solutions at scale and expanding their direct-to-consumer strategy in the U.S. and UK. Monevo’s platform connects over 150 global lenders and publishers, allowing consumers to compare tailored credit offers, improving approval visibility and minimizing credit score impact from unnecessary searches. <a href="https://thepaypers.com/payments-general/transunion-to-acquire-monevo--1271657?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8o9xDzmjL8L_NUbGSG71QyQev3XRMx1g_LL7GnyfyxMsb77nNaxm5ZCsixf2hC2RZlu_Ll#">(Source)</a></p>

<p>EU General Court Fines European Commission for GDPR Breach in Landmark Ruling</p>



<p>The EU General Court has fined the European Commission €400 ($412) for violating its own data protection laws, marking a precedent-setting decision. The Commission unlawfully transferred a German citizen’s personal data, including their IP address, to Meta Platforms in the U.S. without proper safeguards. The breach occurred when the citizen used the “Sign in with Facebook” feature on the EU login webpage to register for a conference. This ruling underscores the EU’s commitment to enforcing GDPR compliance, which has previously resulted in fines for major companies like Meta and LinkedIn. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/first-eu-court-fines-eu-breaching-own-data-protection-law-2025-01-08/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8o9xDzmjL8L_NUbGSG71QyQev3XRMx1g_LL7GnyfyxMsb77nNaxm5ZCsixf2hC2RZlu_Ll">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>U.S. Defense Department Expands Chinese Military Companies List to Include Biometrics and Tech Giants</p>



<p>The U.S. Department of Defense has updated its Section 1260H list of Chinese military companies, adding firms like Cloudwalk, Dahua, Hikvision, Huawei, Tencent, Yitu, and SenseTime for their dual-use technologies supporting China’s military. While the listing has no immediate legal impact, it raises the risk of sanctions and has caused market disruptions, including stock declines. Some firms, such as Dahua and Hikvision, face allegations of involvement in Xinjiang human rights abuses, while others, like Tencent and SenseTime, deny military ties. Megvii was removed from the list, which China criticized as exaggerating the “China threat” for national security purposes. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/facial-recognition-digital-id-firms-land-on-dods-list-of-chinese-military-companies?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8o9xDzmjL8L_NUbGSG71QyQev3XRMx1g_LL7GnyfyxMsb77nNaxm5ZCsixf2hC2RZlu_Ll">(Source)</a></p>

 DeFi vs. TradFi: A Tale of Two Workforces (and a Whole Lot More) 
<p>As an avid blockchain user and developer, one of the more common questions I reecive from non-technical family and friends is "where and how does blockchain technology make money?". The answer to this very valid question could be explained using complex blockchain vernacular or boiled down to a few familiar business metrics and statistics. In this article we'll look at the impact legacy and blockchain technologies have on employment in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Traditional Finance (TradFi) industries. The numbers may surprise some and be a cause for concern for others, especially for those in the TradFi industry.</p>
<p>DeFi has emerged as a disruptive force in the financial world, challenging the established norms of traditional finance (TradFi). While many discussions focus on the technological underpinnings and financial mechanisms, a key differentiator often overlooked is the stark contrast in organizational structure and the number of employees required to operate. This difference has profound implications for efficiency, accessibility, and the overall nature of financial services.</p>
<p>Let's explore this contrast by comparing a DeFi giant like Uniswap with a traditional centralized exchange operating within the US banking system.</p>
<p>Uniswap: The Lean, Mean, DeFi Machine</p>
<p>Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It operates using automated market makers (AMMs), which rely on smart contracts to facilitate trading. These smart contracts automatically execute trades based on pre-defined algorithms and liquidity pools provided by users.</p>
 
 Minimal Human Intervention: The core functionality of Uniswap requires virtually no human intervention for day-to-day operations. There's no need for order books managed by human traders, no settlement processes requiring back-office staff, and no need for extensive customer support teams to handle trade execution issues. 
 Small Core Team: Uniswap Labs, the company initially behind Uniswap's development, focuses primarily on protocol development and upgrades. The core team is relatively small compared to traditional financial institutions. The protocol itself operates autonomously once deployed. Uniswap employs approximately 140-190 people. 
 Community Governance: Governance of the Uniswap protocol is largely decentralized, with UNI token holders having voting rights on proposals for protocol changes. This further reduces the need for a large internal management structure while extending the arm of decentralized opportunity across the globe. 
 
<p>Traditional Exchanges: The Workforce Heavyweights</p>
<p>In contrast, traditional centralized exchanges and other financial institutions within the US banking system require significantly larger workforces. Consider a typical stock exchange or a large bank:</p>
 
 Extensive Operations Staff: These institutions require numerous employees for various functions, including:
 
 Trading Desk: Traders execute orders, manage risk, and ensure market stability. 
 Back Office: Settlement, clearing, and reconciliation processes require substantial human oversight. 
 Compliance and Legal: Strict regulatory requirements necessitate large compliance and legal teams. 
 Customer Service: Handling customer inquiries, resolving issues, and providing support requires a large customer service department. 
 IT and Security: Maintaining complex IT infrastructure and ensuring security requires dedicated teams. 
 
 
 Hierarchical Structure: Traditional financial institutions typically have complex hierarchical structures with multiple layers of management, further increasing the number of employees. The average TradFi company listed on the NASDAQ employs 5000+ People. 
 
<p>The Implications of Workforce Size</p>
<p>The difference in workforce size between DeFi and TradFi has several important implications:</p>
 
 Efficiency: DeFi protocols like Uniswap can operate with significantly lower overhead costs due to their minimal staffing needs. This can translate to lower fees for users. 
 Accessibility: Decentralization and automation can make financial services more accessible to a wider audience, as there's less reliance on physical branches and human interaction. 
 Transparency: Smart contracts are publicly auditable, offering greater transparency compared to the often opaque operations of traditional financial institutions. 
 Security Considerations: While DeFi offers transparency, it also introduces new security challenges related to smart contract vulnerabilities and exploits. The smaller teams may have limited resources to address these issues compared to the larger security teams of TradFi. 
 Regulatory Scrutiny: DeFi's decentralized nature makes it challenging for regulators to oversee. This lack of regulatory clarity created a period of uncertainty and slowed wider adoption until the SEC, CFTC and Central Banks worldwide began to relax their stance a few months prior to approving BitCoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on January 10, 2024.  With 2024 in the rearview along with Bitcoin $100K, regulatory headwinds have clearly shifted to tailwinds while the largest investment banks are slated to invest trillions of $USD in blockchain technology and begin tokenizing real world assets (RWA) in earnest. 
 Estimating the Value: Reports suggest that blockchain deployments could enable banks to save billions on operational costs. For example, one study estimated potential savings of up to $27 billion annually on cross-border settlement transactions by 2030.
 
 Faster Transactions: Blockchain transactions can settle much faster than traditional systems, especially for cross-border payments that can take days to process. 
 24/7 Availability: DeFi markets operate continuously, unlike traditional markets with limited trading hours. This increases capital utilization and allows for greater flexibility. 
 
 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The contrast in workforce size between DeFi platforms like Uniswap and traditional financial institutions highlights a fundamental difference in their operational models. DeFi's reliance on automation and smart contracts allows for lean operations and greater efficiency, while TradFi's complex structures require substantial human capital. This difference has profound implications for the future of finance, with DeFi potentially offering greater accessibility and lower costs, while TradFi continues to provide established regulatory frameworks and well-defined security protocols. As both sectors continue to evolve, it's likely that they will influence and learn from each other, shaping the future of finance in ways we are only beginning to understand. Blockchain technology has incredible potential to foster economic dynamics that result in a much needed modernization of nearly every industry from supplain chain logistics to healthcare to waste management infrastructure and many more.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs has the most advanced&nbsp;decentralized identity&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;on the market—and the newly released version 3.0 is packed with features that customers can apply to their own products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new features in the latest version of our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK represent the bleeding edge of decentralized identity (DI), align with European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) regulations, and maintain the modularity, reliability, and security of <a href="http://anonyome.com/businesses">Anonyome Labs</a>’ products.</p>



<p>Our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK currently allows customers to easily integrate DI and verifiable credential (VC, or reusable credential) solutions into their applications and now, with version 3.0, these capabilities go even further. The DI Mobile Edge Agent SDKis a native SDK for both iOS and Android, and does not rely on any third party frameworks such as Javascript frameworks.</p>



<p>In nutshell:</p>



 
 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 adds support for OpenID4VC (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>), expanding its suite of protocols for receiving and presenting credentials, in addition to the already supported Aries protocols. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 builds on its collection of supported credential formats (Anoncreds and W3C) with the addition of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a>, increasing interoperability and supporting new privacy-preserving use cases. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 updates its supported Aries protocols, maintaining interoperability with the latest Aries agents in the ecosystem. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK continues to exist in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s DI offerings, such as in the Anonyome Labs Cloud Agent Service and the Anonyome Labs Decentralized Identity Relay. 



 Having accomplished what was on the roadmap we set out in our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">previous article</a>, we’ve outlined our new enhanced roadmap, including continued investment into OpenID4VC capabilities, and expansion for new DID Methods (such as <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method">Cheqd</a>). 
 



<p>Let’s break these down:</p>



 Adds support for OpenID4VC protocols 



<p>With our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK already having support for Aries protocols for receiving and presenting VCs (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2/README.md">Issue Credential</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/401acf391b1470fd0b7bc58b94c1b05588b811b7/features/0454-present-proof-v2/README.md#L4">Present Proof</a>), version 3.0 ventures into the new OpenID4VC protocol suite (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>).</p>



<p>This move allows for wider interoperability with the DI ecosystem, including within the EUDI ecosystem where these protocols are being used in technical specifications (such as the <a href="https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/arf/">Architecture Reference Framework</a>) and pilot deployments.</p>



<p>These new protocols also help achieve new use cases and wallet UX flows alongside the existing Aries protocol’s use cases. A few of the notable differences are:</p>



 
 Being rooted in industry-standard OAuth 2.0 flows, OpenID4VC allows standard OAuth authorization flows to be used in credential issuance flows. 



 Multiple credentials can be offered in the same flow, where the Edge Agent SDK consumer can browse and request the desired credential. 



 The issuer now conveys support for UI display data in the credential exchange, including issuer and credential colors, text, and logos. 



 There’s no prerequisite to establish an existing DIDComm connection. Credential and presentation exchange flows can begin immediately from an initial QR code scan or deep link click. 
 



<p>The possibilities and protocol variations in OpenID4VC are vast. To home in on the variations the Edge Agent SDK will support in this release, we’ve targeted interoperability with the OpenID4VC verifier and issuer capabilities of the popular open-source projects <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts/tree/main/packages/openid4vc">credo-ts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy-plugins/tree/main/oid4vc">ACA-Py</a>.</p>



 Builds on supported VCs formats, with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a> 



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF’s SD-JWT VC</a>s is the latest credential format to enter our Edge Agent’s suite of supported formats, alongside <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCs</a> and <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Anoncreds</a>.</p>



<p>Like the new OpenID4VC features, this new credential format enables new use cases and wider interoperability with the DI ecosystem, since SD-JWT VC is a preferred format in the EUDI ecosystem.</p>



<p>SD-JWT VCs are designed with selective disclosure in mind, allowing for the building of user-centric privacy-preserving use cases. Using SD-JWT VC, the holder can selectively choose to hide certain attributes of their credential (if the issuer permits it), so that when they present their credential in some use cases, they present only the bare minimum to satisfy that use case. By default, our Edge Agent SDK will always disclose as little as possible when presenting SD-JWT VCs, protecting the privacy of our consumers.</p>



<p>Our Edge Agent SDK could already support some of these use cases via Anoncreds and the BBS-variant of W3C VCs, but SD-JWT VCs differ from these formats in that they use <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/140-2/upd2/final/docs/fips1402annexa.pdf">NIST FIPS</a>-compliant cryptography—an attractive feat for EUDI regulation.</p>



 Updates supported Aries protocols 



<p>In addition to our major venture into the new OpenID4VC protocol suite, we continue to maintain and expand our Aries protocol suite. Since <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">2.0</a>, the Edge Agent SDK has added support for the latest Aries connection protocol, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">DID Exchange</a>.</p>



<p>This new protocol has new UX optimizations for Edge Agent SDK consumers where DIDComm connections can be re-used if a duplicate connection is detected when receiving a DIDComm invitation. But, just as importantly, this feature ensures the Edge Agent SDK remains aligned with the latest Aries Interoperability Profile (AIP).</p>



 Exists in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s DI offerings 



<p>As a market leader in innovative&nbsp;decentralized identity (DI)&nbsp;technology offerings, Anonyome Labs continues to advance its&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">DI solutions</a>, supporting a wide range of use cases. Our Edge Agent SDK continues to seamlessly integrate with our highly scalable DI message relay solution, the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo DI Relay SDK</a>, allowing the edge agent to reliably receive messages from the DIDComm peers it connects with. What’s more, we continue to thoroughly test our Edge Agent against our&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Cloud Agent Service</a>&nbsp;offering (in addition to a suite of open source DI agents) to make sure all our features remain interoperable in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Rich roadmap ahead 



<p>With this extensive third release, Anonyome’s DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK has once again exceeded its roadmap, going beyond the plan laid out since the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">previous release announcement</a>. But we are not slowing down: we plan to keep adding features to every new release of the SDK so our customers’ applications can stay up to date with the latest and greatest in the DI ecosystem.</p>



<p>Going forward for the SDK, we plan to continue updating our OpenID4VC protocol suite. Despite being deployed in many EUDI pilots, OpenID4VC protocols are still in draft status. We plan to stay up to date with these protocols as they approach their official 1.0 release, aligning with the EUDI. We also plan to:</p>



 
 Enhance our OpenID4VC protocol implementations with new capabilities, such as OpenID4VCI’s “Authorization code flow”, enabling use cases where users must perform a standard OAuth login to access a credential 



 Add support for OpenID’s <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">SIOPv2</a> protocol, allowing for new “login with decentralized identifier” use cases 



 Continue expanding the set of DID methods we support, such as did:cheqd, did:tdw, and did:jwk, again increasing the level of interoperability with more DI agents. 
 



<p><a href="http://anonyome.com/businesses">Anonyome Labs</a>’ business solution&nbsp;combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of enterprise-ready APIs and SDKs, so you can quickly build and deploy next-generation privacy, cyber safety, and decentralized identity apps to help your customers communicate privately, navigate online safely, and transact securely in an increasingly connected world.&nbsp;</p>
