<p>A retail expert from one of the world’s largest ad companies has joined <a href="https://vsblty.net/">VSBLTY</a>‘s Board of Directors, offering the latest signal of the smart signage and computer vision specialist’s expansion efforts in the the retail sector.</p>



<p>David Roth is a high-level executive with WPP, a London-based firm that dabbles in everything from public relations to commerce to technology, and that is widely considered the <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/advertising-companies/">world’s biggest ad firm</a> by revenues. Roth is the CEO of The Store, WPP’s global retail practice; and he is Chairman of WPP BAV, a consultancy focused on in-store innovation. Roth is also a documentary filmmaker and the author of multiple books and studies including “Brand Stories from Brand Champions” and “The Third Era of Digital Retailing”.</p>



<p>In announcing Roth’s appointment as a non-executive member of the board, VSBLTY co-founder and CEO Jay Hutton framed it as an important strategic maneuver with respect to the promotion of the company’s “Store as a Medium” strategy, which aims to help retailers use technological innovation to build meaningful relationships with customers. VSBLTY announced the launch of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-intel-white-paper-offers-look-future-retail-012005/">a “SaaM” mobile app</a> in collaboration with Intel and The Store-WPP in January.</p>



<p>“David Roth, with his global retail expertise, considerably strengthens the team we are assembling to take advantage of the most important media channel to emerge in decades,” Hutton said. “SaaM represents a complete alteration and disruption in the way brands communicate directly and more effectively with their customers. And brands will pay retailers for the increasingly available data about shopping and purchase behavior that reveals predictive patterns. The addition of David to an already solid Board ensures that we will increase our management strength, reach and ability to help key brands take advantage of the most important innovation emerging throughout the retail landscape—brands influencing customers’ buying decisions right at point of sale.”</p>



<p>In addition to any expertise VSBLTY has on hand, much of that effort will also depend on the company’s technology, which revolves around machine learning-driven AI, computer vision, and facial recognition. The company signed a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-modelo-move-forward-with-smart-retail-network-latin-america-031501/">formal agreement with Grupo Modelo</a> last year to see its technology deployed in convenience stores and bodegas in Mexico, enabling retailers to collect shoppers’ demographic data and offer tailored in-store ads through smart displays.</p>



<p>The other major arm of VSBLTY’s business channels these technologies into smart city and security applications, as demonstrated in deployments of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/survey-shows-mexico-city-residents-feel-safer-with-vsblty-surveillance-tech-110105/">face-scanning surveillance systems</a> in the Benito Juarez borough of Mexico City.</p>



<p>For his part, Roth expressed excitement about helping VSBLTY on the retail side of things. “I was excited to learn how VSBLTY’s team has been leading the way in computer vision capabilities for retailers and brands,” he said. “I look forward to helping VSBLTY across its next phase of development and growth.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jumio.com/">Jumio</a>‘s KYX Platform has won the company a couple of important new accolades. In the 2022 Cyber Security Global Excellence Awards, the ‘Know Your Everything’ platform took a Gold award in the category of fraud prevention and Silver in the category of AI in security.</p>



<p>The Cyber Security Global Excellence Awards represent one of the 11 annual awards programs organized by The Globee Awards in a program that has been running since 2003. Over 55 judges from around the world participate in the award program, assessing cybersecurity solutions and technology for innovation and quality.</p>



<p>KYX evidently stood out. First launched in <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/jumio-unveils-new-kyx-identity-verification-solution-091704/">September of 2020</a>, the KYX Platform is aimed at helping organizations to comply with a wide range of Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations. Building on Jumio’s face-based onboarding and authentication technology, the platform offered additional tools in service of the ambitious goal of enabling organizations to verify any entity interacting with their business.</p>



<p>In October, the KYX solution was further upgraded through the implementation of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-enhances-risk-screening-capabilities-kyx-platform-102604/">an ‘orchestration layer’</a> that added risk scoring capabilities and enabled clients to build custom workflows.</p>



<p>The robust platform has proven appealing amid growing concerns about cyberthreats, says Jumio CEO Robert Prigge. “Today’s tech-savvy cybercriminals have the knowledge and tools to conduct sophisticated remote attacks,” he said. “Consequently, organizations have been heavily relying on Jumio’s KYX Platform to remotely verify users and defend their operations from fraudulent transactions.”</p>



<p>As for the Cyber Security Global Excellence Award wins, Prigge said the recognition “validates our strategic vision to redefine the end-to-end identity industry by helping organizations instill trust in their online channels, meet AML and KYC compliance and fight fraud and financial crime.”</p>



<p>The award wins come after a fiscal update in January in which Jumio reported that revenues had <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-momentum-continues-in-q4-update-501181/">doubled year-over-year</a>. That momentum was complemented by the news that Jumio had <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-completes-4stop-acquisition-011906/">completed its acquisition of 4Stop</a>, a German startup that has built a data management hub platform.</p>

<p><a href="https://innotechtoday.com/">Innovation &amp; Tech Today</a> (I&amp;TT) has listed <a href="https://www.alcatraz.ai/">Alcatraz AI</a>’s the Rock as one of its Top 50 Most Innovative Products for 2022. The publisher’s annual Top 50 list highlights cutting-edge products in a number of different sectors, covering everything from software products and connected services to new gadgets for the home and the workplace. Categories include health technology, connected life, and gaming and entertainment.</p>



  



<p><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/alcatraz-releases-updated-version-flagship-facial-recognition-platform-010708/">The Rock</a>, meanwhile, is an access control solution that uses facial recognition to verify the identities of registered users. The platform is designed primarily for enterprise use cases, where its tailgating detection feature is particularly appealing to organizations that want to prevent people from following employees into a building. In that regard, the Rock can send a real-time notification to security personnel if an unfamiliar face manages to get through the door.</p>



<p>For legitimate users, the Rock enables contactless access control backed up with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/alcatraz-strengthens-rock-with-three-factor-authentication-021201/">multi-factor authentication</a>. It also makes enrollment simple, since the platform can <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/alcatraz-streamlines-access-control-la-hospital-latest-case-study-020903/">learn to recognize users</a> as they approach a point of entry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Alcatraz AI is honored that the Rock has been awarded as a Most Innovative Product by Innovation &amp; Tech Today,” said Alcatraz AI CEO, Tina D’Agostin. “We are thrilled to be included in this list among so many other great innovators.”</p>



<p>“Every year, we unearth some of the most innovative products on the market,” added I&amp;TT Editor-in-Chief and Innovative Properties Worldwide CEO Charles Warner. “We pride ourselves on having a sharp eye for finding novel products that are technologically advanced and highly useful. Each product was vigorously tested by our entire editorial staff, as we narrowed down the entrants to the best possible reflection of products that will appeal to our readers.”</p>



<p>Alcatraz will be bringing the Rock to the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/alcatraz-taking-rock-isc-west-021801/">ISC West show in Las Vegas</a> later in the month. The event is set to run March 23-25.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.iproov.com/">iProov</a>’s phenomenal growth has caught the attention of the Financial Times. The outlet’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/ft1000-2022">annual FT 1000 list</a> was set up to recognize the fastest-growing companies in Europe, and it has iProov ranked in the 57th spot in an increasingly competitive European marketplace.</p>



  



<p>The companies on the latest FT100 list were ranked based on their fiscal performance between 2017 and 2020. Those whose revenues displayed the highest CAGRs were placed near the top, while those with lower CAGRs received lower positions.</p>



<p>iProov was able to secure its spot with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/selfie-biometrics-specialist-iproov-enjoys-record-growth-2020-121101/">strong year-over-year returns</a>, and indicated that its trajectory has accelerated since the evaluation cut-off date. The company’s revenues tripled between 2020 and 2021, and its traffic volume has gone up accordingly. It verified more than one million identities on a single day on multiple occasions, and managed to eclipse its total for all of 2020 in one particularly busy 10-day period in 2021.</p>



<p>Some of iProov’s newest partners include <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/eurostar-begins-trial-of-biometric-passenger-processing-712061/">Eurostar</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iproov-enters-nsf-accelerator-help-stop-spread-online-misinformation-102702/">National Science Foundation</a>. The company is best known for its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iproov-provides-liveness-detection-itsme-onboarding-platform-042201/">liveness detection technology</a>, which helps prevent spoofing for businesses that are using face-based identity verification systems.</p>



<p>“To be recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in Europe is truly remarkable,” said iProov Founder and CEO Andrew Bud. “This recognition is a testament to the dedication of everyone on our extraordinary team. Our mission is to make the world a safer place with secure, effortless online identity verification and we look forward to continuing our growth as we meet that challenge head-on every day.”</p>



<p>iProov has previously been identified as one of the fastest-growing companies in the UK, after making its way onto the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-liveness-specialist-iproov-claims-top-five-spot-deloittes-uk-technology-fast-50-list-112007/">Deloitte Fast 50 list</a> in each of the past two years. The company recently received a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iproov-gets-70m-vc-investment-from-silicon-valleys-sumeru-501061/">$70 million investment</a> from Sumeru Equity Partners, though it is also facing a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-sues-iproov-over-alleged-biometric-technology-patent-infringement-501051/">patent infringement lawsuit from FaceTec</a> that was filed earlier this year.</p>

<p>This is a transcript of Ocean Founder Bruce Pon’s latest talk at the MOBI Community Lecture Series. In his fourth presentation to the MOBI community since 2019, Bruce offers a deep dive into safe data sharing with blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. His lectUre also underlines the role of <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> and its latest technical advances — safe staking and Data NFTs — in spearheading this&nbsp;vision.</p><p>The Value of&nbsp;Data</p><p>Data is an untapped asset waiting to be unlocked. With a combination of new technology, mindset changes and new business processes, this is possible. As a starting point, organizations must acknowledge that publishers need to feel safe, secure and comfortable to share data. If this is solved, then the next phase is to develop pricing signals on the data to incentivize people, reveal the value of personal data to them and get the cycle&nbsp;going.</p><p>My team have worked for eight years to build the tools and technologies to allow for safer data sharing and we have employed blockchain technology and cryptocurrency for this purpose. Today, the world is closer to having the pieces in place to unlock data at a large scale. The technology stack is maturing quickly and many of the core infrastructure pieces are ready to be used. With successful models of bootstrapping and new economies forming in the Web3 space through decentralised finance, non-fungible tokens and decentralised autonomous organisations, the Defi space has a total value of $3+ trillion, which is more than the value of all the startups and unicorns on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>The decentralised space is moving very fast, there’s a lot of value being sucked up to it which makes data ripe for this crypto cycle. However, there are still a lot of challenges to improving the user experience. There is a need to raise awareness and educate people and streamline the onboarding process because that’s not intuitive. The need of the hour is to teach people that if they are able to put things into digitized formats using these tools, they will also be able to apply the tools of finance to make it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Ocean Protocol: The key to unlocking an Open Data&nbsp;Economy</p><p>There are a lot of features in the Ocean tech stack that enable users to share their data and monetise it on their own terms. In Ocean’s upcoming technical release V4, these features present a whole new set of opportunities.</p><p>1. Ocean&nbsp;Market</p><p>The <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> is the main way for people to interact with Ocean; it’s the front end application that one can access from any browser. Users can see the datasets, stake them, buy them and consume them. What Ocean will work to build soon is a pool to draw people in, whether through a wider range of useful data, bounties or request forms to allow people to ask for the type of data they’re looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>For data providers, the Ocean Market is open-source software that’s freely available to anyone to clone and build their own marketplace. The code is completely available to inspect and any vulnerabilities found can be fixed very quickly. In V4 the providers can set their own fee schedules for each transaction as well as price data in the currencies they want. The advances Ocean has made in the last 14 months are to extend tools, features and control to all participants and stakeholders. Ocean has also integrated both DeFi and NFTs into the Ocean Market enabling users to stake and earn transaction fees. The Ocean Market has now evolved into a more mature front end with which people can start using Web3 technologies. This includes the cryptocurrencies of Ocean, anything else that interacts with it, the concept of NFTs and decentralized finance.</p><p>The idea driving this is that Web3 technologies are future-facing; this is where the world is going to head and the ability to have a live demo that is in production, securing several million dollars worth of data and allowing people to start sharing their data is very rare. This makes the Ocean Market one of the very first data markets available using Web3 technologies.</p><p>2. Ocean Smart Contracts</p><p>With Ocean as an operating system for AI and data sharing, smart contracts are the engines driving it. They serve to enforce conditions of access, facilitate payments, execute a transaction or business logic. It is a globally shared computer that anyone can use, which allows for these transactions to happen anywhere on Earth at any time, given the proper&nbsp;inputs.</p><p>There are multiple kinds of blockchain networks, and Ocean interacts with all of them through smart contracts — these are the core building blocks on which all protocols live. They allow the trustless exchange of value, but also provide an audit trail on what transactions have taken place and what actions have been done. It is a very strong use case because any participant can trace back and see what happened directly on the blockchain, paving the way for automated audits and inspections — continuous monitoring of what happens to the data and personal datasets. Publishers could get daily reports on how many datasets were sold, what was done to them, and be notified of any exceptions or&nbsp;misuse.</p><p>3. Compute-to-Data</p><p>The third piece that Ocean built to meet the needs for people to share their data without exposing it is a reference implementation called Compute-to-Data. It offers privacy-preserving access, which means that data can be stopped from being stolen. Today, there are a host of tools being developed across the entire space, which allow for privacy-preserving computing to happen at multiple fine grain levels. This means that any type of computing on a dataset, any type of action that is run on it will still preserve its privacy. Compute-to-Data is our first cut at this and our team is working with several other entities to integrate their privacy-preserving algorithms and solutions directly into the Ocean Market. Users will be enabled to choose the type of privacy protection they want to implement on top of their services in order for them to be consumed safely. Ocean equips users with comfort and security for providing their data to meet industry&nbsp;demand.</p><p>4. OCEAN&nbsp;Token</p><p>We hear a lot about cryptocurrencies nowadays where more and more people are comfortable acquiring, holding and using them to navigate the blockchain economies. 15% of the American public apparently holds crypto and in about a dozen other countries, such as the Philippines, Nigeria, and other places that you wouldn’t have necessarily thought would be on the edge of innovation, the number of population that actually have crypto is above 20%. This is what crypto does, it invites the world in, and it allows everybody to participate. That is the positive effect of this technology.</p><p>This is where the OCEAN token comes in. It is a native crypto token for the Ocean network that helps to run the smart contracts and we use it for a whole bunch of other purposes like governance, staking rewards and bounties as well. It’s a standard for this data economy and the means of payment in the ecosystem. In the future, we are also looking to introduce other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Our whole goal is to make sure that data sharing becomes easier. We do know that right now, it is mandatory that people have cryptocurrency wallets in order to interact with us but we are looking forward to easier onboarding as technology progresses.</p><p>5. Datatokens and Data&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>Think of it this way: if you want to play a pinball game, you need to throw in a token to play the game. The way we have architected datatokens is through the idea that one needs a token in order to access&nbsp;data.</p><p>A publisher could set the price of the datatoken at $100 in the Ocean Market. There’s also innovative technology that allows for tokens to be dynamically priced by the community in real-time, without affecting the data itself. If the community takes a look at the data and understands what is being provided, they can help price the data. The datatoken concept allows for a data asset to develop its own dynamic price, the liquidity behind the datatoken gives a price, people can trade datatokens speculatively without moving the actual underlying data — and at the end, because there’s a dynamic price on the datatoken, that becomes the de facto the price of the data asset. It is an interesting experiment to see how we can price data into the future, especially for data assets that we don’t really know the price&nbsp;for.</p><p>If one takes the datatoken concept to its logical conclusion when a dataset is so well used and so broadly traded, one could say that the dataset is IPO’ed — and it is a stock that also grants one access to use the data if one&nbsp;wants.</p><p>One of the things that we’ve realized in the Web3 space is that speculation and pricing are fundamental pieces to a market. In a nascent market, there is only speculation. By using this dynamic, we can start unlocking data through datatokens.</p><p>6. Data&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>Imagine that you have a dataset, and you’ve generated it for your doctoral research but you don’t really need the data anymore. It now turns out that an automotive company would like to have that dataset. One could generate a datatoken and hand over access to that automotive company. But one could argue that there is also the possibility of creating a Data NFT for the licensing rights to a data asset. Not only can you sell this Data NFT to the automotive company, and let them use the data but now it can also be improved and marketed.</p><p>In other words, you’ve licensed out your intellectual property for somebody else to use and monetize themselves. Think of an NFT for a car — where one essentially sells the car with the NFT — the physical object with the digital NFT. Or one can invest in licensing where the process is just granting access at a particular time to a particular data asset. Just like a song and multiple CD’s with access to it, there are datasets and a couple of NFTs to grant access to them enabling owners to monetise their data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In summary, there are two approaches. One is the datatoken, where users maintain control of the data asset, watch over how many people are trading it and what the price is from a dynamic perspective. The second one is Data NFTs, where users generate sublicenses and sell them off. These NFTs are free-floating but whoever has that NFT continues to be able to access a particular dataset.</p><p>These are native, future-facing technologies that we are going to hear a lot more about. With these building blocks, Ocean gives users the tools to sell data and monetize it. Any publisher can now monetize their data using these innovative channels without any reliance on a centralized party or software as a service provider. They have full control over their commissions and they cannot be de-platformed. This allows for a flowering of innovation but also for different business models to be tried out by interested parties in order to get a data economy&nbsp;going.</p><p>Why isn’t data being shared more frequently?</p><p>The answer is simple: there are 100 different ways how data can be collected, but it just stays locked up. Many individuals today want to share and monetise their data however they do not know how to get started. They want to have a comprehensive understanding of the legal, safety and privacy implications involved in the process. There is a curiosity to learn, a sense of opportunity to start building new business lines and that is crucial to building the open data economy that we aim to unleash at&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>We need more experiments that put small amounts of value and reputation at risk, to learn and adjust organically. Interested publishers must take that first step because no one can predict the market’s reaction. The path isn’t clear for anyone and no one knows how to package and sell the data in a Web3 world. Everyone is learning in this new environment and it is my strong conviction that we can start sharing data now only if we take some bold steps forward. Many people have exactly the kind of data that many organizations are looking for in order to enhance their services and AI capabilities and so, it becomes imperative to dive into the easiest ways to start sharing and monetising it.</p><p>The 3-step approach to getting value out of your&nbsp;data</p><p>Step 1 — Gather &amp; Publish&nbsp;data</p><p>Gather data that you think is valuable but isn’t being exploited and monetized.</p><p>Find some data about supply chains, manufacturing, energy consumption, sensor data, warehouse data — whatever it is that you are collecting and you think has value. However, avoid anything that exposes personal information.</p><p>Find it, package it up, publish it on Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>This allows you to get your feet wet with the tools and paradigms of Web3 — from setting up a wallet, to self-generating IDs and then using the tools available. It’s the best way to learn and demonstrate to stakeholders how to navigate the world of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Step 2 — Explore&nbsp;Value</p><p>If you don’t know what the data could be valuable for, issue a&nbsp;bounty.</p><p>You issue a bounty to the community for helping you find out what the data could be used for. It can be as simple as a $15k prize for the best ideas on how the data is valuable and could be better monetized — $5k to the top 3 winners. Ocean Protocol can also publicize the bounty with its 250,000 strong community. This bounty allows you to gather ideas from a broad swath of motivated people.</p><p>Step 3 — Get&nbsp;Value</p><p>Finally, if you have some burning questions and you think there might be an answer, or at least, an approach to solving the questions, you can also bounty this for the community.</p><p>Give a prize to anyone that can help you solve the riddle or question, using the datasets you published.</p><p>One example: in 1999, Goldcorp Challenge was launched by the new owner of a goldmine — he asked the global community to help him find the gold on his land for a chance to get $1m in prize money. He put up a small file of his geological data for inspection. 20 years later, Goldcorp was sold for $10 Billion and is now the largest gold mining company on Earth. All because he took the chance, opened up his data and let others help him to figure out where to dig for&nbsp;gold.</p><p>Data — when openly, transparently exploited, can be extremely powerful and valuable.</p><p>Through this simple 3-step approach, you can get value out of your data and incentivize a global community of data scientists using bounties. It can be a game-changer only if one takes a&nbsp;chance.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In summary, with Ocean, we have been building infrastructure to enable this kind of safe data sharing. It is there and is ready to use; we just have to get the wheel going. As part of our future Ocean V4 release, Ocean will give publishers more control, transparency and ways to monetize their data. It’s the most advanced stack of technologies in this rapidly expanding space. However, its true potential can be realized only if there is more experimentation. Imagine the discoveries that are just waiting to happen if data could be opened up. At Ocean, we will continue to support and encourage you in this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a new Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality&nbsp;data.</p><p>Watch Bruce Pon’s past talks for the MOBI community via the links&nbsp;below:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHuNQ-DmaM0">How to Tokenize and Monetize Your Data</a> — MoCo Los Angeles, 12 November&nbsp;2019</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U2H0qV2VwE">Data Monetization for Mobility</a>, 25 November&nbsp;2020</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybfZUT0Fmb0">Data Sharing Using the Latest Web3 Technologies</a>- 23 February&nbsp;2022</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-sharing-using-the-latest-web3-technologies-7703624aa709">Data sharing using the latest Web3 technologies</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Web3Auth at one of the World’s Largest Web3 Events — ETHDenver 2022  Web3Auth was at ETH Denver to forge partnerships, sponsor the Opening Party where we (literally) air-dropped NFTs, delivered talks, and also unveiled a&nbsp;dance!  What is ETHDenver and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>ETHDenver is the largest and longest-running ETH Event in the world. Attended by the who’s who of the Crypto industry — particularly from within the Ethereum community, ETHDenver is hosted in the state of Colorado — a thriving hub of Ethereum and Blockchain innovation.</p><p>In the three years since we’ve been active as a Web3 company, this is the second time we had the opportunity to participate in this massive gathering of some of the brightest minds in the Web3 space. What better way to open our presence at ETHDenver than to become official sponsors of the Opening&nbsp;Party?</p> How Celebrations unfolded at the Opening&nbsp;Party <p>The Party was hosted at the Wings Over The Rockies Air and Aviation Museum spread across 44000 sq ft and housing over fifty iconic aircraft and the most realistic flight simulators.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1494427295720919042">@epnsproject</a></p></blockquote><p>Starting at 2:00 pm and going on till 2:00 am, the opening party hosted a slew of exciting talks and panel discussions with our own co-founder and CTO Leonard Tan featuring in a very insightful discussion around ”Interoperability, Scaling, and Blockchain Agnosticism”. Leonard also cited the example of Web3Auth whose pluggable SDK is blockchain agnostic which evoked a few pleasant surprises in the audience.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495452625709395970">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Later in the day, our co-founder and <a href="https://twitter.com/zenzhenyu">CEO Zhen Yu Yong</a> also spoke about a popular topic — “How one can accelerate the adoption of Web3 Wallets and Applications”</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/DefiNft/status/1494446562163900423">@DefiNft</a></p></blockquote><p>The audience was surprised to know that with Web3Auth’s pluggable SDK, they could eliminate the need for using seed phrases in their dApps just in a few&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>The party got groovier with an interesting bunch of artists performing through the day(and night) to keep the energy rising in what was an already electrifying space. After having spent the day reaching out to many developers, it was time to put the good old phrase “Work hard party harder” into action. Team Web3Auth partied through the rest of the&nbsp;evening.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495504783909732361">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> Web3Auth AirDrops Party&nbsp;NFTs <p>The highlight of the night was a blimp that circled above the event for 6 hours from which we airdropped specially designed physical NFTs. Don’t believe us? See for yourself.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495488929562255364">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/EthereumDenver/status/1494843481172459524">@EthereumDenver</a></p></blockquote> Star-Studded Speaker&nbsp;Sessions <p>ETHDenver set the stage for some of the biggest names in Blockchain to come and share their priceless insights with the rest of the community. The galaxy of speakers included the founders of some of the biggest NFT marketplaces to the founders of giant L2 chains to senior members from the Ethereum Foundation and countless exciting developers from the ecosystem!</p><p>Having helped dApps such as Skyweaver, Rarible, and MyCrypto heroes increase user adoption, Zhen gave insights to the community on how they can scale up too by integrating Web3Auth’s state of the art Private Key management infrastructure.</p><p>However, it was Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum Foundation(with whom both our co-founders worked previously) who eventually stole the show for reasons both expected and unexpected.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/neocrassical/status/1494888681055920129">@neocrassical</a></p></blockquote><p>When Vitalik wore the ETHDenver Mascot Buffi suit, little did he know he would end up as a meme to be shared by Elon&nbsp;Musk</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1496252264171941888">@elonmusk</a></p></blockquote> Successful Partnerships and the Dance of&nbsp;success <p>The simplicity of Web3Auth attracted a lot of attention from the community and people from different quarters reached out to the team to know more about Web3Auth. Below is a snippet from Zhen’s interview with The Sapien&nbsp;Tribe.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/sapien_network/status/1496253333941940225">@sapien_network</a></p></blockquote><p>Web3Auth also forged some promising partnerships at ETHDenver that will help onboard the next generation of users into Web3. You can expect formal announcements in the days to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Lastly, we would like to leave you with a sweet dance of success — presenting to you the official Web3Auth Dance that we unveiled for the first&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495790667867508744">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1496291445883420675">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> About Web3Auth <p>Web3Auth, is a pluggable non-custodial infrastructure that enables Web3 wallets and applications to provide seamless user logins for both mainstream and Web3.0 users. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets, and existing key management solutions, Web3Auth provides dApps/wallets with a familiar experience that fits every&nbsp;user.</p> Stay in touch with&nbsp;Web3Auth <p><a href="http://web3auth.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">Docs</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/web3authdev">Telegram</a> | <a href="http://discord.gg/web3auth">Discord</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3auth">Linkedin</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-at-one-of-the-worlds-largest-web3-events-ethdenver-2022-4a2180621107">Web3Auth at one of the World’s Largest Web3 Events — ETHDenver 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Over the years, I’ve developed a lot of Java applications. I started writing Java code in the late 90s and spent several years doing Java before I tried another server-side language. I was impressed when I first tried building apps in Ruby on Rails, Python, and Node.js - they all started super-fast! 
 
 
 Starting fast is cool, but we in the Java community have often asked, does it perform over

<p>Over the years, I’ve developed a lot of Java applications. I started writing Java code in the late 90s and spent several years doing Java before I tried another server-side language. I was impressed when I first tried building apps in Ruby on Rails, Python, and Node.js - they all started super-fast!</p>
 
 
<p>Starting fast is cool, but we in the Java community have often asked, does it perform over time? The Java Virtual Machine is famous for performance and optimization over time.</p>
 
 
<p>I scoffed at serverless when it first came out. Mostly because I was a Java developer and my apps didn’t start in milliseconds. They also used a whole lotta memory and there was no hope in sight.</p>
 
 
<p>Then, along came <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>. It’s gained support from many Java frameworks in the last few years and has made their apps start in milliseconds!</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’m proud to announce that this same capability is now available for your JHipster 7+ apps!</p>

 Why should you care about serverless? 
 
 
<p>From <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless">IBM’s What is Serverless computing?</a></p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>Serverless is a cloud execution model that enables a simpler, more cost-effective way to build and operate cloud-native applications.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>That’s it!</p>
 
 
<p>For companies with high traffic and large cloud bills, serverless makes sense. They can save millions of dollars a month.</p>
 
 
 
 
 GraalVM allows serverless Java for everyone! 
 
 
<p>I’ve been playing with GraalVM and the Java frameworks that support it for around 18 months. After doing a lot of research, I blogged about <a>building native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In September 2021, I did a talk with Josh Long about Spring Native with JHipster at the San Francisco JUG.</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>Let the games begin with <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@starbuxman</a>! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Java?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Java</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpringNative?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SpringNative</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JHipster?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JHipster</a> <a href="https://t.co/0KSRTd89e5">pic.twitter.com/0KSRTd89e5</a></p>— Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1442698739563446276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2021</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>I flew out on a Monday, we got everything working by Wednesday afternoon, and then spoke about our experience on Wednesday night. I wrote about it in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-matt-raible/">JHipster Works with Spring Native!</a> on LinkedIn and created a <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/16498">JHipster issue</a> to automate our learnings.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What is Spring Native? 
 
 
<p>Spring Native provides an API to configure Spring Boot and GraalVM so classes that are not easily discoverable become recognizable. For example, those that are instantiated using reflection. It’s a really slick extension to Spring Boot and will likely disappear with Spring Boot 3 because it’ll be native by default.</p>
 
 
<p>As a result of our successful <a href="https://youtu.be/F9oydL_MndA">presentation at the SF JUG</a>, Josh and I were invited to speak at the Garden State JUG in December. We laid low for a few months and rekindled our research in December. I wrote about it in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-part-2-matt-raible/">JHipster works with Spring Native, Part 2!</a></p>
 
 
 
 
 🔥 Announcing the JHipster Native blueprint! 
 
 
<p>In late January 2022, we (the JHipster team) upgraded JHipster to use Spring Boot 2.6 and released version <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/2022/01/23/jhipster-release-7.6.0.html">7.6.0</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In early February, I updated <a href="https://github.com/mraible/spring-native-examples">the Spring Native with JHipster examples</a> that Josh and I’d been using for research. I was ready to start automating the Spring Native integration using a JHipster module. When <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/16498#issuecomment-1030263905">I asked the JHipster team</a> about the best way to implement it, <a href="https://github.com/mshima">Marcelo Shima</a> volunteered to create the initial blueprint.</p>
 
 
<p>This was on a Friday afternoon (Mountain Time or MT). By the next morning, Marcelo had the MVP finished and provided steps to reproduce our examples. 😳</p>
 
 
<p>I was amazed! I remember telling (my partner) Trish that he’d done a week’s worth of (my estimated) work in a matter of hours.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’m proud to announce the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-native">JHipster Native blueprint</a> is available! Here’s how to use it:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-native@1.0
jhipster-native</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This will generate a JHipster app and integrate GraalVM automatically. You can build and run a native image with the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Pnative,prod -DskipTests
npm run ci:e2e:prepare # start docker dependencies
./target/native-executable</code> 
 
 
 






Gradle is not currently an option, but it can be if we add support to the JHipster Native blueprint.



 
 
 
 
 Go native with Spring Native and GraalVM 
 
 
<p>To see Spring Native + JHipster in action, let’s look at a <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/">previous JHipster app I created for the Auth0 blog</a>. First, clone the example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git jhipster-native
cd jhipster-native</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>Want results right away? Clone the <code>spring-native</code> branch with the changes below already made:</p>
 
 
 
 git clone -b spring-native https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git jhipster-native 
 
 
 
<p>Then, skip to the <a>Configure your OpenID Connect identity provider</a> section to continue.</p>
 



 
 
<p>Install JHipster 7.7.0 and the JHipster Native blueprint:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@7.7
npm i -g generator-jhipster-native@1.0</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, remove all the existing project files and regenerate them. The <code>jhipster-native</code> command includes parameters to disable caching because it’s not supported by Spring Native, yet.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>rm -rf *
jhipster-native --with-entities --cache-provider no --no-enable-hibernate-cache
# When prompted to overwrite .gitignore, type "a" to overwrite all files</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the Commit Tools Window (⌘+0 on macOS or Ctrl+0 on Linux/Windows) to view files that changed.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Next, run the following <code>git checkout</code> commands to restore the files that were modified in the original example.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git checkout .gitignore
git checkout README.md
git checkout demo.adoc
git checkout flickr2.jdl
git checkout screenshots
git checkout src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo.tsx
git checkout src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo-update.tsx
git checkout src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/config/SecurityConfiguration.java
git checkout src/main/resources/config/application-heroku.yml
git checkout src/main/resources/config/bootstrap-heroku.yml
git checkout Procfile
git checkout system.properties</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d rather not use the command line, you can right-click on each file and select Rollback.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you ran the <code>git checkout</code> commands, there are several changes I made in the first tutorial that’ll need to be re-applied:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In <code>src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml</code>, remove the <code>faker</code> profile for Liquibase.</p>
 
 
<p>In <code>pom.xml</code>, re-add Drew Noake’s <code>metadata-extractor</code> library:</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.drewnoakes&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;metadata-extractor&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.16.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Next, modify the <code>createPhoto()</code> method in <code>src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/web/rest/PhotoResource.java</code> to set the metadata when an image is uploaded.</p>
 
 
 <code>import com.drew.imaging.ImageMetadataReader;
import com.drew.imaging.ImageProcessingException;

public class PhotoResource {
    ...

    public ResponseEntity&lt;Photo&gt; createPhoto(@Valid @RequestBody Photo photo) throws Exception {
        log.debug("REST request to save Photo : {}", photo);
        if (photo.getId() != null) { ... }

        try {
            photo = setMetadata(photo);
        } catch (ImageProcessingException | IOException | MetadataException ipe) {
            log.error(ipe.getMessage());
        }

        Photo result = photoRepository.save(photo);
        ...
    }

    private Photo setMetadata(Photo photo) throws ImageProcessingException, IOException, MetadataException {
        String str = DatatypeConverter.printBase64Binary(photo.getImage());
        byte[] data2 = DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(str);
        InputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(data2);
        BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);
        Metadata metadata = ImageMetadataReader.readMetadata(bis);
        ExifSubIFDDirectory directory = metadata.getFirstDirectoryOfType(ExifSubIFDDirectory.class);

        if (directory != null) {
            Date date = directory.getDateDigitized();
            if (date != null) {
                photo.setTaken(date.toInstant());
            }
        }

        if (photo.getTaken() == null) {
            log.debug("Photo EXIF date digitized not available, setting taken on date to now...");
            photo.setTaken(Instant.now());
        }

        photo.setUploaded(Instant.now());

        JpegDirectory jpgDirectory = metadata.getFirstDirectoryOfType(JpegDirectory.class);
        if (jpgDirectory != null) {
            photo.setHeight(jpgDirectory.getImageHeight());
            photo.setWidth(jpgDirectory.getImageWidth());
        }

        return photo;
    }
    ...
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Install the React libraries needed:</p>
 
 
 <code>npm i react-photo-gallery@8 --force
npm i react-images</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>In <code>src/test/javascript/cypress/integration/entity/photo.spec.ts</code>, remove the code that sets the calculated data in the <code>should create an instance of Photo</code> test:</p>
 
 
 <code>cy.get(`[data-cy="height"]`).type('99459').should('have.value', '99459');
cy.get(`[data-cy="width"]`).type('61514').should('have.value', '61514');
cy.get(`[data-cy="taken"]`).type('2021-10-11T16:46').should('have.value', '2021-10-11T16:46');
cy.get(`[data-cy="uploaded"]`).type('2021-10-11T15:23').should('have.value', '2021-10-11T15:23');</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Then, you’ll need to add type hints for Drew Noake’s EXIF processing library in <code>src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/Flickr2App.java</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>@org.springframework.nativex.hint.TypeHint(
    types = {
        ...
        com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifIFD0Directory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifSubIFDDirectory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifThumbnailDirectory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.makernotes.AppleMakernoteDirectory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.GpsDirectory.class,
})
@org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint(options = "-H:+AddAllCharsets")</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The <code>@NativeHint(options = "-H:+AddAllCharsets")</code> solves the following exception that happens when you upload a photo:</p>
 
 
 
 Caused by: java.nio.charset.UnsupportedCharsetException: Cp1252
    at java.nio.charset.Charset.forName(Charset.java:528) ~[native-executable:na]
    at com.drew.lang.Charsets.&lt;clinit&gt;(Charsets.java:40) ~[na:na] 
 
 
 
<p>Once you’ve made all the changes (or cloned the <code>spring-native</code> branch), you can build your hip native binary.</p>
 
 
 Build a native JHipster app 
 
<p>You will need a JDK with GraalVM and its <code>native-image</code> compiler. Using SDKMAN, run the following command and set it as the default:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 21.3.0.r17-grl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the native extension to the JDK:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gu install native-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, use Maven to build the project. Skip tests since there’s no support for Mockito at this time.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Pnative,prod -DskipTests</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This process will take a few minutes to complete.</p>
 
 
 
 Configure your OpenID Connect identity provider 
 
<p>When you generate a JHipster app with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC for authentication, it defaults to using Keycloak. It creates a <code>src/main/docker/keycloak.yml</code> file for Docker Compose, as well as a <code>src/main/docker/realm-config</code> directory with files to auto-create users and OIDC clients.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to use Keycloak for your running app, start it with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d rather use Okta or Auth0, that’s possible too!</p>
 
 
 Use Okta as your identity provider 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>You’ll need to source the <code>.okta.env</code> file the Okta CLI creates to override the default Spring Security settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .okta.env</code> 
 
 
 






If you’re on Windows, you can modify this file to use <code>set</code> instead of <code>export</code> and rename it to <code>okta.bat</code>. Then, run it with <code>okta.bat</code> from the command line.



 
 






Modify your existing <code>.gitignore</code> file to have <code>*.env</code> so you don’t accidentally check in your secrets!



 
 
<p>Skip to <a>Run your native JHipster app</a> if you’ve configured your app for Okta and just want to see it running.</p>
 
 
 
 Use Auth0 as your identity provider 
 
<p>To switch from Keycloak to Auth0, override the Spring Security OAuth properties. You don’t even need to write any code!</p>
 
 
<p>To see how it works, create a <code>.auth0.env</code> file in the root of your project, and fill it with the code below to override the default OIDC settings:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=&lt;your-client-id&gt;
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;your-client-secret&gt;
export JHIPSTER_SECURITY_OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll need to create a new web application in Auth0 and fill in the <code>&lt;…​&gt;</code> placeholders before this works.</p>
 
 
 Create an OpenID Connect app on Auth0 
 
<p>Log in to your Auth0 account (or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">sign up</a> if you don’t have an account). You should have a unique domain like <code>dev-xxx.eu.auth0.com</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Press the Create Application button in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications">Applications section</a>. Use a name like <code>JHipster Native!</code>, select <code>Regular Web Applications</code>, and click Create.</p>
 
 
<p>Switch to the Settings tab and configure your application settings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Allowed Callback URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code></p>
 
 
<p>Allowed Logout URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes.</p>
 
 
<p>Copy your Auth0 domain, client ID, and client secret into the <code>.auth0.env</code> file you created earlier. Then, run <code>source .auth0.env</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles">roles</a> section, create new roles named <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new user account in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/users">users</a> section. Click on the Role tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.</p>
 
 
<p>Make sure your new user’s email is verified before attempting to log in!</p>
 
 
<p>Next, head to Auth Pipeline &gt; Rules &gt; Create. Select the <code>Empty rule</code> template. Provide a meaningful name like <code>Group claims</code> and replace the Script content with the following.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>function(user, context, callback) {
  user.preferred_username = user.email;
  const roles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

  function prepareCustomClaimKey(claim) {
    return `https://www.jhipster.tech/${claim}`;
  }

  const rolesClaim = prepareCustomClaimKey('roles');

  if (context.idToken) {
    context.idToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  if (context.accessToken) {
    context.accessToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This code is adding the user’s roles to a custom claim (prefixed with <code>https://www.jhipster.tech/roles</code>). Click Save changes to continue.</p>

 Run your native JHipster app 
 
<p>After you’ve built your app, it will be available in <code>target/native-executable</code>. Start Keycloak or source your Okta/Auth0 settings. Then, run the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run ci:e2e:prepare # start docker dependencies
./target/native-executable</code> 
 
 
 
<p>It should start in under a second!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 What does the JHipster Native blueprint do? 
 
 
<p>The JHipster Native plugin integrates Spring Native into a JHipster project based on <a href="https://github.com/mraible/spring-native-examples#readme">findings from the research by Josh Long and me</a>. I documented our findings in September and December 2021.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Sep 30, 2021: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-matt-raible/">JHipster Works with Spring Native!</a></p>
 
 
<p>Dec 14, 2021: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-part-2-matt-raible/">JHipster works with Spring Native, Part 2!</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The unexpected thing is, one of the hardest problems we had to solve was with JPA and relationships. In JVM mode, everything worked fine. When running in native mode, <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/17794">there was an exception</a>. The solution took days to figure out, but was quite simple to fix: I just had to add a type hint for <code>java.util.HashSet.class</code>. 🤯</p>
 
 
<p>During this experience, I was surprised to find that Spring Native <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/issues/465">doesn’t support caching yet</a>. I believe this support will be added by the community soon. In the meantime, if you’re looking to start/stop your infra as fast as possible, you probably don’t care about caching. Caching is made for long-lived, JVM-strong, JVM-loving apps.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What’s the performance like? 
 
 
<p>The native binary starts in just over 500ms (581ms) on my 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM.</p>
 
 
<p>If I start it in JVM mode with Maven, it takes just under five seconds.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>As far as build time goes, Spring Native says:</p>
 
 
 
 Finished generating 'native-executable' in 3m 10s. 
 
 
 
<p>If I build a Docker image with the native binary:</p>
 
 
 
 mvn spring-boot:build-image -Pprod 
 
 
 
<p>It takes a while the first time:</p>
 
 
 
 Total time:  06:30 min 
 
 
 
<p>And it’s slightly faster the second time:</p>
 
 
 
 Total time:  06:18 min 
 
 
 
<p>The amount of memory used after starting: <code>180 MB</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The amount of memory used after running <code>npm run e2e</code>: <code>196 MB</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, here’s the command I used to measure the amount of memory used:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color native | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)" MB";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>What about the M1 Max? That’s <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1494417051137585152">not an option yet</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2666#issuecomment-1057819284">could be in the next release of GraalVM</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn more about GraalVM and Spring Native 
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning how to make JHipster work with Spring Native and GraalVM. It’s still a work-in-progress. Startup time isn’t the end-all-be-all metric, but it is important in a serverless environment.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example/tree/spring-native">@oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example repository</a>. The source for the JHipster Native blueprint is in the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-native">@jhipster/generator-jhipster-native repository</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster also has Micronaut and Quarkus blueprints. However, their native support is currently a work-in-progress. I hope to help improve them in the next few months.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-quarkus/issues/222">JHipster Quarkus can’t build native image</a></p>

<p>One of Australia’s biggest card manufacturers is teaming up with <a href="https://www.zwipe.com/">Zwipe</a> to deliver biometric cards. <a href="https://www.placard.com.au/">Placard</a> already delivers more than 100 million cards on an annual basis.</p>



  



<p>In terms of utility, Placard expressed particular interest in the Zwipe Pay platform, which will be deployed in next-generation biometric payment cards. However, the company is active in a number of different sectors, and eventually hopes to use biometric technologies to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-modifies-biometric-payment-cards-access-control-applications-120101/">strengthen card security</a> across its entire portfolio, which includes government identification cards and loyalty cards for retail and hospitality programs.</p>



<p>Having said that, biometric payment cards will still be the first point of focus for the company. Placard’s cards are certified for use with every major card scheme, and it is hoping to move forward with its first pilots with card issuers in the second quarter of the year. It will then proceed with the commercial rollout of biometric payment cards if those trials go well. In addition to providing the biometric technology, Zwipe will provide ongoing technical support services and business advice to help Placard refine its go-to-market strategy.</p>



<p>“The biometric solution provided by Zwipe is the ideal platform for the next generation of payment cards,” said&nbsp;Placard Sales &amp; Marketing GM Tess Barone. “We believe that highly secure touch-less payments and PIN-free cards create a very compelling proposition for consumers and that our collaboration with Zwipe will provide differentiation and meaningful commercial value to our customers.”</p>



<p>“There is a clear growing interest in biometric payment cards globally and Placard will be vital in accelerating the deployment of biometric payment cards to banks and consumers,” added Zwipe CEO André Løvestam. “Zwipe will be supporting Placard’s clients during their launch processes to ensure the best customer experience and successful commercialization.”</p>



<p>Zwipe believes that 2022 will be a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-anticipates-breakthrough-year-2022-010302/">breakthrough year for biometric payment cards</a>, and has already partnered with India’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-provide-biometric-cards-indias-skarn-robotics-022306/">sKarn RoboticS</a>, Malaysia’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/modularsoft-partners-with-zwipe-bring-biometric-cards-malaysia-022801/">Modularsoft</a>, and the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/central-bank-iraq-encourages-banks-work-zwipe-712103/">Central Bank of Iraq</a> in the past two months alone. Placard, meanwhile, was <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/hid-global-acquires-australian-card-maker-810011/">acquired by HID Global</a> back in 2019.</p>

<p>The largest airport in Jordan is the latest major transportation hub to introduce streamlined passenger processing technologies, having begun its trial of a new biometric solution.</p>



  



<p>In collaboration with Royal Jordanian Airlines, Queen Alia International Airport (QAIA) in Amman is trialing facial recognition technology at self check-in kiosks and boarding gates for select Royal Jordanian flights to Istanbul, Turkey.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to try [a]&nbsp;biometric&nbsp;check-in solution that improves customer service, makes the flying experience more hassle free and ensures safer travel during the current pandemic,” said Royal Jordanian Airlines Vice Chairman and CEO, Samer Majali. “Our endeavour to make travellers’ airport experience as smooth and as safe as possible is made possible by our longstanding partnership with Airport International Group. It is with pride that we carry out our role of national carrier of Jordan, and connect it with the rest of the world.”</p>



<p>QAIA is the latest in what is a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iris-id-airport-applications-for-biometric-scanners-501173/">rapidly growing list</a> of airports throughout the world that are looking at the implementation of biometric solutions as a way to lure passengers back to a travel sector that has been devastated by the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/interview-nec-jason-van-sice-airport-biometrics-late-pandemic-501109/">ongoing COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Biometrics are being used at travel hubs to provide more touchless and hygienic experiences for passengers while also being utilized to expedite the flow of people through some of the most crowded and busy facilities in the world.</p>



<p>“With airports worldwide shifting towards such transformational technologies, we welcome the initiative of the pilot biometric solutions on select Royal Jordanian Airlines flights, at QAIA,” said Airport International Group CEO, Nicolas Claude. “As the operator of&nbsp;<a href="https://qaiairport.com/en/Pages/default.aspx">QAIA</a>, we are keen to assess the conditions for future deployment of such technologies at Jordan’s prime gateway to the world and remain up to speed on future travel requirements, so we can present to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.internationalairportreview.com/core_topic/passenger-experience/">passengers</a>&nbsp;a faster and more streamlined contactless journey.” </p>

<p>By now, you may have heard about the attack on <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>, the world’s largest NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace, that resulted in roughly $1.7 million worth of NFTs being stolen from users’ wallets. The apparent phishing scam took place on February 19th, and some OpenSea users fell prey to it. </p><p>OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer took to Twitter on the 19th to explain the details the company knew at that point, denying direct responsibility for the hack: “As far as we can tell, this is a phishing attack. We don’t believe it’s connected to the OpenSea website. It appears 32 users thus far have signed a malicious payload from an attacker, and some of their NFTs were stolen.” </p><p>OpenSea later revised the original estimate of 32 affected users to 17, and clarified that some of the NFTs had been returned to their rightful owners, though by <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/23/2390008/0/en/UPDATE-Mintable-Recovers-NFTs-Stolen-in-OpenSea-Exploit.html#:~:text=While%203%20NFTs%20have%20been%20recovered%20and%20will%20be%20returned%20by%20Mintable%2C%20over%20a%20million%20dollars%E2%80%99%20worth%20of%20NFTs%20remain%20lost">some reports</a> about $1 million in assets are still unrecovered. </p><p>This attack raises legitimate, valid questions about the security of web3 platforms that must be addressed if web3 is to survive &amp; reach mass adoption. </p><p>In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/31/success-of-web3-hinges-on-remedying-its-security-challenges/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAHZNOQLkIbdMdaa19R3WYV-CGFpWmBY396bPvAF5sATS6Fpai-XQSb_PU9ckqZSo7o8mdRCL5FB_UwqX-sV8upKGEDORCVQskmGwMaDbYTOcpaMeU6bzPU0-ZmE4M4gnidqN8ABfYAjx-9v5V7FOVPsUkq8l7EyZSKm5MwnU52i">TechCrunch article from January</a> titled “Success of web3 hinges on remedying its security challenges,” author Wei Lien Dang lays bare the security tradeoffs between Web 2.0 and web3: “The blockchain does not require actors to be trusted as in Web 2.0, but making updates to address security problems is harder. Users get to maintain control over their identities, but no intermediaries exist to provide recourse in the event of attacks or key compromises (e.g., how Web 2.0 providers can revert stolen funds or reset passwords). Wallets can still leak sensitive information like an Ethereum address – it’s still software, which is never perfect.” </p><p>Dang goes on to say “in Web 2.0, a substantial part of the security model is about response. In web3, where transactions cannot be changed once executed, mechanisms must be built in to verify if transactions should happen in the first place. In other words, security has to be exceptionally good at prevention.” </p><p>The TL;DR: because of the decentralized structure of web3, with users amassing more control of their identities, it’s crucial for platforms to focus on attack prevention, rather than solely on response, which is the previous Web 2.0 mode of handling security. </p><p>Web3 is growing in scope and popularity, and is no longer just a nascent movement populating quiet corners of the internet. As web3 gains momentum, underlying vulnerabilities are coming to light as malicious actors find ways to exploit them, as with the OpenSea attack. Vulnerabilities can stem from issues with authentication, key management, and a plain lack of user knowledge from which attackers can capitalize. Because transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, falling prey to an attack often has no positive resolution for victims. </p><p>Whether or not these security issues are just web3 growing pains or develop into larger, systemic problems remains to be seen. Much of that trajectory depends upon how developers, enterprises, and thought leaders in this space address these problems. Ultimately, if users who are educated enough in the web3 space to be buying NFTs fall for a sophisticated phishing attack, then how can we expect a nontechnical populous to participate in a new, decentralized web that’s supposed to be for everyone? </p><p>We want users to control their identities – to own their credentials, to stop trusting platforms with sensitive information – but enterprises, organizations, and individuals must take seriously the technological challenges posed by a growing web3 movement in order to fully realize that ideal end goal.</p><p>Fortunately, a community built largely by individuals with a passion for a decentralized digital landscape is addressing those vulnerabilities head-on. One such core challenge is privacy-preserving accountability, which NuID’s Trustless Authentication protocol provides. </p><p>In our next blog, we’ll define and explain how NuID provides privacy-preserving accountability to enterprises &amp; assists in furthering the goal of individuals’ self-sovereignty online. </p>

 Massachusetts has advanced its data privacy bill. 



<p></p>



<p>For the first time, the commonwealth has moved the Massachusetts Information Privacy Act beyond the committee stage.</p>



<p>As with all other states who have either passed data privacy legislation or have a proposed bill on the table, Massachusetts wants its citizens to have greater control over their personal information in the digital economy.</p>



<p>In progressing its bill, Massachusetts moves closer to California, Virginia, and Colorado, which have all passed state privacy legislation, although California’s updated law (<a href="https://www.caprivacy.org/cpra-text/">CPRA</a>), and the laws in&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0035">Virginia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2021a_190_signed.pdf">Colorado</a>, don’t take effect until 2023.&nbsp;All these laws restrict how businesses can collect and use the personal information of residents within the relevant state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>State-level pushes for comprehensive privacy bills have never looked stronger, with Maryland, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida and Alaska also&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/01/4-major-data-privacy-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">likely</a>&nbsp;to pass laws in 2022.</p>



<p>Of course, the states continue to act in the absence of a&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-federal-privacy-legislation-tracker/">federal privacy law</a>, which appears to remain a long way off, locked in partisan divisions over the detail.</p>



<p>But the goal remains a single federal privacy law with streamlined compliance obligations for business and clear rights for consumers. Recent discussions have looked at what might be the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/the-us-data-privacy-law-floor-what-deserves-basic-protections/">minimum protections</a>&nbsp;of a national law, and survey results show&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/75-of-americans-want-national-data-privacy-standards/">75%</a>&nbsp;of all Americans want some data privacy standards at the national level.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The organization that is ready to onboard pre-verified customers should pay attention to global identity networks.</p>
<p>The organization that is ready to provision, authenticate, authorize their employees, contractors, suppliers, etc. remotely and based on credentials verified by trusted service providers should pay attention to global identity networks.</p>
<p>The organization that is ready to manage identities with data minimization built into credential sharing, and transparent audit trails to check the validity of those credentials should pay attention to global identity networks.</p>
<p>Global identity networks propose a different way of identity management, one that operates on shared standards so that organizations <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity" title="Global identity networks">don’t need to repeat onboarding and verification</a> with the same individuals, and one with verification built in so that organizations don’t need to rely on trust. But this post isn’t to explain global identity networks; if you’re curious about that, this <a href="https://gainforum.org/GAINWhitePaper.pdf" title="GAINforum Whitepaper">white paper</a> is a great place to start.</p>
<p>The question to ask is how to leverage them? The short answer is to get involved: participate in any number of the organizations that are designing the technical and governance architectures. Contribute to the conversation, join a PoC or a pilot where it fits your requirements. Join the cause as long as it also helps achieve your identity management or digital transformation goals. Collaborate, because we all have something to gain.</p>
 Where to Begin 
<p>Knowing where to start can be difficult, but understanding a bit of the context in which global identity networks are developing is a good place to begin. As is typical with a blog post, this is an oversimplified explanation, but the regulatory environment in Europe could soon make big waves in the identity community and beyond, complimented by the long-standing action from numerous organizations.</p>
<p>For those of you that European-based, you certainly are aware of eIDAS. For those who are not, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG" title="EU Regulation on electronic identification">EU Regulation No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market</a> (most commonly referred to as eIDAS) sets out a common interoperability framework for Member States to accept the national eIDs and trust services (like electronic signatures) of other Member States to authenticate citizens when accessing public services. It may sound pretty dry, but it was a very clear attempt to facilitate a regional identity network, where identities could be issued by different identity providers and accepted by cross-border public services. In other words, eIDAS tried to facilitate a portable, reusable identity.</p>
 The Revision 
<p>Unfortunately, tried is an important word here. The uptake of eIDAS (facilitating cross-border acceptance of eIDs) is low relative to the technical capacity of states; <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1" title="eIDAS requlation requirements">only 15 of the 27 Member States</a> able to fulfil the regulation’s requirements of accepting the eIDs of other Member States for public services.</p>
<p>The EU Commission did reflect on the effectiveness of the regulation in its <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1" title="Impact Assessment">Impact Assessment</a>, and is developing a revision of it. There are multiple revision options being discussed, but thus far, the preferred option would establish a framework that provides citizens with optional use of a personal digital wallet. This could be used to access public and private services across EU borders. Provision of cross-border trust services is also part of the revision, but is out of scope for this post.</p>
 The Collaborative Action 
<p>Upping their digital identity game between 2014 up to the present (freshly 2022), EU Member States may now need to provide not only a digital identity to each of their citizens and residents, but also a personal digital wallet with which the individual can present to the public services of any other EU Member State. Why does a digital wallet make that big of a difference, and what does that have to do with you and global identity networks?</p>
<p>This could be a catalyst for reusable, portable identities in private industry, not just for public services. For consumer-facing businesses, that could mean inheriting a digital identity for a consumer at increasingly high assurance levels with even faster onboarding times and less responsibility for managing consumer data. It also means that onboarding your workforce digitally, and enabling other methods of high assurance authentication is available to more organizations. And it’s possible, even likely, that the basis of both consumer and workforce credentials would be based in an eID.</p>
<p>A digital identity wallet plays a big role in enabling the same individual to use their digital identity for multiple purposes. Instead of creating numerous accounts and being bound by usernames and passwords for each consumer and/or employee service, digital wallets put identity credentials that have been issued and verified by trusted parties into the hands of the individual to share as they please.</p>
<p>This concept starts to edge on decentralized identity, sometimes called self-sovereign identity (SSI). Digital wallets have been part of the decentralized identity conversation since the early days. But digital wallets are not exclusively the domain of decentralized identity, and benefits from the cooperation of many initiatives, organizations, and foundations that are globally working to promote interoperable, secure, privacy-centric, and functional identity standards for personal and enterprise use.</p>
<p>The following is just one example of how these identity networks and organizations are interconnected and support each other. There are many other projects besides identity wallets that tie these networks together. The order in which these organization are mentioned is arbitrary, and doesn’t denote any formal hierarchy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about" title="eIDAS Bridge">eIDAS Bridge</a> project which is supported by the European Commission and the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) is striving to make eIDAS available as a trust framework in the decentralized identity ecosystem. This means that there are now efforts from both sides of the spectrum: eIDAS may be revised to accept personal identity wallets and technological mechanisms such as zero-knowledge proofs and Verifiable Credentials. The European decentralized identity scene is also actively working to integrate eIDAS by enabling issuers to issue a VC “through” the eIDAS bridge to add additional trust to the credential.</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI" title="European Blockchain Services Infrastructure">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)</a>, also supported by the European Commission, Member States and Lichtenstein and Norway are aiming to establish a blockchain infrastructure for cross-border public services, and to enable information verification and trustworthy transactions. ESSIF and identity are a critical part of the first major pilot, which is to issue and exchange credentials between universities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleTechnologieprogramme/Sichere_Digitale_Identitaeten/Projekte_Umsetzungsphase/IDunion/IDunion.html" title="IDUnion">IDUnion</a> is also on the scene. It is a consortium of decentralized identity vendors and other influential partners, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and private investment. It is providing an open-source infrastructure to issue credentials, identify legal entities/natural persons/devices, and authenticate user and relying party. It aims to be available globally, but with governance remaining primarily European. It is designing its structure to align with the eIDAS revision, is compatible with <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html" title="GAIA-X">GAIA-X</a> (a European-based secure data infrastructure project), and is working to improve interoperability with EBSI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/" title="GLEIF">GLEIF</a> is also a part of this as a non-for-profit organization to manage the organizations who issue Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs). LEIs provide a unique identification for legal entities. It was establish to facilitate improved financial governance, but with potential for many other uses like authentication of relying parties, as is likely required in the eIDAS revision. GLEIF is part of Trust Over IP (ToIP), and uses ToIP’s governance framework and technology stack.</p>
<p><a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/" title="Trust Over IP">Trust Over IP</a> is an independent project hosted at the Linux Foundation and lays out the governance model and a trust framework to provide Internet-wide digital trust. The main use cases they address with this trust framework are passwordless authentication, long-term private digital connections, and verifiable origins. This is a governance stack to complement the (often decentralized) technology solutions that are being developed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/" title="Decentralized Identity Foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) aims to and ensure an open ecosystem and interoperability for decentralized identity. DIF has contributed DIDs, DID authentication, and many other standards, wallet security, and much more related to implementing decentralized identity. They and ToIP <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/w3cdidspec/" title="ToIP and DIDs">both support</a> the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification being advanced to an official W3C Recommendation.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops technical specifications and guidelines, of which the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" title="DID specification">DID specification</a> is a proposed recommendation. W3C carries the influence and respect to propose decentralized identity standards to the web community at large.</p>
<p>Though this took a turn into the decentralized world, the cooperation of other non-decentralized organizations are critical to test the interoperability and standards that are being developed. <a href="https://gainforum.org/" title="GAIN forum">The Global Assured Identities Network (GAIN)</a> proposes a federated identity network that would allow any organization to utilize verified identity attributes. It utilizes the international collaboration of financial institutions <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/deeper-dive-into-gain" title="Leverage trusted identities">to leverage the trusted identities</a> that are issued by those financial institutions for reuse in any industry.&nbsp;This project is in close collaboration with OpenID, Open Identity Exchange, the Cloud Signature Consortium, and GLEIF. While this is still in early stages of launch and development, GAIN may emerge as a parallel effort along with decentralized identity. Achieving interoperability can be achieved between such decentralized and federated global identity networks will be a monumental leap forward in enabling a verified, reusable identity for consumer, citizen, and workforce identity management.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cloudsignatureconsortium.org/" title="Cloud Signature Consortium">Cloud Signature Consortium</a> is working to establish a standard for secure and open cloud signatures, motivated in part by eIDAS goals to create a single digital EU market for trust services.</p>
<p>This is a very brief and simplified map of some of the most active organizations working for global identity networks. This is a space remarkably focused on collaboration and first enabling interoperability before striving for market share. Each organization has their own individual goals which dovetail with many of the goals of others, and even provide a critical technology or governance frameworks that help other organizations to achieve theirs.</p>

<p><a href="https://zwipe.com/">Zwipe</a> is continuing to build its biometric card business in the Middle East. The company has now partnered with the Qatar Fintech Hub to help raise awareness about biometric payment technologies amongst financial stakeholders in the country.</p>



  



<p>The end goal is to persuade more financial institutions in Qatar to integrate Zwipe Pay into their own biometric payment cards. The Qatar Fintech hub was established by Qatar Development Bank (QDB) in 2018, in an effort to modernize the country’s financial infrastructure and encourage collaboration both domestically and abroad. The Hub has relationships with leading FinTech developers in the UK, Turkey, Australia, and Singapore, and is hoping that those partnerships will help drive the growth of the country’s own Fintech ecosystem.</p>



<p>Biometric payments are expected to be a key component of that evolution. The Qatar Fintech Hub believes that Zwipe Pay will improve the in-store checkout experience with faster and more secure transactions. Its outreach efforts are expected to motivate more biometric card trials and launches in the years ahead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We believe this collaboration will further accelerate the adoption of Zwipe Pay enabled biometric payment cards among fintechs, issuers, processors and consumers,” said Zwipe <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-appoints-mena-gm-teams-with-indias-masterline-74202105/">MENA General Manager Ramzi Saboury</a>. “Qatar is a core market for us in the MENA region and we are already engaging with issuers in the country to pilot Zwipe Pay and be amongst the first in MENA to deploy the next Gen biometric cards.”</p>



<p>“Our innovation programs have witnessed tremendous success since their launch, and we are extremely happy to incorporate biometrics now,” added QDB Executive Director Ibrahim Abdulaziz Al Mannai. “This collaboration will greatly enrich our technology competency and help Qatar to become a regional hub of fintech solutions, catering to the needs of the global market.”</p>



<p>Zwipe is currently preparing for a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/middle-east-bank-announces-biometric-card-pilot-with-zwipe-areeba-010602/">biometric card trial in the Levant region</a>, and the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/iraq-central-bank-endorses-zwipe-for-financial-innovation-401101/">Central Bank of Iraq</a> has also endorsed the technology for local financial institutions. <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-strengthens-middle-east-position-with-saudi-card-maker-811292/">GEPCOM</a>, <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/nymcard-zwipe-mena-partner-biometric-card-809131/">NymCard</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-gets-mena-distribution-partner-biometric-card-solution-76202103/">Middle East Payment Services</a> are some of Zwipe’s other clients in the Middle East.</p>

<p>A Colorado state Senate panel has advanced a bill that would dramatically limit the scope of public facial recognition programs in the state. Bill 22-113 would ban the use of facial recognition in schools until 2025, and create much more oversight for government and law enforcement agencies that want to use the technology.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, the bill states that the police cannot use facial recognition to establish probable cause, and cannot use facial recognition to create a record of someone who is engaged in actions (such as the right to assembly) that are guaranteed under the first amendment. They are also barred from using facial recognition to match someone to a police sketch, and must ask for permission before engaging in any real-time tracking activities.</p>



<p>On the government front, any department that wants to use facial recognition would need to file an accountability report that explains what technology they plan to use, and what they plan to use it for. Any decisions made with automated tech must be subject to human review, while the technology itself must be tested to make sure it is accurate.</p>



<p>The Bill then goes on to establish a new Task Force for the Consideration of Artificial Intelligence. The Task Force would be responsible for overseeing the use of facial recognition in the state, and would be expected to offer policy advice to help shape new facial recognition legislation in the future. For example, the state could allow facial recognition in schools with certain guardrails after the proposed restriction expires in 2025.</p>



<p>Colorado lawmakers stressed that they are not trying to ban facial recognition technology, and that the Bill is instead intended to ensure that facial recognition <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/rank-one-pushes-industry-led-code-conduct-ethical-use-facial-recognition-090901/">gets used in a safe and constructive fashion</a>. They expressed particular concern about the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-nist-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-algorithms-122401/">threat of racial bias</a>, noting that many facial recognition systems are less accurate when applied to people of color, and that the teams developing those systems often do not reflect the true diversity of the population.</p>



<p>“This is not about prohibition,” said Colorado State Senator Chris Hansen. “It’s really about carefully considering the use and making sure we’re getting the right results and have the human review.”</p>



<p>The Bill has the unanimous approval of the Senate panel, though it did face opposition from special interest groups during the committee phase. Law enforcement organizations believe that the bill is too restrictive, while the Security Industry Association spoke out against the ban in schools, and argued that the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sia-voices-opposition-baltimores-proposed-facial-recognition-ban-060403/">vague language</a> would discourage even valid uses of the technology. There is also some concern that the bill would curtail the operations of third-party testing facilities, which is notable since <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ibeta-accredited-fido-biometrics-certification-program-509106/">iBeta’s lab is located in Denver</a>.</p>



<p>The Colorado Task Force would meet every four months before dissolving in 2032. The Bill itself in keeping with the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/virginia-plans-relax-police-facial-recognition-ban-021401/">broader trend of facial recognition legislation</a> across the country.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fingerprints.com/">Fingerprint Cards</a> (FPC) has received Microsoft’s official stamp of approval. The tech giant has added FPC’s Match-on-Chip offering for PCs to its approved vendor list (AVL), which indicates that the fingerprint authentication solution meets the standards for Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security.</p>



  



<p>According to FPC, the AVL designation will allow the company to expand its enterprise PC business. The company’s fingerprint technology has already been featured in consumer PCs from <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpcs-pc-fingerprint-solution-makes-debut-new-xiaomi-laptop-022602/">Xiaomi</a>, Huawei, <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fingerprint-cards-sensor-integrated-honor-magicbook-v14-1072102/">HONOR</a>, and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/two-dell-laptop-series-feature-fpc-fingerprint-sensors-081208/">Dell</a>. However, enterprise PCs usually have stricter security standards, and often require a solution that can process a biometric match on the chip itself, without drawing on the rest of the device.</p>



<p>“In consumer PCs, biometric authentication is usually executed in the computer’s CPU (so-called Match-on-Host),” explained FPC Mobile, PC, and Access China President Ted Hansson. “In the Enterprise PC segment, it is much more common to use Match-on-Chip, where the biometric data is stored on a separate chip, providing an even higher level of security. Match-on-Chip fingerprint solutions command a higher average selling price (ASP) and currently account for approximately half of the market and growing.”</p>



<p>FPC launched its new <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-releases-new-pc-line-of-biometric-products-908114/">portfolio of biometric PC products</a> in August of 2020, and received its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/windows-pc-maker-orders-several-hundred-thousand-biometric-sensors-from-fpc-701071/">first volume orders</a> in early 2021. The company now provides sensors for three of the five largest Windows PC manufacturers, and indicated that it will be revealing the names of more high-profile clients sometime in the not-too-distant future.</p>



<p>Since unveiling its new product line, FPC predicted that <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fpc-expects-pcs-to-embrace-fingerprint-biometrics-909254/">two-thirds of all PC devices</a> will ship with a fingerprint sensor by 2026. The AVL announcement will presumably help the market move closer to that goal. In that regard, FPC has previously argued that fingerprint sensors make it easier for people to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-details-benefits-fingerprint-sensors-pcs-032202/">login to devices</a><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-details-benefits-fingerprint-sensors-pcs-032202/"> </a><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-details-benefits-fingerprint-sensors-pcs-032202/">and web applications</a>, while improving security with a truly passwordless alternative.</p>

 The Launch of the Ontology EVM Fund Makes $10 Million in ONT/ONG Available to Enable Expeditions <p>As Ontology community members, we have chosen a life of adventure where we push the boundaries of what is possible. We are pioneers, explorers, choosers of the road less travelled. Now, looking to fund our adventures and fuel our journeys into uncharted lands, Ontology has created a $10 million (ONT/ONG equivalent) EVM Fund. The fund, which has been launched in celebration of the recent release of Ontology’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aims to support Web3 developers building on Ontology.</p><p>We invite you to join us on what could be our greatest adventure to date, entering the Metaverse. Web3 will bring us together to game, invest, communicate, and innovate online. It will offer a world where we are self-sovereign and not simply a product which companies capitalize on by collecting our data. In the new era of the web, there can be a decentralized metaverse world where we have more control over our identity and our&nbsp;data.</p><p>Fueled by the new Ontology EVM Fund, we can make this vision a reality. We have made $10 million equivalent funding available to support suitable projects who are working towards creating an incredible Metaverse that is open and decentralized. Of course, success on a new planet is not only dependent upon finances. That is why further to the support offered by the Ontology EVM Fund, developers will benefit from a Fast, Accessible, and Secure public chain with a focus on Decentralized Identity and Data. Projects also benefit from the growing user base of <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, which already has over 800k users, and the flagship identity solution, <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a>, which has been created over 1.5 million times. Ontology offers projects the opportunity to achieve exposure by top level media outlets and the opportunity to join the crypto conversation with some of the leaders in the&nbsp;space.</p><p>We think of these projects as spacecrafts, the driving force behind a shared mission and the stable vessel that holds collective explorers together. If you are one of these projects/spacecrafts, bring your crew to join us on an adventure. We have landing platforms prepared on Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, and Mars. Our ground crew is waiting to welcome you with the resources you need. Simply check out below to see which planet best suits your&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Should you possess an adventurous spirit, but not yet own a spacecraft and team, then do not fear. We have space on our public spacecraft where you can put your skills to use and be rewarded for your endeavors. These flights take you to Mercury and to the Moon, where you can take part in Bug Bounties and Hackathons. See the details&nbsp;below.</p><p>So how can we support your adventurous spirit? What can we do to make our journey a success? What awaits you when you land on your planet of choice. Whilst we only have limited space available, each selected project will be eligible for rewards to help them succeed. See the landing and flight plans&nbsp;below.</p><p>We are going to the Metaverse. Are you coming with&nbsp;us?</p><p>Submit your application to join us on our journey by proposing on the <a href="https://buidl.ont.io/">Ontology Community Forum</a>.</p><p>Technical Reference</p><p>Links of tools and docs about the Ontology&nbsp;EVM:</p>  Ontology Bridge: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/testnet/">https://bridge.ont.io/testnet/</a>  Ontology Explorer: <a href="https://explorer.ont.io/testnet">https://explorer.ont.io/testnet</a>  EVM smart contract development doc: <a href="https://docs.ont.io/guides-and-tutorials/development-guides/smart-contract-dev/evm-contract">https://docs.ont.io/guides-and-tutorials/development-guides/smart-contract-dev/evm-contract</a>  Ontology EVM supported Web3 API: <a href="https://docs.ont.io/developer-tools/api/eth-web3-api">https://docs.ont.io/developer-tools/api/eth-web3-api</a>   Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Ontology Releases Ethereum Virtual Machine and Announces $10 Million Fund To Support Web3 Developers Building On&nbsp;Ontology <p>The EVM will increase interoperability and reduce migration costs for developers, allowing them to enter the Ontology ecosystem with lower gas fees and faster block production</p><p><a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a>, the project bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions, has today announced the release of its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Seamlessly connecting the Ontology and EVM-based ecosystems, it will increase cross-chain interoperability, allowing EVM-based blockchain developers to migrate easily across ecosystems and seamlessly construct applications on Ontology.</p><p>To celebrate the release, Ontology has also announced a $10 million USD (ONT/ONG equivalent) EVM Fund to support developers building Web3/Metaverse decentralized applications (dApps) on Ontology. As well as receiving investment and the potential to access Ontology’s state-of-the-art protocols and tools, participating projects can receive tech, marketing, and business development support. Ontology will receive equity/tokens in the projects, enabling the synergistic growth of its interoperable ecosystem across a diverse array of projects.</p><p>Ontology’s EVM will reduce migration costs for developers, allowing them to enter EVM-based ecosystems on the Ontology blockchain. This will enable lower gas fees, as the Ontology EVM uses ONG as the gas fee for on-chain services, which usually costs 0.05 ONG per transaction. Developers will also benefit from faster block production.</p><p>Ontology’s multi-virtual machines make it the most VM supported blockchain, including <a href="https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/neovm.html">NeoVM</a>, <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Wasm</a>VM and now <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM</a>. The latest virtual machine will help to connect thousands of developers building on Ethereum to the Ontology blockchain. These developers will be able to build rapidly with Ontology’s decentralized identity and data protocols.</p><p>As we move into the next iteration of the internet, decentralized identity solutions and privacy preserving technology are becoming increasingly important for the secure expansion of decentralized networks. Ontology’s EVM will facilitate the creation of privacy preserving technologies within a more mainstream developer group. These developers will be able to leverage <a href="https://onto.app/">ONTO</a> Wallet, the gateway for a seamless Web3 experience which has a base of 800K users, as well as <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a>, Ontology’s decentralized digital identity application which reached over 1.5 million users last&nbsp;year.</p><p>Commenting on the development Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, said: “As we migrate to Web3 we have an opportunity to create a safer, fairer, more decentralized internet. By launching our EVM, Ontology is contributing to this vision by increasing cross-chain interoperability, as well as expanding our decentralized identity solutions to mainstream developers within EVM-based ecosystems through our EVM Fund. The fund hopes to contribute to the creation of a decentralized, secure and fully interoperable metaverse. For this reason, it will put a specific focus on metaverse and Web3 projects. The Ethereum network is an essential connection for Ontology given its extensive support of smart contract creation and decentralized application development, not least its position as a leader within the DeFi space and its extensive portfolio of world class developers.”</p><p>The EVM will increase Ontology’s functionality by adding an Ethereum account system, Ethereum transaction types, and Web3 APIs. The existing Ontology chain native assets can be transferred to dApps on the EVM for circulation without redevelopment, allowing for the seamless continuity of Ontology’s ecosystem development.</p><p>Dr Kendall MAO, Chief Scientist at Ontology, said: “Since the completion of our EVM development in June last year, it has gone through rigorous checks to ensure that developers will experience a seamless, secure integration upon its release today. In September, we opened the EVM compatible public beta to developers across the world, as well as launching a bounty program in collaboration with renowned security experts, <a href="https://www.slowmist.com/en/">SlowMist</a>. Now fully audited, the machine will offer seamless interoperability to a host of new mainstream developers, as well as allowing them to enter the Ontology ecosystem with lower gas fees and faster block production.”</p><p>Any new or established dApp interested in the EVM Fund can apply and will be subject to evaluation from the Ontology community and team. Project submissions can be made through <a href="https://buidl.ont.io/">Ontology Community Forum</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 RapidLEI support now live for new Common Data File formats driven by ROC, enhancing legal entity reference data available within the Global LEI Index 
<p>LONDON, UK – 1 March 2022 – Today, <a href="https://rapidlei.com/">RapidLEI</a> announced a major platform update to support new Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) format standards, as set out by the Regulatory Oversight Committee (<a href="https://www.leiroc.org/">ROC</a>) and the Global LEI Foundation (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/">GLEIF</a>). All Local Operating Units (LOUs) are required to support the platform changes within the month of March.</p>
<p>RapidLEI is a Ubisecure service, and is the leading global LOU for LEI issuance and data quality. These achievements are largely due to RapidLEI’s pioneering automated LEI issuance API, and a partner network that spans the world.</p>
<p>The GLEIF requires LEIs to be reported according to Common Data File (CDF) formats, in order to standardise how LOUs report LEI and reference data. The ROC, which oversees the Global LEI System (GLEIS), recommended the new policies for updated CDF formats, enabling new information to be reported within the LEI records. As of 1st March 2022, these formats are now required by the GLEIF in order to ensure uninterrupted access to LEI data.</p>
<p>One of the most significant changes to the CDF formats is the inclusion of <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20181030-1.pdf">legal entity events</a>, such as mergers, acquisitions, or entity name changes. This enriches the information available about an entity, for example removing potential previous uncertainty around whether name changes were corrected mistakes or intended alterations.</p>
<p>Another substantial change is the ability to report on complex groupings of entities – particularly <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20190520-1.pdf">fund relationships</a> and <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20201229.pdf">government entities</a>, which can both form composite networks. Entities will now be able to report beyond just parent companies, to provide information around relationships and structures.</p>
<p>Other new data offered in the updated formats include further available entity categories, resulting in fewer blank category entries, and foundation date, which will facilitate record de-duplication.</p>
<p>Steve Roylance, Senior VP Identity Services at RapidLEI and Ubisecure, said, “Since the LEI is primarily intended to increase transparency in financial transactions, the information available in the new CDF formats is valuable in enhancing that transparency further. RapidLEI is committed to GLEIF’s vision of legal entity identification enabling trusted business, so we’re excited to support these enhancements to the Global LEI System and the additional benefits they will bring to organisation identity use cases.”</p>
<p>Most of the new information will be added to the GLEIS when renewing, importing, or creating new LEIs from this point onwards. As LEIs are renewed on a yearly basis, the GLEIF anticipates a period of up to one year for the GLEIS to be fully populated with the new data.</p>

<p>Paul Kohlhaas, the co-founder of Molecule Protocol and co-author of VitaDAO on longevity research and the role of decentralization in&nbsp;science.</p><p>In this episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/voices-of-the-data-economy-learn-about/id1506212617">Voices of the Data Economy, </a>we spoke to Paul Kohlhaas, co-founder of <a href="https://www.molecule.to/">Molecule Protocol</a> and co-author of <a href="https://www.vitadao.com/">VitaDAO.</a> ​​VitaDAO is a community-owned collective funding early-stage longevity research. Paul Kohlhaas is an entrepreneur and economist with a passion for open-source utility networks. His drive for pharmaceutical innovation led him to found Molecule–a networked marketplace that enables the distributed R&amp;D and funding of new chemical intellectual property. In a chat with us, he spoke about the need for longevity research, IP-NFTs, DeSci, and more. Below are edited excerpts of the&nbsp;episode.</p><p>Why invest in longevity research and how can DAOs add&nbsp;value?</p><p>Longevity research and longevity therapeutics are the final frontiers of medicine. If we can stop the genetic ageing process in our body, we can also stop the onset of many diseases ranging from cancer to age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s. This would mean saving an enormous amount of cost across society. Developing longevity therapeutics is about how high medical costs typically associated with age can be&nbsp;reduced.</p><p>Most of the medical costs associated with a person’s life, typically happen in the last two to three years of their lifespan. Through the onset of age-related diseases, be cardiovascular disease or tumours developing in your body, or even Alzheimer’s, the question remains — could we offset the onset of those diseases by 10–20 years? The goal wouldn’t be to live up to the age of 150 but to have the same decline that we know today where one can’t move as fast anymore. How can we have a more productive and happy end of&nbsp;life?</p><blockquote>“Most longevity research that we know, is being funded by billionaires today. Longevity therapeutics haven’t really been in the purview of a pharma company and the reason for that is that aging is not considered a disease. If you want to develop a pharmaceutical or medicine and you want to take it through the classical pharmaceutical development pipeline — what you’re developing has to be considered a disease by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, or by the EMA (European Medicine Agency). However, aging has been in this weird field, where if you essentially develop a medicine that would prevent people from getting a disease, its not considered a treatable disease. This may actually change in the&nbsp;future.”</blockquote><p>There’s also a blossoming venture capital industry that is only focused on supporting biotech companies and researchers that are working on developing longevity therapeutics.</p><blockquote>“Even though there is a large research community for longevity, I think it’s been quite difficult for the general public to participate in that and to actually get involved. The biotech field always has this area of secrecy around it. Looking at it from the lens of a DAO, or a decentralized community, it can be really powerful in democratizing access to research and also democratizing involvement in the therapeutics that have been developed. It can avoid the risk of developing aging therapeutics in a monopolized way.”</blockquote><p>The ownership of IP in pharma and the role of blockchain</p><p>A large pharmaceutical company only has a few things from an asset perspective. It’s based on their intellectual property portfolios in the form of patents. It takes quite a long time to get a new medication onto the market. Once you have it on the market, there’s a long funnel, and it typically starts in academia in small research laboratories, where a researcher has an idea to treat new cancer therapeutically and begins on a path of obtaining funding to prove her thesis and drug development.</p><p>The other component of drug development is data production. Throughout the pharmaceutical development process, you need different entities that essentially finance data production. In return, you are distributing ownership of the IP gradually as you move along. Today, distributing ownership in the IP really happens through equity. Let’s say this researcher decides to create a biotech company and obtains some venture capital funding. The biotech company might file for a patent, and probably then a series of new discoveries will need more financing to begin researching and producing data about this IP. Those companies grow and move along, and typically at some point are acquired by a biopharmaceutical company. Typically the VCs that finance these companies are also backed by pharma companies.</p><blockquote>“The problem starts in a small lab in an academic institution and then goes all the way to these large companies. The IP essentially says, ‘Hey, here’s a new molecule, and it could be a viable cure for this disease, and then you produce data to solidify that thesis. The problem with that is that IP today in the form that it works is essentially a monopoly and if we contain IP within companies, those companies only have an incentive to show positive data. For example, if I’m a company backed by venture capital firms with a certain valuation — we only show positive data about this drug. At the point where a pharma company would then be interested in purchasing the IP or purchasing the biotech company. I don’t have an obligation to show you the negative data, I will only show you the positive data to learn so and so we could have run 50 studies on this on a particular drug or the IP and only two of them work. So 48 didn’t work, two of them work and one of them is maybe kind of inconclusive. So we’ll only show you the positive data. And then let’s say, this acid, this company, or this IP is now purchased, it goes into a pharma company. And the pharma company invests now, another says they purchased the company for $100 million.”</blockquote><p>What are IP&nbsp;NFTs?</p><p>The problem is the monopolization of IP and how we share data essentially creates a lot of inefficiencies in this entire drug development process.</p><blockquote>“We’ve been working on it in Molecule protocol and VitaDAO is really our first organization that has fully vilified that thesis and proven that the model could work. We’re essentially saying that we move IP out of these centralized organizations and move the IP into a more open structure where essentially fundraising around the IP is not tied to an individual organization, but you can distribute ownership to multiple participants. And those participants can now move in and out of the IP ownership and confirm the IP in a more decentralized way.”</blockquote><p>NFTs can really represent pretty much anything. IP, by nature, is a construct, it’s completely virtual. It is, for example, a relationship between two companies. It’s a right that’s granted between two companies or rights granted by the government, in the form of a patent. However, over the past 30 to 40 years, the IP landscape hasn’t really evolved and it’s very hard to transact an IP. NFTs could be, let’s say, technology carriers for IP.<br>In some cases, the creators of art NFTs, specifically remove media ownership from them, so that you actually don’t have any rights. But in other cases, the rights to the artwork are fully encapsulated within the&nbsp;NFT.</p><blockquote>“We’re using the same technology to essentially attach on one side full legal rights to an underlying intellectual property asset, for example, the discovery of a new molecule — we’re attaching that to an NFT. But then on the other side, what we’re also attaching to the NFT are essentially all of the raw data assets that now come with this molecule.”</blockquote><p>So going back to the original example of a researcher at an academic institution — she can now attach the IP rights in her biotech company to an NFT. At the same time, also attach all of the raw data, let’s say, like the pre-clinical data, the studies that she’s running in the laboratory — she could attach that also to the NFT. The NFT encapsulates those IP rights and then the NFT can be purchased by cancer research staff. This cancer research by purchasing the NFT actually begins funding her research and her work. This way you could move the IP now into a decentralized community of other researchers, or scientists across the world of investors, and the funding community.</p><p>Fractional NFTs: The next interesting thing that VitaDAO is looking at doing is essentially taking those IP NFTs and then making them fractional again.<br>What does one mean by making NFTs fractional? This means essentially, now, you could create a million tokens of this NFT. And you could now open them up to community ownership. Say we need some additional research studies done on this particular drug that we’re looking at. If a researcher comes in and does them, then they get let’s say X amount of ownership in the NFT. You can also now create a public&nbsp;market.</p><p>The demand and supply dynamics of&nbsp;DeSci</p><p>There are biotech companies and biotech VCs and angels that work in different research areas, that are actively looking for IP constantly and then there are interesting researchers. To date, there’s no good way to transparently find and discover the IP where this research was discovered.</p><blockquote>“I think it’s very powerful to enable researchers to obtain funding in a seamless way but also to put them back in control. Through the systems and frameworks that we’re building, researchers have more control over what happens to the IP that they’re developing. The same actually goes for the universities that are involved in this. If a researcher is approached by a pharma company, the pharma company obviously has much more control over what’s going to happen next If they’re really interested in wanting to finance this. So Web3 in that sense levels the playing field making processes more transparent and more democratic.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>1.15–8.30: Why invest in longevity research?

<p>Pricing matters — it’s often one of the first things to consider when adopting a new&nbsp;product.</p><p>That’s why we value transparency not only when it comes to building Magic, but also iterating on pricing. Thanks to all of the helpful feedback from the community, today we’re excited to introduce new and improved pricing&nbsp;plans.</p><p>Since we launched metered pricing (based on logins) last summer, we heard from developers across different sized teams that this model made it harder to predict costs. With that in mind, our new pricing is based on monthly active users, and adds clarity to how you and your teams can make the most out of&nbsp;Magic.</p><p>Before we share more insight into why we’re updating pricing, let’s cover what’s&nbsp;new.</p><p>Note: if you’re an existing Magic customer, these new pricing plans won’t impact your account immediately (and we will grandfathering in&nbsp;perks!).</p> Our new&nbsp;plans <p>The changes to <a href="https://magic.link/pricing">Magic’s pricing</a> make it simple and straightforward to choose the plan that’s most tailored to your&nbsp;needs.</p> Builder plan <p>With Builder, you’ll get 1,000 free monthly active users and 100 free login text messages per month. This plan also gives you access to all login methods, access to all 20 <a href="https://magic.link/docs#blockchains">blockchains</a> to build a dApp, low-code login form, and User Settings, in addition to the ability to add a custom logo and&nbsp;theme.</p><p>For budding startups or indie devs diving into a fun hack project, the Builder plan is a great way to get started with Magic for&nbsp;free.</p><p>Want unlimited monthly active users and text messages? Easily upgrade from the dashboard; add your credit card to keep scaling worry-free. After the first 1,000 MAUs free every month, it’s $0.05 per additional MAU. Similarly, for SMS login, after the first 100 texts are free every month, <a href="https://magic.crisp.help/en/article/sms-pricing-1y7u2ck/?bust=1646078799953">market-rate</a> surcharges apply per&nbsp;text.</p> Enterprise plan <p>With Enterprise, you get everything in Builder, plus premium features: multi-factor auth, custom session length, custom email providers (SMTP), additional team seats, and priority support. Volume-based discounts make the Enterprise plan a great fit for customers serving over 20,000 monthly active users. Our Sales team will partner with you to discuss a custom pricing agreement.</p> The “why” behind these&nbsp;changes <p>From conversations with developers and teams of various sizes, we learned the pros and cons of the legacy pricing&nbsp;model.</p><p>As a result, we aimed to keep the “best of” and added key benefits:</p>  Free to get started — 1,000 MAUs free, no credit card&nbsp;required  Suits your needs — whether you’re an indie dev or a large organization  Pay as you grow — self-serve upgrade to unlimited MAUs and login text&nbsp;messages  Predictability — unlock volume-based pricing and custom pricing agreements   What you can&nbsp;expect <p>We are rolling out new pricing for new users on March 1,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>All existing Magic customers will remain on their current plans and will not need to take any action. Our aim is to make the migration as seamless as possible. Over the coming months, we’ll continue giving existing customers a heads-up on the perks that will be grandfathered in, plus the summer migration planned via email and in the Magic dashboard.</p><p>Have questions or input regarding the new plans? We’re all ears and more than happy to help. Contact <a href="https://magic.crisp.help/en/">Support</a> on our site&nbsp;anytime.</p><p>We can’t wait to see the dApps you&nbsp;build.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/new-pricing-based-on-monthly-active-users-733793b09aa3">New Pricing based on Monthly Active Users</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is a transcript of the conversation between Vinay Gupta and David Orban on 11th February 2022. You can see the full recording of the live stream&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBeCGtc0tOQ">here</a>.</p><p>David: Welcome to What is New in the World of Blockchain! My name is David Orban, I am Managing Advisor of Beyond Enterprises. We love bringing you thought leaders in this frontier of technology that — even though it is already 10 years old, and more — is still often misunderstood, both in what it stands for, how it aims to achieve its goals, and how it can benefit a diverse but inclusive set of people, organisations, enterprises, and which is so full of creativity and passion around people who come up with great new ideas, arguably often not picking the best acronyms or the best descriptors and labels for them. NFTs… I don’t even want to say what they stand for, for anyone who doesn’t already know, because saying that it stands for non-fungible tokens is just making things worse rather than making them&nbsp;better!</p><p>Today I am very happy to welcome our guest, because I have been following his work for many years. He has a diverse set of accomplishments, as well as current activities that have very interesting and potentially very important implications. So, let’s welcome Vinay&nbsp;Gupta!</p><p>Vinay: Hi, good to be here — good to talk to you again,&nbsp;David!</p><p>David: Thank you Vinay for being here with us! Rather than showing my name in the banners as an overlay, I am already showing your Twitter account, which is one of the best ways for people to get in touch with you. You have an active Twitter presence, with very interesting threads. As I was preparing for this episode, I just read the thread that you pinned to the top of your Twitter&nbsp;stream:</p><p>“It probably helps if I define it: here is <a href="https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1423247169725812737?s=20&amp;t=9Zhasdfr6qMh7cJS9RZtbg">my best short&nbsp;summary</a>.</p>  The human race is currently running the world like a death camp for poor humans, and particularly for the other species we farm or drive into extinction.  Fixing the situation is possible, but requires&nbsp;will.”  <blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1423247169725812737">@leashless</a></p></blockquote><p>So, there you go, it’s an important starting point. What brought you to where you are? And in particular, what brought you into the world of blockchain?</p><p>Vinay: My history goes back to the 1990s. I was involved very heavily in the kind of cypherpunk movement in the ’90s. My first year where 100% of my salary went through crypto cash was 1999, so ‘99/2000 I got a full year of salary in crypto cash. Then I did a little bit of work in the defence world after 9/11, specifically on crypto projects, both in the US and in the UK, specifically looking at how we could protect biometric data from being abused, so biometric privacy&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>After that, in 2014 I got interested in Bitcoin and I spent a lot of time talking about Bitcoin, and I came to the conclusion that Bitcoin’s biggest threat wasn’t the state but it was competitors that were more technologically sophisticated. So I was getting kind of attuned to what’s out there, and then I saw Ethereum, and it was like, “Ah, smart contracts!”. And I had been part of the community that was very interested in smart contracts conceptually, 10 years before Bitcoin was launched, way back in the kind of Nick Szabo early days of figuring that stuff out. The e-rights guys, so Mark Miller’s team… I’d been around all of that stuff conceptually for ages and ages — knew the names, read the papers — so when I saw something that was doing smart contracts, I’m like “Okay, that’s my bus, I’m going to get on there.” I joined the Ethereum team, became the release coordinator for the Ethereum launch in 2015, did a lot of the early communications work.</p><p>And now I’m basically implementing a bunch of the core concepts from the cypherpunk era in the 1990s, and implementing a lot of those core concepts on the blockchain, to bring the kind of full power of the cypherpunk vision to bear on the present. Because the smart contract is only a small piece of the cypherpunk vision.</p><p>David: And when you talk to people who are cautious, because they know deeply how important the mission is, and they are not driven by the hype of the moment, or the bear market of whatever period, and we both went through both stages many, many times in the history of Bitcoin… If you ask them how are things going, they will reply “So far so&nbsp;good.”</p><p>So, what do you think? Is the Bitcoin experiment beyond certain stages, where the kind of attackers that you mentioned could threaten it? That’s one question. And the second question is: is Ethereum, which is an experiment, right? It’s code, we found a lot of bugs, important ones too… We had a furious debate in the community, and, forked, hard-forked, rewound the block even… And then here we are, after a few years, Ethereum seems to be going, so far so good. So, how do you feel about the maturity of these two big, important projects?</p><p>Vinay: So, both of these projects are really showing their age, yeah? Bitcoin has become more and more and more well-understood, more and more people are using it, but not much has happened which is new in quite a while. It’s very, very mature, it’s very, very dug-in, it’s very kind of institutional and blue chip and all the rest of that stuff, but Bitcoin is beginning to look a lot like legacy systems. It’s big, it’s standard, everybody is using it, but it can’t solve most of the problems that people want to solve with it, without very, very complex layer-2 infrastructure, and we still don’t really have all of that stuff worked out quite&nbsp;right.</p><p>I mean, the innovation has kind of moved past Bitcoin, because the next… like, when you go from… however many Bitcoin users we have now, maybe 100 million, something like that? If you go from 100 million to a billion, all of the technology which will be used to get that population using Bitcoin will not be Bitcoin technology. It’ll be layer-2 systems, it will be credit card integration, it will be integration with Shopify, there will be all kinds of buildouts around that core system, and it will have to address keeping the transaction costs low, which basically means things like Lightning Network or something better. You know, somebody will figure out how to take optimistic rollups and port them back to Bitcoin, or something — I don’t know what they’re going to&nbsp;do.</p><p>So, that thing of when a technology gets to be so mature that all of the next steps are not that technology, they’re things around that technology, that’s a real sign that something is becoming very, very mainstream and heading into&nbsp;legacy.</p><p>And Ethereum’s problem is very simple, which is it has promised scaling forever, and it hasn’t scaled yet, and that’s really problematic. Ethereum needs to be fast, and I keep hearing it’s going to be fast, and it’s not fast yet, and that’s making huge amounts of room for things like Avalanche to come along. And Avalanche is here now, and it works just like Ethereum, but it’s fast. Okay, now what, you&nbsp;know.</p><p>David: We will probably go back to this. Because as we talk about Mattereum and what the project is doing these days, what your latest milestones and achievements are, we will have the opportunity of asking ourselves gas prices, and all of these fun questions, and potentially composability across multiple chains… Let’s go back there hopefully.</p><p>But, why don’t you tell me about Mattereum. How did it come about? What drove you to found it? What is its&nbsp;mission?</p><p>Vinay: Mattereum makes smart contracts legally enforceable. You take an event that happens on-chain — I pay you for something, or we exchange some token for some other token, something along these kind of lines — and Mattereum makes that transaction visible as a legal event in 160 countries. Somebody does something on-chain, you say, “Now you owe me something,” I take the proof that you owe me that thing in the form of a contract to court, and that court recognises the blockchain as a source of evidence, recognises blockchain transactions as valid, makes a ruling, and that ruling is enforceable in literally all of the countries that signed up to the 1958 New York Convention, which at this point is well over 160&nbsp;nations.</p><p>What we do with that legal enforcement capability is we make it possible to buy and sell physical assets on the blockchain: gold bars, fine art, collectibles… The biggest thing that we’ve done recently is we sold an <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/02/10/mattereum-sells-unique-historic-ring-as-an-ethereum-nft-warhol-up-next/">antique ring for&nbsp;$65,000</a>.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/02/10/mattereum-sells-unique-historic-ring-as-an-ethereum-nft-warhol-up-next/">Mattereum Sells $65,000 Unique Historic Ring As An Ethereum NFT, $200,000 Warhol Up Next</a></p><p>We’ve worked very closely with William Shatner, who is the actor who played Captain Kirk on Star Trek, there will be another collection from Mr Shatner coming up probably late Q1, early Q2… If you go to the <a href="https://mattereum.com/our-news/">News page on Mattereum.com</a>, this is an <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/">asset passport for a Warhol print of Alexander the Great</a> which is about to be sold… And these are NFTs for the physical goods: there is a vault, the picture of Alexander the Great is in the vault, it’s a Warhol print, and when you buy the NFT you get the legal right to take that object out of the vault and take it for your own. And you could potentially sell that NFT a number of times, before somebody decides that they want to take the physical delivery of&nbsp;that.</p><p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/">Mattereum Asset Passport: Alexander the Great</a></p><p>David: And how do you address what in the blockchain world is called the oracle problem? If the trust is in the smart contract, the trust stops where the smart contract ends, and interfaced with the physical world becomes the vulnerable attack&nbsp;surface.</p><p>Vinay: Yes. Let’s take a look at the <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/01_Identity/assets/out/certification-contract.html">warranties of the Warhol print</a>. The way that our system works is there are legal warranties attached to each item. You and I are going to do a trade, you make a legal guarantee that the object in the vault is one kilogram of gold, or a Warhol print. That legal guarantee attaches to the owner of the NFT. I buy the NFT, and what comes with the NFT is your legal guarantee, and there is a direct legal and financial relationship between us at that point, so we can now enforce the promises that you made on the blockchain, in the real world, against your physical&nbsp;assets.</p><p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/01_Identity/assets/out/certification-contract.html">Warranty Agreement</a></p><p>David: And in certain jurisdictions, common law jurisdictions, the proof of that is for a claim to be asserted against a broken warranty for example,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Vinay: Mm-hm.</p><p>David: Has this happened yet with a Mattereum claim?</p><p>Vinay: Not yet, no. We have tested it in moot. We’ve had a QC, which is the most senior class of lawyers in the UK — there are solicitors, barristers, and at the top of the pile are the QCs [Queen’s Counsel] — so we had a QC who chose to run a moot on a Mattereum contract and test the contract and make sure that it would work, and they did an enforceability check, and it is indeed enforceable.</p><p>We also worked very closely with the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce, which is a group constituted by the UK High Court and the UK Law Society in a partnership, and the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce has actually extended the roles of arbitration in the UK specifically for handling digital disputes under arbitration that involve blockchain property.</p><p>David: So these assessments raise the probability that were contract, the legal agreement broken, and the party suffering assert their claim in court, they would be able to win, they would be able to have the contract validated by the&nbsp;court.</p><p>Vinay: Yes. And remember that we’re going to private courts, not national courts. International arbitration is a convention, I mentioned this 1958 New York Convention. The international arbitration convention says that if you and I have a contract together, and we agree that if there is a dispute the judge will be a Swiss lawyer from one of the following five law firms, the 1958 Convention says that both of our countries will regard the resolution of that lawyer as if it had been made by a judge in our own country. What this gives is enormous legal force to these opt-in legal structures.</p><p>David: Jumping ahead 20 years… Because, once again, the trust ends at the court. Because if I have a judgement against another party, I have to be able to execute that judgement, right?</p><p>Vinay: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>David: So, are autonomous machines of some kind going to be triggered by court judgements, where for example the Swiss vault that holds the painting would open for me to pick it&nbsp;up?</p><p>Vinay: So, this is here now; this is not 20 years out. I mentioned that we had worked very closely with the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce on their new arbitration rules for digital assets. In Clause 11 of their guidance, it states that basically if the arbitrator of the case has the technical ability to make an award, so they can do something like take an escrow contract and decide which party will get the escrow, they’re legally empowered in the UK to do&nbsp;that.</p><p>So, when it comes to the process, both sides present the evidence, which is almost entirely or entirely on-chain. The arbitrator, who is a privately-appointed lawyer or barrister, who has excellent technical credentials as well as legal credentials, examines the evidence. They make a decision, and then they take the crypto key that they were given as part of they being kind of instantiated as the judge in this situation, and they use that crypto key to directly access the account which stores the value, and then they can award the escrow to one party or the other party. They can reissue an NFT, they can move the asset from one person to another person’s control, and they are fully legally insulated, you can’t sue them, because they’re acting under the Arbitration Act, which gives them legal indemnity, just like a&nbsp;judge.</p><p>So, what we’re attempting to do here is super-empower arbitrators. And arbitration law is the backbone of international business, it’s absolutely the backbone. Because if you are a French shipping company, and you’re commissioning repair work on one of your ships from a place in Vietnam, in all probability, neither party trusts the other country’s lawyer or the other country’s court, they’re always going to favour the person from their countries, so you pick a neutral third jurisdiction, which is usually London, and then the arbitration happens there. And that as an approach, it forms a kind of de-facto global jurisdiction in which commerce happens. And what we are doing is we are taking the de-facto global jurisdiction of the blockchain, and we’re attaching it to the de-facto global jurisdiction of the arbitration world, and connecting these two things together gives us a technologically-enhanced arbitration world, or it gives us a legally-enhanced blockchain world. It’s bringing two existing global systems together in a single unified&nbsp;whole.</p><p>David: Often the promise of blockchain is to lower the barriers to entry to some facet of the modern world, where too many people were excluded before, whether it is banking or international commerce, which are the traditional examples. And in this case, it would sound that rather than talking about a huge multinational shipping company on one side and a port of access worth billions of dollars on the other side having a dispute, there could be a lot of other things. And a lot of people, who would never have even thought about using arbitration as a process, now they will have access to it through the Mattereum platform potentially. Is that&nbsp;correct?</p><p>Vinay: Yeah, absolutely. Making arbitration cheap is dangerous, and it’s dangerous because unless the evidence is very strong, if you do cheap arbitration, you’re going to get kind of rapid decision-making on not-great cases. There are a lot of people out there that think that the objective is to make arbitration cheaper and cheaper and cheaper, and you do this by having less and less qualified people acting as judges… That kind of stuff eventually is just going to break the arbitration system, because the rulings will be of such low quality that the nation states will just change the rules and those people will no longer be allowed to arbitrate.</p><p>The only way that you could get cheap, high-quality arbitration is by having crystal-clear evidence-gathering every single step of the process, so that 99.9% of the time, you look at the data and you understand exactly what’s happening, and you know where to make the award. And to get there, we need a very deep, pervasive soaking of the blockchain into the transactional layer. When you ship a box by FedEx, FedEx isn’t publishing that data to chain. But in 20 years, when we talk about making these systems cheap, FedEx will put it into the chain. When you take a package from the door, there will be a blockchain transaction where you take legal custody of the package, and you’ll be able to open it right there in front of an app running on your phone, which will log the data directly to the chain in a way that makes it evidential. I open the package in front of my phone, my phone is running the court app, the court app records what happens when I open the box, and that’s seen as being legally-authoritative data-gathering. So, there’s a lot of infrastructure you have to build to get really high-quality evidence collection, before you can get into that kind of position.</p><p>David: 30 years ago my activities were already digital, but a little bit less digital than today, and I remember being fascinated by incoterms…</p><p>Vinay: Oh&nbsp;yes!</p><p>David: Which is the table of when the responsibility during a shipment goes from filling the ship, then getting to port, then unloading the goods, and really complex agreements around when one or the other party is responsible for the shipment. So, as you described, FedEx and my next-generation Alexa Ring doorbell documenting the on-chain custody and legal ownership of a good is supercharged, incontrovertible chain of evidence — that will be very, very interesting.</p><p>What role do custody or non-custody solutions play here? If I don’t hand over the private key, am I going to go to jail until I do? What’s going to be the solution for a non-custody system to be part of&nbsp;this?</p><p>Vinay: The answer to almost every question when it gets to crypto and the real world is escrow, escrow is where it’s at. Because, at the end of the day, we’re not going to see a world in which non-custodial wallets are accessible to court order, it’s never going to happen. So, if you and I are going to do a transaction, both parties have to have escrowed value bigger than the value of the transaction, and that value sits there, available for a litigator to come and claim, and when we both agree that the transaction was successfully done, then we release our escrows and everything opens up again. And it has to be an escrow on both ends of the deal. You can make the payment sit in escrow, but what if the damage done is greater than the payment? If you send me a part for my car and it blows up my engine, the part cost $200, and the engine damage is $6,800; we need to have the ability to have guarantees for more than the price of the payment going&nbsp;across.</p><p>So, you have $100,000 bond which sits there guaranteeing all of your trade, we do a bunch of transactions, I come along and say, “I want $6,800 of the settlement,” at that point immediately $6,800 is frozen. Then we go through the arbitration process, and at the end of that either the money is released, or it’s awarded to me. And I want to stress: that’s not 20 years out. The legal machinery for that came from the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce last year, we have implementations of the Mattereum system that use it, and we have physical assets issued on that platform right&nbsp;now.</p><p>David: What do you see as your next challenges around the Mattereum? What will make your dreams come&nbsp;true?</p><p>Vinay: We’re doing real estate, the next big piece of news is we’re going to do the first real estate transactions. And once you can move real estate around on an NFT, like… Welcome to the 21st century — we’re here now! I mean, imagine the difference between the existing real estate systems and an NFT-based real estate system: you buy the NFT, you call the estate agent, you tell them you’re the new owner of the NFT, and you’re coming to the office to pick up the&nbsp;keys.</p><p>David: Yeah. [laughs]&nbsp;Yes.</p><p>Vinay: And you’re like “Really?!” and it’s like “Yeah, really! Really really.” We can do that right now, we’re in the late stages of actually shipping projects to do&nbsp;that.</p><p>David: That is fantastic. What kind of new markets will develop around the frictionless transactions of asset classes that before were much less&nbsp;liquid?</p><p>Vinay: Well, so here let’s talk about how to save the world with crypto. Because we know that the world’s main problem is environmental, and also poverty, these are the two big challenges. What we say is capitalism is extractive at one end and polluting on the other. So, what would it take to dramatically increase the efficiency at which goods circulate in society, to the point where we can hugely expand the amount of human welfare that we can create, for every unit of environmental damage that we do by existing?</p><p>I’ll give you an example: I have on my desk a pair of binoculars. Now, I have more than one pair of binoculars in my house, and only the pair on my desk ever really gets used. So if I had a liquid market for the other pair of binoculars that I own, I can immediately just take those binoculars, drop them into a box outside of my front door, and somebody would put some money in my bank account and I’d be set, and that would be one less pair of binoculars that the world has to manufacture. I can take the pair that I actually use to go and watch the deer in the backyard, and these are my binoculars; the other binoculars, they can just go roaming around and somebody else could buy them, and five or six other people could buy them, if the goods have liquidity.</p><p>The problem is that if I want to sell the other binoculars, as long as I don’t use them… If I want to sell them, it’s 10 times more work to sell them than the economic benefit to me getting a pair of binoculars sold for $16. Right? It just doesn’t&nbsp;help.</p><p>David: I remember being in love with the concept of eBay, and hating to use&nbsp;eBay.</p><p>Vinay: Exactly! So, let me find these&nbsp;guys…</p><p>David: I actually tried to convince my children, who were young at the time, that they should Tom-Sawyer-like use eBay, because it was so much fun! But they called my bluff, and they always refused! [laughter] I couldn’t incentivise them enough! They would still say, “Nah, it’s too much work!”&nbsp;[laughs]</p><p>Vinay: Exactly, exactly — there’s your&nbsp;problem!</p><p>So, here we have some Mattereum tags, and each one of these tags is a wallet on-chain. There is a cryptographic secret key on this tag, and when you beep it against your phone, it does a cryptographic signature to prove that this key is on this chip, but you can’t get the secret key off the chip. If I stick one of these tags onto the binoculars, now the binoculars have a digital ID, and we can take everything we know about these binoculars — manufacturer, brand, all the rest of that information — we can tie all of that stuff together, and immediately at that point we’ve got a digital identity. And when we come to sell this thing, we don’t have to go and take pictures of the thing and all the rest of that stuff; all we need is a third party to look at the binoculars, look at the asset passport that describes them, and says, “They still match the asset passport.” And then that third party puts the claim that these two things match into the asset passport as a new claim, and then at that point they’re free, they can be sold immediately. It’s literally somebody holds them up, checks they match, looks through them, beeps the tag, says, “Yeah, they’re exactly the same thing. I verify that all of this is still true,” and boom, you can now sell&nbsp;them.</p><p>David: Well, it sounds really, really wonderful. And, as you said, very healthy for the environment, very much towards accelerating the speed of money in the system, and without uselessly creating new gizmos or gadgets that we don’t&nbsp;need.</p><p>Vinay: And this is here today. This sounds like science fiction, but it’s not science fiction. I mean, we’ve got the tags right there, we literally just stick them onto things, and off you&nbsp;go.</p><p>So, that as an approach… Imagine what happens to the world when we’ve got correct specifications for everything! Because this asset passport thing has a bunch of machine-readable data in it! Remember all of that semantic Web&nbsp;stuff?</p><p>David: Well, Tim Berners-Lee used to call Web 3.0 something that is completely different from what Web 3.0 means today… But yeah, that was the semantic&nbsp;Web.</p><p>Vinay: Right, that was the semantic Web. So, instead of semantic Web [we have] semantic blockchain: we take the semantic Web data, we embed it in the asset passport, the asset passport is tied to the NFT, and the NFT is tied to the chip. And now, we scan the chip and we get semantic Web, machine-readable data about what the object is! Can you imagine what this is going to do to the&nbsp;world?!</p><p>David: Fantastic. One of the beautiful consequences of technology is that the way it develops is allowing groups of people and groups of companies or countries or continents to leapfrog. There was some industry report in the ’80s, saying that Africa will never have cell phones, because there isn’t enough copper in the world to lay down the cables. And obviously with smartphones, or mobile phones first, you stopped needing the cables, and Africa and India and China have phones&nbsp;aplenty.</p><p>Where do you think the leapfrogging opportunities are coming here? Because it would sound like the low-hanging fruit is in the UK, as you mentioned. And of course one of the largest real estate markets is New York, so why don’t we do real estate transactions with Mattereum on the blockchain in New York? But [I see] two problems, one is that, yes, it would sound easy, but actually incumbent interests will raise the bar against execution. [Problem number] two, the benefit accrues to establish the structures rather than spreading out more widely. So, do you have any examples where this kind of leapfrogging could uplift 100 million people here, 200 million people there, providing a wider spreading of the benefit of these technologies?</p><p>Vinay: I think that we can roughly quadruple the efficiency of global capitalism. I think we can take the cost per unit of human benefit… I think we can quarter the cost per unit of human benefit. Now, that’s a bold claim. But, how many owners should a thing have over its lifetime? One, two, three, four? If it’s four owners, then capitalism is now four times more efficient. Now, that doesn’t cover energy, it doesn’t cover services, but I’ll give you an example: I seem to have too many USB batteries. How did I wind up with too many? You kind of lose them when you’re on a trip, and you discover that they were still in your bag, but you’d already ordered another one, and that happens two or three times over five years, and now you’ve got like a swarm of the damn things! Somebody out there is buying a new one of these right now, even though this thing has probably been used less than 200 times. If we could certify how much volume is still left in this battery, I could sell this thing tomorrow&nbsp;morning.</p><p>Now, what happens to the world when every single thing that a rich person in America or Europe doesn’t need is sold on to somebody who’s less wealthy? What happens is we take the existing pool of goods, which currently covers about two billion rich people who are kind of in the stuff world. Then there’s another four-five billion people that aren’t really in the stuff world, they have barely enough stuff, and two billion people have too much stuff. So we’re just going to stick a price tag on every single thing that a person in the rich world no longer needs, and then we’re going to sell that. Some of that stuff is going to be sold to other people in the rich world, most of it is going to be sold to people in the developing world.</p><p>David: An alternative could be that rather than imitating uselessly the wasteful models that have been adopted in the developed world, communities will become wealthier through a different model, more along the lines of faster sharing of goods, and more effective and efficient sharing of goods, enabled by this technology.</p><p>Vinay: Yeah. You’ve been to India,&nbsp;right?</p><p>David: Yes.</p><p>Vinay: In India, practically everything that can be made out of stainless steel is made of stainless steel: caps, saucers, plates, trays… You know the stuff I’m talking about, this kind of stainless steel…</p><p>David: Yeah,&nbsp;yeah.</p><p>Vinay: How long does stainless steel last? Centuries. None of that stuff is ever going to be manufactured again, those things are permanently here. A stainless steel cup never wears out, and nobody throws it in the trash — it just lasts forever. This we call permafacture: we make things to last forever, because they’re going to be sold and sold and sold and sold. And the rule is this: the rule is a human being never buys anything they don’t intend to sell again. And if I buy something with the intention of selling it, I will take good care of it, I will buy good quality, I will make sure that it lasts, I’ll make sure that it can be repaired, I’ll make sure that it’s easy to test to verify that it functions, and a set of other attributes. And this permafacture approach, where you make sure that everything you buy you intend to sell again, means that whenever you stop using a thing, you execute the sale plan that you had when you bought it originally, and you get rid of&nbsp;it.</p><p>David: I am not very much into luxury goods, but one of my favourite advertisements in The Economist is a black-and-white photo of a father with a kid sailing, and you see the watch on the father, and the tagline says, “You never really own this watch; you just preserve it for the next generation.”</p><p>Vinay: And like that for everything that we manufacture!</p><p>David: [nods] Very good. We have someone following us from Kenya, David de Weerdt, and he actually refers to a meeting that he had with the Maasai elders, in Kenya and Tanzania, which of course have a deep, deep culture that deserves not only to be preserved but to be… Well, neither monetising and securitising, none of these labels are appropriate, but to… [to be] made an instrument of empowerment for that culture, that today is not sufficiently able to leverage it. And through the examples and the technologies of NFTs and others, they really could achieve recognition beyond what is happening today.</p><p>Vinay: Oh yeah. Let’s take an example: if I want to buy let’s say a Maasai stool, I want some Maasai furniture in my house, I want a Maasai stool, I’m going to buy one. The biggest obstacle I have is that if I try and buy a Maasai stool on eBay, what I’m going to get is a cheap knock-off that was made in some other country, by somebody in a furniture factory.</p><p>David: Yep, yep. And actually David is writing exactly that, he said, “Global brands make money using their [Maasai] cultural objects, knocking them&nbsp;off.”</p><p>Vinay: Right. This inability for those people to prove that they manufactured something, so that I only buy a genuine object made by a specific craftsman… We get back to these good old digital tags here. If the Maasai have these things and cell phones, you make an object, you embed this in the object at manufacturing, you scan the tag and verify the identity of the object before it goes into the sales pipe, and I buy the NFT, which means that I own the object, and now you ship it to me. And that as a&nbsp;process…</p><p>I mean, I can’t overstress how the shadow of fraud reduces our willingness to trade directly with people in the developing world. Because you don’t know when you buy something that you’re going to get something that was really made by the Maasai, you don’t know that you’re going to get something which works, you don’t know whether you’re going to be sold a knock-off… It breaks down the possibility of global peer-to-peer trade, because we don’t have global peer-to-peer trust. And if we have this global peer-to-peer trust, because the tags work, the object identification works, the payments work, the justice system works, you could get this trade sorted out… Anybody that has something to sell, and has cultural value to sell with that something, has the ability to do that successfully. And it sounds kind of dumb, but a good example of this is music: do you know the kind of Bedouin guitar bands that have come out of the&nbsp;Maghreb?</p><p>David: Yes, yes. Not deeply, but I have a friend of Tunisian origin, and he always shares that kind of music with&nbsp;me.</p><p>Vinay: Now, that musical genre is kind of right now understood to be the best guitar music in the world, that’s like… [These people are] musicians’ musicians, these people are fantastic! And they’ve managed to make enough of a jump to the world of copyright and branding and distribution that they’re doing tours, their music is on Spotify, their music is on YouTube, they’re making a living doing this stuff, because there is a strong-enough connection for copyrighted material to link it up at one end to their bank accounts, and link it at the other end to the media distribution machinery. As a result, that stuff has become an industry, they’re getting paid. They’re not getting paid as much as they should, no musician is getting paid what they should, but they’re getting&nbsp;paid.</p><p>That’s not happening for manufacturing. It’s not happening for clothing, it’s not happening for food, it’s not happening for furniture…</p><p>David: So, there are these waves of attention, and there are movements and labels, fair trade, and you go and buy fair trade coffee beans and fair trade trinkets of whatever kind. Even those are unable to deliver the value to the producers to the degree that they&nbsp;should?</p><p>Vinay: Well, it’s just a digital question. I mean, if you have an analogue fair trade system that was designed 40 years ago… You know, they do it for a category of goods: this thing was fair trade, okay, but there are, like, 4,000 of them. And I know fair trade as a standard, but I don’t know whether the standard is enforced properly… I have some&nbsp;doubts.</p><p>[But] if I can see a video of the person making the thing… I got the workshop, I got the camera, the camera films me making the thing, and then at the end of that process there’s a tag on the thing, and I beep it against the camera and it registers that video as the video of the thing being manufactured… Fair trade is my money goes directly into the digital wallet of the person that I just watched making the thing that I have in my house! You see what I’m saying? Radical transparency all the way down the manufacturing supply chain is possible now, we have the technology to do it, and this is how we clean up the enormous sort of environmental and social footprint of capitalism, is by making sure that people can see the consequences, right down to the original mining of the goods and the manufacturing of the goods — total transparency.</p><p>David: Let’s flip it around. Many countries need to upgrade their social contracts, and in this I include Western countries too, and there is a large difficulty in doing that. In some countries the work is even harder, it is not even “Oh, our representative democracy is broken, we must repair it,” [but rather] it is “Well, we have a dictatorship that kills people.” And for those of us who are active in blockchain, the issue of a self-sovereign identity, and a strong ability for privacy — at least pseudonymously, but in some circumstances anonymously — is seen as being crucial for supporting the kind of radical change that is needed in certain circumstances. And I’m not even talking about becoming or being a revolutionary; I am maybe even talking about something as simple as being gay, in a country where it is punished by death being gay. And those who have listened to us until now had this vision of everything being tagged, of everything being tracked, of every merchant having their reputation on-chain, every buyer having their reputation on chain… How do you see this world coexisting with the need for strong privacy, or even anonymity?</p><p>Vinay: Mm — good question, excellent question. The first thing is I absolutely do not believe in reputation systems in any form, at all. Surveillance capitalism doesn’t get better run as a network of 100 million cottages compared to a single big factory. Reputation is terrible, the core concept of reputation is terrible — it’s literally just prejudice as a&nbsp;service!</p><p>David: [laughs]</p><p>Vinay: Right? Because think of this situation: you are a black Uber driver in a racist suburb of a right-wing American city. The reputation system is constantly going to be used to punish you for being black, and nobody is ever going to be accountable, because they’re just marking you down — half a star, half a star, half a star, half a star — until you’re driven off the platform. Reputation is literally just prejudice as a service. We should never use reputation in any situation that we can possibly avoid it, and that’s almost everything.</p><p>What we do want is restitution.</p><p>David: I just googled “prejudice as a service”, and I don’t remember now what you call the result, when you search something and you only have one&nbsp;result…</p><p>Vinay: Oh&nbsp;wow!</p><p>David: Almost — six [results]!</p><p>Vinay: Six — goodness gracious!</p><p>David: Prejudice as a service has six results in&nbsp;Google!</p><p>Vinay: Wow! Well, it should be more popular now, because now people will know&nbsp;it!</p><p>So, prejudices… We don’t want that, right? What we want is not reputation; we want restitution. “I took a ride in this Uber, and the guy got totally lost, he wasn’t paying attention to the map on the screen, he thought he knew where he should go himself. As a result, I missed my flight and it cost me $1,200.” Restitution: somebody has to pay for the damage that I took, because somebody didn’t do their damn job. And that as a model… You and I engage in trade, there are funds set aside for restitution — on an insurance contract, drawn on an insurer — if something goes wrong in our transaction, if I claim on your insurance rather than claiming on your identity, I can take the money from your insurer without ever having to know who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>David: What is I think very interesting, and I will have to think about this more, is that the way that you describe this system, which creates a distance between the individual and the behaviour or the outcome, is a better basis for redeemable events, or the evolution of behaviours that are nudged towards desirable forms, than the current assumption, especially in social justice warrior circles, that once you failed their bar, you are irredeemable forever, there is no way that you will be able to do whatever — if you’re a comedian being cancelled, then it’s&nbsp;over.</p><p>Vinay: Yeah,&nbsp;yeah.</p><p>David: So, it is interesting, and I will have to think about it a little bit, but I will take this alternative of a restitution system rather than a reputation system — very good, thank you, thank you very&nbsp;much.</p><p>Vinay: And the critical thing about reputation and restitution is restitution doesn’t have to come from the person that screwed up. You’re my Uber driver, you get lost and I miss my flight and it’s a disaster, and you were doing something… It’s not like we hit traffic; you were ignoring the instructions from the robot, because you thought you knew better. Okay, we agree this is a problem. I claim restitution from Uber. “I bought this service from you, you’re going to pay me.” Now, at that point I never knew who you were: I don’t have your name, I don’t have your address, I don’t know anything about you. And your business relationship with Uber might be affected, but it might just be that you paid your insurance fees, because you put $6/month into a bucket, and that bucket is there to cover claims against drivers when something goes wrong. And that ability to think of this as being about restitution and being about insurance… As long as I know who your insurer is, I don’t need to know who you are. You give me a digital proof of insurance, and I can verify that you are insured… At that point, I’m much less worried about who you are, because I know if something goes wrong, the transaction is&nbsp;insured.</p><p>So, it’s not that we just take the existing systems of trade and we slap a layer of cryptography on top, and now we’ve got anonymous, unaccountable black markets, and everybody is running around causing trouble, and we have no way of catching anybody, and it’s a disaster. That’s not what we do. We change from reputation-based to restitution-based, we use digital proofs of insurance rather than digital proofs of identity, and we create a society which is fully accountable and also deeply anonymous.</p><p>David: Very good. As people go and visit Mattereum, ideally what kind of enquiries, or what kind of potential partnerships or customers or investors would you like to come banging on your digital&nbsp;door?</p><p>Vinay: Okay, let’s talk about investors first. We are about to do an A round. The objective is to raise $30–50 million, and what we will deliver for that — fingers-crossed, with a little bit of luck, this is not investment advice — is a company which is basically 10 times the size of Visa, and which is the large-scale guardian of global trade in the areas where we need reliable purchases, and we need accountability for all&nbsp;parties.</p><p>We’ve got the technology, we’ve figured out the hardware, we’ve figured out the software, we’ve figured out the legals, we’ve figured out the business arrangements, we’ve figured out the insurance, we have all of the parts of the machinery there, and we’re going to scale it. And we’re going to be throwing around real estate, we can already do gold bars up to $750,000 bars, we’ve worked with celebrities, we’ve done all kinds of different asset classes to demonstrate capability… We are about to turn the blockchain into the thing that everybody thought it was five years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>David: And is this an equity round or a token&nbsp;round?</p><p>Vinay: Equity and tokens. Accredited investors only, obviously.</p><p>David: And the vehicle is UK vehicle or US&nbsp;vehicle?</p><p>Vinay: UK&nbsp;vehicle.</p><p>David: It’s a UK vehicle. That’s great. So, what are you going to do with all that&nbsp;money?</p><p>Vinay: We’re going to build scale. We’re going to take the existing systems we have, we’re going to automate everything that we possibly can to get transaction costs down, and we’re just going to bring on more and more and more stuff to be bought and sold as&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>David: And what are the key markets that you will be concentrating on, or you will tackle first? You mentioned real estate. Is arts an important one, or it was more like an&nbsp;example?</p><p>Vinay: There are two big drivers for what we do. There are markets where the things are very expensive, and there are markets where there’s lots of uncertainty in the purchase. High value and high uncertainty is where we add most value. Because this system that I described with the warranties… You could take the risk on buying a house, and you could have 15 or 20 warranties from different people. “I’m the guy that did the roof, I’m the guy that did the plumbing, I’m the guy that installed the kitchen, I’m the person that manufactured the stove, I’m the person that did the bathroom…” All of those different people take legal responsibility for their part of the process, all of them carry insurance. When I buy the NFT for the house, when I move in, if anything is not as described in the house specification, I can make a claim. Imagine what that’s going to do to the real estate industry! Suddenly houses have specifications, and when something isn’t in spec you can get your money! So, there’s&nbsp;that.</p><p>Wine is a huge asset class. Wine is huge, because there’s two trillion dollars of wine in cellars right now. $400 billion of wine transactions in a year, and somewhere between 8–30% of the wine is fake, 8% at the bottom and 30% at the top. So, maybe $400 billion of fake&nbsp;wine?</p><p>David: Wow.</p><p>Vinay: Oh yeah. I mean, fake wine per year is tens of billions of dollars, it might even be $100 billion, so wine is&nbsp;huge.</p><p>Art is huge, and art is… The main place for art is actually new works. Imagine if every artist currently working had those kind of tags on everything that they manufacture — game-changing! No more fraud in art! Everything has been born… Right at the beginning of the process, it’s born digital, it’s tracked all the way through, we know exactly what’s happening… All the stuff about privacy of ownership by the way, this is where the zk-SNARKs come in. We are probably not going to build SNARK-based systems ourself, because we think the SNARK technology belongs in the platform rather than in the application. We might get dragged into it, but I’m not keen to get dragged into it… But I think SNARKs at the application layer is going to be fragile, SNARKs at the platform layer is going to be robust, so we really want to use platforms that have SNARKs for the identity&nbsp;layers.</p><p>So, I mentioned real estate, wine… Gold, we’re very interested in doing digital gold. We’ve done a little, and we’re going to do a lot more. Here’s the reason on digital gold: right now there’s about $200 billion in stablecoins, but stablecoin just means dollar coin, and dollar coin now means “you’re losing 5–8% of your money every year” coin. So the stablecoins have gone from being stable, to gradually, gradually shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking… There are no stablecoins now.</p><p>David: Yeah, they should be called dollar-pegged coins rather than&nbsp;stable.</p><p>Vinay: Right. And stable relative to the dollar was okay when the dollar had zero inflation; the dollar now has a lot of inflation. So, where do you go if you want a stable transaction that isn’t the dollar? The answer is not euros, the answer is not yen… The answer is gold. Because if you have a mix in your portfolio between Bitcoin and gold — or if you’re really paranoid, Bitcoin, dollars, and gold — at that point you can adjust your risk profile just by changing the ratio of dollars to gold to Bitcoin in your portfolio. And really, if you’re a purist, you don’t need dollars at all; you can just do gold and Bitcoin. But dollars, gold and Bitcoin… that gives you a tripod, and you just adjust your balance between those three things to get something that looks pretty stable to you. Well, at this point most of the people in crypto have dollars and Bitcoin; very few of them have gold. So we’re going to do an enormous amount of gold, to basically fill the gap opened up by dollar inflation in the crypto market. And the way that we do gold is very specific: to give excellent claims on specific gold bars with numbers on them, rather than just “grams of gold” in an account. Because how do you know the gold is&nbsp;there?</p><p>David: Are you a platform in the sense that can a developer interface with Mattereum, integrating it in their system and taking advantage of your infrastructure?</p><p>Vinay: So, it’s pretty much… You as an issuer of the NFT, you want to sell physical things, you come to us, we build the NFTs with you, we hand you the NFTs, and you take them to market. At that point it’s an ERC-721, it’s on OpenSea: you can plug it into DeFi, you can move it around, you could put it in escrow contracts, you could do all of the normal crypto stuff with it, because functionally it’s an ERC-721; it’s just connected to this enormous legal machinery behind it. So you kind of move around this little kind of ERC-721 thing, and what’s dragged behind it is this enormous legal machinery that makes it into this fully-enforceable magic&nbsp;widget.</p><p>David: What is the cost of the&nbsp;tags?</p><p>Vinay: The tags are dollars. The chip shortage has made them a little more expensive than they were, but… I mean, we’ve had quotes as low as $3–4/tag, but in very large quantity, with slightly less security than these guys [on his desk]; these guys are kind of unobtainum, because, frankly, we bought most of the world’s supply that was available when we got a chance, like we just… It was an emergency, and we just grabbed all the chips that we could at that window, so we’ve got a bunch of tags. But by the time the supply chain for those has settled down, it won’t be very expensive. And it’s only going to get cheaper every&nbsp;year.</p><p>David: Yes. You mentioned India, and of course you are… I don’t know, were you born in&nbsp;India?</p><p>Vinay: No, I was born in Scotland! So yeah, I’m Scottish. My father was a medical researcher who came across to study rats in the&nbsp;1970s.</p><p>David: But obviously you recognise, and hopefully I hope cherish your Indian&nbsp;roots…</p><p>Vinay: Oh yeah, yeah — I’m a massive hippy! [laughter]</p><p>David: Have you kept an eye on the recent announcement of India recognising cryptocurrencies, and… well, taxing them at&nbsp;30%…</p><p>Vinay: Yeah!&nbsp;[laughs]</p><p>David: Which to me says that now more than a billion people, and the government behind them, is extremely interested in the success of crypto, because it will become their largest source of&nbsp;income.</p><p>Vinay: “Bring us your tax dollars,” yeah. I mean, to be honest… The delicate thing with India is that it has so much scale, and such an ability to make a mess when it does the wrong thing. They rolled out this biometric system for payment of all of the welfare benefits and so on, and it’s been a privacy disaster! Because the state has sovereign authority over 1.4 billion people, and they’re pretty good at scaling things across their entire territory, and when they get it right it’s fantastic, and when they get it wrong it’s a disaster.</p><p>And India has such terrible problems with corruption. All of the places that were ruled by empires, corruption becomes a civic duty. If you are in a country, and you’re colonised and they’re extracting wealth from your country, everything which operates by the book and everything which is honest serves the imperial masters, and everything which is decadent and corrupt and hides money and steals from the tax man and so on, all of that stuff, while you were still under occupation, is a civic duty. And you see this in all of the countries which were heavily colonised.</p><p>David: And is there a time by which this habit that has been evidently ingrained and adopted… One would expect it has a half-life, or it kind of wanes, or it&nbsp;doesn’t?</p><p>Vinay: I mean, the Indians have had independence since, what was it,&nbsp;’48?</p><p>David: Yeah.</p><p>Vinay: Still one of the world’s most corrupt societies… Ireland has independence since… I don’t know when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic_of_Ireland_Act_1948">Irish independence</a> was — I want to say it was about the same time, maybe a little earlier [5] — ’28 maybe for Ireland… I should know this… Apologies to the Irish people, I should know it but I don’t! Ireland is still fabulously corrupt. Greece? Fabulously corrupt. South America? Fabulously corrupt.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic_of_Ireland_Act_1948">The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 - Wikipedia</a></p><p>David: And is the blockchain going to help with that at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Vinay: Well, this is the question. If the Indian adoption, and the general global adoption for blockchain takes the areas where things are reasonably clean, and gradually expands them in size, there’s a decent chance that it will be an anti-corruption technology. But if it’s taken too large too quickly, so that the blockchain penetrates the society faster than the society can become less corrupt, the prospect is that what we get is the blockchain is used as a fuel for corruption rather than as a cure for corruption. And that, to be fair, really kind of worries me. Because if you take a corrupt system and you just inject blockchain into it, now you have a corrupt system with a blockchain. Whereas if you take a relatively clean system, and you use the blockchain to clean it the rest of the way, and then gradually you scale it, maybe it’s possible to kind of widen the circle of light, until you’ve got quite a well-established sort of social contract, that this part of the system is not&nbsp;corrupt.</p><p>And this is the hope for Mattereum. I mean, we have a world-class anti-modern-slavery expert on board, we have a very good environmental leader, we’re currently in the process of onboarding a friend of mine who is going to take Elinor Ostrom’s work on the commons, and start figuring out how we apply Ostrom’s work… She won a Nobel Prize for commons management stuff. So we’re going to start applying Ostrom’s work to handle the circular economy aspect. We take the thing with the sticker, and it’s being sold, and it’s being moved around and around and around… This thing is now in some sense in a commons. And we take Ostrom’s work on governing commons, and we apply that to the circular economy, because how else would you run a circular&nbsp;economy?</p><p>David: Yes. Dominic is helping out: Ireland gained independence in 1922 — thank you Dominic!&nbsp;[5]</p><p>Vinay: ’22, ’22 — I lived in Ireland for a year, I ought to know&nbsp;that!</p><p>David: Vinay, this was really wonderful. And really, good luck with Mattereum! Even though you have already achieved a lot, the mission is so ambitious that still you have exponentially more in front of&nbsp;you…</p><p>Vinay: [slaps the battery and tags together] Practical solutions, practical solutions!</p><p>David: That’s right, that’s right — very good, very good! Your thinking of course is very deep as well, so I hope you will join us sometime in the future, to give us both an update on what is going on with Mattereum, as well as in the various implications. Because you are, as well as I, very much looking forward to see how blockchain delivers its promise to build a better&nbsp;world.</p><p>Vinay: Yeah.</p><p>David: Thank you, thank you very much for being with us&nbsp;today!</p><p>Vinay: Thank you David, and thank you everyone for watching!</p><p>David: Thank you for watching today’s episode of What is New in the World of Blockchain.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-is-new-in-the-world-of-blockchain-64b482e1f9d7">What is New in the World of Blockchain?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 ComplyDeFi: The Compliance SDK For DeFi Protocols 
<p>We are pleased to announce the release of the <a href="https://www.onchainid.com/complydefi">ComplyDeFi SDK</a>, an easy-to-integrate tool that enables Web3 developers to launch permissioned DeFi protocols.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			 Who is ComplyDeFi for?&nbsp; 
<p>DeFi protocols, Web3 applications and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) may use ComplyDeFi to “filter” their participants and accept/exclude certain types of users in order to apply compliance rules or launch new segmented business models.</p>
 Why is ComplyDeFi needed?&nbsp; 
<p>By linking Web3 applications with a self-sovereign identity system, ComplyDeFi opens an infinite number of use cases. Perhaps the biggest one would be to open DeFi to institutional investors, who require some compliance guarantees about the DeFi project owner and the other participants in the protocol.</p>
<p>Aave Arc, the institutional version of the well-known Automated Market Maker (AMM) DeFi protocol, is starting the movement to permissioned DeFi. Increasingly, DeFi protocols will choose to launch specific versions excluding retail investors to reach bigger investors, or at least will exclude underage or participants from trade embargoed countries, to make their ecosystem safer and targeted.</p>
<p>In addition, as DAOs grow, these organizations need to validate who can join them, participate in decision-making and take active roles. As a first step, it could be helpful to prove that the governance token holder is a human and not a robot.</p>
 How does ComplyDeFi work?&nbsp; 
<p>It provides a simple modifier, acting as a compliance layer, to link the decentralized identity system ONCHAINID to DeFi protocols:</p>
 
 Compliance &amp; segmentation:&nbsp;The DeFi protocol sets up criteria conditions for participants; the ComplyDeFi SDK will verify eligibility via users’ ONCHAINIDs. 
 Anonymous credentials:&nbsp;ONCHAINID owners share verifiable credentials to the DeFi protocol for eligibility check and the code returns yes or no. No actual information is shared, so users remain anonymous. 
 
<p>Here is an illustration explaining the user journey in permissioned DeFi protocols using ComplyDeFi:</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>As a result, while participants don’t know who they’re dealing with in detail, they can ensure that other participants are verified by trusted parties designated by the DeFi protocol (e.g. KYC providers, auditors, banks, etc.), opening the door for protocol owners to roll out multiple versions of protocols based on different business needs.</p>

 <p>Editor’s note: This article was <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/lawlab/2009/07/01/meta-currency-a-step-towards-the-rheonomy-by-eric-harris-braun/">originally published</a> in the Harvard Law Lab blog on 1 July 2009. In it, Eric gives his analysis of the problems we face — wealth inequity, injustice, ecological degradation, political discord — and argues that many of these problems are caused by the way the economy works. It separates our lives into two worlds, and it does a poor job of recognising the things that really matter.</p><p>Finally Eric suggests that, if we want to get out of this mess, we need to develop our ability to create new social patterns to replace the broken patterns that aren’t working for us. We don’t know what these patterns might be, but Eric is convinced that we can only discover them if we have the tools to express and practice them.</p><p>Why are we republishing this article now? Because we see that societal problems have increased since it was first published. Our struggle to thrive is becoming more challenging. The need for new social patterns is becoming more clear every day.</p><p>This is why we’re building Holochain. We believe that part of the solution is to build a software toolkit that lets people create, try, and evolve new social patterns.</p> <p>In her beautifully insightful book,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Economies-Jane-Jacobs/dp/0375702431#reader"> The Nature of Economies</a>, Jane Jacobs suggests that we must broaden our understanding of economics in the context of the flow processes of the natural world. Near the end of the book one of her characters asks the question, “What are economies for?” One of the other characters answers:</p><blockquote>“… To enable us to partake, in our own fashion, in a great universal flow”</blockquote><p>Another character answers with “Economies have a lot in common with language… like language, economic life permits us to develop cultures and multitudes of purposes… that’s its function which is most meaningful for us.”</p><p>What do we mean by economy when we say “the economy is strong / weak / growing / shrinking / healthy / in crisis”? We mean something social, an aggregate of many people interacting. But it’s not just individuals, it’s groups of people in the form of businesses, governments, unions, non-profits, etc, also interacting with each other and with individual people. We know, however, that we aren’t necessarily talking about the entire social organism — for when the economy falters, other aspects of the social organism, e.g., its arts and culture, may thrive. Or, the economy may flourish while we experience a marked drop in “civility” or an increase in other so-called “social problems”.</p><p>“Economy”, it seems, specifically refers to the body of the social organism — its “corporeal” aspect. This includes moving stuff around, building houses, growing food, transforming nature to its bodily needs, etc. Using this analogy, we might say that the mind of the social organism is everything else — its cultures, religions, arts, politics, and so on.</p><p>However, it would be a mistake to project this mind/body dualism onto our nascent understanding of the social organism, thereby forming a dis-integrative framework from the start. So it’s not just that the economy is disintegrating around us, it’s that the very word and concept of economy is dis-integrative!</p><p>Here, the two answers given by Jacob’s characters are so powerful. First, they help us shift our imaginations toward thinking from the point of view of the social organism; toward seeing that the “us” that partakes in the great universal flow, and the “us” that develops cultures and multitudes of purposes, is not the individuals of the social organism, but rather the social organism itself. Second, they suggest a perspective from which to perceive the organism as a unity: as a participant in the “great universal flow.” Third, they suggest how this participation is achieved: through language and expressive capacity.</p><p>Here are the two answers restated:</p><p>1) What we think of as economic life is actually the ability of the social organism as a whole to perceive and interact with the flows in which it is embedded.</p><p>2) This ability of the social organism depends on a coordinative expressive capacity.</p><p>So what is this “coordinative expressive capacity?” We are very familiar with its current form: money. Without money and its context in currencies, most of what we call the economy would collapse. However, with money in its current form, the economy also seems to be collapsing! Money, as a medium of exchange, a unit of measure, and a store of value, is the primary information system that coordinates the flows of goods and services through the economy.</p><p>If it cannot also properly coordinate the participation of the social organism in the greater flows of nature in which it is embedded, then the organism will not survive. Currently humanity is failing to coordinate the basic flows of inputs (fresh water, food, etc) it needs and outputs it produces (CO₂, waste, etc) in a way that will ensure its survival. But perhaps more importantly, seen from the perspective of coordinating flows, the social organism is failing miserably to allocate resources and human effort within itself in a way that yields a healthy harmonious entity. Money as an information-carrying “life-blood” does not rise to the challenges posed by the social organism that humanity has become.</p><p>So where do we go from here? What is needed is the development of a new expressive capacity, what could be called a meta-currency language that allows the social organism to organically develop and express formal information systems tailored to enabling and interacting with all the different types of flows that comprise it. We can still call these information systems currencies because they are about shaping flows, or currents. However, these currencies will take on a huge variety of new forms tailored to the kind of value that they are helping to build.</p><p>Note that this is not a call to “monetize” social wellbeing. Quite the opposite, it’s a call to understanding that money, as currently practiced, inherently destroys many forms of social wellbeing. But formal information systems can, in fact, build social wellbeing, and we are actually quite familiar with them: reputation tokens, formal achievement markers like grades/credits &amp; degrees, certification markers like USDA Organic, and many more.</p><p>But as things stand, we haven’t recognized that all of these formal information systems are related families in a larger coherent pattern. We don’t see this, because we don’t yet have the necessary expressive infrastructure, the language, and grammars that unify the structure and forms these information systems take.</p><p>The word “economy” comes from the Greek roots oikos (home) and nomos (management) = home management. Since what we really need is flow management, we can use the Greek root for flow “rheo” to declare that when we gain this new expressive capacity of a meta-currency language, then perhaps we can start talking about the Rheonomy instead of the Economy.</p> <p>Eric Harris-Braun wants the world to experience the new kinds of thriving and collective intelligence that come from deep, rich, ease-full collaboration. Thus he co-founded Holochain and Holo as a strategy to build Internet-based tooling and frameworks with underlying properties that naturally lead to empowered agency and social coherence (at the same time!). He looks forward to a Cambrian explosion of new types and instances of social organisms made possible by these kinds of tools.</p>

<p>In March 2022 Mydex CIC will be fifteen years old. We’ve had many ups and downs along the way but one thing has surprised us. We’ve found it difficult to recruiting the people we need for our particular work. It turns out they’re difficult to come&nbsp;by.</p><p>We’ve been thinking hard about this and we though there might be some value in sharing these thoughts. Trying to change the way a system works (as we are) isn’t easy. It requires a unique and special combination of mindset, skills, understandings and attitudes.</p> Mindsets <p>In our experience most people bring one of three core mindsets to the work they do (and they are often expected to display these mindsets by the organisations they work&nbsp;for).</p><p>Instrumental Many people are instrumental in their attitude towards work. They want to get as much out of it as they can, whether it’s salary, prospects, perks, whatever. Given that many employers are 100% instrumental in their attitudes towards employees, this is quite understandable. But it’s not for us. We are a mission-driven organisation and we need people committed to that&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Sentimental The other side of the instrumental coin is what you could term a sentimental one. Many people are first and foremost concerned with what should be. They want to make the world a better place, which is admirable. But sometimes, what comes with this impatience with ‘what is’, is an endless focus on what’s wrong — without really addressing, practically speaking, what to do about it. That’s also not for us. We’re about making real change happen, and that involves working out how to move from what is to what should&nbsp;be.</p><p>Impractical There’s another group of people (and organisations) who at first sight appear to provide a connection between these two. These are people focused on ‘policy’: on doing research and making recommendations about what needs to be done. In our experience however, most people with a ‘policy’ mindset rarely get involved in actually implementing the policies they prescribe. That’s left to other people. That’s also not for us. As a mission-driven organisation we’ve got lots of policies and we help develop many of them locally and nationally. But what we’re really concerned about is finding ways to make them actually happen. This requires a practical, determined focus on delivery: hard work, attention to detail, dedication and discipline.</p><p>So what we need is no-nonsense, hands-on, streetwise people — common sense problem-solvers able to work with other people to get things&nbsp;done.</p> Skills <p>To get things done in the real world you need the appropriate set of skills. Here, one of the problems we’ve wrestled with is what you might call ‘CV job title inflation’ where people (and organisations) say they can do a job or deliver outcomes but where (from our point of view) they fall short. Here are three examples.</p><p>Project management Project management is a universal requirement for every organisation that needs to organise and coordinate multiple activities to get things done. But in our experience there are two types of project manager. There are those who apply formulas (such as the use of certain tools and techniques, the need for certain processes) and take a tick box approach to their&nbsp;job.</p><p>Then there are others who display ferocious attention to detail (which requires unending discipline and sheer tenacity), unstoppable determination to get the job done, coupled with patience-of-a-saint diplomatic skills and the ability to read, manage, cajole and corral people into doing what they said they would do. This precious combination of skills is rare. But it’s what good project management is about, and is something we are constantly in need&nbsp;of.</p><p>Business development Many people think that ‘business development’ and ‘sales’ are the same thing. But they are not. Sales is about selling a pre-packaged, pre-defined product with known, fixed functions and features. Business development is something else entirely. It’s about listening really hard to what the other party wants and needs, and using a deep understanding of what the organisation can (and can’t) do, to craft something that is both creative and practical — that uses the organisation’s skills and capabilities to truly address the client’s&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Business development is, therefore, both incredibly creative (in forging a value-adding connection between the two sides’ circumstances and capabilities) and very disciplined, doing the hard listening, developing the deep understanding of your own organisation’s capabilities, and in scoping and scaling what’s needed and breaking it down into a practical, workable roadmap. As an organisation, Mydex may have a mission but we don’t want to employ missionaries who simply proselytise a vision. We need problem solvers focus determinedly on how to turn the vision into a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Software development In digital circles nowadays a hacking mindset is cool. Got a problem? Then write a new piece of code about it! That is the opposite to what we are doing, which is closer to infrastructure engineering — where every piece we build has to fit perfectly with every other piece, and where they need to work together continuously in a secure, scalable and resilient way. Engineering is a real discipline, including understanding and keeping to standards and processes which deliver high quality make-once-use-many-times outcomes. For many people brought up in a ‘hacking’ culture it’s very hard to make the transition to become a successful software development engineer.</p> Understanding <p>Mydex has been at the cutting edge of a society-changing innovation for 15 years now. Another thing we’ve discovered along the way is that many people think they know about personal data, but really, from our perspective, what they’ve imbibed is a series of myths and misunderstandings.</p><p>When we talk about things like personal data stores and citizen empowerment, we have developed a highly specific understanding of the issues, challenges and solutions that are needed — and this is often a far cry from what people assume we are saying. To work for an organisation like ours, people need to engage intellectually in a way that will almost certainly challenge their assumptions. They then need to learn how to use this intellectual engagement to practical, operational effect. Working for Mydex makes your head hurt. This leads us to the next defining feature of what a ‘good’ person looks like for&nbsp;us.</p> Attitude <p>If there is one thing we’ve learned in our 15 years it’s this. Yes. We’ve learned an awful lot. But there’s even more we still need to learn. We need people who really want to learn, and who want to learn in the right way — honestly, and with other people, as part of a team. Admitting the gaps in our knowledge, our errors and misunderstandings. Engaging with the facts, not playing politics. (Big egos are too proud to learn. Learning needs humility.)</p><p>To that extent, we don’t care how much of a novice a person may be. What matters is their willingness to learn — along with their determination to make a hands-on practical contribution.</p><p>There’s something else. As an organisation we are on a steep learning curve, and will be for a long time. This is not just one level of learning, but three levels at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>First, we are obsessed with delivery. Getting results. Demonstrating proof points. Getting the job done. We can’t abide flim-flam: we have to learn how to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Second, one of the drawbacks of results-obsessed organisations is that they become myopic. Along with our results obsession lies a deeper obsession: learning how to improve the ways in which we deliver results; developing skills and capabilities that enable us to deliver the right things at the right times, on time. (‘Make once, use many times’ is a must for us. Re-work is a&nbsp;killer.)</p><p>Finally, we are obsessed with continuous improvement, which includes continuously improving the ways in which we improve these skills and capabilities: improving the ways we&nbsp;improve.</p><p>Working at these three levels is hard. Sometimes it means working twice as hard to deliver a particular result, because you are attending to three things at the same time, not just one. But ultimately it’s the only way to really build momentum, and we need people who ‘get’ this and understand that this is what they are signing up for. The hard graft of breaking new&nbsp;ground.</p> Conclusion <p>The upshot is simple: we are always looking for people who are right for us. But not everyone is. If, on reading this, you think you might be right for us, why not get in touch? Let’s have a chat.

  <p>Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that supports many languages.  Initially, it supported only Ruby sites but now supports various languages, including JavaScript with Node.js.  Heroku also has Docker support so that you can deploy just about anything to it.</p>

<p>This tutorial will teach you how to build a small application using the Express framework for Node.js.  You will then secure that application using Okta by integrating the Okta OIDC middleware with your application.  Finally, you will learn how to deploy the application to Heroku, update your Okta application for your Heroku site, and set the environment variables for your app in Heroku.</p>

<p>This tutorial uses the following technologies but doesn’t require any prior experience:</p>

 
   <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> 
   A free <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (to handle your OAuth needs) 
   <a href="https://signup.heroku.com/">Heroku Account</a> 
   A <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">repository on GitHub</a> 
 

<p>Of course, if you want to just see the code feel free <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-node-heroku-app-example">to view it on GitHub</a>.</p>

 Create your Okta application 

<p>Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select node. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code> and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/node/create-okta-application/">Create a node App</a> for more information.</p>



 Create your Express application 

<p>Now it’s time to turn your attention to writing your application.  You will scaffold it using <code>express application generator</code>.  Open the folder where your application will live and run the following command:</p>

   <code>npx express-generator
</code>   

 Install your dependencies 

<p>Run the following command to install the default dependencies from express-generator:</p>

   <code>npm install
</code>   

<p>You will need to install some additional dependencies for your application.</p>

<p>First, you will add <code>dotenv</code> to house your sensitive and environment-specific information.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@16.0.0
</code>   

<p>Next, you will add Bootstrap.  You will use the Bootstrap libraries in your <code>jade</code> templates for writing the front end.  Bootstrap is a simple UI framework with many samples to help you develop HTML pages quickly.</p>

   <code>npm i bootstrap@5.1.3
</code>   

<p>You will need <code>oidc-middleware</code> from Okta to help secure your application.  This package makes integrating with Okta painless, quick, and secure.  You will be able to configure the middleware with your Okta application details and start securing your routes with only a few lines of code.  <code>express-session</code> is required when using the <code>oidc-middleware</code> so you will need to install that as well.</p>

   <code>npm i express-session@1.17.2
npm i @okta/oidc-middleware@4.3.0
</code>   

 Write your server code 

<p>The express-generator package does a great job of scaffolding a simple Node.js application.  For this tutorial, you can leave most of the application the way it is.  You will need to make a few changes, though.</p>

<p>Open <code>.okta.env</code> and add the following to the end of your file after your Okta configuration values:</p>

 <code>export APP_BASEURL="http://localhost:3000"
</code> 

<p>NOTE: Make sure that you add the <code>.okta.env</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>app.js</code> and replace the contents of the file with the following code:</p>

   <code>require('dotenv').config({ path: '.okta.env' })

var createError = require("http-errors");
var express = require("express");
var path = require("path");
var cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");
var logger = require("morgan");

var indexRouter = require("./routes/index");
var usersRouter = require("./routes/users");

const session = require("express-session");
const { ExpressOIDC } = require("@okta/oidc-middleware");

var app = express();

// session support is required to use ExpressOIDC
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "this should be secure",
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
  })
);

const { OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER, OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID, OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET, APP_BASEURL } = process.env;

const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
  issuer: OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER,
  client_id: OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret: OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET,
  appBaseUrl: APP_BASEURL,
  redirect_uri: `${APP_BASEURL}/authorization-code/callback`,
  scope: "openid profile",
});

// ExpressOIDC attaches handlers for the /login and /authorization-code/callback routes
app.use(oidc.router);

// view engine setup
app.set("views", path.join(__dirname, "views"));
app.set("view engine", "jade");

app.use(logger("dev"));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));

app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/node_modules/bootstrap/dist"));

app.use("/", indexRouter);
app.use("/users", usersRouter.userRoutes({ oidc: oidc }));

// catch 404 and forward to error handler
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  next(createError(404));
});

// error handler
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  // set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get("env") === "development" ? err : {};

  // render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render("error");
});

module.exports = app;
</code>   

<p>Most of this code is boilerplate from the express-generator—the notable addition is the configuration for the Okta OIDC.  First, you need to enable <code>dotenv</code> at the top of this file.  Next, configure the <code>express-session</code> and add it to your application.  Finally, you can configure your Okta OIDC middleware using the variables from <code>.env</code>.</p>

<p>Open your <code>routes/index.js</code> file and replace the contents of the file with the following code:</p>

   <code>var express = require("express");
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get("/", function (req, res, next) {
  res.render("index", { loggedIn: req.isAuthenticated() });
});

module.exports = router;
</code>   

<p>Here you added a property called <code>loggedIn</code> for the <code>index.jade</code> template to use. This property will help the view decide if it should display a <code>login</code> or <code>logout</code> button.  The rest of the home page will be static.</p>

<p>Open your <code>routes/users.js</code> file and replace the contents of the file with the following code:</p>

   <code>var express = require("express");
var router = express.Router();

function userRoutes(options) {
  const oidc = options.oidc;

  router.get("/", oidc.ensureAuthenticated(), function (req, res, next) {
    res.render("users/index", {
      loggedIn: true,
      title: "Express",
      user: req.userContext.userinfo,
    });
  });

  return router;
}

module.exports.userRoutes = userRoutes;
</code>   

<p>This file is where the magic from the Okta OIDC middleware shines.  You are passing in the <code>oidc.ensureAuthenticated</code> middleware in your route definition.  This function will reroute unauthenticated users to the login route you defined in your <code>app.js</code> file.  Because you didn’t explicitly set this parameter, it will direct the user to <code>/login</code> and trigger the authentication flow.  The model that is passed to the view here also contains some information about the user, which you’ll display when the user lands on this page.</p>

 Write your frontend code 

<p>Now you can write some client code.  By default, the express-generator sets up some views using <code>jade</code>.  Jade is a templating engine for Node.js.  The language incorporates some conditionals and flow controls to make templating HTML from your model easier.  The syntax is pretty simple to learn, and there are many HTML to jade converters out there.</p>

<p>Open the <code>layout.jade</code> file that was generated with your project and replace that code with the following:</p>

 <code>doctype html
html
  head
    title= title
    link(rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/style.css')
    link(rel='stylesheet' href='css/bootstrap.min.css')
    script(language='javascript' src='js/bootstrap.min.js')

  body
    .container
      header.d-flex.flex-wrap.justify-content-center.py-3.mb-4.border-bottom
        h5.d-flex.align-items-center.mb-3.mb-md-0.me-md-auto.text-dark.text-decoration-none 
          a(href="/") Home
        ul.nav.nav-pills
          if loggedIn
            li.nav-item 
              a(href="users").nav-link Profile
          li.nav-item
            if loggedIn
              form(action="logout" method="post")
                button(type="submit").nav-link.active Logout
            else 
              a(href="Users").nav-link.active Login

      block content
</code> 

<p>We have used the HTML elements; the classes are chained with a <code>.</code> between them. The attributes are bounded by parentheses.  This simple layout takes the <code>loggedIn</code> value from the server and determines if it should display a <code>login</code> or <code>logout</code> button.  It also conditionally shows a tab for the <code>Profile</code> page if the user is logged in.</p>

<p>You can add the profile page by creating a new folder called <code>users</code> in your <code>views</code> folder and adding a new file called <code>index.jade</code>.  Add the following code to it:</p>

 <code>extends ../layout

block content
  h1 Welcome #{user.name}
  P locale: #{user.locale}
  p UserName: #{user.preferred_username}
</code> 

<p>This page displays the user information that was retrieved from Okta when the user logged in.</p>

<p>Replace the code in <code>views/index.jade</code> with the following:</p>

 <code>extends layout

block content

<p>Make sure all your code is running and checked into your GitHub repository.  Navigate to your <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps">Heroku Dashboard</a>.  If this is your first time using Heroku you shouldn’t have any apps configured yet.  Click on New and then Create New App.  Name your app <code>okta-heroku-webapp-{yourUserName}</code> or another unique name you feel is appropriate.  Press Create App.</p>

<p>On the application page for your newly created app, find the Deployment Method section on the Deploy tab.  Click on GitHub and connect your Heroku account to your GitHub account.</p>

<p>Next, in the Connect to GitHub section, find the repository you created for this tutorial and press Connect.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can enable automatic deploys under Automatic deploys.  In addition, you can configure it to wait for CI to pass before deploying the application.  CI can be configured from your GitHub account.  This step isn’t strictly necessary for this tutorial, but it’s nice to see how this fits into the CI pipeline.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, under Manual Deploy choose the branch you wish to deploy and click Deploy Branch.  Wait a moment and you should receive a message from Heroku saying that your app was successfully deployed.</p>

<p>Click the view button to be taken to your application.  At this point, your application won’t be running because it isn’t configured correctly yet.  Make note of the URL of your site and then you’ll make a few changes.</p>

 Configure your environment variables 

<p>In your Heroku application click on Settings.  Find the section named <code>Config Vars</code> and click on Reveal Config Vars.  Here you will add the same key and value pairs from the <code>.okta.env</code> file you used locally.  You can see mine below with the values blurred out.</p>

<p></p>

 Configure your Okta application 

<p>Next, you will need to configure your Okta application to accept the new URL from Heroku.  Navigate to your application in the Okta admin dashboard and find the General Settings tab.  Click Edit.  Under the Login section add a value for Sign-in redirect URIs that matches your URI from your development settings, but replace <code>http://localhost:3000</code> with the URL from your Heroku application.  For example, my URI would be <code>https://okta-heroku-webapp-nfisher.herokuapp.com</code>.</p>

<p>Add a similar value for your Sign-out redirects URIs, which should just be your application’s home page from Heroku.</p>

<p>Now return to your application.  You should be able to log in and see your app running as expected.</p>

 Do more with Node and Heroku 

<p>Heroku is a great way to quickly and easily deploy a lightweight application that slides into your existing CI process.  Plus, it’s free to get started. Together with Express and Okta, you can quickly build secure web apps and deploy them to a modern platform.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you learned how to build an express application with the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html">express-generator</a> toolchain.  You then secured it with Okta.  Next, you learned how to create an application on Heroku, connect it to your GitHub repository and deploy your app from GitHub to Heroku.  Finally, you learned how to configure Heroku and Okta to work with each other.</p>

 The Shyft DAO is asking for members of the Shyft Network community to apply for one of the three available key signer positions via a formal campaign on&nbsp;Discord. <p>The Shyft Network DAO was officially <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/introducing-the-shyft-network-dao-a6c63b9dd18e">announced</a> this week and moved towards eventual formation with an official vote on Snapshot, where all DAO voting will occur. In the latest DAO resource blog on <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-network-dao-how-to-get-involved-66fb42e79ac4">how to get involved</a> in DAO activity, details were shared on the opportunity for Shyft community members to apply to become one of the three DAO community key signers who will join the four other signers from the Shyft Core and Shyft Federation. Key signers will all help contribute to the DAO’s mission to facilitate the perpetual advancement of the Shyft protocol to enable institutional blockchain adoption in compliance with local and global regulation without users’ sacrificing their data privacy or sovereignty.</p><p>A DAO proposal is currently in the process of being sent to the DAO forum, whereby the DAO will invite the Shyft community to elect three community members to join the four other key signers. Elected community members will serve for three months, at which time there will be another election. Elected Community members will be given authority whereby five out of seven signers will be required to execute transactions associated with the Shyft DAO treasury.</p><p>So, what’s next? Now, we’re asking YOU — members of the Shyft Network community — to apply for one of the three available key signer positions via a formal campaign on&nbsp;Discord.</p> Key Dates   We have until Tuesday, March 1, 12:00PM UTC to nominate, and vote on our community nominees. Please use <a href="https://forms.gle/MLCMPQg8gPyNyvcg8">this Google Forms</a> to submit nominations.  The top three nominees by number of individual votes on Discord will be entered into a Shyft DAO Improvement Proposal&nbsp;(SDIP).  On March 2, 2022, selected nominees will be sent to the Shyft DAO Forum; upon receiving five comments, the proposal will move to Snapshot for formal&nbsp;voting.   Campaign Details <p>Individual key community member campaigns will run for three&nbsp;days.</p><p>Regarding the expectations of DAO community key signers, it is prudent to enable participation of highly reputable members of the Shyft community with technical backgrounds, specifically in the DeFi space, to form the group of seven signers delegated with the task of signing for transactions associated with various grant fundings. The ideal signer is also someone who is able and interested in staying informed and involved in the Shyft&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Key signers are required to be abreast of Shyft DAO proposals and timely in their key signings. The expectation is that this will not be a considerable time commitment.</p><p>Interested candidates will be required to share on Discord why they would best represent the community regarding the above specifications and help the DAO accomplish its goals. This is your chance to promote yourself! Consider it something like a campaign speech. The Shyft DAO wants to hear about your technical background, experience as a supporter of Shyft’s mission, and what you would like to see from the DAO. The Shyft DAO urges all community members to be proactive and suggest candidates they believe are active, engaged, and represent the community best.</p><p>Stay connected on our <a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> channels for more information on the DAO Key Signer voting&nbsp;process.</p><p>Thanks for reading and your participation in this process. Good luck to all community members who plan to run for these positions!</p><p>— The Shyft&nbsp;DAO</p>

			 Adrian Gibas is a Full Stack Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p></p>
 Who are you? 
<p>I’m Adrian, Senior Full Stack Developer. I grew up in Melbourne where I completed a Bachelor of Computing degree then spent a couple of years running a one-man web development startup.</p>
<p>Soon the lure of earning pounds sterling on the contract market (and having my evenings and weekends back) drew me to London where I spent several years freelancing, before escaping the big city for the seaside town of Brighton. Finally I had enough of the UK altogether and moved to Barcelona, having fallen in love with the city after many visits and realising money isn’t as important as quality of life!</p>
 
 
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>My colleague and friend Max McKenzie told me about this awesome new company he’s working at and how they need more developers. The rest is history!</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It’s exciting to be working on the cutting edge of an emergent industry and it’s super interesting learning more each day about blockchain technology and DeFi. The best thing about working at Tokeny is the team! The Tokeny family is friendly, fun and professional. Everyone is at a senior level of expertise and there is a sense of camaraderie and pulling together when things get tough, while also enjoying the good times when we score wins.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Analog synthesizers. I’ve recently started building my own modular system using the Eurorack standard, which entails making my own unique music machine by purchasing and inter-connecting an eclectic mix of modules for generating and modulating sounds. It’s a highly addictive hobby; a wonderful combination of mad scientist engineering and creative musical experimentation.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Ability to travel through time, space and dimensions? Hmm tough question! More within the realm of the possible: Gain some success creating electronic art while somehow making the world a better place – like advocating innovative uses of solar energy by powering said electronic art with it.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Abolish private motor vehicles in urban centres. Ok I’m biased as I don’t drive, but I still think we’d all be better off with less cars in cities. The money being spent on maintaining the infrastructure for cars could be better used on free public transport, etc. Might actually make a dent in CO2 emissions also.</p>

<p>Blockchain development and the development of decentralized apps (Dapps) has changed over the past 5 years. When I started with crypto in 2017, Ethereum had just launched, and Solidity programming became the new thing a lot of people wanted to learn. The only problem these days was that little information to get started was available, whereas today we can build on thousands of Youtube videos, courses like <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/">Cryptozombies </a>or <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/">Openzeppelin </a>standards.</p><p>Today, one doesn’t even have to know anything about Solidity programming or blockchains at all to create a product or service that is built on top of a blockchain. Nowadays there are services like Tatum and Moralis, providing almost everything you need to instantly start developing your product or service instead of managing all the “behind the scenes” things on your&nbsp;own.</p><p>This post explains how to get started with blockchain development using the platforms of Tatum and Moralis. I discuss pros and cons and what you can build with them&nbsp;today.</p> Introduction <p>The two main features of Moralis and Tatum are a Web API and an SDK for application development based on a public blockchain. With the Web API we can retrieve all the necessary data from a blockchain and with the SDK we can easily use code to interact with the blockchain to make a transaction or call a function of a smart contract. The blockchain data retrieved by the Web API can be accessed with the SDK as well. Without using such a service a developer must run his own full node to know the blockchains state in order to make a correct transaction based on the current&nbsp;state.</p><p>Moralis and Tatum work on multiple public blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. Thus, one can retrieve data from all these blockchains using a single Web API. While <a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3-sdk/intro#supported-chains">Moralis</a> “only” covers 6 blockchains, the <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/supported-blockchains">Tatum API</a> covers around 40. Both APIs can be used to access the main network and a test network of a blockchain like for example Rinkeby or Ropsten for Ethereum.</p><p>Behind the scenes, services like Tatum and Moralis run a full node of every blockchain they support. Having access to all blockchains’ data, they are able to aggregate it so that one can access all users’ balances, token balances or NFTs in one place. The API can then be used within the respective SDK to help developers creating their product or service. The following picture shows the general architecture of&nbsp;Moralis.</p><a href="https://moralis.io/">The architecture of&nbsp;Moralis</a> Web API comparison of Moralis and&nbsp;Tatum <p>Using a Web API to get all necessary blockchain data saves developers a lot of time and money. Retrieving blockchain data via Tatum and Moralis is free of charge. Both APIs are able&nbsp;to:</p>  Get all Transactions an address has&nbsp;made.  Get the current block of any&nbsp;chain.  Get the native balance or balance of any ERC-20&nbsp;token.  Get all NFT information of a user or a contract.  Get and write data from and to&nbsp;<a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>.  <p>Both, Moralis and Tatum cover all “basic” API requests. Differences are listed in the following.</p> Requests specific to Moralis’&nbsp;API   Get all Events emitted at a specific smart contract.  Get liquidity pair reserves for a Uniswap based exchange&nbsp;(DeFi).  Resolve an <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/learn">unstoppable domain</a> and return the&nbsp;address.  <p>Good thing to know: The Moralis Web API differentiate between all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche and Polygon and the new created Solana Web API for Solana. For Solana, one can “only” retrieve users’ current balance, transactions, NFTs and tokens at the&nbsp;moment.</p> Requests specific to Tatum’s&nbsp;API   Generate a wallet and get the private key, the mnemonics and the&nbsp;address.  Deploy a standard ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 contract.  Interact with virtual accounts and the off chain ledger — I will cover this later in more&nbsp;detail.   How to use the&nbsp;APIs <p>After you registered for Moralis you can see on the left side of the screen the Web3 API Button. Once clicked you can use the whole Web API within the browser (see figure below). The x-api-key and the whole curl request are shown when you execute a request. Using the API from outside the browser like for example with Postman or curl is also possible.</p><a href="https://admin.moralis.io/web3Api">The Moralis Web3 API webinterface</a><p>Using Tatum’s API works a bit different. After the registration you will be redirected to your dashboard. Here you can find your API keys — one for all main networks and one for all test networks.</p><p>To see the whole API you have to go back to the homepage to find the <a href="https://tatum.io/apidoc.php">documentation of the API</a>. Sadly, it is not possible to use the API within the browser. However, Tatum provides request code examples in 13 programming languages (see&nbsp;below).</p><a href="https://tatum.io/apidoc.php#tag/Blockchain-Polygon-(Matic)">Tatum API example to create a new wallet on&nbsp;Polygon</a> Pricing <p>Both APIs have a very good free version that can be used immediately after registration. The following figures show the number of requests possible with the APIs, depending on the plan you may&nbsp;choose.</p><a href="https://moralis.io/pricing/">Moralis Pricing for number of&nbsp;requests</a><a href="https://tatum.io/pricing.html">Tatum Pricing for number of&nbsp;requests</a> Web API conclusion <p>Most importantly first: both API’s from Moralis and Tatum are working great and as expected and I can recommend both to you. Moralis has a little bit less supported blockchains and features than Tatum but looks more modern on the other hand. With both API’s you have access for all “basic” requests and if you really need something advanced you should look at both API’s and compare if one of these API’s is already dealing with your problem. If so just choose it and try it&nbsp;out.</p> How to use Moralis’ blockchain SDK <p><a href="https://moralis.io/">Moralis</a> describes itself as “the ultimate Web3 Development Platform” and is often said to be “the firebase of crypto”. Regarding help in blockchain software development, a JavaScript SDK is available. You can either use it as a plain npm module named “moralis” or you can use the “react-moralis” module to use the SDK within your React project. All the following paragraphs will focus on EVM blockchains but like already mentioned Moralis also support&nbsp;Solana.</p> Moralis server <p>Starting a new project with Moralis requires you to create a Moralis Server within your Dashboard.</p><a href="https://admin.moralis.io/servers">Add a new Moralis Server within your Dashboard</a><p>Creating a Moralis server requires only to select a name, your region, main network or test network and which blockchains should be included and listened to. In the free version of Moralis, you can run 3 of these servers at the same time but you must revoke them manually after 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>After you created your Moralis server, you can open either its details or its dashboard. Opening the details will show you your Server URL and your Application ID. These two keys have to be imported in your SDK to use it correctly. In the dashboard you can see all your additional databases Moralis is creating for&nbsp;you.</p><p>In the following paragraphs I will show use cases of these additional databases and cover some of the more advanced features you can do with your Moralis server that is helpful for Dapp development.</p> Authenticating users <p>The Moralis SDK provides a simple way to track all users of a Dapp. Either users can register themselves with a username and password or do it the web3 way by using Metamask. The following code example shows how to connect your Dapp with your Moralis server and how to authenticate users the web3&nbsp;way.</p> const Moralis = require('moralis');  const serverUrl = "YOUR_SERVER_URL";<br>const appId = "YOUR_APP_ID";  Moralis.start({ serverUrl, appId });  Moralis.authenticate() <p>The authenticate function will open the user’s Metamask window and request a signature from the user by clicking the “Sign” button. Note that there is no gas fee involved in signing because it is not a transaction.</p><p>Now, here’s the cool part. Once a new user logged in, you can observe a new row added to your “User” table in the Moralis dashboard with the address of the user. Furthermore, the Moralis server creates additional tables like for example “EthTransactions”, where you can see all transactions made of all users on the blockchain networks you selected when creating the&nbsp;server.</p>Moralis Server Dashboard — Get all transaction made from all&nbsp;users<p>Because your tables can get fast quite big, your whole database is capable of managing queries and filters in order to only get and show the desired&nbsp;data.</p> Listening to&nbsp;events <p>One feature only Moralis provides, is listening to events of a specific contract. To this respect, open your server details and go to the “sync” tab. Now either choose to “follow” a specific address or a specific event. If you choose to follow an event, you only have to paste its name with parameter, its ABI as JSON and the contract address. After creation the data will synchronize automatically and the result can be found within a newly generated table in your server. A more detailed tutorial can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://moralis.io/sync-and-index-smart-contract-events-full-guide/">here</a>.</p> Cloud-based queries <p>Complex database queries can be run on the Moralis server in the cloud. For example, if you have a table with movie ratings with 1–5 stars and you would like to know the average film rating, you normally would first get all ratings and then calculate the average. To directly get the answer, just deploy and call the query as a JavaScript function within your Moralis server. For more information about the correct syntax check out Moralis’ documentation <a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/cloud-code">here</a>.</p> Getting data with Moralis’&nbsp;SDK <p>Let’s take a closer look at the actual JavaScript SDK and how to retrieve blockchain data. Moralis differentiates between their “normal” API for all EVM blockchains and their Solana API. The following paragraphs refer to the EVM blockchain API.</p><p>To get some data, there are 4 entry&nbsp;points:</p>  With Moralis.Web3API.native.functionName(options) we can access the Web API data within our SDK. Click <a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3-sdk">here </a>for more information.  With the useMoralisQuery(‘tablename’) function we can get access to all the data within a specific table of our Moralis server. With the React SDK it should also be possible to enable live updates whenever your table you reference to updates. However, this didn’t work for me while&nbsp;testing.  With the Moralis.executeFunction(‘options’) function we can interact with a smart contract directly in order to get the state of a public variable or the result of a read only function. Click <a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3/web3">here </a>for more information.  With the Moralis.Cloud.run(‘function_name’) function we can execute our cloud functions and get the result&nbsp;back.  <p>Using these methods, you can retrieve all blockchain data required for building your Dapp. Of course, all these possibilities can be combined within your Dapp. For example, many requests like getting the specific ERC-20 balance of an address can be resolved using any of these four possibilities.</p> Creating transactions with Moralis’&nbsp;SDK <p>Knowing how to get blockchain data, let’s look at how to make a transaction with the Moralis SDK. The general approach of doing a transaction with the Moralis SDK is by conducting the actual transaction via Metamask. This way, the user and the developer don’t have to deal with any private keys, because Metamask handles them. Metamask provides the SDK with the information, which network the user is currently connected to, so we don’t have to deal with any blockchain network code. The SDK creates a correct transaction with the currently connected network on its own. Thus, the user only has to click on a button within the Dapp and Metamask to accept the transaction.</p><p>Making a transaction with the Moralis SDK is a one liner of code. Only the parameters of a transaction, e.g., the transaction amount, the receiver and the contract address have to be passed as JSON parameter to the Moralis.transfer(options) function. Note the different parameter settings in the code examples below to create a transaction for respectively sending a native coin, an ERC-20 token or an NFT. For more information click&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/sending-assets">here</a>.</p> 1) Transfer native coin options<br>const options = <br>{type: "native", <br> amount: Moralis.Units.ETH("0.5"), <br> receiver: "0x.."<br>}  2) Transfer ERC20 Token options<br>const options = <br> {type: "erc20",<br> amount: Moralis.Units.Token("0.5", "18"),<br> receiver: "0x..",<br> contractAddress: "0x.."<br>}  3) Transfer ERC721 Token options<br>const options = <br>{type: "erc721",<br> receiver: "0x..",<br> contractAddress: "0x..",<br> tokenId: 1<br>}  // Call the Moralis.transfer function with options as parameter<br>const transaction = await Moralis.transfer(options);  // You can wait until its confirmation and do sth. with the result<br>const result = await transaction.wait();  Interacting with smart contracts <p>For interacting with a function of a smart contract, you have to create an options variable as JSON string that includes the contract address, the function name, the <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solidity/what-is-an-abi">ABI </a>of the function, and the parameters. Now call the Moralis.execute(options) function with the options string as parameter. That’s everything it takes to create a transaction with the Moralis SDK as shown in the following <a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3/web3">code&nbsp;example</a>.</p> let options = {<br> contractAddress: '0x...',<br> functionName: 'FUNCTION_NAME',<br> abi: [ FUNCTION_ABI_AS_JSON ],<br> params: {<br>     parameter1: value1,<br>    }<br>};  const tx = await Moralis.executeFunction(options);<br>const result = await tx.wait();  Moralis conclusion <p>Moralis appears modern and helps building a Dapp. The Web API works great and using the SDK, it becomes a one liner to handle user authentication, getting data from any blockchain or creating valid transactions. Also, the documentation is very well written and detailed. They also have a very active <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MoralisWeb3">Youtube&nbsp;Channel</a>.</p><p>A limitation of Moralis is that it only deals with reading from and writing to a blockchain. Creating your own wallet or deploying a new smart contract are not possible. Therefore, scripting can get complicated because to send a transaction you have to deal with Metamask in the first place. But if you are only looking for a SDK that helps you build the JavaScript/backend part of your Dapp then choosing Moralis makes a good&nbsp;choice.</p> How to use Tatum’s blockchain SDK <p><a href="https://tatum.io">Tatum</a> describes itself as “The ultimate blockchain development platform” that offers a unified framework for 40+ blockchain protocols to reduce the complexity of blockchain development. While Moralis specialized in building Dapps, Tatum is a more general tool with a lot of methods needed to deal with a blockchain. Methods for creating and managing your own wallets and private keys, deploying smart contracts and interacting with them are included in the Tatum JavaScript SDK and their&nbsp;API.</p><p>Maybe because of the broad scope of Tatum, it feels a little bit unfinished. They feature a lot of services and endpoints instead of specializing on one specific. Thus, their Web API documentation is so big that it takes more than 2–3 seconds to load and render the whole page. Also, a lot of things are missing completely, and some other things are not properly explained yet in the documentation. However, Tatum told me that they are working on it already. So as well as in the Moralis section of this article, I will focus in the following paragraphs on EVM blockchains only, since the Tatum API is most developed for these kind of blockchains.</p><p>In the following paragraphs, I will show you the most important things you can put to use already today with&nbsp;Tatum.</p> Initializing Tatum’s&nbsp;SDK <p>Tatum’s SDK is as well written for JavaScript and can be downloaded as npm module with the name ‘@tatumio/tatum’. Once installed you can import it within your project and use one of the hundreds of functions Tatum provides. Calling any of these functions is a one liner. But compared to Moralis you don’t pass all the options as a single JSON string, but rather each parameter is passed individually.</p> Generating a&nbsp;wallet <p>By creating a wallet from scratch, we can script any transaction we want because we know the private key and can sign transactions on our own. To create a wallet with the Tatum SDK you need to import the generateWallet function and the Currency Enum. Once you call the function with the desired cryptocurrency, like for example Bitcoin or Ethereum, you will get your 24-mnemonic words and your xpub for your newly generated <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hd-wallet-hierarchical-deterministic-wallet.asp">HD-wallet</a>.</p><p>With these two variables, Tatum can create new addresses with the corresponding private keys for your new wallet using the generateAddressFromXPub and generatePrivateKeyFromMnemonic functions, which you have to import as well. <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/your-first-app">The following code</a> demonstrates the whole&nbsp;process.</p> 1) const {generateWallet, generateAddressFromXPub, generatePrivateKeyFromMnemonic, Currency} = require("@tatumio/tatum");  2) const btcWallet = await generateWallet(Currency.BTC, false);  3) const btcAddress = generateAddressFromXPub(Currency.BTC, false,    "YOUR_XPUB", "HD_WALLET_INDEX");  4) const btcPrivateKey = await   generatePrivateKeyFromMnemonic(Currency.BTC, false, "YOUR_MNEMONICS", "HD_WALLET_INDEX") <p>In the first line of code, we import the SDK and all required functions. In the second line, we generate a Bitcoin wallet and get the mnemonic and the xpub. In the third line, we create a new address from the xpub and in the fourth line, we create the private key for it. Because we are dealing with a HD-Wallet you must also pass the index of it as a parameter.</p> Tatum’s Key Management System&nbsp;(KMS) <p>To create a transaction, we need our newly created private key to be passed as a parameter to each function. Because it is never a good idea to send your private key across the internet, Tatum provides two approaches: (1) You can sign your transaction locally — this way you must have your private key stored locally on your computer, or (2) you can use the Tatum Key Management System (KMS). KMS is a cloud solution by Tatum, allowing to import your private keys encrypted with a password of your choice to let Tatum sign transactions for you within their service. This way, the private key doesn’t have to be sent across the internet because Tatum signs your transaction and only sends the signature of the transaction. For more information, click&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tatum.io/tutorials/how-to-securely-store-private-keys">here</a>.</p> Accessing blockchain data <p>Currently, the Tatum SDK does not support yet to get all the blockchain data being available via the API. So to access blockchain data via Tatum, one should consult the <a href="https://tatum.io/apidoc.php">Web API docs</a> and make a HTTP request. This method can be used to build your own Dapp. I recommend to create a separate function for each request, in which you pass all necessary parameters and do the actual HTTP request within this function. This way, you create your own little framework for one-liner requests to get any necessary data from the blockchain.</p> Interacting with a smart&nbsp;contract <p>Interacting with a smart contract doesn’t work yet with the SDK at the time of writing. Instead, you must use the API as described <a href="https://tatum.io/apidoc.php#operation/EthBlockchainSmartContractInvocation">here</a>.</p> Transfering coins and&nbsp;tokens <p>At least the transfer functions for native coins, ERC-20 tokens, NFTs and ERC-1155 tokens exist already in Tatum’s SDK and are documented. The <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/guides/blockchain/how-to-send-ethereum-transaction">following code example</a> shows how to create an ERC-20 token transaction. For more information, check out the <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/guides/blockchain">documentation</a>.</p> import {sendEthOrErc20Transaction, ethGetTransaction, Currency} from '@tatumio/tatum';  const transaction = await sendEthOrErc20Transaction({<br>chain: Currency.'CHAIN_TO_USE', <br>fromPrivateKey: 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',<br>contractAddress: 'CONTRACT_ADDRESS',<br>digits: DIGITS_OF_TOKEN,<br>amount: "AMOUNT_TO_SEND--0.1 for example",<br>to: "TO_ADDRESS"<br>});  const transaction = await ethGetTransaction(transaction.txId);  Deploying a standard smart&nbsp;contract <p>Tatum’s SDK allows deploying standard smart contracts for EVM-compatible blockchains. Thus, one can deploy a smart contract with custom parameters for token standards listed below. Detailed information on parameters to use regarding using one of the token standards are linked to the&nbsp;list:</p>  <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/guides/blockchain/how-to-create-an-erc-20-token">ERC-20</a>  <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/guides/blockchain/how-to-create-nft-token">ERC-721 (NFT)</a>  <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/guides/blockchain/how-to-create-erc-1155-multi-tokens">ERC-1155</a>   Virtual accounts <p>Virtual accounts are more or less the equivalent of a Moralis server. It’s a separate private ledger maintained by Tatum to enable, e.g., setting up webhook notifications when at a specific address a new transaction is observed. While for Moralis you must paste your address to synchronize and the webhook URL endpoint in your server’s dashboard, in Tatum you must set it up using the SDK or API. Moralis’ dashboard has great usability but Moralis provides no API for specifying webhooks. Tatum on the other hand has no dashboard but provides an API and SDK for the&nbsp;setup.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tatum’s SDK did not work properly during my experiments and I had to use the API again to test the webhooks. The steps for setting up a virtual account in Tatum and to subscribe to blockchain events&nbsp;are:</p>  Create a new wallet and save your&nbsp;‘xpub’  Create a new virtual account with the ‘xpub’ as one of the parameters. Only a private key corresponding to this ‘xpub’ is allowed to do a transaction within this virtual&nbsp;account.  Connect the address to sync with your virtual&nbsp;account  Initialize a subscription that listens to incoming events and send the data to the endpoint of your&nbsp;choice.   Tatum conclusion <p>Tatum’s SDK is a not a complete product at the moment, given its claims. Tatum aims at offering much more features than Moralis for interacting with a blockchain, especially when starting from scratch. Tatum is also more flexible by supporting more blockchains and already provides more usable features that can be helpful for scripting: Generating a wallet, managing keys, or deploying a new smart contract works great. The documentation is quite okay, but I would like to see Tatum to improve on that in the future. For functions not present in the SDK yet, you can use Tatum’s API instead, which works fine. To conclude, Tatum already provides a decent service and given the assumption that they will improve their documentation and SDK, I can recommend using Tatum’s SDK and API for developing a&nbsp;Dapp.</p> Other blockchain SDKs and APIs worth considering <p>Besides Moralis and Tatum, several other services exist that provide a Web API and a SDK for Dapp development. But none of them are as advanced as Moralis and Tatum and can be used only for some parts of your Dapp probably.</p>  <a href="https://idexo.com/">Idexo</a>: It is another service, offering an SDK for blockchain development that feels like the very small brother of Tatum. Idexo provides only an SDK and is very limited regarding the number of blockchains and features. When trying to evaluate it, I had problems with registration and login. What Idexo is most known for is their Telegram bot that allow users to mint an NFT within Telegram.  <a href="https://thegraph.com/en/">The Graph</a>: This is a Web API, focussing on complex and automated queries on Ethereum and&nbsp;IPFS.  <a href="https://nownodes.io/nodes">NOWNodes</a>: They offer a Web API that is comparable to Tatum. The service supports also 40+ blockchains and a lot of endpoints are supported for each blockchain.  <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a>: Infura provides some tools and endpoints to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and&nbsp;IPFS.  <a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a>: If you even want to build a custom blockchain, then the Cosmos SDK might be worthwhile. Creating an own blockchain gets almost as simple as deploying a new token with&nbsp;it.   Conclusion <p>It’s astonishing to experience how easy blockchain development has become due to tools and services like Moralis and Tatum. I recommend to use Moralis for developing a Dapp and to use Tatum for close interaction with different blockchains. I expect more to come as these services are evolving quickly. On top of that many other services exist to keep an eye&nbsp;on.</p><p>51nodes GmbH based in Stuttgart is a provider of crypto economy solutions. 51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (Dapps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/@draklein">Achim Klein</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@jpbu">Jan-Paul Buchwald</a> for their help in the course of developing this&nbsp;article.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/getting-started-with-blockchain-development-pros-and-cons-of-tatum-vs-moralis-91dd5acea624">Getting Started with Blockchain Development: Pros and Cons of Tatum vs. Moralis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the seventh in a series of DM notes, which share information from DM Downloads — our regular internal learning sessions. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>DM Note #7 reflects upon our approach to visualising and communicating complexity, and explores the ways complexity plays a central role in our practices and&nbsp;output.</p> Diving into the Dark Matter // A brief origin&nbsp;story <p>Before Dark Matter Labs came <a href="https://www.project00.cc/">Project 00</a>, a collaborative design company seeking to think beyond design’s traditional borders.</p><p>The organisation’s name has multiple connotations, In German architecture, 00 denotes a building’s infrastructure (its toilets and corridors), in computing, 00 is the root base of a structure in a file directory.</p>The logo of DM was inspired by the periodic table of&nbsp;elements<p>00’s early work included Opendesk (downloadable, printable furniture) and Wikihouse (open-source housing), but despite the positive attention both projects attracted, they also revealed a series of underlying structural questions:</p><p>How do you provide decentralised warranty for an open source&nbsp;desk?</p><p>Even if you managed to radically reduce the cost of making a house, what about the cost of the&nbsp;land?</p><p>Through 2010 and 2011, 00’s team took part in a series of workshops focused on similarly broad questions, from which emerged both Dan Hill’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15801041-dark-matter-and-trojan-horses">Dark Matter and Trojan Horses: A Strategic Design Vocabulary </a>(2012) and Dark Matter Labs. We realised that if real change was going to be possible, it wasn’t with the ‘things’ we were designing or making, but at the level of institutional infrastructures; the powerful — but invisible — dark matter that makes 93% of the universe and structures the visible world&nbsp;. If we were going to achieve even a modicum of success, we’d have to really explore, uncover, embrace and articulate invisible complexity.</p>A very small sample of how the stack has been used across initiatives at&nbsp;DM The Stack <p>The Stack became our way to communicate interconnected ideas at various stages, and influences how we organise our information architecture on Notion. Over the years, The Stack’s taken on a wide array of colours and configurations, ongoing a regular cycle of becoming excessively elaborate, and eventually simplified again, but ultimately still stands as an intuitive metaphor for complexity, simultaneity and visibility.</p><p>Its isometric projection not only demonstrates multiple activities happening at the same time, but also provides a sense of territorial scale, accounting for the physicality of an environment alongside other intangible structures.</p><p>Inspired by <a href="http://thestack.org/">Bratton’s “stack”</a> and Donella Meadows’ “leverage points” (<a href="https://alastairparvin.medium.com/we-need-new-operating-systems-whose-job-is-that-37421656a2e9">nicely illustrated here by Alastair Parvin</a>), The Stack references (tech holy grail) ‘vertical integration/innovation’ — providing visualisation of the multiple interventions and innovations needed around a problem. But The Stack also has a practical hierarchy; the lower you go, the harder the thing is to&nbsp;change.</p><p>Synthesising the complexity of a context or an initiative we want to portray and guiding people through a narrative that is easy enough to understand remains a constant challenge.</p> Complexity Mapping <p>Today at Dark Matter Labs, embracing complexity is a core part of our daily work and map making has become our central visualisation process. Complexity mapping allows us to explore interconnected, entangled contexts involving multiple stakeholders, interests and interdisciplinary knowledge.</p><p>Whether to present a particular piece of information in full complexity or more streamlined clarity is a constant challenge.</p><p>Done well, opting for complexity offers oversight, allowing us to recognise root causes, potential leverage points, and sites of change for intervention and experimentation.</p><p>Maps can be widely collaborative and provide a starting point for conversations, allowing each viewer to spot their own connections and opportunities.</p><p>A bad map can get excessively complicated, where it should be designed to demonstrate multiple entry points, it can overwhelm and shut people down; quickly ring fencing our work — and while a lot of the work is presented with specialist audiences in mind, we fall majorly short if we fail to make it&nbsp;legible.</p><p>Maps are not simply means of sharing our work publicly. They are a central part of our inquiry process. They allow us to share our individual thoughts, explore connections and work collaboratively. Our daily work often involves moving between projects and holding multiple pieces of information simultaneously, and maps serve as a vessel for retaining that information. Different team members can enter a project, introducing new ways of thinking and spotting a host of new connections.</p><p>Our work is often conducted internationally, presentations at DM Download #7 came from three continents. Mapping serves as a substitute for gathering around a table or a board, chipping away at a problem and exploring its interconnections.</p> Maps are non-linear and open&nbsp;ended <blockquote>“Maps are not the destination, they are tools for exploration”<br>Eunsoo Lee, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs</blockquote><p>During the DM Download, Eunsoo’s presentation underlined the importance of the map making process to idea formation, stressing its crucial role in the thinking process behind a piece of&nbsp;work.</p> Maps can reflect our thinking processes <p>They can serve as an intermediary step in the narrative and argument building process, which bridges research and portfolio building.</p> Behind the map sometimes sits a spreadsheet <p>A database of nodes and data points emerges from desk research, interviews and workshops. We sift through the most relevant bits of information, disintegrating them into parts, and breaking insights into components, before reconnecting them again in a way that makes the most sense for what we want to&nbsp;convey.</p> The imperfect disintegration process <p>The information which ends up on a map is usually collected from interviews and research, it gets stored in a database in which insights are tagged, the quotes or pieces of information then get broken into components and bundled according to their theme. The intention is to provide a skeletal framework from which connections can be&nbsp;created.</p><p>Classifying the nodes into domains or themes is always an imperfect, reductive process. The richness of the original statement from which they stem, gets lost in the act of grouping them under umbrella terms, but its purpose is to manage the complexity and guide further exploration.</p> Maps are open for interpretation <p>The map is never considered a complete product, rather, it serves as a foundation upon which hundreds more connections can be built, as well as multiple narratives and interpretations.</p> Maps are a research tool for collective sensemaking <p>Our work requires us to engage with complexity in a variety of ways. The interconnected, planetary-scale challenges are projected onto complexity maps, which help us embrace their entangled, independent nature, and hold the interests of multiple stakeholders.</p><p>Creating and collaborating around maps allows us to use our skills to recognise connections. Our daily work often involves moving between projects and holding multiple pieces of information simultaneously, maps serve as a vessel for retaining that information and when published let us show our thinking, in an open, transparent, and adaptable format.</p>Layering and communicating complexity through systems&nbsp;mapping Maps tell bigger&nbsp;stories <p>Maps can include nodes and connections and visual hierarchies.</p><p>During Download #7, team member Oliver Burgess led us around a visual from the Longtermism project supported by Climate KIC in 2020. The work imagines a world where physical objects (phones, roads, bicycles) have the inherent desire to persist, and so seek to maximise their utility, minimise their environmental impact and contribute to economies of&nbsp;reuse.</p><p>The visualisation centres on a rentable electric bicycle, exploring the product’s manufactured complexity and embodied environmental impact over its life&nbsp;cycle.</p>Map exploring the life cycle environmental impacts of an electric hire&nbsp;bicycle<p>The map covers extraction of raw materials; manufacture of components; usage and operation; and end of life of the bike. It also considers the platform infrastructure that enables the service, the teams responsible for maintaining and redistributing the bikes across the city, and the digital infrastructure upon which it depends. In doing so, it illustrates the negative environmental and social impacts which result from carbon-intensive or polluting processes throughout the bike’s life&nbsp;cycle.</p> Maps are a balance between complexity and&nbsp;clarity <p>Oliver highlighted a visualisation’s ability to balance complexity with clarity. His aim was to encourage the viewer to engage with the whole map and provide a level of detail which conveyed the system’s complexity, without allowing them to get lost in minute&nbsp;details.</p> Maps are always incomplete <p>The map is a static snapshot of part of a bigger system, the scope and detail is often limited by the quantity and quality of available research and&nbsp;data.</p> Maps are only ever approximate <blockquote>Obviously this is only ever an approximation, and it was important in the process to be fully transparent about the assumptions behind it, and the methodology used to make those calculations. Some of the data’s more available than other [bits of data], some of the approximations and assumptions that are used throughout the calculation are estimates, but we tried to keep that very&nbsp;open.</blockquote><blockquote>- Oliver Burgess, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs</blockquote> Maps provoke further&nbsp;thought <p>More broadly, the visual demonstrates an approach to thinking about objects: it focuses on a bike, but a similar approach could be taken for many other objects which make up our built environment. Could a better understanding of their embodied value and impacts, change our perceptions around waste and disposability?</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/CrisMoffitt/status/1265492792018599936">@CrisMoffitt</a></p></blockquote> Creating visual hierarchy <p>Despite our desire to keep things legible, their iterative, collaborative nature means these maps can quickly become difficult to read, drawing connections and using shorthand that only the original cartographers can even begin to navigate.</p><p>Dark Matter Labs’ Hyojeong Lee is often tasked with creating legibility and hierarchy to make maps fit for public consumption. At Download #7, Hyojeong led us through the mapping principles which guide the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Through use of colour, grids, keys, icons, linkages, nodes, quotations and visual effects such as shadows or highlights, Hyojeong seeks to create a topography, she often carefully uses clustering to suggest — but never enforce — groupings and narratives. Positioning and then pinning and the nodes enforces a sometimes frustrating rigidity to the information, but proximity, and cause and effect should gently imply our thinking. Underlining the sense that the map is a tool for exploring, rather than a linear singular narrative.</p> Communicating complexity through visual&nbsp;identity <p>While maps are the main process by which we articulate complexity, it also enters our work in other ways. Hyojeong led us through the visual research and thinking which underpinned the graphics in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/civic-indigenous-7-0-459436b6f60">Civic Indigenous 7.0</a>. The research, care and attention to detail that underpin an elegant visual identity and support and enhance the&nbsp;project.</p> Starting point <p>Hyojeong said that the story that the project wants to tell is the most important process in visualising, initially she’ll work through written documents including ideas, thoughts and research.</p><p>With Civic Indigenous 7.0 her ambition was to visual bridge futurism and tradition, the technological and organic, and Tech and TEK (traditional ecological knowledge). Initial visual research led her towards Indigenous art, which she took colour and mood, and contemporary graphic design which follows similar geometric fluidity and intensity of&nbsp;colour.</p><p>Seeking to create seven visuals which explored points of convergence:</p>  Section 35: Opening radically different futures  Verbs not nouns: conjugations and a perpetual state of&nbsp;becoming  Counselling with nature: moving towards more eccentric models of&nbsp;law  Everyday lawing: constituting as a daily&nbsp;practice  Economies of care: towards a systemic reciprocity  High-TEK (traditional ecological knowledge): Indigenous innovation and knowledge  Inherent right: reweaving our relationship to&nbsp;land.  <p>After an initial series of monochrome iterations received a round of feedback, Hyojeong integrated comments, refined the designs and introduced colour and gradients.</p><p>Hyojeong then went on to develop a second series of graphics exploring the resurgence of Indigenous world views and shifts away from western and colonial&nbsp;default.</p><p>Here are some examples of the graphics in&nbsp;context:</p> In short <p>By looking to demonstrate the value and limitations of working with both maps and The Stack, and attempting to lift the lid on our visual processes, we’ve tried to show some ways that complexity enters our daily work and how to improve it moving forward.

 <a href="https://youtu.be/pYT4gj7k7RQ?t=2194">Rivivi l’evento</a> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>Si è svolto il 23 febbraio 2022, il webinar organizzato dal CED (Centro Economia Digitale), evento che aveva l’obiettivo di analizzare le sfide che il Paese si appresta ad affrontare in ambito di Transizione Digitale, Transizione Ecologica e Mezzogiorno a seguito dell’approvazione del PNRR.</p>
<p>L’evento, tenutosi presso Villa Blanc, sede della rinomata Università Luiss Guido Carli, e mandato in onda in diretta streaming, ha visto l’alternarsi di una serie di autorevoli interventi presentati da illustri relatori, facenti parte sia del mondo delle istituzioni, che della ricerca e dell’industria.</p>
<p>Durante la tavola rotonda dal titolo “Next Generation Italia – EXECUTION”,Danilo Cattaneo – CEO di InfoCert – <a href="https://www.tinexta.com/">Tinexta Group</a> – è stato intervistato sul ruolo che può avere InfoCert nell’accompagnare la PA e la società nella Transizione Digitale, quale sia lo stato dell’arte in questo inizio 2022 e quale percorso dovrebbe prendere il Paese per perseguire con successo gli obiettivi strategici del PNRR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>«Sicuramente sul tema della Transizione Digitale abbiamo visto susseguirsi alcune storie di successo che hanno eletto l’Italia ad apripista, a livello europeo, su alcuni ambiti. Esperienze tuttavia intervallate da altre meno positive dovute a evidenti deficit in ambito di cultura del digitale e cultura dell’innovazione.</p>
<p>Già da prima dell’outbreak pandemico, il nostro Paese poteva contare su delle eccellenze in termini di strumenti di digitalizzazione che impattavano su processi e sull’operatività di aziende ed Enti. Parlo ad esempio della diffusione della PEC nei processi della PA e delle aziende private, che hanno portato ad ulteriori situazioni virtuose come il processo civile telematico, l’accesso ai concorsi in digitale e via dicendo. I quali, oltre ad un evidente risparmio di tempo nell’affrontare le pratiche relative ai singoli processi, hanno portato ad un enorme risparmio in termini di CO2e di spazio di archivio, che hanno dei costi di manutenzione e gestione esorbitanti.</p>
<p>Con l’arrivo della Pandemia di COVID-19, tutti noi abbiamo assistito ad una fortissima ed ulteriore spinta di digitalizzazione e remotizzazione dei processi pubblici e privati.</p>
<p>Il Sistema Pubblico di Identità Digitale, lo SPID, ad esempio è cresciuto a ritmi fortissimi, sostenendo l’esigenza del cittadino di usufruire dei servizi pubblici e quella della PA di erogarli. Il primo grande caso d’uso è stata l’adozione dello SPID come principale sistema di autenticazione ed accesso ai servizi dell’INPS. Abbiamo stimato che l’INPS grazie all’adozione di questo strumento di Digital Trust abbia risparmiato qualcosa come più di 50 milioni l’anno.</p>
<p>Questa premessa è doverosa per capire il perché della presenza della “Transizione Digitale” come uno dei Pillar del PNRR e quale deve essere la direzione corretta per proseguire virtuosamente su questa strada che ci consentirà di mettere a terra gli obiettivi che l’Europa ci chiede di raggiungere…»</p>
<p>Danilo Cattaneo, CEO di InfoCert – <a href="https://www.tinexta.com/">Tinexta Group</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Il discorso di Cattaneo si è focalizzato poi sul fulcro del percorso di Transizione Digitale:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>«Le parole d’ordine, anche in uno scenario di “ritorno alla normalità” rispetto ai giorni di emergenza del 2020 devono restare le stesse: digitalizzazione, efficienza, resilienza, flessibilità, ma non solo. Gli strumenti citati hanno un comune denominatore, che ne costituisce il cardine e che ha reso possibile la creazione e la diffusione di questi Casi di Successo: il Trust, ovvero il concetto di fiducia applicata al digitale.</p>
<p>Infatti, solo con uno strumento certificato si può blindare una transazione digitale e renderla sicura. La PEC, lo SPID, la Firma Digitale sono tra gli strumenti principali per tale cambiamento, i “mattoncini” su cui costruire i processi certificati del futuro, che facciano operare vicendevolmente PA Centrale, PA Locale, mondo economico e cittadino. Altri strumenti simili possono essere la Conservazione a Norma ed i wallet per l’Identità Digitale, basati sulla Self Sovereign Identity.</p>
<p>Digitalizzazione, efficienza, resilienza, flessibilità e Trust quindi sono sullo stesso piano per abilitare la Transizione Digitale dell’Italia»</p>

<p>An explainer on OceanDAO voting improvements implemented in Q1&nbsp;2022.</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO</a> is a community-curated grants DAO for the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. It follows monthly funding rounds where people can propose grants, the community votes on those proposals, and winning proposals receive&nbsp;funds.</p><p>With guidance from the OceanDAO “Parameters &amp; Roadmap” working group, the OceanDAO engineering team works to make curation accessible and fair for every participant.</p><p>This post describes recent improvements to OceanDAO voting mechanisms.</p><p>The rest of the post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>Section 2 — Describes Quadratic Voting (QV), which gives more voice to smaller token-holders and softens the impact of&nbsp;whales</p><p>Section 3 — Describes Bright Id &amp; Voting Boosts, to address Sybil attacks that QV&nbsp;exposed</p><p>Section 4 — Describes Vote Delegation, to allow busier people to let more-informed people vote on their behalf, and to allow people with multiple wallets to benefit from Voting&nbsp;Boosts</p><p>Section 5 — Describes multi-chain voting, so people can vote with their OCEAN and pool tokens beyond just Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet</p><p>Section 6 — Describes future&nbsp;updates</p> 2. Quadratic Voting (QV) — More voice to smaller token-holders <p>Quadratic voting (QV) is addresses two&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Issue: voice of smaller token-holders. Until recently, OceanDAO was one-token one-vote. This gives a lot of power to OCEAN whales. It makes smaller OCEAN holders feel like their voice is weak. This is counter-productive to growing an engaged community. We could go for a democratic ideal: one human one vote. Yet skin-in-the-game matters too: holding OCEAN is a strong signal that you care about Ocean. How do we balance&nbsp;these?</p><p>Issue: competition from long-established projects. Less established projects may find it difficult to compete against longer-established projects that have built up support from many large OCEAN&nbsp;holders.</p><p>We address these issues via two mechanisms.</p><p>1. Preference signaling. First, a given voter has the OCEAN in their wallet to allocate (vote positive or negative; not spend) across project project proposals. This signals the voter’s preference; the voter must choose which projects they feel the most strongly about and allocate more OCEAN to those projects. We’ve already had this for a few rounds, and it’s helped (<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Voting">details&nbsp;here</a>).</p><p>2. Sqrt(). The sqrt() function is applied to the voter’s allocation of OCEAN on a given proposal. This softens whale impact. We deployed this in OceanDAO Round 14. The table below is an&nbsp;example.</p><p>The combination of (1) and (2) is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">quadratic voting</a>&nbsp;(QV).</p><p>If you are a voter with just a few $OCEAN, you are able to vote for a few projects and have an impact. If you are a project that is just starting out, then you are more likely to receive support as voters look at other projects with good <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Value-Add">Value-Add Criteria</a> to&nbsp;support.</p> 3. BrightID &amp; Voting Boosts — Address Sybil&nbsp;Attacks <p>Issue: Sybil attacks. You might have noticed a potential attack vector with Quadratic Voting which is called a “Sybil Attack”, aka “attack of the clones”. In such an attack, a participant distributes their OCEAN into 10 or 20 or more smaller wallets, and votes separately from each. They’ve “cloned themselves”. This allows them to mostly avoid the effect of the square root, to make their OCEAN have higher total voting impact. Sybil attacks are only a problem when you go beyond one-token one-vote. Therefore before QV, they were not an issue; but with QV they&nbsp;are.</p><p>Possible Solutions. We could mitigate the effects of Sybil attacks with a “stick” or a “carrot” approach. In a “stick” approach, the idea would be “you could only vote if you show you’re a unique human”. This would be gatekeeping, and is counter to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">Ocean values</a> and broader web3&nbsp;ideals.</p><p>So, we opt for a “carrot” approach, where we incentivize for showing unique-humanhood. You show unique-humanhood by connecting your Ethereum address to BrightID identity. If you vote with that BrightID-linked wallet, you get a 400% Voting Boost. That is, votes from that wallet have 4x&nbsp;weight.</p><p>BrightID uses a web-of-trust (peer-to-peer) approach to establishing unique humanhood.</p><p>We’ve implemented a portal — <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">here</a> — to make this&nbsp;easy.</p><p>Something to note, you can only associate one wallet to a BrightID, and to an associated Voting&nbsp;Boost.</p> 4. Vote Delegation — More-informed voting <p>Issue: high effort for quality votes. OceanDAO Round 14 had 35 grant proposals. To become well-enough informed to vote with high signal takes several hours, even for people deeply involved in Ocean ecosystem. This is a big time commitment, and many people simply can’t commit the time. This means that the quality of voting signal suffers: some people don’t vote because they don’t feel well-informed enough, or they do vote but with less information than&nbsp;ideal.</p><p>Issue: can only boost one wallet. Many voters hold OCEAN (or pool tokens) across multiple wallets. But the Voting Boost only applies to the wallet associated with BrightID. How might we reconcile this?</p><p>Voter Delegation addresses both issues. It allows busier people to let more-informed people vote on their behalf, and it allow people with multiple wallets to benefit from Voting&nbsp;Boosts.</p><p>OceanDAO Round 15 introduces Voter Delegation. Participants are now able to delegate their voting power to another&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>On the first issue — by delegating Voting Power, you are empowering someone else to make decisions for you! Even if you’re less involved in Ocean, you likely know who might be more informed for voting. We hope this will increase voting signal quality, and also increase the number of people engaged in&nbsp;voting.</p><p>On the second issue — This means that you can delegate votes from a non-BrightID wallet to a verified BrightID wallet, and receive a voting boost more&nbsp;readily.</p><p>Usage. You can delegate your votes via these&nbsp;steps:</p>  Get the 0x wallet address from the person/account that will be casting the votes for&nbsp;you.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/delegate">Enter the Snapshot&nbsp;portal</a>  You can choose to limit the delegation to a specific space. In our example, we’ll be limiting the voting power delegation to: officialoceandao.eth  Finally, click “Confirm” to delegate your voting&nbsp;power.  Snapshot’s Voter Delegation Portal<p>Future usage. We hope that by releasing this feature, the OceanDAO community will be able to build on top of and help establish healthy delegates within the Ocean Ecosystem..</p><p>Some ideas for how the community can take this forward include establishing a Delegate Registry Portal such as <a href="https://stewards.eth.limo/">Gitcoin’s Steward Report Cards</a>. This would enable anyone to find or register themselves as Ocean Ecosystem Stewards, and facilitate good decision making inside OceanDAO.</p>Gitcoin’s Steward Report&nbsp;Cards 5. Multi-chain Voting <p>Issue. Ocean is deployed to Ethereum mainnet; but this has high gas fees. To address, Ocean has deployed to several other networks like Polygon which have low gas fees. That’s a great thing! The challenge is that OCEAN and pool token holders in these other networks haven’t been able to vote from those networks; they shouldn’t have to move their tokens to Ethereum mainnet (at high inconvenience and cost) just to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Solution: vote from Polygon and BSC. As of OceanDAORound 15l, OCEAN and datatoken pool token (BPT) holders holders in Polygon (Matic) chain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) can now vote with their OCEAN and BPTs. Note: R15 doesn’t support votes from other Ocean-deployed networks (Moonriver, EWC); we will continue to grow the supported-networks list over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Here’s what this looks&nbsp;like:</p>  This update supports everything that worked previously.  OCEAN in Polygon and BSC will count toward Voting&nbsp;Power.  OCEAN staked in Polygon and BSC datatoken pool tokens (BPTs) will count toward Voting&nbsp;Power.  You can delegate Voting Power within Polygon and&nbsp;BSC.  The sqrt() formula will be applied as described in the QV&nbsp;section  You only need to vote once to have your combined Voting Power deployed.   6. Conclusion <p>This post described several recent improvements to OceanDAO grants curation: Quadratic Voting, Sybil Tolerance, Vote Delegation, and Multi-chain voting. The OceanDAO engineering team implemented these based on guidance by the “Parameters &amp; Roadmap”&nbsp;WG.</p><p>The team will continue to make improvements over time, to further catalyze growth and make the funding process ever more accessible.</p><p>You can learn more about OceanDAO by <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">visiting our website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki">reading our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/"> Reddit</a>,<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> &amp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/"> Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

GEMpay Intends On Establishing Visual&nbsp;Identity<p>Introduction: The Importance Of Visual&nbsp;Identity</p><p>What is GEMpay, it is an important question to answer before delving deep into the intricacies of visual identity. GEMpay is a service that aims to create a new experience and practical benefits through a simple point payment service based on blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is an immutable and trustless system that enables GEMpay to operate effectively and transparently. The brand’s slogan is as follows “the double discount if there is a GEM.” According to the announcement of the National Statistical Office and the Korea Consumer Agency, the size of the Korean point market is estimated to be about KRW 20 trillion (approximately worth 16.5 billion USD) as of 2019, and it is showing an increasing trend of more than 10% every&nbsp;year.</p><p>As the e-commerce industry has grown substantially in both activity and revenue building, the point market continues to grow substantially. The primary point however seems to accompany a concept known as “the mask of benefits”, a silhouette or an illusion of benefits for the consumers. In the case of Starbucks, the deposit amounted to 200 billion won in 2020, but there was no real benefit to consumers. “The deposit is huge, but why is there no benefit for the consumer?” GEMpay intends to solve this problem by using blockchain based technology. By operating by the point called ‘AERGO GEM’ with a stable token mechanism that guarantees 1:1 value with Korean Won, we intend to provide consumers with a new experience of “blockchain-based simple payment’ and a real ‘double discount benefit.”</p><p>💟The Beginning: Blocko Creates The Payment&nbsp;Service</p>As Easy As Stacking Legos: This Is&nbsp;Blocko<p>“Blocko”, which has planned and created the GEMpay service, is a company who envisions a paradigm “to create a world where anyone can easily use blockchain even if they don’t know blockchain.” In order to make it simple for anyone who isn’t familiarized to utilizing blockchain without the awareness of actually using it, it is incumbent to help experts who are familiar with blockchain technology to easily implement the technology into preexisting applications. This requires disruptive collaboration and paradigm shifts that are not limited to existing systems and industries.</p>Standardizing Blockchain Through Familiarity<p>💟Now More About GEMpay: As Easy As Stacking&nbsp;Legos</p><p>Blocko created the GEMpay service with the philosophy of pursuing ground breaking cooperation and making blockchain as easy as stacking Legos. So, if you look closely at the GEMpay service logo, you can find that it is similar to the Blocko logo as well. Although GEMpay is a blockchain-based service, specific keywords have been extracted based on the service’s goal of the service being efficient, fun and easy to utilize without understanding the basic mechanisms of blockchain technology. Simultaneously, through GEMpay, our goal is to ‘enable everyone to use points safely and well’. Now how is utilizing GEMpay easy and effortless, it is important to highlight how such a claim is&nbsp;valid.</p><p>GEMpay is an app-based service that will provide an easy blockchain-based payment experience to everyone, whether on/offline. Fun: Instead of difficult and unfamiliar terms related to digital currency, easy and traditional terms such as ‘recharge GEM’ and ‘pay with GEM’ are provided, creating a fun experience in all processes from point charging, discount, and payment. Safe: going beyond a simple payment method, we plan to allow users to directly determine the discount rate and risk by selecting an asset management service for deposits. At this time, we want to solve the lug pool risk with the stable token method for asset management services. Smart: it means a smart experience at GEMpay where you can receive a ‘double discount’ rather than a ‘just discount’ when paying with GEM than when paying with cash or card. We also found a commonality between the ‘G’ of ‘GEM’ and ‘jewel’ in the service name, and derived eight key visuals based on this in the infographic showcased above.</p>Visualizing Definitions And&nbsp;Terms<p>The Formation Of Familiarized Symbols</p>Envisioning The GEMpay Prospect Through Visual Representation<p>A representative symbol was created using the above eight key visuals. The symbol of GEMpay is expressed with the hexagonal shape of the uppercase letter ‘G’ and ‘jewel’ and the block shape of a cube, whichimplies that GEMpay is a blockchain-based service. Formally, it is made to look like a hexagon and a cube by minimizing the effect of lines and gradations, visually conveying simplicity, fun, safety and smartness.</p><p>Defining The Color: Aesthetics</p>Artistic Expression In Logo Conception<p>The main color of GEMpay was defined as purple with the meaning of “purple ocean.” Purple ocean is a combination of a red and blue ocean symbolizin the creation of a market with new value (blue ocean) by changing ideas in a market with many competitors (red ocean). We think it is a very good expression of GEMpay, which has a competitive edge through a differentiated strategy called “blockchain technology”, while reducing risk in the already established market called “point&nbsp;market.”</p> 💟On February 28, The GEMpay Pre-Registration Page Is&nbsp;Open!  💎Garner The Double Discount If You Have&nbsp;Gempay!  <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-establishment-of-the-gempay-visual-identity-e8647d28a0dd">The Establishment Of The GEMpay Visual Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Configurations are part of a developer’s life. Configuration data is information your app needs to run and may include tokens for third-party systems or settings you pass into libraries. There are different ways to load configuration data as part of application initialization in <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>. Your requirements for configuration data might change based on needs. For example, you may have one unchanging configuration for your app, or you may need a different configuration based on the environment where the app is running. We’ll cover a few different ways to load configuration values and identify when you should use each method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re covering specific use cases using Angular, so this post assumes you have some experience developing Angular apps. If you’re interested in learning more about building your first Angular app, check out the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular">Angular Getting Started</a> docs or the <a>links to tutorials</a> that walk you through integrating Okta into Angular apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this post, we’ll cover the following forms of configuration:</p>
 
   defining configuration directly in code 
   defining configuration for different environments 
   loading configuration data via an API call 
 

<p>We’ll show examples, including how to integrate with Okta, for each method. Also, we’ll identify when to use each technique and what to watch out for.</p>

 Set up Angular and Okta in a sample project 

<p>First we’ll set up the base project and Okta resources so you can follow along with the post.</p>

<p>To keep things on an even playing field and avoid any new Angular feature funny-business, I’ll use an Angular v9 app in the code sample. All the outlined methods apply from Angular v7 to the current version, Angular v13.</p>
 Create the Angular app 

<p>You’ll need a version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> that works for the Angular app version you want to create.</p>

<p>I’m using Node v14.18.1 and npm v6.14.15 to create an Angular v9 app, but you can create the app for your favorite Angular v7+ version.</p>

<p>Use your globally installed Angular CLI to create an Angular app with routing and standard CSS for styling by running:</p>

   <code>ng new async-load --routing --style=css
</code>   

<p>Or create the Angular v9 app by running the following command:</p>

   <code>npx @angular/cli@9 new async-load --routing --style=css
</code>   

 Create the Okta application 

<p>Let’s create the Okta resource to have the configuration values we need to integrate.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>We’ll need the Okta Angular and Okta Auth JS libraries. Add them to your application by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-angular@5.1 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.0
</code>   

<p>This post won’t walk you through setting up sign-in and sign-out; we’re interested only in setting up the configuration. If the Angular app runs without errors, the configuration aspect is correct. To see the types of errors we’re trying to avoid, try excluding <code>issuer</code> or don’t replace the <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with the values you got back from the Okta CLI. The sample code repo does have sign-in and sign-out integrated so you can see authentication working all the way through.</p>

 Define configuration in code 

<p>When your configuration is static the most straightforward way to configure libraries is to define the configuration directly in the code. In this method, you’d define the configuration data in the <code>AppModule</code> or in a feature module in this method. Examples of this method might look something like defining the configuration for routes and passing it into the <code>RouterModule</code>:</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'profile', component: ProfileComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent, ProfileComponent ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes)
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>You might be surprised to see routing as an example of defining configuration directly in code.  And yet, when you pass application-wide configuration into a module’s <a href="https://angular.io/guide/ngmodule-faq#what-is-the-forroot-method"><code>forRoot()</code> static method</a> that’s precisely what you’re doing.</p>

<p>If you’ve followed many of our code examples and blog posts to integrate Okta into Angular apps, you’ve followed a similar pattern where configuration is defined directly in the application.</p>

<p>Your configuration code looks something like this:</p>

   <code>import { OktaAuthModule, OKTA_CONFIG } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientId', 
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
});

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent, ProfileComponent ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth } }
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>Summary of define configuration in code:</p>

<p>The most straightforward way to add configuration to your app is when the configuration does not change based on external factors.</p>

<p>When to use:</p>

 
   Use as often as you can since it’s the easiest way to configure things. 
 

<p>Best use cases:</p>

 
   Static app configurations 
   Configuring third-party libraries 
   Quick tests 
 

<p>Watch out for:</p>

 
   Configuration that involves private keys or tokens 
 

 Configuration that changes by environment 

<p>Angular has a built-in way to support per-environment differences using the <code>environments/environment.*.ts</code> files. When serving locally, Angular CLI uses the values in <code>environments/environment.ts</code>, and when you build for production, Angular CLI substitutes <code>environment.prod.ts</code> instead. You can see this file substitution defined in the <code>angular.json</code> build configuration. And if you have more environments to support, you can customize the build configuration to suit your needs.</p>

<p>The environment files are helpful when you have different configurations you want to support at build time. Some examples include enabling user analytics only on prod environments or defining the API endpoints your QA environment calls.</p>

<p><code>src/main.ts</code> contains an example of a configuration that changes based on the environment. Here you see the following:</p>

   <code>import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import { environment } from './environments/environment';

if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}
</code>   

<p>Angular utilizes the environment files to identify when to call the <code>enableProdMode()</code> method. Notice the file imports from <code>./environments/environment</code>. That’s because the build process handles that file swap.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at how we’d use this when integrating with Okta.</p>

<p>In <code>src/environments/environment.ts</code>, add the Okta auth configuration like this.</p>

   <code>export const environment = {
  production: false,
  authConfig: {
    issuer: '/oauth2/default',
    clientId: '{yourClientId}'
  }
};
</code>   

<p>In <code>src/environments/environment.prod.ts</code>, you’ll add the same <code>authConfig</code> properties with values that match your prod environment.</p>

<p>You’ll use the environment file to initialize the <code>OktaAuthModule</code> in the <code>AppModule</code> like this.</p>

   <code>import { OktaAuthModule, OKTA_CONFIG } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { environment } from '../environments/environment.ts';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  ...environment.authConfig,
  redirectUri: window.location.orgin + '/login/callback'
});

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent, ProfileComponent ],
  imports: [ BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule, OktaAuthModule ],
  providers: [
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth }}
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>Summary of configuration that changes by environment:</p>

<p>Customizing environment files is the Angular recommended method to inject values during build time.</p>

<p>When to use:</p>

 
   You have different configuration values based on build output 
 

<p>Best use cases:</p>

 
   Devmode - keep apps served locally from doing things only prod apps should do 
   Multiple staging environment systems 
 

<p>Watch out for:</p>

 
   Configuration that involves private keys or tokens 
   Run the build for each environment to test changes you make. You don’t want to miss adding a property and potentially get a runtime error. 
 

 Loading configurations from external APIs 

<p>Sometimes you need to load configuration at runtime. This makes sense if you use release promotion style deployments - creating a build for a staging/pre-production environment and promoting the same build to production after verification. You don’t want to create a new build, but what if your staging and production environments require different configurations? Loading configuration from an external API is handy in scenarios like these.</p>

<p>To keep things simple for this external API configuration method, I’ll focus only on the Okta example.</p>

<p>In this example, we’ll look at <code>src/main.ts</code> where we bootstrap the Angular application. When you need configuration before the application loads, we can take advantage of <code>platformBrowserDynamic()</code> platform injector’s <code>extraProviders</code> functionality. The <code>extraProviders</code> allows us to <a href="https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection#platform-injector">provide platform providers</a>, much in the same way we can provide application-wide providers in the <code>AppModule</code>.</p>

<p>Since we need to make the server call to get the configuration before we have a full Angular application context, we use Web APIs to call the API. Then we can configure the provider for Okta’s <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> injection token.</p>

<p>For a configuration API call response that looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "issuer": "/oauth2/default",
  "clientId": "{yourClientId}", 
  "redirectUri": "{correctHostForTheEnvironment}/login/callback"
}
</code>   

<p>…the code in your <code>src/main.ts</code> changes to:</p>

   <code>import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
import { environment } from './environments/environment';
import { OKTA_CONFIG } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}

fetch('http://{yourApiUri}/config').then(async res =&gt; {
  const authConfig = await res.json();

  platformBrowserDynamic([
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: {oktaAuth: new OktaAuth(authConfig)}}
  ]).bootstrapModule(AppModule)
    .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));
});
</code>   

<p>Then your <code>AppModule</code> only needs to import <code>OktaAuthModule</code> since you’ve already provided the <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> injection token.</p>

<p>If you need to create the callback URI programmatically or if you need to use the configuration in multiple places, you can store the configuration in the app instead. The minimum we need is a class that holds the config, which we will show in the example. You can wrap the config in a service if your needs are more involved than what we’ll show here.</p>

<p>You’ll add a new file and create an interface that matches the response, as well as a class to hold the config:</p>

   <code>export interface AuthConfig {
  issuer: string;
  clientId: string;
}

export class OktaAuthConfig {
  constructor(public config: AuthConfig) { }
}
</code>   

<p>Edit the <code>src/main.ts</code> to provide the <code>OktaAuthConfig</code> class instead</p>

   <code>import { OktaAuthConfig } from './app/auth-config';

fetch('http://{yourApiUri}/config').then(async res =&gt; {
  const authConfig = new OktaAuthConfig(await res.json());

  platformBrowserDynamic([
    { provide: OktaAuthConfig, useValue: authConfig }
  ]).bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));
})
</code>   

<p>In the <code>AppModule</code> you can provide the <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> needed to integrate with Okta by accessing <code>OktaAuthConfig</code>:</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent, ProfileComponent ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: OKTA_CONFIG,
      deps: [OktaAuthConfig],
      useFactory: (oktaConfig: OktaAuthConfig) =&gt; ({
        oktaAuth: new OktaAuth({
          ...oktaConfig.config,
          redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
        })
      })
    }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>You can now load a config from an API and use the app’s location.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself, “Isn’t there an <code>APP_INITIALIZER</code> token or something we can use instead”? Well, yes, there is an <a href="https://angular.io/api/core/APP_INITIALIZER"><code>APP_INITIALIZER</code> token</a> for executing initialization functions that complete before application initialization completes. However, in our case, we need the auth configuration in order to initialize. So, we need to finish loading the configuration before initializing the app, which we can do when bootstrapping.</p>

<p>Summary of loading configuration from an external API:</p>

<p>Load configuration from an API and provide the config to the application. Depending on your needs, the configuration loading may occur during bootstrapping or via <code>APP_INITIALIZER</code>.</p>

<p>When to use:</p>

 
   You want the configuration to load at runtime instead of being baked into the code 
   Your configuration properties include private information that you don’t want to commit to source control 
 

<p>Best use cases:</p>

 
   You have different configurations for staging and prod and use release-promotion style deployment processes 
   Your configuration changes frequently or often enough where building and deploying the app is not feasible 
 

<p>Watch out for:</p>

 
   Configuration errors or network blips - your app will not run since it’s dependent on the external API. 
   Anything that can decrease application load speed such as overly large configuration response, calling too many endpoints, or slow server response.

<p>This week’s Holochain release brings a substantial change to the HDK: validation is based on DHT ops, not source chain elements. This change is coming now as part of the core dev team’s effort to stabilise the HDK so you don’t have to refactor your code as often.</p><p>There’s a lot going on in the hApp ecosystem as well. Read on for all the news!</p> A note about breaking HDK changes <p>Before I share the release notes for the last two Holochain versions, I want to talk about what I mean when I describe some HDK changes as ‘breaking’. Generally I mean one of two things:</p>  Something in the hApp-dev-facing ‘surface area’ has changed — that is, public functions or types — and you need to refactor your code.  The hApp-dev-facing surface area hasn’t changed, but something in the conductor’s host API has changed behind the scenes, which requires you to recompile your zome code against the new HDK.  <p>But this morning the core devs educated me about another, more subtle breaking change. This change happens every time you update to a new HDK version, even if there aren’t any of the above sorts of changes. In fact, it happens every time you recompile your zome code — even if you stick to the same HDK version.</p><p>What is this breaking change? Every time you recompile, the DNA hash changes. This is because the Rust-to-WASM compiler doesn’t produce deterministic builds — at least, not without a lot of tooling work. We don’t have a step-by-step guide for setting up deterministic builds, and from what I understand it’s quite a difficult process.</p><p>I’m still searching for better language, to distinguish different kinds of break. Until I find the right words, I’ll just clarify whether a change breaks your code versus compatibility with the host API. If I say ‘no breaking changes’, however, know that you can still break compatibility with prior copies of your DNA’s compiled WASM simply by recompiling — HDK upgrade or not.</p> Holochain 0.0.126: Bug fixes, HDK consistency <p>Most of the work in this version was administrative — CI improvements, test coverage, and the like — there are three things worth knowing about.</p>  The HDK has been <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/">updated to 0.0.122</a>, with no breaking changes.  A panic on conductor startup has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1206">#1206</a>)  The HDK’s entry deletion functions <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/entry/fn.delete.html"><code>delete</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/entry/fn.delete_entry.html"><code>delete_entry</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/capability/fn.delete_cap_grant.html"><code>delete_cap_grant</code></a> now take a new <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/prelude/struct.DeleteInput.html"><code>DeleteInput</code></a> struct, which lets you specify relaxed chain top ordering just like create and update functions. This is not a breaking change, as you can still pass just a plain <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/prelude/type.HeaderHash.html"><code>HeaderHash</code></a> as before and it will get converted to a <code>DeleteInput</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1213">#1213</a>)  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.126/CHANGELOG.md#20220211091841">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.127: New validation approach, other HDK changes, gossip changes <p>The biggest developer-facing change in this release is a new approach to validation based on DHT operations rather than source chain elements (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1211">#1211</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1212">#1212</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1210">#1210</a>). And it’s a big breaking change. Here’s what you need to know:</p>  When an agent publishes a source chain element, it gets converted into a number of DHT operations that transform the data that other peers store. There are three kinds of operations: ones that create an entry, ones that create a header, and ones that affect metadata on an entry, header, or agent ID (such as a link, delete, update, or source chain change). You can get an overview of this in the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#a-cloud-of-witnesses">core concepts</a>.  Moving validation to operations forces you to think more deliberately about the previous point. This may make things complicated at first, but I feel that it also brings clarity and helps you reason more accurately about what’s happening on the DHT when an agent publishes one of their source chain elements.  Each zome has only <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/prelude/validate/index.html">one validation callback</a> which receives all operations it produced, as well as all operations not produced by any specific zome (such as those generated from system elements like the membrane proof or agent ID elements). All other validation callbacks are now obsolete.  The validation callback receives one parameter, an enum called <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/prelude/enum.Op.html"><code>Op</code></a>, that describes all seven kinds of operations and contains the appropriate element and entry data. The documentation describes the enum in depth, telling you which operations are created from which types of source chain elements.  If you look at the documentation for <code>Op</code>, you’ll notice that <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/prelude/enum.Op.html#variant.RegisterAgentActivity">agent activity ops</a> (changes to an agent’s source chain that get registered as DHT metadata on their agent ID entry) can now be validated.  The <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/prelude/struct.ValidationPackage.html">validation package</a>, which included a portion of the author’s source chain, is no longer passed to the validation callback. This <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/prelude/struct.ValidateData.html#structfield.validation_package">input field</a> had been empty for a while and will eventually be replaced by a host function which lets you query portions of the author’s source chain via the DHT. (For now you can iterate over the source chain using <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/entry/fn.must_get_header.html"><code>must_get_header</code></a> repeatedly.) All other dependencies can be retrieved using <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/chain/fn.get_agent_activity.html?search=must_get"><code>must_get_*</code></a> functions, as usual.  You can see code examples for the new validation approach in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/holochain-0.0.127/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace"><code>wasm_workspace</code> tests folder</a> (scroll down to ‘validate’).  <p>Here are the other changes in this release:</p>  Sharding is now turned on by default (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1237">#1237</a>). That means that each participant has less work to do in helping secure the integrity of an application’s network and data.  The HDK has been <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/">updated to 0.0.123</a>, with a few breaking changes in the HDK.  The <code>init</code> guest callback, called by the conductor when it runs a DNA for the first time, can now use the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/p2p/fn.call.html"><code>call</code></a> host function, allowing one agent to access functionality in <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#inter-zome-call">other zomes</a> within the same cell, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#bridge-call">other cells</a> with different DNAs on their own machine, or <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#remote-call">other agents’ cells</a> with the same DNA. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1186">#1186</a>)  The host exposes a new hashing utility function called <code>hash</code> with a lot more options. It’s not exposed via the HDK, but it does show up as a number of <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/hash/index.html">convenience functions</a>, including a refactor of the existing <code>hash_entry</code>. Now you can pass anything hashable — not just entries, but also headers and even raw bytes. If you’re passing raw bytes, you can receive either a 256-bit Blake2B hash (the default used by Holochain), a 256-bit <a href="https://keccak.team/keccak_specs_summary.html">Keccak</a> hash (used by Ethereum), or a 256-bit SHA3 hash. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1222">#1222</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1228">#1228</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1230">#1230</a>). Support for 256- and 512-byte SHA2 hashes is also planned.  Breaking: Your DNA manifest now takes an <code>origin_time</code> field, which defines the earliest timestamp that any source chain header may have. This prevents agents from forging nonsensical timestamps, but will also help with the efficiency of the not-yet-released fast gossip algorithm. Timestamps can be specified as an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339">RFC3339 time string</a>, or the number of microseconds since the start of the <a href="https://www.epochconverter.com/">UNIX epoch</a> if you’re good at math. If you don’t specify an origin time in your manifest, it’ll default to January 1st, 2022 at 00:00:00 UTC (maybe we should call this the start of the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/prelude/struct.Timestamp.html#associatedconstant.HOLOCHAIN_EPOCH">Holochain epoch</a>!) Unspecified origin times will eventually be deprecated. When you use the <code>hc dna init</code> command, it’ll populate the manifest with the system’s current time as an RFC3339 time string. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1224">#1224</a>)  Breaking: The P2P protocol has two changes which break compatibility with version 0.0.126 and lower. First, hashes are no longer passed along with data, as authorities need to calculate these anyway. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1233">#1233</a>) Second, in preparation for the new fast gossip algorithm, nodes can sync DHT data by ‘region’ (more on this when the new algorithm lands). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1234">#1234</a>)  There are also lots of updates to documentation courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/jost-s">Jost</a>, as part of our increased commitment to improving all developer documentation.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.127/CHANGELOG.md#20220223090000">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> DWeb webinar on decentralised storage <p>Our friends at the Internet Archive and DWeb are hosting monthly webinars on various decentralised web topics.

 Decentralised storage on Holochain with the file-storage module <p>On the topic of decentralised storage, I must mention the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/file-storage">file-storage module</a> created by <a href="https://github.com/guillemcordoba">Guillem Córdoba</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HedayatAbedijoo">Hedayat Abedijoo</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/harlantwood">Harlan Wood</a>. It accepts any kind of binary data, chunked into pieces 16MB or less for more equitable distribution around the DHT, and identified by a file manifest that lets you name it, give it a type, and specify who created it and when.</p><p>It includes examples of two DNAs: one in which everyone can write and retrieve data directly to and from the DHT, and one where they do it through peers who have agreed to be ‘providers’. This second approach could be used to create hosting incentives for certain files, for example.</p><p>Chunking is the responsibility of whatever client you create, because different chunking strategies might make more sense for different contexts. You may want to align your chunk boundaries along video frames, or optimise for lag-free streaming or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deduplication">deduplication</a>, or play with chunk sizes that have an impact on the amount of data each peer is asked to store. There is an example UI included that breaks files into 256 KB chunks before committing them to the DHT.</p><p>All in all, it’s pretty comprehensive! This module has actually been around for a long time, and I may or may not have mentioned it in a past Dev Pulse, but this seemed like a good time to bring it up!</p> Video: Scaffolding a hApp in less than 10 minutes <p>This is a workshop that Guillem Córdoba in the Web3 Infrastructure room at FOSDEM 2022. It starts with a great introduction to what Holochain is about, then proceeds to show you how to get started writing a hApp using our scaffolding tool, all while explaining how a hApp is architected. I haven’t tried it myself, but the tool looks both easy and comprehensive — it even lets you generate a basic UI!</p> Video and demo repo: Bundling your hApp with Electron <p>In the most recent <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/about-the-holochain-in-action-category/5448">Holochain in Action</a> video, Connor walks you through the process of bundling the Holochain conductor, your hApp, and your web-based UI into an Electron-based executable, using his <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain-template">template</a>. If this is something that you find exciting, you’ll probably want to look at this <a href="https://github.com/Connoropolous/hc-events/">example repo</a> that not only uses the Electron template but demonstrates how to use GitHub CI to do the building for you.</p> Forum conversation: Migrating data on DNA upgrade <p>The question of migration — what to do with all the data in an existing DHT when it’s time to upgrade the DNA — is a good one. There are design challenges involved, so it’s no surprise when someone brings up questions about it.</p><p>This <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/updating-the-source-code-is-going-to-create-a-new-chain/7885">forum thread about migration</a> is a good one. Connor Turland of <a href="https://sprillow.com/">Sprillow</a> lays out some good principles for migrating a hApp’s data and hints at the possibility of future changes that will make migration a less common occurrence. (Note: these changes are very likely to happen, but the details are still being worked out.)</p> Correction: dev.hc Discord invite URL <p>In the last Dev Pulse I made the mistake of sharing an invitation to the dev.hc Discord server that eventually expired. Here’s a <a href="https://discord.gg/usvDaqNeA7">permanent invite URL</a>; we’d love to see you there!</p><p>The dev.hc Discord server is created and stewarded by the community; it’s a great place to have informal conversations about developing Holochain apps or understanding the technical details better. And don’t forget the <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/">Holochain Forum</a> — not only is it a good place to have more in-depth conversations involving a lot of text and code, but there are a lot of great resources in past forum threads!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniegray?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Annie Gray</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/renovation?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Have you heard the&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/facebook-isnt-growing-anymore/">news</a>? Facebook has stopped growing.</p>



<p>In a first for the social media giant, its daily active user numbers dropped in the&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-events/default.aspx">last quarter of 2021</a>, and its monthly active user numbers remained steady in the second half of the year. The poor performance sent Meta Platforms stocks plummeting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/meta-faces-historic-stock-rout-after-facebook-growth-stalled-20220204-p59tpc">27%</a>&nbsp;on Wall Street earlier this month, a result “<a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/meta-faces-historic-stock-rout-after-facebook-growth-stalled-20220204-p59tpc">unprecedented in stock market history</a>”.</p>



 <a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/meta-faces-historic-stock-rout-after-facebook-growth-stalled-20220204-p59tpc">Observers</a>&nbsp;say this distinct lack of growth for Facebook comes from a convergence of substantial threats: 



<p></p>



  Facebook is an aging monolith that no amount of rebranding as part of the new shiny ‘Meta’ stable can hide or reverse. It’s arguably attracted all the new users it’s going to attract.  <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/07/we-told-you-so-apples-new-privacy-changes-validate-what-weve-done-for-years/">Apple iOS privacy changes</a>&nbsp;have hit Facebook’s ad revenue hard, at the same time as advertisers are tightening their belts.  The platform admits it’s facing stiff competition for user time and attention from TikTok and YouTube, and its own answer to TikTok, Reels, isn’t engaging users as quickly as hoped.  



<p>We would add another substantial threat to this list: the privacy tide is turning. We’ve been saying for a long time that&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers are fed up</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">trading their privacy for access</a>&nbsp;to products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumers have never been louder in their calls for better protection of their personal data by the brands and products they engage with, and it seems Facebook just isn’t hearing them or responding seriously enough. And we all know Facebook isn’t the only one.</p>

				  12月にハイパーレジャー東京ミートアップイベントに、インディシオが招待され、プレゼンテーションさせて頂きました。その時の要約をこちらに記します。  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Trussted Data Ecosystemの仕組み　</p>
<p>この図式にあるように、Trussted Data Ecosystemは、</p>
<p>シームレスで効率的なデータエクスチェンジシステムです。Issuer, Credential Holder, Credential Verifierを含みます。どうして私たちがこのようなシステムを構築しているかというと、現在存在しているデータモデルは、信頼できないシステムだからです。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>インディシオがTrussted Data Ecosystemに取り組んでいる背景：アナログからデジタルへの歴史</p>
<p>＜紀元前3200年前から1964年まで＞私たちはアナログの世界で書類を郵送したり、持ち運んだりして書類をエクスチェンジしてました。</p>
<p>Notarity (公証人) から封を閉じられたスタンプ付きの封筒や郵便局で登録された書類など、持ってきた人がポケットに入ってた封筒を手渡したりしてきましたね。</p>
<p>＜1964年からこれまで＞信頼できる効率化されたプライバシーが保護されたハイブリットな世界が出来上がりましたが、便利になった分、たくさんの信頼を犠牲にしました。書類をスキャンしてアップロードしたり、デジタル化されたドキュメントやデータをEメールするようになり、効率は高まりましたが、トラストやプライバシーを失いました。Eメールを受け取ったり送ったりすることで中央集権型となり、便利にはなりましたが、送信や受信したEメールは、信頼やプライバシーを失いました。</p>
<p>＜Decentralized Idneity（分散型ID）の世界＞このような三つの要因　Trust, Efficiency, Privacyをオプティマイズすることで、効率を最大限にし、データエクスチェンジの際、分散型IDを利用することで、プライバシーを保護することが可能となりました。</p>
<p>アナログ vs. デジタル：プラスチックでできている免許証は、もし偽造された場合、もし例えば、プラスティックの免許証の一部の加工の仕方が一般に目にするものと違っていたり、都道府県が表記されていなかったりすると、これは偽物じゃないかと思うかと思います。このように、アナログの世界では物理的な変化があるとこのデータが本物か偽物かが判断できます。これが、デジタルの世界になると、デジタルIDが本物か偽物かどうかを判断するのには、物理的なプラスティックなカードではなくなるので、わかりにくくなりますが、Decentralized ID分散型IDの世界だとわかります。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>信頼性のあるモデル</p>
<p>信頼性はTrustedモデル（信頼性のあるモデル）に存在しています。こちらの図式にありますのが、Trustモデルのガバナンス（ステークホルダーとの信頼関係を築くための管理体制）です。</p>
<p>このガバナンスは、二つのフォームによって成り立っています。一つは、コードで書かれた暗号化された信頼と、署名を読み取りに行ったり、本当の情報を読みに行ったりします。</p>
<p>もう一つは、哲学的な信頼です。この図の右にあるお店のオーナーが、データが送られてくる機関または業者が、どの信頼できる機関であるかどうかを選んで決めさえすれば、このガバナンス内で、信頼されたデータを受け取ることができます。</p>
<p>データを受け取った時に、データが信頼された機関から送られてきたかどうか、このガバナンスで、Machine Reachableなやり方で実行されます。そして、お店のオーナーは、送られてきた情報が、信頼できる情報かどうかを判断します。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>＜ビルディングブロック＞　＊図式は、Cardeaプロジェクトで使われた説明図です。</p>
<p>インディシオで世界中のクライアントに使っているビルディングブロックは、オープンソースのものですので、全く同じものが誰にでもアクセスできます。一番下の部分にあるブロックにイミュータブルデータ（作成後にその状態を変えることのできないデータ）のブロックがあります。このブロックは、Issuer（発行者）のDecentralized Identifier(DID)が保存するためにあります。スキーマは、違った参加者の間で共有されるかもしれません。クレデンシャルの定義、基本的には、それぞれのフィールドのパブリックキーとなるものが、それぞれの Issuer（発行者）によって署名されます。レボケーション(取り消し)レジストリー情報は、最終的な確認を常に最新情報としてアップデートされています。テールファイルに続いているアキュムレーターやデルタ、これらの四つの基盤となるデータがパブリックレジャーに書かれます。これらの四つの基本となるデータが全体のシステムをサポートしています。またインディシオは、私たち自身でネットワークを運営しています。テストネット、デモネット、プロダクションネットワークです。ハイパーレジャーINDYベースのネットワークの中でも一番大きなネットワークです。５つの大陸に跨って、25のノードオペレータがいます。ノードオペレータは、ソフトウエアをアップデートしたり、プレミアムコードを書いたりしています。デモネットは、ネットワーク上でテストする方々のためにあります。そして、メインネットは、プロダクションユースケースのためです。他のネットワークとのやりとりは、世界中で行われており、ヨーロッパや、アメリカ、その他様々なところで使われております。顧客の様々な機能のタイプによって、例えば、政府によっては自身のプライベートネットワークが必要となり、決められた範囲内に情報が置かれていないといけない場合もありますし、その場合は、それぞれの地域で法律が違うので世界のネットワークでの運営は避けています。</p>
<p>このVerifiable Credentialの技術で面白い点は、Verifiable Credential が扱うデータ、PIIはパブリックレジャーに残らないことです。エンドユーザーがコントロールしています。そのためにプライバシーが守られているデザインで、コンプライアンスも保護されています。レジャーが使われるのは、データが正確なものかどうかを確かめるためだけに使われます。IDを発行したIssuerから署名されており、他の誰からも署名されてないのを確認されて、Holderに届きます。そして、誰か信用している人から署名されていることを確認します。Holderのウォレット（お財布）の中あるデータは、すでに同意されたものが保護されたまま、やりとりされます。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>＜クリプトグラフィー暗号について＞</p>
<p>ハイパーレジャーインディのエコシステム上で走っています。どのような暗号法による計算によって、実際に証明書が発行されているか、クリプトグラファーが１４３ものステップを一つ一つ説明してくれました。もしこのクリプトグラフィーに興味があって、詳細を見たい方、オンラインで、ドキュメンテーションが見れます。Issuerは、暗号ツールを使って署名したり、DIDやパブリックキーを使ったり、またはパブリックキーと同じようなものを使って、レジャーにおきます。署名されてきちんと処理された証明書がIssuerそしてHolderに届くように承認します。 ハイパーレジャーで使われている、ZKPスタイル、zero knowledge proofの仕組みによって、エンドユーザは、選別的情報開示またはpredicate proofs述語証明と呼ばれるやり方で、一部のフィールドを見えないようにしたり、または選んだフィールドだけを見えるようにした証明書を提示できます。例えば、年齢が18歳以上という規定があり、年齢が18歳以上かどうかだけを確認する場合は、体重や住所は必要ない情報ですので、開示する必要がないですよね。こういった必要な情報だけを開示する設定ができます。これらは、クリプトグラフィーの中でも重要な部分で、Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature / CL signature と呼ばれる署名スタイルです。</p>
<p>Verifierは、ほとんどの情報をキャッシュできることです。空港の中など、インターネットのアクセスが限られている場所が多いと思います。Wifiのコネクションが悪いところでも、HolderとVerifierとまだやりとりできます。</p>
<p>＜Cardeaプロジェクト＞</p>
<p>病院などのメディカルIssuerがデータをHolderに渡し、そして、Holderは政府や航空会社の人たちに、空港などでワクチン接種の証明書や、PCR検査の結果などを見せます。みなさんはご存知かと思いますが、こういった状況の中では、いつも政府と医療関係者やそのコミュニティがうまく一緒に調和できるとは限らないんですよね。ですので、こういった状況では大変便利なツール・技術となります。なぜなら直接、政府と医療関係のシステムをインテグレーション しなくても、プライバシーを保護しながらデータを受け渡しできるからです。</p>
<p>私たちのクライアントの中には、ヨーロッパの顧客が多いです。彼らは、GDPRのレギュレーションの中で、ビジネスをしている会社ですので、プライバシー保護法には非常に敏感でPIIパーソナルデータの扱いに気をつけています。GDPRの違反で、多大な罰金を払っている会社の記事を新聞などでご覧になったかと思います。Verifierが、ビジネスに必要な扱わなければならない情報だけを扱うことで、コーポレーションにおいてはリーガルチーム、法務部やエグゼクティブにはかなり助かるツールなんですね。重要なのは、技術的な部分とビジネスやそのオペレーションの部分のバランスを取りながら、ソリューションを築いていくことです。それぞれの会社にとって、ビジネスチーム、リーガルチーム、マーケティングチーム全ての部署の人たちがハッピーに満足できるように進めていくことで、満足いく結果が生まれます。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>＜コードアーキテクチャ＞</p>
<p>基盤となるライブラリは前までは、ハイパーレジャーインディだけだったのですが、今はハイパーレジャーUrsaと分裂しました。なぜなら他のいくつものプロジェクトとも共有できるようになったからです。クリプトグラフィ・ライブラリに様々な面白いオプションができて、クリプトグラフィック暗号Suiteが可能になったからです。今では中国のアルゴリズムも含まれています。一部の方々は、どうしてユニバーサルに信頼されていないアルゴリズムを含まなければいけないんだろう、と思われる方がいるかと思います。けれども、クリプトグラフィックライブラリの違ったコンポーネントは、一部の国や地域にそったレギュレーションの必要条件に合わせなければなりません。ハイパーレジャーインディプロジェクトでは、cl signaturesに集中していたのですが、新しいシグネチャスタイルが査定されて、cryptographic suiteに付け加えられました。シンプルなシグネチャも付け加えられました。新しいsignatureスタイルは、シンプルな署名も扱えます。Jason LD　Signatureでパッケージを署名することで、全てのデータを明らかにすることができます。フィールドは５つしかないのですが。ZKPスタイルのSignature署名は、意味がないのかもしれません。</p>
<p>そして、BBS　Plusというのも査定されました。新しい署名タイプで、ハイパーレジャーウルサのライブラリに付け加えられました。これらはレイヤーが上の部分を利用することができます。</p>
<p>この左側にある緑の部分にあたる部分ですが、レジャーそのものを形作ってます。現在、コンセンサスアルゴリズム　インディプレナムコード、これはPBFT (practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) ビザンチン障害耐性をもつ分散合意アルゴリズムの 1 つです。</p>
<p>レジャーを常にシンクさせています。そうすることで、みんながレジャーに何が書かれているかを同意することができ、変更できません。</p>
<p>インディノードは、トランザクションを受け取るところで、トランザクションをレジャーから査定したり、書いたり、読んだりまたは誰か使う必要がある人に戻したりするところです。</p>
<p>ハイパーレジャープラグインもあります。実験的なトークンのプラグインです。例えば、ネットワーク上でトークンを使って、トークンネットワークフィまたはバリューエクスチェンジの他のタイプを試したりします。</p>
<p>これらのプラグインは、みなさんがノードやプレナムコードを強制的に変化させたりすることなく、ネットワークの機能を延長させることができます。</p>
<p>右側の部分をみてみましょう。これらはノードコードの若干上にありまして、アプリケーションに書き込むようにしています。</p>
<p>indie resolver は、DIDが基本的なアドレスです。DIDメソッドを用いて、解明します。そして、ある情報を取りにいくのに、どこのレジャーにいけば良いかなどです。</p>
<p>Resolverの上にあるSDKは、エージェントコードより簡単で、エージェントコードがその上にあります。典型的なエージェントコードは、AriesAgentです。クラウドエージェントパイソンまたはACA-Py(Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python)また、Biフォールドプロジェクトは、このAries Framework Javascriptの上にあります。</p>
<p>他の違ったフレームワークもGoやJAVAにもあります。全てインターオペラブルに使われています。なぜなら同じプロトコルとスタンダードを維持しているからで、エンタープライズやモバイルアプリがそれぞれ一番上にありまして、コミュニティによってカスタマイズされています。IndiesやAries　Ursaを使ってみたい方、是非この図の上から初めてください。この図のしたから始めないでくださいね。すでにあるエージェントを使ったり、コードやサンプルを今いらっしゃる業界の必要に応じて修正したら良いです。</p>
<p>プレゼンテーション後、たくさんの良い質問を頂きました。中でも皆さんが気にされていたのは、ゼロ知識証明に関することだと思いました。質問は、「ゼロ知識証明は既に社会実装可能な技術でしょうか。技術的困難は残されていますか。」でした。ゼロ知識証明は、すでに実装されています。技術的な詳細も公開されています。新しい署名スタイルができれば、リビューされたり、実行したりできます。ですから、技術は使用可能な状態ですので、開発を遅らせる必要はないです</p>
<p>もし詳細など、御質問等などございましたら、兼原麻弥 maya@indicio.techまで直接、お気軽にご連絡ください。</p>

				   Cardea Interopathon II : March 17 
<p>After its first successful Interop-a-thon, Cardea is back with new features to implement and test against! The first is a new out-of-band invitation protocol—a change coming to Hyperledger Aries on March 31. This is a great opportunity for anyone using Hyperledger Aries to get ahead of the change and ensure interoperability. You don’t have to be involved in Cardea or building health credential solutions to participate—all companies using Aries agents are welcome!</p>

				   Machine Readable Governance is the Key to Scaling Decentralized Trust 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating decentralized trust online is a difficult enough task on its own, but how do you drive growth and adoption once you have it? We dive deep into that topic and what we believe are the best options in our latest blog.</p>

				   Self-Sovereign Identity: Expectations &amp; Reality 
<p>Christopher Allen and Charlyn Ho took part in the February meeting of the Indicio Identity Community Meetup group, with moderator Heather Dahl, to reflect on the roots of self-sovereign identity and share thoughts on whether ‘true SSI’ can, or should be, achieved. The fireside chat style discussion took a dive into the often confused vocabulary of the industry that is misunderstood and mis-used. The group looked at ways that both the technological and theoretical foundations of SSI can serve as a basis for a Trusted Data Ecosystem that brings value, control, and privacy to both enterprise and individuals.</p>

				   When it Comes to Decentralized Identity, Sell Solutions Not Rules 
<p>The real power of decentralized identity is that it enables incredibly flexible solutions within a privacy and security-driven framework. In our recent blog we explain our take on why when it comes to realizing the value of Trusted Data Ecosystems, people should focus on building solutions.</p>

<p>Art in a decentralized world.&nbsp;</p>



 The rise of NFTs.&nbsp; 



<p>NFTs are by far one of the hottest topics at the moment. In March 2021 artist Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, sold one of his artworks as NFT at the auction house Christies for 69 million USD. The sale made him one of the top three most valuable living artists. Less than a year later, the leading NFT marketplace OpenSea kicked off the year with a NFT trading volume of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-monthly-volumes-top-5b-as-nfts-continue-to-mainstream">more than </a>5 Billion USD in January 2022. This equals the volume of the whole of 2021. Ever since, it’s fair to say that NFTs are out of the niche. Is this the future of art? Maybe – but what’s for sure is that NFTs are here to stay.&nbsp;</p>



 What are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)?&nbsp; 



<p>NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens are non-interchangeable tokens stored on a blockchain or other form of distributed ledger. The tokens can represent any form or data, from a picture or video to a digital asset in a video game. Due to their unique non-interchangeable traits, NFTs are often compared to traditional collectibles, like playing cards or artworks – just with the difference of being fully digital.&nbsp;</p>



 How are NFTs different from cryptocurrencies?&nbsp; 



<p>Unlike NFTs, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">cryptocurrencies</a> are fungible, meaning that every unit is the same. Like with traditional FIAT currencies like EUR, USD and GBP, every monetary unit is equal and interchangeable. In practice, NFTs are usually purchased with cryptocurrencies, like Ether (ETH) or Solana (SOL). In other words, NFTs are the good you are buying, while crypto is the mean to pay for it.&nbsp;</p>



 Where can I buy NFTs, and how are they stored?&nbsp; 



<p>There are many dedicated NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea, Rarible or Nifty Gateway. In addition, some projects, such as Axie Infinity, NBA Top Shot or Sorare have their own marketplace and sometimes even their own cryptocurrency. In addition, many of the established crypto exchanges like Coinbase or Binance are expanding into NFT trading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some marketplaces also allow you to store NFTs, they are typically stored in a personal wallet. The most popular wallet for storing NFTs is MetaMask. After purchasing a NFT on a marketplace, the token can be transferred to your personal wallet for storage.&nbsp;</p>



 Notable NFT projects.&nbsp; 



<p>Even though the NFT trend is still fairly new, there is already thousands of projects out there. Here are a few projects worth watching.&nbsp;</p>



 



Project nameDescription<a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">Crypto Kitties</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect and breed unique kittens. One of the first NFT projects with significant traction.<br><a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks">Crypto Punks</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect unique punk-themed avatars. Popular as Twitter profile picture.<br><a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a><br>Collect unique and evolve ape-themed avatars. Popular as Twitter profile picture.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect and battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><a href="https://sorare.com/">Sorare</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect digital cards of football players. Over 200 officially licensed clubs.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://nbatopshot.com/">NBA Top Shot</a>&nbsp;<br>Collectible short video clips from the NBA basketball league.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924">Beeple</a>&nbsp;<br>In March 2021 artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, sold one of his artworks as NFT at the auction house Christies. The sale made him one of the top three most valuable living artists.<br>



 



 Fine art – a long history of money laundering.&nbsp; 



<p>Long before NFTs existed, fine art has been used as a store of value, and with that comes a long history of money laundering. Unlike with other assets, like stocks or gold, the value of an artwork is highly subjective to the viewer or owner. Popular paintings are often valued in the double-digit millions with the most famous artworks, like the <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6110563">Salvator Mundi by Leonardo da Vinci, being last sold for more than 450 million USD</a>. Therefore, artworks, mostly paintings, are perfect for storing, moving and exchanging large amounts of value in a very compact form. In consequence, paintings and other artworks have a long history of smuggling and money laundering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February 2022, the United States Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a “<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury_Study_WoA.pdf">Study of the Facilitation of Money Laundering and Terror Finance Through the Trade in Works of Art</a>”. The report showcases the risk of money laundering through art trade being bigger than ever.&nbsp;</p>



 Why NFTs are attractive for money laundering. 



<p>NFTs essentially are digital artworks and therefore have the same traits as conventional art. In addition, NFTs come with the benefit of being fully digital, making them much easier to trade compared to moving physical art. Like with cryptocurrencies, a NFT can be transferred from one wallet or owner to another within seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the trait that makes NFTs particularly attractive for money laundering purposes are the volatile prices. While the exchange rate of Bitcoin to EUR follows the market principles of supply and demand, the prices of NFTs are highly speculative. In practice, a NFT that was just bought for 1 EUR can be sold for 1 million EUR the next day. This makes NFTs attractive for laundering black money through legitimate transactions. </p>



<p>While blockchains allow to trace these transactions between wallets, without a KYC of the wallet holder, it’s easier than ever to anonymously transfer value. For these reasons and according to the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) the “<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury_Study_WoA.pdf">Emerging Digital Art Market</a>” presents an immense threat for potential money laundering and financial crime.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC in a decentralized world.&nbsp; 



<p>Like with crypto exchanges a few years ago, most NFT marketplaces are not requiring a KYC from their users. For the same reasons as for crypto, buying and trading NFTs on platforms without a KYC process can be <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">an immense risk for both users and platform operators</a> alike.&nbsp;</p>



 What regulation are NFTs falling under. 



<p>Most national regulators just caught up with regulating cryptocurrencies, like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/11-fold-increase-in-bitcoin-account-openings/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) or Ether (ETH). For example, the EU with the implementation of the AMLD 5 extended the coverage of their AML regulations to include cryptocurrencies. However, due to NFTs being cryptographic yet different because of their non-fungible traits, they are not necessarily covered in existing laws or often fall into grey zones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in September 2020, the European Commission presented a proposal for the regulation of cryptoassets, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593">Markets in Cryptoassets Regulation, or MiCA proposal</a>. As part of this proposal, the EU for the first-time defined criteria for classifying cryptoasset as a “digital representation of value or rights which may be transferred and stored electronically, using distributed ledger technology or similar technology”. This would extend the coverage to at least partially include NFTs. While the MiCA proposal is still just a proposal, it’s expected to come into effect soon as rising trading volumes are driving demand for clear taxation laws.&nbsp;</p>



 Why NFT marketplaces should implement KYC &amp; AML procedures. 



<p>With rising popularity and especially exploding trading volumes, it’s ultimately only a question of time until the regulators will extend their AML coverage to NFTs. In parallel, the same discussion is happening around <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a>. In addition, compliant platforms with proper KYC procedures would potentially boost mass adoption. In particular, institutional investors as well as brands require compliant solutions to stay away from money laundering themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, NFT marketplaces and platforms now have the chance to act &nbsp;sooner rather than later, and proactively add KYC procedures, before the AML regulations will enforce it.&nbsp;</p>

Otherwise, how can we be sure we are interacting with whom we mean to? Unfortunately, we are far from where we need to be. For businesses, legal identity is obtained through registration with a country’s business registration authority. In that process, the business is “born,” and ideally, it should be assigned a unique identifier and business name that is meant to facilitate its authentication and interaction with the government and other stakeholders. This information is collected into business registries.”</p><p>As a digital “identity card”, DID can not only help users prove their identity through uniqueness, but also return data and privacy to users through blockchain technology, solving information leakage and advertising harassment caused by the centralization of the traditional Internet. Ontology has been working in the DID industry for several years, and has gradually reached cooperative relations with service providers in various industries and fields around the world. Through the comprehensive deployment of DID, global users will have a unique digital identity, which can not only protect and manage identity and privacy, but also log in to various dApps with one click, maintaining identity unity and data interoperability.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Successful year supports IDnow’s journey towards becoming the European leader in identity verification and authentication 
<p>Munich, February 23rd, 2022, IDnow, a leading European Identity Proofing Platform, reports another record year, closing 2021 by organically doubling the number of transactions in its core business. The growth rate is fueled by strong momentum in new sales, increased use of the platform among its existing client base and is further supported by the successful integration of ARIADNEXT in France and identity Trust Management AG (“identity.TM”) in Germany.</p>
<p>The acceleration of advanced digital business models has led to a shift in demand from single-product identity verification towards comprehensive identity proofing platforms. IDnow’s acquisitions of ARIADNEXT and identity.TM in 2021 have allowed the Company to seamlessly meet this rising demand across Europe with one of the broadest sets of identity verification methods available in the market.</p>
<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO at IDnow, commented: “Our goal is to build the leading unified identity proofing platform that meets the multi-dimensional user needs of our customers, whilst meeting stringent and often complex regulatory demands. Through our successful M&amp;A ventures, the IDnow group is now positioned to offer best-in-class products and services that deliver a seamless user experience across an expansive range of geographies and verticals.”</p>
<p>The combined IDnow platform provides a holistic suite of products, catering to the advanced needs of its leading, international clients. In the past year, IDnow added a record number of new clients, including some of the fastest-growing European brands, such as eToro and Lydia. The IDnow platform is used by leading companies globally, with half of the top 20 banks in Europe as well as each of the top 4 relevant telecommunication operators in France and Germany relying on its services.</p>
<p>IDnow has made a series of senior hires in the past year to support the Company’s rapid growth, including Johannes Meerloo as COO, Doug Pollock as Director of Customer Success, Jamie Turner as Vice President People as well as Dr. Heinrich Grave as Senior Vice President Digital Identity. The Company has also opened offices in the UK as well as in the Middle East to cater to regional surges in demand.</p>
<p>“The identity verification and proofing space is experiencing tremendous growth as companies increasingly adopt digital-first strategies. Our automated verification product solutions have proven themselves to be the first choice for some of the biggest companies across Europe, which is a testament to the levels of fraud assurance we continuously offer our customers. Looking forward to the rest of the year, I am very excited about our position in the market. With our holistic identity proofing platform, strengthened team and additional regional locations, we’re in a unique position to offer enterprises exactly what they need from a single source,” says Andreas Bodczek. “I am looking forward to 2022 – a year in which we will continue to bring our three combined companies closer together and strive for increased market leadership as a unified force.”</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Authentication without passwords is the goal that many businesses have already set, but very few have delivered. Now, WebAuthN is one of the standards that we hear the most lately. So today we’ll have a critical assessment of WebAuthN. And we’ll see, is it ready to deliver its promise? And for that we have a special guest who is Olly Brough.</p>
<p>He’s Managing Director of EMEA at Trusona. Olly has built his career delivering best in class payments, anti-fraud, and identity solutions to leading retail, financial services and public sector clients working with a variety of high growth technology companies in Europe and overseas. Prior to joining Trusona, Olly led European sales and marketing functions of privately-owned technology businesses to successful exit including QAS; an identity and data quality business, Eiger Systems; a consumer payment collection platform, Cambridge Global Payments; a cross border bank payments service, and 41st Parameter; the online device intelligence platform.</p>
<p>Hello, Olly.</p>
<p>Olly Brough: Hello, Oscar. Good morning to you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Good morning. And welcome, let’s talk about data identity. But as always, I want to hear more about our guests. So please, Olly, tell us a bit more about yourself and how was your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Olly: Thank you, Oscar. So yeah, my name is Olly. I’m based here in the UK. My focus is, as you said, has been very much around growing technology companies across Europe. I think I somewhat stumbled into the world of identity. I first joined, over 25 years ago, a data verification business that was at the time flexed on helping organisations increase the integrity of their name and address data for old style mailing campaigns, just before the internet was a big thing.</p>
<p>But of course, that morphed into identity verification, because once you have names and addresses and date of birth, you can then start to verify identities. And that business was acquired by Experian, the big PLC. Then really through that, my experience sort of morphed into identity verification. And then I got into the whole area of online security, which is where I am now initially through 41st Parameter, but now focusing on Trusona.</p>
<p>And then finally I dipped into payments along the way. But then payments, as you know, is also very heavily associated with the world of online authentication because payments can’t happen unless they’ve been authenticated in the right way. So yeah, it’s been an interesting last 25 years – long may it continue.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, super interesting journey, touching several industries so you say that were very close to identity. And excellent, OK, so we are going to discuss about especially WebAuthN, if you can tell us first what is that?</p>
<p>Olly: Yeah. Well, first of all, I’ll give it a little bit of context. Trusona was established over five years ago in Arizona, with great backing from the likes of sort of Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins. If I’m honest, we always would have hoped that progress would have been quicker in those early years. But I think many people have the vision to remove passwords and other static authenticators like less OTPs and the like. But I think to a degree, the technology has been the constraining factor in terms of standards that are available to use to bring more consumers into using passwordless capabilities. That’s been there a little bit more in the workplace type environment, but perhaps been a limiting factor when trying to authenticate consumers.</p>
<p>So WebAuthN, the question you asked is, what is WebAuthN and why would you use it? Well, WebAuthN I think is the most exciting development that I’ve seen over the last four and a half years working with Trusona. And it is a standard that has been adopted by FIDO. OK, now, W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, created the standard. And FIDO, which stands for Fast Identity Online. And really FIDO is an alliance, an open industry association that’s mission is helping create standards to remove passwords from those secure interactions. OK? So they are bankrolled by the likes of Google, Apple, Microsoft, and all the usual suspects. And they have a common interest in helping to standardise on the internet so that we can better authenticate individuals and move away from passwords.</p>
<p>So in terms of explaining what WebAuthN is, then probably the best way to describe it is we’ve all now had that experience of being able to open an app and tap in the app to identify yourself, or at least most of us are familiar with that. I, for example, bank with StarlingBbank but you might have other services – where Starling bank, for example in the UK, forces you to use the app and therefore every time you want to authenticate or accept a card payment or move a payment, they will ask you to open your app and to tap in the app using face ID or your touch ID. And I think people now accept that if you have that app, then that is a really good experience for consumers.</p>
<p>The problem with that type of technology, which is stuff that Trusona has been helping people with, is if you do not have the app for the brand, so let’s say I’m trying to talk to my telco, and I don’t have the Vodafone app on my phone. Then Vodafone do not have the capability to ask me just to tap or look into the device to authenticate. Because that is only available if you have that relationship with a native mobile app, the My Vodafone app.</p>
<p>To put it into context, I’m trying to explain that problem and then that will explain why WebAuthN is a useful technology. The problem is if you take the telco industry, for example, then only about 18% of their customers have actually got around to downloading the app. So if you were posing a solution for telcos to authenticate their customers, then you’re proposing a solution that only addresses 18% of their customers, whilst the rest of the world, the other 82%, are still stuck with passwords and usernames and SMS OTPs and the like.</p>
<p>What WebAuthN has done is enabled that same tap in app experience but without the need to have the brand’s native mobile app. It effectively allows the likes of Vodafone to deliver the same experience, but through their mobile website, and using the Chrome or the Safari, or Microsoft Edge app that is installed on the device as the app, so that they do not have to establish that app-base relationship to have that tap and go experience of authentication.</p>
<p>So what WebAuthN really means is that when consumers pull their new phones out of the box, they already have the standard on their device. And there is no technology to be delivered to the customer to enable them to be able to cleanly authenticate to a brand, which means that now instead of 18% of people being able to do it, 100% of people can now have that same tap and go experience. Is that clear? There’s quite a bit of detail there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes. I think a good idea is the way you clarified. First of all, you start explaining that there are already nowadays, in the last year, they already have been companies’ services that offer their own proprietary own branded authenticator app, mobile app, which authenticate or which, as you said, the user experience is normally good, that works and is secure. And now, to make it more accessible to everybody, that kind of app is just in every browser, at least in the browser who are supporting WebAuthN. Correct?</p>
<p>Olly: That’s correct. Yeah. It is available to everybody out of the box on all new mobile devices. And increasingly, it’s available on desktop devices.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. It sounds super convenient. Of course, you don’t have to install an app. If it sounds so convenient, as you are describing it, why we don’t see this so much. Actually, I think once I try with GitHub, I try but I haven’t found, I haven’t heard many services that offer it. So is it really available now?</p>
<p>Olly: So first of all, let’s address the question as to whether it’s a technology that’s here to stay, or it might disappear in the next 12 to 24 months? The answer is it’s definitely here to stay. Today, about 85% of all smartphones in Western Europe have the capability already. OK? So I think that’s something that people don’t understand.</p>
<p>It is there. The reason there was a delay was that it took a little while for Apple and their iOS operating system to adopt the standard and that happened in September 2021. And now, as those updates have been updated to those Apple devices, there’s a very, very high penetration, it’s almost 100% of Apple mobile smartphone devices.</p>
<p>Coming back to your question about why haven’t you seen it out there? You will now increasingly, it’s being used by some of the core services that Apple and Google deliver themselves, things like Apple Pay and Google Pay and the like. But the challenge is, it’s really- until Apple came to the party back in September 2021, it’s been very difficult for people to deliver use cases. But now that it’s in place in the last year, we’re seeing an increasing incidence of projects using this type of technology. So it’s definitely here to stay.</p>
<p>The challenge is, you probably won’t realise that you’re using it, because the experience is very, very good. It is simply like just unlocking your smartphone device. And so you will be using it in instances that you have no awareness that this is WebAuthN, because why should you? You as a consumer, all you care about is being able to authenticate and get what you want.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So it means that it’s been already, let’s say for the last month, at least available on the services side, but not available because of Apple, Apple didn’t support it on their clients.</p>
<p>Olly: But now it’s in iOS 14 so it’s pretty much, unless you have a very old Apple device, you will have WebAuthN available on your device. As I say, I think the key point is it is being used, but people aren’t aware of it because you wouldn’t explain to the consumer, “Do you want to log on using WebAuthN?” They will say, “Do you want to use biometrics to log on?” And they’ll tap and that’ll be done, and they won’t think any more about it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. I think it’s a good time to hear about the use cases. So I’d like to hear which use cases are being used already.</p>
<p>Olly: So, where we’re seeing the most activity is really in two areas. And I’m talking about on the consumer side of things at the workforce level, then authenticator apps are pretty well-established as a mechanism to do second factor authentication. And you will now see on the workforce side, we’ve already got deployments whereby organisations are using WebAuthN instead of an authenticator app to passwordless the MFA into single sign-on environments like Okta, for example.</p>
<p>So that’s one area, the workforce environment where CISOs want to get rid of passwords, and they want MFA. And they don’t want to have to go around policing everybody to download and enrol to the authenticator app. They just want to move that overhead. So that’s one area.</p>
<p>On the consumer side, I’d say there are two areas of real interest to us. One is the customer services area, which has always been strong because people don’t realise the cost of passwords, pins and codes to customer services. Ultimately, if I can’t self-serve, then I will pick up the phone to customer services, which drives up costs. So it’s always, while security is important, really, the areas where good ROI is delivered is where there’s a real meaningful cost upon the business of passwords, usernames, pins and codes.</p>
<p>So for customer services, we are seeing a lot of interest in using this over chat discussions. If you have an open chat discussion, at some point, the brand will want to enable account servicing via chat. But they can’t do that, because it is very difficult to authenticate someone over a chat discussion. Whereas if you have the WebAuthN capability, you can literally just send a message that enables the customer to tap on the screen, look into the device, and they have authenticated themselves. And now they can move that chat journey into the account servicing level where I might want to change my address. And a lot of time chat discussions are limited to initial sort of high-level questions, but you always have to then pick up the phone if you want something more serious done. So that’s one area that we’re seeing quite good demand.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest is the replacement of SMS. So whilst this is not a true passwordless deployment, SMS is seen as a real pain for businesses. Why is that? Well, one, it costs money. So finance people don’t like it, that can be very, very expensive. Number two, it has a attritional impact and we’ve seen that with PSD2 and Strong Customer Authentication and payments across Europe. There are attrition rates associated with SMS of between 10% and 30%, OK? We’ve all had that experience where we tap a button and say, “Send me an SMS” and it doesn’t turn up and then you tap it again. And then you get two or three at the same time and then you enter the phone number, not the code. So all of that cost money or impacts conversion, which drives revenue.</p>
<p>And then finally, we know that SMS is not particularly secure, because it really is not a true possession factor. It’s the SIM card rather than the actual physical device, whereas WebAuthN strongly identifies the actual physical device. So for those out-and-out mobile login type experiences where there is a security requirement to have a second factor, then we see WebAuthN as being so easy to deploy.</p>
<p>So we’ve seen a lot of interest in the gambling sector at the moment for a very, very cutting edge with regards to customer experience. So instead of having to go through with those steps, the customer literally just taps on the screen, looks into their phone, and they’ve been strongly authenticated, there’s no need to remember anything or type anything. And they can get on with what they want to do, which might be placing a bet on the 2.15 at Haydock. So those are the use cases that we’re seeing early on.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks for sharing that. Very interesting, of course, you mentioned the workforce, the replacement of SMS which is widely used today still. And yeah, you have described why it’s not a good idea to keep using that. But there was also fun, quite interesting and I haven’t heard before is about the customer service using the chat. So yeah, definitely, it makes that kind of customer service via chat much more powerful.</p>
<p>Olly: Exactly. Because I saw a stat, I think it’s something like, I can’t remember what the numbers were and I’m going to be cautious not to misquote on this discussion. But I think generally speaking, we would now prefer to get something via chat than picking up the telephone, because you multitask, you can tap a message, “I need this, I need this, I need this.” And that, I think is a very powerful driver.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, the chat person says, “OK, you had to call anyway. So you had to make the one-hour queue and then call.”</p>
<p>Olly: Oh definitely. And all the time the customer satisfaction goes down and costs go up. It’s just this whole digital transformation agenda is primarily it should be about, how can we serve the customer best? And I think this addresses it. And then secondly, of course the finance people will want to know, well, how can we do it more cheaply? And the good news to the finance folk is that it can be done more cheaply, and we can make sure that customers are happier and they’re retained for longer and they spend more money with the organisation. So who wouldn’t want that?</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. So we’d like to hear now about the security. So how WebAuthN is secure, if you compare to other standards?</p>
<p>Olly: Yeah. OK. So let’s break that down. First of all, let’s break the security model down into simple terms. And really there are three factors that can be applied, there’s a possession factor, so something you have, there is a biometric, which is something you are, and then there’s knowledge, which is something you know. Now, if you compare WebAuthN to other standards, then let’s look at passwords, for example, passwords is a single factor, knowledge-based check. If I know it, I could pretend to be you, and I can clean out your account.</p>
<p>Now, on top of that, you might apply another standard to improve security, which we discussed earlier, which is OK, well, I’m now going to add on top of my knowledge-based factor, I’m going to add an SMS. SMS is often characterised as being a possession factor. And to a degree, you could argue it is because you need to be in possession of that SIM card, but then the message can be diverted or it can be phished in some way. And so really, SMS quickly becomes another knowledge factor. If I have that code, I can pretend to be you. And there are a number of ways in which that code could be diverted or moved to another party. So, if you look at the two-factor authentication using passwords and SMS, then if I know your password, and I can get your code, then I can pretend to be you and I’ve broken through that security model.</p>
<p>And what we see within customer services is even worse is knowledge-based authentication. So knowledge-based authentication is that experience of secret questions, Oscar, before I can change your address, could you tell me what month you were born? Again, anybody that has got the time and desire to want to break into your account, it’s not difficult information to obtain. And therefore, it is another knowledge factor that I can collect, and again, pretend to be you, OK? And there’s real challenges in customer services with knowledge-based authentication, not just because it’s weak, but it also takes about 34 seconds for every single call to go through, which is more money and more cost associated with trying to identify the customer.</p>
<p>So WebAuthN, factors WebAuthN uses, number one is possession. But it is not possession of a SIM card, it is possession of the physical hardware of your smartphone device. And therefore, if I change the SIM, or if I divert the message, the transaction will not be authenticated. Why? Because you physically have to have this piece of metal in your hand, using cryptography, it is strongly establishing the device and that cannot be transferred to anyone else. OK? So that’s the first thing.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is using the biometric on your device. So WebAuthN does not create a new biometric. It is using the biometric that you have set up to unlock your device probably about 100 times a day on the average person. The important thing about that is that that biometric is very secure, because it is not transferred over the internet, it is only ever retained on the device. And it is secondly, it’s something that you’re very familiar with using. So from a customer experience point of view, if I ask someone to unlock their device, then they know how to do it, because they’re very practiced at it, they do it every day, hundreds of times.</p>
<p>So the WebAuthN standard uses number one, very, very strong, immutable possession of the device that is much better than other standards, such as SMS. And then secondly, it layers on top of that, to get at that possession factor the biometric from the device. Really, it is a very, very strong standard compared to other alternatives. It’s not infallible. One of the key things that we always state is that if you’re using WebAuthN, then you should make sure that the customer is not sharing their device. So these days, if you use Touch ID within a banking app, they will put a disclaimer in there to say “If you share your device, please do not use Touch ID or face ID to authenticate transactions. You’re guarding against other people in your household using their fingerprint or their face ID to unlock your device and approve transactions.” So that’s one thing that you need to think about.</p>
<p>But then when you compare that wrinkle to the other wrinkles within the other alternatives, that is a very, very strong standard. And if you need to layer on top other additional security steps for high-risk transactions, then you can do that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Two strong factors you mentioned. First, the possession but a strong possession. Here, I would like to ask you something. So, it has to be the device and exactly the device that is registered. But if you change the SIM card that’s not valid, or you can change the SIM card?</p>
<p>Olly: You can change the SIM card.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Olly: It doesn’t matter. It is the physical piece of metal by itself. So there is a part of your device called the Secure Enclave, which is where cryptographic elements are stored, and the key is stored within that enclave, and that is resolved when the customer unlocks their device with biometrics to then establish possession of the device. Is this the device that was registered to Olly’s account?</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, thank you for clarifying that. And also the biometrics that can be used depend on the device, correct? Some devices have the fingerprint. So what are the options, fingerprint, face recognition?</p>
<p>Olly: It’s really whatever is available on the device. But I mean, these days, I’m an Android user but iOS devices are all face ID now I think. My device is older Android Moto device that uses touch ID, I think there is a face ID option as well. But it can use either – whatever is available on the phone device.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, I would like to also hear about how easy it is to use, as far as you have described seems to be from the end user perspective, pretty simple. But also, I’d like to know how is for the more technical who would need to deploy this or considering to deploy this? So what would you say – how easy is it to use and deploy?</p>
<p>Olly: You’re right, at a customer level. I mean, I think the way to think about this is the customer doesn’t need to understand how the technology works. The customer is simply prompted and asked, do they wish to enable biometrics to authenticate to the brand whether that’s Vodafone, Lloyds Bank, Klarna, whoever it might be, OK, you’re just asked, “Do you want to unlock your phone to authenticate this transaction?” So it’s very easy, and the customer uses it hundreds of times a day already.</p>
<p>Where the complexity exists is in the orchestration, really, because remember at the front end, it’s a standards-based technology. So it’s not our technology that’s running the frontend, it is Apple’s or Google’s technology. At the backend, there is a little bit more complexity in orchestrating the authentication. And that’s where the benefit of vendors like Trusona come in, because they have plenty of experience of deploying these types of solutions time and time again.</p>
<p>So what we need to do is, for example, first of all, make sure that you’ve got an appropriate enrolment journey so that you’ve established trust with that customer. And then once that’s done, our backend will communicate typically with the brand’s CRM or identity and access management platform to then send and receive messages when authentication events are presented or required.</p>
<p>The other thing to think about is that because you are dealing with multiple OSs, then there are different ways and different devices and different operating systems need to step through that authentication process. And indeed, some of the devices we talked about earlier will not yet be compliant so you need to be able to provide a soft landing for those rather than just say, “No, you can’t log in.” Being able to offer a migration path for those older devices to make sure that you’re offering the right authentication options so if they can’t use WebAuthN then maybe they need to stick with passwords and usernames until the time that they upgrade to that device. And then you can put the offer in place.</p>
<p>So it’s a combination of orchestration and I think good design and planning, and the detail that sits around that to make this all come together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. For instance, as you mentioned, for some type of devices, the service is not supported, you have the good user interface that tells you what are the other options available. One qualification question for you, Trusona is a piece of software that would be installed in the backend of the service provider, along with the CIAM, you mentioned, it’s not a managed service, correct? It’s software that is installed?</p>
<p>Olly: It’s software-as-a-service, we run all of our services on Amazon Web Services in different clouds for different regions. And we provide, all of the technology is served up through that cloud service. So there’s no need for the customer to establish their own cloud, or there’s no software that needs to be deployed locally by the brand.</p>
<p>So one of the questions that pops up when we explain that is, well, what about the personally identifiable information that you hold in your cloud? What about considerations around security and so forth? Well, the answer to that is we do not hold any personally identifiable information. Our service communicates with the identity and access management platform that will hold all of the biographic personally identifiable information. What we are using is, we hold in our cloud public keys that relate to the private key that sits on the device that is resolved. And we then use that as an identifier and we pass that between the two systems. So never at any point do we hold personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Of course, the biometric that’s being used to unlock the devices in the OS, we’d never see that, we just get a result code from the OS to say, whether that has been passed or failed. OK? So our cloud really, if anybody wanted to hack into it, and spent the time they’d be really disappointed by what they got. Because there would just be a bunch of public keys that are proprietary to our own system and are completely useless to any third party.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, great clarification about that. It’s a software-as-a-service, but you don’t hold any or store any personal data of the users.</p>
<p>Olly: Yeah, I think when people start thinking about identity and authentication, immediately, they think, “Oh, there’s going to be a data store somewhere of valuable data and that’s a risk to the business.” And I think that’s one of the things that FIDO and WebAuthN have really thought through in the backend. And vendors like ourselves, Trusona, have thought through in terms of the orchestration, how we pull that together. And that’s probably another real call out to FIDO and WebAuthN is – the security model and in that respect is very, very strong. They’re not creating another honeypot of information that can be hacked by the criminals.</p>
<p>Oscar: And you don’t need to be an expert to deploy WebAuthN on the backend side.</p>
<p>Olly: Yes. I mean, I think it’s the same as, do you need to be an expert to build an identity and access management platform? Well, yes, of course. And do you need to be an expert to build a WebAuthN based passwordless authentication service? And the answer is, of course, we built one. So anybody could do but it’s taken us five years to get it as good as it is today. And that’s a lot of results, a lot of time getting it right. So yeah, you do need to be an expert to do this well, and I think that’s where traditionally vendors in this marketplace, add value on that with Trusona, then we can really help with the leader in that space.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. I will have a final question for you. Olly, thanks a lot for bringing light about WebAuthN, it’s very, very interesting, very enlightening what we’re hearing. For all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Olly: So I would say we’re probably going to have different types of people listening to this podcast, but many will be identity experts, and potentially their costs sit within a cost centre somewhere within the business. That’s the reality. My one piece of advice would be understand the true costs of your authentication services. Because rather than being a cost centre, you can actually deliver strong return on investment back on improving authentication back to the marketing team, the customer services team, and to your finance director. And I can tell you finance people love it when money can be saved.</p>
<p>And so have a look at those hard costs. So for example, we talked about customer services, most of the organisation, large customer service operations that I talk to are- all of them are seeking to drive down the cost of service, but they don’t want to do it at the expense of customer satisfaction. And as we talked about earlier, one of the big obstacles to completing self-service is the authentication processes.</p>
<p>For example, something like on average about 11% of calls come into contact centres, because people can’t get what they want online. So if you could help them to get what they want, by removing these barriers, like SMS, OTP, and passwords and presenting something that’s much easier to them, then suddenly, you can start to drive down the call flow into the customer service team.</p>
<p>Secondly, have a look to see their existing process. If they’re using knowledge-based authentication, they’re probably spending upwards of a minute trying to identify the customer. And if you provided a service that enabled them to do it with just a touch of the smartphone, then that would save 40 seconds on every single call. So customer service is one area.</p>
<p>And the other area that we’ve talked about is SMS, go and ask, how much are we paying for these messages? What’s the total cost of that? And what would happen if we could take out 50% of that, and make the customer happier in the process? And then go and tell the salespeople that they will get more sales because customers will be enabled more easily to be able to complete and get what they want.</p>
<p>And so that’s where I would start is just do a cost analysis. But think beyond the fraud and identity team and go and ask customer services about the cost of knowledge-based authentication, customer services about how many calls come in that are diverted because people can’t log in. Go and get that. And then go and ask the finance director, how much do you pay every year on SMS? And are you interested in having a discussion as to how we could reduce that by 50%? I think they’d really like it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. Again, thanks a lot, Olly for all this. Please let us know how people can get in touch with you or follow the conversation with you.</p>
<p>Olly: Well, first of all, my email address is OB@trusona.com. If anybody wants to give me a call, I’m always happy to chat as well, that’s +44 7823 538 872. But as a good starting point is maybe pop on to our website <a href="https://www.trusona.com/">trusona.com</a> or if you’d like you can look me up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olly-brough-5821a38/">LinkedIn</a> and send me a LinkedIn message. It’s Olly, O-L-LY Brough, B-R-O-U-G-H. If you search that Trusona, I’ll pop up and drop me a message and we’d love to talk.</p>

 Read about the key information on the Shyft DAO’s mission, structure, how to submit and vote for proposals, and more as Shyft kicks off this next era of its community! <p>2022 is already off to an exciting and productive start for the Shyft Network platform, team, and community. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-network-end-of-year-recap">Last year</a>, Shyft Network launched on mainnet and introduced key partnerships and products like Veriscope to the ecosystem. One of the first priorities for 2022 is the rollout of something critical to the future of the Shyft Network community and our goal towards total decentralization: the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>So why a DAO, and why now? From historical failures around data, privacy, and identity in Web2 and traditional finance to a rise in security and identity concerns in blockchain, there has never been a more critical time for Shyft Network to exist. The time for the community to take control is now; to expand Shyft Network’s ecosystem, create new trusted data solutions, like a sovereign identity system, and further empower each other to expand what Shyft Network can&nbsp;do.</p><p>It’s time to move closer to the goal of total decentralization and help launch the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Shyft Network is proud to share that after many months of planning and hard work, below is what lies ahead towards forming the DAO and some of the essential information you should know as the process kicks&nbsp;off.</p><p>The first <a href="https://forum.shyft.network/d/15-sip-1-shyft-dao-existence-proposal">proposal</a>, a yes or no vote on the instantiation of the DAO, is now live on the <a href="https://forum.shyft.network/">Shyft Network forum</a> and will move to Snapshot after five comments are posted — if you are a SHFT holder, you will be able to&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Read on to learn more about the Shyft DAO and how to participate. Thanks for being&nbsp;here!</p> What is the Mission of the Shyft&nbsp;DAO? <p>Shyft DAO aims to facilitate perpetual advancement of the Shyft protocol, to enable institutional blockchain adoption in compliance with local and global regulation without users’ sacrificing their data privacy or sovereignty.</p><p>The Shyft DAO will enable community governance over Shyft DAO assets by allowing community members to make proposals regarding the operation of the Shyft Network, as well as voting on proposals made by other community members, and participating in the deployment of various network economic systems such as the Shyft staking pool, AMM &amp; Yield Wrap&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>In addition, the Shyft DAO will facilitate community involvement in the implementation of strategic treasury management to facilitate Shyft protocol infrastructure expansion, upgrades, and ecosystem development in conjunction with the curation of strategic grant fundings and community involvement in the distribution of suitable economic benefits to the Shyft community.</p> What is the Structure of the Shyft&nbsp;DAO? <p>Version 1 of the Shyft DAO will consist of the six committees described below.</p><p>At launch, each committee will be populated with members of the decentralized federation of nodes. Their initial focus will be to document and share their mandate as well as build a plan to include new members outside of the Shyft Federation.</p> Treasury &amp; Economics Committee   Oversee treasury management and asset allocation.  Oversee financial analysis and strategies.  Oversee the design of Shyft Network’s economic policies.  Oversee financial audit and reporting.  Oversee treasury management and asset allocation.  Oversee financial analysis and strategies.  Oversee the design of Shyft Network’s economic policies.   Operations Committee   Set the goals, milestones, and channels within each DAO committee.  Create proposals for the formation of additional required committees, such as an R&amp;D committee.   Governance &amp; Oversight Committee   Maintain governance procedures via a Shyft DAO Charter (to be drafted by the Governance &amp; Oversight Committee)  Write and manage proposals (SIPs, DAO proposals, grant proposals, etc.) in close collaboration with the DAO members using the discussion forum.  Review, monitor, report, and provide DAO feedback.   Technology Committee   Strategic furtherance of Shyft Network’s technology.  Curation of technology development proposals.  Design of bug bounty programs.  Instantiation of Shyft Network’s developer community.   Ecosystem Business Development &amp; Partnership Committee   Identify and establish strategic partnerships that further expand Shyft Network’s use&nbsp;cases.  Outreach and liaison with 3rd party developers to encourage their development on Shyft&nbsp;Network.  Gather market intelligence and communicate market insights to the Technology Committee for strategic use case development.   Marketing and Community Committee   Develop various community-oriented initiatives, such as the Shyft Ambassador program.  Design various bounty programs in cooperation with the Technology Committee.  Organize community outreach, including updates; build and write reports, moderate and hold regular discussions.  Organize content, announcements, regular live AMAs, hackathons, blogs, and&nbsp;more.   What Tools Will Be Used in the Operation of the Shyft&nbsp;DAO?  1. Voting via&nbsp;Snapshot   The Shyft DAO will utilize Snapshot as a voting tool via a single voting system architecture. The first proposal the DAO will vote on is for the instantiation of the DAO itself. Voting will take place directly on the Snapshot portal (see below). As will be the case with all proposals, they will require five comments minimum on the forum before then going live on Snapshot for official&nbsp;voting.  <p>Below, see the necessary steps on how to vote for a proposal:</p><p>Step 1: Navigate to Shyft’s<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/shyftdao.eth"> Snapshot&nbsp;portal</a>.</p><p>Step 2: Click “join” on the Shyft DAO&nbsp;space.</p><p>Step 3: Connect with the wallet where you hold&nbsp;$SHFT.</p><p>Step 4: Sign in with the account you want to vote&nbsp;with.</p><p>Step 5: Select the active proposal to vote&nbsp;on.</p><p>Step 6: Browse through the proposal and see what options are available to cast a&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Step 7: Click on your preferred option then review and agree to the&nbsp;terms</p><p>Step 8: Confirm your vote by clicking on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Step 9: Sign the transaction with your account to complete the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Step 10: You have successfully voted!</p> 2. Multi-Sig Enactment (Shyft&nbsp;Safe)   This tool will be used to enact votes on the Shyft DAO. This will be deployed through two key sections:   1. Shyft DAO&nbsp;Treasury   The Shyft DAO Treasury will be managed by the Treasury and Economics Committee and deployed with instantiation of the Shyft DAO. The Treasury and Economics Committee will observe the aforementioned Shyft DAO charter to ensure full transparency regarding its actions. The committee will also be responsible for creating its own mandates aligned with this Shyft DAO&nbsp;charter.   2. Shyft DAO 7 Key&nbsp;Signers   Following voting on the substantiation of the Shyft DAO, the process will move forward with a vote to elect the seven key signers — two from Shyft Core, two from the Shyft Federation, and three from the Shyft Community. The first proposal will focus on the election of the three community key signers. A separate election will occur among the Shyft Federation and Shyft Core to elect the two key signers for those two sections.  The Treasury and Economics Committee will initially be composed of Shyft Community, Federation, and Core members. It will initially deploy via the DAO’s seven key signers, portfolio managers, financial analysts, and strategists. The expectations are that the committees will expand over time to fill its other various organizational roles.   3. Shyft&nbsp;Forum   The Shyft Forum acts as the primary communication platform for Shyft community members to discuss proposals — this is where you can find active proposals (in addition to on Snapshot), a forthcoming knowledge-based section, team support, community development information, and more. To access the Shyft Forum, click&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.shyft.network/">HERE</a>.   What’s Next <p>Following the close of Shyft Network’s <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/celebrate-the-lunar-new-year-win-a-fang-gang-nft-and-shft-603a892e56fd?source=user_profile---------3-------------------------------">latest community campaign</a>, there will be an AMA on Twitter Spaces to discuss feedback community matters and answer questions on the DAO formation and its proposal process. A portion of the AMA will be focused on discussing the proposal for electing the DAO’s seven key signers, primarily focusing on selecting its three community signers. The entire Shyft Core looks forward to sharing its excitement about the DAO, as well as answering any questions you may have on what’s&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>As always, feel free to reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>.</p><p>See you&nbsp;soon,</p><p>— Shyft&nbsp;Network</p>

It is impossible to fully capture the experience of the crypto community at a massive gathering like this, but these two choice talks provide a snapshot of the vibes and ethos of the 2022 conference. Kevin Owocki and Erik Voorhees join to synthesize the respective merits of individualism and collectivism, and Andrew Yang stepped up to give an impromptu call to action for the community to rally around productive goals. <p>We are scaling out the crypto vibes, and that was abundantly clear this week. Far larger than any previous ETH Denver, this conference truly felt like a Schelling point for folks changing the world via novel, elegant mechanisms.

<p>Decentralised Identity is changing the world, one bit at a time, and it won’t be long before it becomes a wave that will encompass all of us. This concept is gaining a lot of ground quickly because it enables every entity to own his or her identity and use it just the way one&nbsp;chooses.</p><p>In other words, it is an approach where every individual stores his or her Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and shares it with only those organisations that the individual chooses to. This is a revolutionary concept as it takes away data from centralised databases and authorities and empowers users to own and control their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Since Decentralisation is a relatively new concept, we have many organisations like Affinidi that are working to make this a reality. The umbrella organisation that provides the necessary support and guidelines is called the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF).</p> What is&nbsp;DIF? <p>DIF is an organisation involved in developing a new identity ecosystem. To this end, it strives to create the foundational components that would provide an open and standards-based ecosystem for people and organisations to leverage for app development and interoperability across platforms and&nbsp;devices.</p><p>DIF members play a role in developing the specification and emerging standards for protocols, components, and data formats that would facilitate the adoption of decentralised identities. Along with shaping the standards, these members also create the technical components and protocols to advance the common interests of everyone in the decentralised space.</p> Affinidi’s Role in&nbsp;DIF <p>At <a href="https://affinidi.com/">Affinidi</a>, we value our association with DIF. Our mission is to empower users to own and control their data and in the process, enjoy the highest possible levels of privacy and security.</p><p>Our association with DIF is a natural extension of what we do at Affinidi. To further our mission, we have been creating the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-can-you-do-with-affinidis-sdk-1966f4fef042">building blocks</a> for empowering individuals and organisations to control their verifiable data and through this data, unlock value across platforms and geographies.</p><p>As a member of DIF, we have been playing an important role in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/">educating audiences</a> about the importance of owning their data. We have also been working with other DIF members and the decentralised community at large to understand the existing gaps and expectations and to shape the standards accordingly.</p><p>In particular, Affinidi has been at the forefront in building many components such as the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-affinidis-digital-wallet-1c2a52b4d13f">Affinidi Wallet</a>, Schema Manager, <a href="https://build.affinidi.com/">Consent Manager</a>, and more that have enhanced the adoption of decentralised identity among communities and individuals.</p><p>In continuation of our efforts in this space, we will be participating in the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/difcon-f2f-virtual-3-tickets-162786327287">DifCon F2F Virtual Community Meeting</a> happening on the 24th of February&nbsp;2022.</p><p>If you are curious to know more about Affinidi’s role as a member of DIF and its contributions in this space, join our sessions on Consent Management and Schema Manager.

  <p>For large enterprise companies, boundaries around each team are crucial for maintaining systems that are owned by software engineers. This is accomplished by allowing individual teams to own their systems and expose them via APIs.</p>

<p>You also need to keep certain types of cross-cutting concerns centralized, like select security controls, logging, and routing. If you don’t, every API across different teams has to implement common controls like rate-limiting, logging, and authentication. This can lead to maintainability and consistency issues.</p>

<p>However, the <a href="https://engineering.salesforce.com/api-federation-growing-scalable-api-landscapes-a0f1f0dad506">API Federation</a> pattern keeps cross-cutting concerns located in one centralized lightweight API gateway. For example, by having a centralized place where rate-limiting is processed, and HTTP headers are returned for your company’s APIs, each API is kept consistent from the perspective of your clients.</p>

<p>The gateway also short-circuits requests that otherwise might use unnecessary resources. Protecting internal APIs and microservices from <a href="https://www.kentik.com/kentipedia/ddos-detection/">DDoS detection</a> can be added in one place, which safeguards backend services.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this article, you’ll learn how to build <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/microservices-architecture">.NET microservices</a> that are federated via another .NET API gateway. You’ll see how using an API gateway can protect internal services from the outside world by allowing the gateway to handle authentication using <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta’s</a> authentication services. These are easily integrated into our .NET microservice.</p>

 What Is API federation? 

<p>APIs are foundational to modern software development. They enable distributed systems to communicate with each other in a way that allows different teams to build their own systems autonomously.</p>

<p>Larger organizations need to be able to keep cross-cutting and security concerns at a higher-level abstraction so that individual API teams don’t need to worry about them.</p>

<p>API federation addresses this need by centralizing cross-cutting and security concerns into a gateway. All incoming API traffic can have security controls applied such as <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-mitigation/">DDoS protection</a>, <a href="https://avinetworks.com/glossary/ssl-termination/">SSL termination</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting">rate-limiting</a>, and will proxy those requests to internal services.</p>

<p>In this article, you’ll be using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/federated-identity">federated identity</a> approach. This enables authentication and authorization to be handled by one team or system (i.e., API gateway) so that other internal teams and APIs don’t have to worry about cross-cutting concerns.</p>

<p>Other architectural patterns like <a href="https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/#bff">Backends For Frontends</a> use this same approach of placing API gateways in front of other internal microservices for similar reasons.</p>

 Before you begin 

<p>To proceed through this tutorial, you’ll need the following tools installed:</p>

 
   <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker Desktop</a> 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio 2022 for Windows</a> 
   The latest version of the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download">.NET SDK</a> (This should be installed by Visual Studio.) 
   <a>Postman Desktop App</a> 
   A free <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer account</a> 
 

 Build .NET microservices 

<p>Let’s start building the foundation of your .NET projects and solutions.</p>

<p>First, navigate to an empty folder where you will start building your .NET solution and projects. Create a folder named <code>/src</code> and navigate to <code>/src</code> in a terminal.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll create two internal microservices and the API gateway. To do this, execute the following commands:</p>

 
   <code>dotnet new webapi -o Service1 --no-https -f net6.0</code> 
   <code>dotnet new webapi -o Service2 --no-https -f net6.0</code> 
   <code>dotnet new webapi -o ServiceGateway --no-https -f net6.0</code> 
 

<p>In order to build and link all the .NET projects together, you’ll need to create a new solution by running <code>dotnet new sln</code>.</p>

<p>To add all the projects to the new solution, run:</p>

 
   <code>dotnet sln src.sln add Service1/Service1.csproj</code> 
   <code>dotnet sln src.sln add Service2/Service2.csproj</code> 
   <code>dotnet sln src.sln add ServiceGateway/ServiceGateway.csproj</code> 
 

<p>To get the projects ready for the next steps, remove the <code>Controllers</code> folder and the <code>WeatherController.cs</code> file from all three projects.</p>

 Create a proxy gateway 

<p>The API gateway is a lightweight service that executes cross-cutting concern logic and then forwards the original request to the appropriate internal microservice API.</p>

<p>In your IDE, create a new file C# class named <code>ProxyExtensions</code> in the root of the  <code>ServiceGateway</code> project. This file will have a couple of extension methods to perform the logic needed to proxy HTTP requests to other microservices. Extension methods in C# are a great way to create reusable methods that are tucked away in their own file.</p>

<p>Replace its contents with the following:</p>

   <code>namespace ServiceGateway
{
  public static class ProxyExtensions
  {
    private static readonly int StreamCopyBufferSize = 81920;

    public static HttpRequestMessage CreateProxyHttpRequest(this HttpContext context, Uri uri)
    {
      var request = context.Request;

      var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage();
      var requestMethod = request.Method;
      if (!HttpMethods.IsGet(requestMethod) &amp;&amp;
          !HttpMethods.IsHead(requestMethod) &amp;&amp;
          !HttpMethods.IsDelete(requestMethod) &amp;&amp;
          !HttpMethods.IsTrace(requestMethod))
      {
        var streamContent = new StreamContent(request.Body);
        requestMessage.Content = streamContent;
      }

      // Copy the request headers
      foreach (var header in request.Headers)
      {
        if (!requestMessage.Headers.TryAddWithoutValidation(header.Key, header.Value.ToArray()) &amp;&amp; requestMessage.Content != null)
        {
          requestMessage.Content?.Headers.TryAddWithoutValidation(header.Key, header.Value.ToArray());
        }
      }

      requestMessage.Headers.Host = uri.Authority;
      requestMessage.RequestUri = uri;
      requestMessage.Method = new HttpMethod(request.Method);

      return requestMessage;
    }

    public static async Task CopyProxyHttpResponse(this HttpContext context, HttpResponseMessage responseMessage)
    {
      if (responseMessage == null)
      {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(responseMessage));
      }

      var response = context.Response;

      response.StatusCode = (int)responseMessage.StatusCode;
      foreach (var header in responseMessage.Headers)
      {
        response.Headers[header.Key] = header.Value.ToArray();
      }

      foreach (var header in responseMessage.Content.Headers)
      {
        response.Headers[header.Key] = header.Value.ToArray();
      }

      // SendAsync removes chunking from the response. This removes the header, so it doesn't expect a chunked response.
      response.Headers.Remove("transfer-encoding");

      using var responseStream = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();
      await responseStream.CopyToAsync(response.Body, StreamCopyBufferSize, context.RequestAborted);
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>These two methods allow your gateway to forward/proxy requests and responses to the original client transparently. This code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspLabs/blob/main/src/Proxy/src/ProxyAdvancedExtensions.cs">AspLabs GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: a hand-built .NET-base API gateway could be beneficial when you need full control of how your gateway behaves (i.e.,  if you’re building a really complex internal API gateway), don’t want dependencies on third-party services, or as a proof-of-concept. In production scenarios, you may want to use a product like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/?cdn=disable#overview">Azure API Management</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a> instead of a hand-built .NET application API gateway. These tools come with common cross-cutting tooling like routing, rate-limiting, static content caching, HTTP caching, SSL termination, etc., so you don’t have to code them by hand. Often, you can leverage infrastructure-as-code tools like <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/infrastructure-as-code">Terraform</a> to keep your API gateway easy to maintain and scalable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, replace the <code>ServiceGateway/Program.cs</code> file with the following (you’ll add more to this file later.):</p>

   <code>using ServiceGateway;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

var app = builder.Build();

// Expose the gateway via port "4300"
app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4300");

app.UseRouting();

// We're routing clients to internal microservices, which many times
// will have different public and internal URLs. Gateways can help to
// keep routing centralized as a cross-cutting and customer-focused concern.
app.MapGet("/warehouse", async context =&gt;
{
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();

    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri("http://localhost:4301/inventory"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});

app.MapGet("/sales/sku/{sku:required}", async context =&gt;
{
    var sku = context.Request.RouteValues["sku"];
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();
    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri($"http://localhost:4302/sku/{sku}"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Your gateway service will now accept two routes, and proxy the requests to the appropriate internal microservice.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to configure these two services. Replace <code>Service1/Program.cs</code> with the following:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4301");

app.UseRouting();

app.MapGet("/inventory", () =&gt; "Total inventory is 721 items");

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Then, replace <code>Service2/Program.cs</code> with:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4302");

app.UseRouting();

app.MapGet("/sku/{sku:required}", (string sku) =&gt; $"You're looking at SKU {sku}!");

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Both of these files make the services listen to traffic on a custom port so that all three microservices can run on your machine at the same time. These services return static content so that you can focus on the orchestration of the gateway and microservices.</p>

<p>Now, it’s time to try to run it. Open up three separate terminals (any terminal should work). Navigate to the root directory for each of the .NET projects you created and execute <code>dotnet run</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To test the API gateway, run the following request in Postman:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should see some HTTP headers and the HTTP body “You’re looking at SKU 1234!”</p>

<p>Here’s what the current topology looks like:</p>

<p></p>

 Add Okta auth to your API gateway 

<p>In the next steps, you’ll add authentication to your API gateway. By placing authentication in the gateway, any internal microservices or APIs can trust that requests coming from the gateway have already been authenticated.</p>

<p>Here, you’ll be using the API gateway to proxy requests for API access tokens to Okta behind the scenes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In these next steps, you’ll be utilizing your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta account</a>.</p>

<p>Once signed into <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a>, you’ll be at the home page/dashboard. Navigate to Applications on the left-hand menu, and click the Create App Integration button. Choose API Services, and create a name for your app.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take note of your Okta domain, <code>client_id</code>, and <code>client_secret</code> for later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll need to create a dummy security scope for your API integration. On the left-hand menu again, click on Security &gt; API. In the list of authorization servers, click the Edit button for the default server. Then, click on the Scopes tab and the Add Scope button. Make sure the Default Scope checkbox is selected, and choose any name for your scope.</p>

<p>Copy the Okta domain that’s displayed and add it to your <code>ServiceGateway/appsettings.json</code> file:</p>

   <code>  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "https://dev-1234.okta.com"
  }
</code>   

<p>Next, navigate to the <code>ServiceGateway</code> project folder in a terminal and run <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore</code>. This will install the Okta .NET library that will help your gateway to authenticate incoming requests.</p>

<p>Finally, copy the following code and replace <code>ServiceGateway/Program.cs</code> with it:</p>

   <code>using Okta.AspNetCore;
using ServiceGateway;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

// Configure authentication middleware
AddAuthMiddleware(builder);

var app = builder.Build();

app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4300");

// Federated Logging
app.Use(async (context, next) =&gt;
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Request for \"{context.Request.Path}\"");
    await next();
});

// Federated Rate-Limiting
app.Use(async (context, next) =&gt;
{
    context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Rate-Limit-Limit", "infinite");
    await next();
});

app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

// Using Okta to generate tokens by forwarding the request.
// To your clients, if you strip out Okta specific response headers,
// they would have no idea that Okta is being used as the identity
// provider!
app.MapPost("/token", async context =&gt;
{
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();

    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri($"{builder.Configuration["Okta:Domain"]}/oauth2/default/v1/token"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});


app.MapGet("/warehouse", async context =&gt;
{
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();

    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri("http://localhost:4301/inventory"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});

app.MapGet("/sales/sku/{sku:required}", async context =&gt;
{
    var sku = context.Request.RouteValues["sku"];
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();
    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri($"http://localhost:4302/sku/{sku}"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
}).RequireAuthorization();

app.Run();

void AddAuthMiddleware(WebApplicationBuilder builder)
{
    // This method is all it takes to use Okta to automatically test incoming
    // bearer tokens for authentication!
    builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
    {
        options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultSignInScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
    })
    .AddOktaWebApi(new OktaWebApiOptions()
    {
        OktaDomain = builder.Configuration["Okta:Domain"],
    });
    
    builder.Services.AddAuthorization();
}
</code>   

<p>Again, open up three separate terminals and navigate to the root directory for each of the .NET projects you created. Run all three services by executing <code>dotnet run</code> in each terminal.</p>

<p>You’ll have to provide a bearer token to the gateway service in order to access <code>/sales/sku/&lt;sku&gt;</code> but <code>/warehouse</code> will not require any authentication.</p>

<p>To get an access token to access <code>/sales/sku/&lt;sku&gt;</code>, you’ll need to execute the following request in Postman by using your own <code>client_id</code> and <code>client_secret</code> values:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should have a response with the <code>access_token</code> displayed. Copy the token and then issue the following request using Postman to replace the bearer token with your access token:</p>

<p></p>

<p>If implemented correctly, you should see a successful response!</p>

 Use Docker to run the solution 

<p>In Visual Studio, right-click each project and click on Add &gt; Docker Support. Then, choose Linux as the target OS. This will add a <code>Dockerfile</code> to each project that will be configured to build and run the .NET application with sensible defaults.</p>

<p>Right-click the <code>ServiceGateway</code> project and choose Add &gt; Container orchestration support. Choose Docker Compose and then Linux as the target OS. This step will add a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Replace the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file with the following:</p>

   <code>version: '3.4'

services:
  servicegateway:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}servicegateway
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ServiceGateway/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4300:80"
  service1:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}service1
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Service1/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4301:80"
  service2:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}service2
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Service2/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4302:80"
</code>   

<p>This will configure each project to become exposed at the ports you used earlier, except now Docker is responsible for exposing the proper ports.</p>

<p>In the <code>Program.cs</code> file for the three .NET projects you created, remove the <code>Urls</code> code that looks like:</p>

   <code>app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;");
</code>   

<p>In the <code>ServiceGateway</code> project’s <code>Program.cs</code> file, replace the two URLs for the internal microservice routes with <code>http://host.docker.internal:&lt;port&gt;</code> instead of <code>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>For example, the code for the external <code>/warehouse</code> route will now become the internal URL of <code>http://host.docker.internal:4301/inventory</code>.</p>

<p>At the top of Visual Studio 2022, there will be a new launch profile available called “Docker Compose.”</p>

<p>Use the same Postman request as earlier to fetch your token:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, using that token, you can make requests to the <code>/sales/sku/&lt;sku&gt;</code> path:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you can run all your microservices and the API gateway and test them.</p>

 What you learned about API federation in .NET 

<p>In this tutorial, you built the skeleton of the API gateway and two .NET microservices, which were all exposed on specific ports.</p>

<p>You also learned how to use <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/">Okta’s Client Credentials API token endpoint</a> to retrieve a server-to-server access token by using your API gateway as a proxy. With Okta’s <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-aspnet">Okta.AspNetCore</a> library, you then enabled your API gateway to process and validate incoming access tokens.</p>

<p>In the end, you had the entire suite of services running in one click by using Docker Compose.</p>

<p>You can check out the completed project at <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-dotnet-microservices">this Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>Il 2022 è un anno cruciale per l’avanzamento del PNRR, in cui la “messa a terra” degli indirizzi di policy diventa il tema principale. </p>



<p>Di fronte a questa sfida sarà fondamentale concentrare gli sforzi organizzativi e operativi di tutti, facendo leva su alcuni fondamentali punti di snodo del Piano: il rapporto con il mondo economico; il rapporto della PA centrale con gli enti locali; il rapporto con l’Europa.</p>



 Mercoledì 23 febbraio dalle ore 11:00 alle ore 13:00, evento in live streaming. 







 



<p>Il prossimo 23 febbraio, Danilo Cattaneo – Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert – interverrà al webinar organizzato dal CED – Centro Economia Digitale, prendendo parte alla tavola rotonda dal titolo “Next Generation Italia – EXECUTION”. L’evento si svolgerà presso la Luiss Business School e verrà trasmesso in streaming.</p>



<p>L’obiettivo dell’evento è analizzare le sfide che dovrà affrontare il Paese per concretizzare delle proposte operative utili all’implementazione del Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza approvato dal governo, il quale metterà a disposizione di Imprese e Pubblica Amministrazione i fondi necessari per effettuare una svolta fondamentale su temi quali: Transizione Digitale, Transizione Ecologica e Mezzogiorno.</p>



<p>L’apertura dei lavori è affidata al Chairman dell’evento: Rosario Cerra – Fondatore e Presidente del Centro Economia Digitale, dopo il quale prenderanno la parola:</p>



  Adelaide Mozzi – Team Leader Affari Economici, Commissione Europea, Rappr. in Italia;  Paolo Boccardelli – Comitato Scientifico CED, Direttore Luiss Business School;  Francesco Crespi – Direttore Ricerche CED, Professore Economia Università Roma Tre.  



 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYT4gj7k7RQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYT4gj7k7RQ">Segui l’evento in streaming</a> 
 



 



<p>Durante la Tavola Rotonda dal titolo “Next Generation Italia – EXECUTION”,oltre a Danilo Cattaneo – CEO di InfoCert, interverranno:</p>



  Andrea Falessi – Direttore Relazioni Esterne Open Fiber;  Filippo Maria Grasso – Direttore Relazioni Istituzionali Italia Leonardo;  Nicola Lanzetta – Amministratore Delegato Enel Italia;  Dario Pagani – Head of Digital &amp; Information Technology ENI;  Alessandro Picardi – Executive Vice President Chief Public Affairs Officer TIM.  



<p>Interverranno inoltre a seguire:</p>



  Andrea Montanino – Direttore Strategie Settoriali e Impatto CDP;  Roberta Lombardi – Assessore Transizione Ecologica e Trasformazione Digitale Regione Lazio;  Fabio Melilli – Presidente Commissione Bilancio, Tesoro e Programmazione Camera dei Deputati;  Anna Ascani – Sottosegretario di Stato Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico.  



<p>L’evento si concluderà alle 12:30 con l’intervento di Federico D’Incà – Ministro per i Rapporti con il Parlamento.</p>



<p>Modera Flavia Giacobbe – Direttore Formiche.net.</p>



<blockquote><p>“L’approvazione del PNRR sancisce non solo la disponibilità di ingenti risorse finanziare per il rilancio dell’economia, ma, soprattutto, un’occasione storica per realizzare un cambiamento strutturale fondato sulla capacità trasformativa dell’innovazione e della diffusione delle tecnologie digitali. Queste possono in particolare svolgere un ruolo cruciale per facilitare il passaggio da un modello produttivo basato sulla competitività di costo a uno basato sulla competitività tecnologica, che fa leva su investimenti continui in nuove tecnologie, attività di ricerca e innovazione. È questo secondo modello che deve diventare prevalente in Italia, poiché è quello in grado di fornire una spinta più forte e duratura alla dinamica della produttività e della crescita.”</p>Rosario Cerra – Fondatore e Presidente del Centro Economia Digitale</blockquote>

<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
<p>Andy Best is the CEO of the Civic Digital Network (CDN), a non-profit organization working to create national data infrastructure.</p>
<p>CDN’s mission is to give the public sector the tools to meet the challenges of the coming century. How do you enable responsible economic activity in the current digital era? What is the government’s proper role to facilitate, regulate and legislate to create the maximum social and economic public and private good.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p><br>
During this conversation, we discuss:<br>
</p>
 
 What are Intangible Assets, the Intangible Economy – and why leaders should care about them? 
 How do you approach Policy around Public Data Institutions, without making them too restrictive which can have negative impacts on private sector innovation? 
 Why Policy Makers must look at Intangible Assets (such as software and data) very differently than Tangible Assets (roads and bridges). 
 How to ensure the Right Controls are put in place for Public Data Utility programs? 
 Why taking a Use Case Lens in the deployment of Public Infrastructure programs is the only approach. 
 How Municipalities who adopt the right public data programs can increase the prosperity of their citizens. 
 Why Government should view standards as part of their regulatory frameworks. 
 
 
 
 
<p>And more!</p>
<p>Note that although this conversation is mostly framed around Canadian context, the key fundamental frameworks discussed are applicable across various democratic systems.</p>

			 The Truth &amp; Nonsense of Blockchain Interoperability 
 
<p>As we acquire more and more financial institutions as customers, a recurring question arises:&nbsp;Are Tokeny’s solutions interoperable/multichain/chain agnostic/magical?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is: “Yes, but…”&nbsp;In fact, if you’re a regular reader of our newsletter, you may recall that last May we talked about our&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/the-era-of-blockchain-interoperability-begins/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--j7MsdjfwUyCqjWUXnZP2xCM7LIgseefqpgewCIY9hBTjJiUx1s5Uj1MsOIT7ckyuI3GLo">partnership with Polygon</a>, a framework for building and connecting blockchain networks in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem. That marked the beginning of our cross-chain solutions. Since then, we have&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/enegra-migrates-digitized-equity-tokens-from-ethereum-to-polygon-blockchain?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--j7MsdjfwUyCqjWUXnZP2xCM7LIgseefqpgewCIY9hBTjJiUx1s5Uj1MsOIT7ckyuI3GLo">migrated $28 billion worth of tokenized equity</a>&nbsp;and other assets from Ethereum to Polygon.</p>
<p>So, what is the EVM ecosystem? In short,&nbsp;EVM-compatible blockchain networks share the same technology stack. It is like if EVM was a Nespresso coffee machine,&nbsp;the smart contracts are coded in the same programming language Solidity, much like the capsules for the Nespresso coffee machine, you could choose Starbucks or L’OR coffee based on your needs, but they are all compatible with the coffee machine. It enables very interesting features: for example,&nbsp;wallets can be switched from one network to another but with the same address. Now, Tokeny is even able to get the same smart contract address on different blockchains.&nbsp;However, the consensus mechanism and the participants can be totally different. These blockchain networks can be public or private.</p>
<p>Non-EVM-compatible blockchains&nbsp;such as Tezos and Solana, on the other hand, don’t share the same technology basis. Each of them is like a different coffee machine that takes different capsules, as they&nbsp;use different programming languages. E.g. SmartPy and LIGO for Tezos, and Rust C &amp; C++ for Solana.</p>
<p>In order to allow blockchains to “communicate” with each other, “bridges” were created.&nbsp;A bridge solution is a set of smart contracts that freeze tokens on one blockchain, then create their representation on another blockchain.&nbsp;For example, you can move tokenized assets from Ethereum to Polygon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many people have asked us how to&nbsp;make Corda, or other private networks, interoperable with EVM blockchains&nbsp;such as Polygon, in order to access its active ecosystem of users. It is possible, but these systems work totally different. Can you use a fax to send an email? Yes, but it is not done for this.&nbsp;An additional system or intermediary will need to be set up, and it becomes a potential point of failure, increasing risk.&nbsp;We saw this no later than last week with the hack of the Wormhole bridge connecting Solana and Ethereum, where $300m+ was stolen.</p>
<p>From day one at Tokeny, we chose to not build the blockchain network itself but to&nbsp;use public blockchains, with an active ecosystem of developers and users.&nbsp;On top of these resilient infrastructures, as they are decentralized,&nbsp;we are bringing compliance and control with a complete suite of business applications.</p>
<p>We want our customers to be able to choose which blockchain network suits their needs.&nbsp;For the moment, the EVM environment and especially the Polygon network is the best fit for tokenized securities. We migrated 2 more tokens last week, so the issuers and token holders are benefiting from a highly-efficient infrastructure. That’s what we call interoperability in early 2022.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, we <a href="https://twitter.com/jhipster/status/1466081146056450054">launched</a> the JHipster Community Survey. The goal was to get feedback from the community about the most useful features and components, things that are missing, and where we should focus our attention to make the project even better for everyone.</p>

<p>We got over 500 responses; thank you all for taking the time to contribute and share the survey with your community! Now let’s take a look at the results!</p>

 How do you use JHipster? 

<p>The first section of questions was dedicated to understanding the most common scenarios in which JHipster is used, and how exactly, so we can focus our efforts accordingly.</p>

<p>Which client-side frameworks do you use with JHipster?</p>

<p>The most commonly used framework in the JHipster community is Angular, with 68.3% of respondents making it their #1 choice. React is in second place with 35.3% votes, and the rest of the votes are distributed between Vue.js, Svelte, and using none:</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rzshsgnb54kdn71elk1n.png">
</a></p>

<p>What kind of applications do you create with JHipster?</p>

<p>It was very interesting to understand what kind of applications developers are building with JHipster. SPA/Monolith is a clear winner (78.3%), with Microservices being a close second (60.8%). Gateways and Server-only projects were equally popular:</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2yc37cvl4s8y636t18e5.png">
</a></p>

<p>Outside Java/Spring Boot, do you use other languages/frameworks supported by JHipster?</p>

<p>Many developers use JHipster for Java and Spring Boot projects, but do they use it for other platforms and frameworks? Yes; Node.js, Kotlin, and Flutter are quite popular, as well as such frameworks as Quarkus, Ionic, React Native, and Micronaut.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8knap4ilrmnjgnj6991j.png">
</a></p>

<p>What is one thing you love about JHipster?</p>

<p>This was an open question, where everyone could share what they like about JHipster in any form. Some of the most popular answers were the following:</p>

 
   Easy bootstrapping of web applications 
   Use of best practices and standards 
   Eliminating routine work and getting to production fast 
   Enabling unit and integration tests 
   Using latest technologies and open source stack 
   Flexibility and customizations out of the box 
   Continuous support and community 
 

<p>… and many other things.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for this great feedback!</p>

<p>What can be improved?</p>

<p>We also asked to identify one thing people hate about JHipster, so we can improve it. Many users said there is no such thing! :) Others pointed out that improving some of the documentation, the upgrade process, entities update, and adding more tutorials, in particular for various cloud platforms, would be great.</p>

<p>How would you rate the quality of generated code?</p>

<p>78.3% of users rated the quality of the code, generated by JHipster, as 8 out of 10 or higher!</p>

 JHipster’s Roadmap 

<p>Some of the most interesting and at the same time challenging questions to answer for each project are about the roadmap. Which features should we prioritize? What is missing? Are our current plans and assumptions right, or do our users feel differently? To get night into that, we asked our users several questions about the roadmap.</p>

<p>What features would you like to see in JHipster?</p>

<p>All of the options that we put up for voting - micro frontends, GraphQL support and GraalVM Native Image support, are highly anticipated by the community. Some of the features suggested by the community, were support for TypeScript, DynamoDB, Flyway, Redis and Vert.x, extended Neo4J support, and Python support, along with introducing app templates and entity-based application dashboards, and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vbbzqtsdla5zcdw7a5sf.png">
</a></p>

<p>If you could improve the getting started experience for JHipster, what would you change?</p>

<p>A few users suggested having a minimalistic version of Jhipster, which is already addressed with the recent announcement of <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-lite">JHipster Lite</a> — go and give it a try, if you haven’t yet!</p>

<p>Other suggestions were to have more project samples, a simple JDL sample (like “Book” and “Author”), outlining best practices for upgrading, creating sample projects with various integrations, and adding more short explainer videos and step-by-step tutorials for beginners.</p>

 JHipster User Profile 

<p>We also asked a few questions to better understand who our users are, and in what context they are using JHipster.</p>

<p>First, a few short facts:</p>

 
   Most of JHipster users define their programming level experience as “Experienced” (50.7%) or “Expert” (27.7%). Only 5% of them are beginners; 
   Most of them also learned about JHipster from a colleague or via GitHub; 
   For the majority of users (65%), JHipster is an integral part of their workflow; 
   42% of respondents’ companies approve using JHipster. 
 

<p>And a few more details about developers using JHipster.</p>

<p>Which programming languages do you regularly use?</p>

<p>Another question we asked was about programming languages. Almost all our respondents use Java (96.1%), which is not surprising since a lot of JHipster’s backend options are Java-based. JavaScript is also popular (61.9%), probably primarily for the front-end part. Python and Kotlin are next, which also corresponds to feature request data we’ve seen before. 9% of the users also chose C# and Golang:</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3pe5dy80yaqv8lnyuest.png">
</a></p>

<p>Have you ever made contributions to the project?</p>

<p>JHipster is lucky to have a very active and engaged community. Every third community member helped the project by providing feedback via <a href="https://github.com/jhipster">GitHub</a>, and every fourth created content about it, such as blog posts, event talks, etc. Other contributions, such as sending code PRs, contributing to docs, and helping other developers, are extremely valuable and improve the project for everyone.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sp0oethhqygt2c8z29pp.png">
</a></p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Thanks again to everyone for taking the time to provide this feedback. We will go through the suggestions with the core team, and will use the results to adjust the project plans.</p>

<p>Some of the most requested features are already on our roadmap, with ongoing work happening and bounties on them — feel to contribute or share your thoughts in corresponding GitHub tickets!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Are you bothered by the ubiquitous dichotomy between delivering to urgent demand and delivering to a strategy for your organization’s IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management)? The one good news on that is that you are not alone. But there is more good news: You can get both, without unreasonable extra effort and without endlessly delaying any delivery. It is work and it will require some investment in time and maybe in money. But it works and it is an already proven approach.<br><br></p>
<p>Not every practice qualifies for “best” practice<br><br>The magic word in that is “best practices”. Best practices in the sense of the word. Unfortunately, a lot of what is sold as best practice is indeed an established practice, but by far no best practice (anymore). It might have been a best practice once in the past, or at least a proven practice. “Proven” and related terms are the alarm signals in that. What has been great for the last 10 years does not always qualify for the best practice when evolving your IAM (or other areas of your business) into the future.<br>A real best practice must have a proven element, as in practice. But it must also deliver to the future demands. A best practice thus must contain a significant degree of flexibility, to adapt to changes, such as new themes and technologies emerging in IAM.</p>
<p><br>Identity Fabrics: Proven &amp; adaptive<br><br>Over the past years, KuppingerCole Analysts has developed and publicized the concept of Identity Fabrics. Identity Fabrics are not a fixed architecture, but a framework and guideline that describes a modern, future-proof, and adaptive IAM, but also the path towards it.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The KuppingerCole Analysts Identity Fabrics provides a framework for both architecting a modern, future-proof IAM and for the gradual modernization of the legacy IAM.</p>
<p><br>This approach delivers what a best practice must include:<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a proven approach that has been incorporated by several companies already<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a proven approach that influences the work of several providers of IAM solutions already<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is adaptive because the set of capabilities, the definition of the services, and the tools in use are adaptive and can evolve with changing requirements<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It thus also is future-proof, because it isn’t static<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It also is future-proof because it focuses on modernization towards an IAM that covers all types of identities, all types of services, and delivers to the needs of businesses building digital services<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It focuses on modern architectures and strong support for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)<br>In the work we have done in research and advisories over the past years, since the introduction of the Identity Fabrics model, the model has proven to deliver to both concrete challenges around delivering to current demand or IAM modernization, and to building a vision, strategy, blueprint, and roadmap for the future IAM.</p>
<p><br>Identity Fabrics: Some insights<br><br>Without explaining all the details of Identity Fabrics, where we already have published a Leadership Compass, a Leadership Brief on utilizing the concept on the journey towards IDaaS, a Leadership Brief introducing the concept, multiple whitepapers, and many blogs and videos, there are some aspects that deserve being highlighted in the context of this blog post.<br>One is that Identity Fabrics go beyond traditional IAM in supporting an inside-out and an outside-in approach on IAM. The inside-out IAM is what most solutions support: They manage accounts and entitlements in target systems, or they, e.g., sit in front of applications and do the authentication. The outside-in approach is different: IAM serves requests of applications and digital services at runtime, as a backend service, via APIs. This paradigm shift is not entirely new, but gaining attention and momentum in the digital age.<br>Another important element in the concept of Identity Fabrics is the support for migration from legacy IAM to a modern solution at the pace of the customer. Identity Fabrics can integrate with legacy IAM solutions. Moreover, existing IAM solutions can even form a part of the Identity Fabric as tools delivering services and capabilities needed, if the IAM technology in use is sufficiently modern.<br>This “sufficiently modern” involves support for deployment in as-a-service models and strong support for IAM as well as modern, modular architecture.</p>
<p><br>Vision, Strategy, Blueprint, Roadmap<br><br>We are aware from many discussions that the IAM teams in organizations are concerned that they fear not to being able to master the effort and time needed for developing their own IAM vision, strategy, blueprint, and roadmap. Our practice has proven the opposite: It can work, and it can be done with a very reasonable effort, and within a reasonable time.<br>The advantage of the Identity Fabrics model is that it provides a mature framework and thus orientation for deriving a specific version that suits the state, the current, and the future requirements of organizations, as well as providing the link to the existing IAM infrastructure.<br>The main effort is in two related areas:<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Requirements analysis<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scoping &amp; prioritization<br>The advisory team at KuppingerCole Analysts has developed efficient methodologies for identifying the high-level requirements, defining the scope, and prioritizing the various capabilities and thus the services and tools required to deliver these. Within a few weeks and a couple of workshops, the vision for the future IAM, the customer-specific incarnation of the Identity Fabric including a high-level architectural blueprint, and a rough roadmap are set.<br>Like every strategy, blueprint, and roadmap, this is not carved in stone, but a living model that evolves with future trends and requirements. It can be easily adapted because the framework for itself remains consistent. Adding services, replacing tools, serving additional capabilities: All can be done within the Identity Fabrics framework.<br>The time (and money) spent on vision, strategy, blueprint, and roadmap following the Identity Fabrics framework are well-spent. To bring up an old analogy here: No one ever would start building a house without a plan. So, why build your future IAM without a plan, by just adding some tools here or there?</p>
<p><br>Deliver &amp; evolve: Balancing short-term demand with strategy<br><br>The other aspect that concerns organizations is the need to deliver to current, pressing demand, while executing a strategy. This dichotomy is not always easy to solve. However, having a strategy building on the Identity Fabrics paradigm also includes aspects such as strong API support, a modern architecture, and support for as-a-service delivery models. The Identity Fabric also provides a straightforward approach of mapping requirements to capabilities, services, and tools, and thus to identify overlaps to existing or planned technologies.<br>Thus, short-term requirements can be checked regarding their compatibility with the strategy and might become an element of the Identity Fabric. On the other hand, massive overlaps with existing components can also be easily identified, to avoid redundancy.<br>There also might be scenarios where some short-term solution stands in contrast to the requirements within the future Identity Fabric. If there is no alternative solution (in most cases, there is) that fits the strategy, such solutions should be defined and treated as tactical, with a limited life span and a defined migration strategy.</p>
<p><br>The legacy aspect: Embrace, extend &amp; replace<br><br>Finally, there is the legacy. Most large organizations have some level of legacy IAM in place. In many organizations, these also serve complex legacy IT such as mainframe or SAP environments. The effort for a rip &amp; replace approach in many cases is unreasonable. While the Identity Fabric is open to moving to modern solutions that support the legacy IT, it also is legitimate to use legacy IAM components as intermediaries to the legacy IT.<br>In the end, this is just a matter of economics and, to a certain extent, of pragmatism and prioritization. The economic aspect is about comparing the cost for licenses and operations of the legacy IAM with the cost of migrating it to more modern solutions. It can be more efficient to just keep the legacy IAM in the as-is-state and gradually move legacy IT to the Identity Fabric, or just retire legacy IT.<br>The aspect of pragmatism and prioritization applies to everything in the journey towards a modern Identity Fabric. You never will be able to do everything in parallel. Prioritization is key. This also holds true when it comes to the discussion about further utilizing some elements of legacy IAM: Sometimes, it is better to focus on adding new capabilities, while postponing migration. This just needs to be discussed, evaluated, and decided.</p>
<p><br>Modernize your IAM. Now.<br><br>The Identity Fabrics model helps in the journey from the legacy IAM to a modern, future-proof IAM. It has a lot of flexibility in planning and doing that journey. However, with the need to support more identities and services, and with the shift from an inside-out only approach on IAM to supporting both inside-out and outside-in approaches, there is a mandate to modernize your IAM. That journey must start now.<br><br>Don’t miss attending EIC 2022. You will benefit from plenty of sessions around the big theme of Identity Fabrics.<br><br></p>

Garner A Double Discount With&nbsp;GEM!<p>Introduction: Introducing GEMpay, A Blockchain Based Simple Payment&nbsp;Service!</p><p>The main issue that GEMpay aims to resolve surrounding payment services is eliminating the countless amounts of brokerages and contracts that are needed to issue a payment settlement for businesses. This can become tedious and often costly for the producer. Many preexisting contract structures that are created for convenience and risk structure of financial institutions often accompany high commission burdens to small business owners and simultaneously, franchise owners and consumers bear the economic trickle down burden from this financial model. It is evident that, from a global standpoint, small businesses have garnered more financial burden than they can take on, especially during the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>An Outline Of The Preexisting Payment&nbsp;Paradigm<p>Do Big Tech Platforms Make Life Better Or Is This A Subjective Claim?</p>Bearing The Burden Of Processing Costs With Big&nbsp;Tech<p>Did you know that, as of August 2021, big tech fees were 2–3 times higher than standard credit card companies. This is unacceptable as it creates an immense financial burden on small businesses. A 2–3 times higher fee exacerbates the already preexisting financial problems that small business owners face in 2022, and it must be stopped. The deposits are huge, but where are the financial benefits for small business owners and their loyal consumers?</p>The Great Balance Trend In&nbsp;Korea<p>Starbucks, an unregulated entity, spent 180 billion won as of 2020 from customers at their own will! While fintech companies are required to invest 100% of their customers money into safe assets by trusting them with an external agency, Starbucks is not subject to any restrictions or regulations. It can be pointed out that while Starbucks enjoys the benefits of a regulatory vacuum, it is increasingly passive in social contributions. (Reporter Lee Hyun-seung, Chosun&nbsp;Biz)</p><p>The Great Features Of GEMpay: What We&nbsp;Provide</p>THE GEMpay Service&nbsp;Flow<p>We want users to receive a discount from the GEMpay issuer (online and offline stores that issue points through the GEMpay Issuer Center). Through the asset management service (Defi, Cefi, point-secured loan) provided by GEMpay, users will directly determine the discount rate and risk for the deposit and receive additional discounts. So it is “double discount if you have GEM, GEMpay.” Our aim is to significantly increase the scope so that users can safely use their points, which are their assets. AERGO GEM used through GEMpay will guarantee 1:1 value with Korean Won during the payment process. It would be suitable for use as a payment method as there is no risk of fluctuations in&nbsp;value.</p><p>In addition, going beyond a simple payment method, we plan to allow users to directly determine the discount rate and risk by selecting an asset management service for deposits (AERGO GEM charged in GEMpay) according to the risk level of each product. Just as we are trying to guarantee AERGO GEM at a 1:1 value with KRW, we want to solve the rug pull risk for asset management services using a stable token&nbsp;method.</p><p>Making It Possible: We Aim To Make It Possible For The Issuer To Issue Points Simply And Transparently</p><p>We plan to allow the issuer (online or offline stores that issued points that issued points through the GEMpay issuer center) to directly determine the payment discount rate as the subject of the point of issuance without being dependent on a giant platform. The web-based GEMpay Admin (GEMpay Issuer Center) aims to eliminate the risk of SI performance by making it easy to issue points and easily request settlement.</p><p>🎯The GEMpay&nbsp;Roadmap</p>The GEMpay&nbsp;Roadmap<p>We plan to launch the beta version in the second quarter of 2022, starting with the opening of the pre-registration landing page beginning in March. Subsequently, in the third quarter, we plan to officially launch the GEMpay app and plan to provide a service for managing point assets with DeFi. With the goal of linking CeFi services and developing point collateral products by the end of the year, we are running to create a win-win service for both small business owners and consumers!</p> 💎If You Have GEM, You Garner A Double Discount With&nbsp;GEMpay!  💻March PoC And Advance Reservations Open  📍The GEMpay Two Line&nbsp;Summary   Point deposits are also&nbsp;assets!  GEMpay aims to create a smart and safe asset utilization plan, which allows for small business owners to easily issue, manage and settlement points directly without being dependent on large platforms.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-great-double-discount-with-gem-of-gempay-d6baa2899d0d">The Great Double Discount: With GEM Of GEMpay</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Danilo Cattaneo – CEO di InfoCert, Marco Ramilli – CEO di Yoroi e Giuseppe Tusa – Product Marketing Manager di InfoCert, alterneranno i loro interventi durante il webinar promosso congiuntamente da InfoCert e Yoroi, moderato da Arturo Di Corinto.</p>



<p>Martedì 22 Febbraio 2022 dalle ore 17:00 alle ore 18:00<br>(evento soggetto a iscrizione)</p>



<p>Di fronte alla nuova ondata di cyberattacchi, la cui efficacia è legata molto spesso alla capacità di ingannare gli utenti, inducendoli a cliccare su allegati o link all’apparenza innocui ma con conseguenze potenzialmente drammatiche, la sicurezza della PEC risulta a rischio.</p>



<p>La posta elettronica è il primo vettore di attacco per la diffusione di malware, ransomware, phishing, spam, ecc., con l’aumento repentino dello Smart Working, è stata registrata un’ulteriore esplosione dei cyber attacchi via mail che hanno superato il 94% del totale.</p>



<p>Già nel 2020, complice la crisi pandemica, l’incremento degli attacchi cyber a livello globale è stato pari al 12% rispetto all’anno precedente, nei quattro anni precedenti il trend di crescita si è mantenuto pressoché costante, facendo segnare un aumento degli attacchi gravi del 66% rispetto al 2017 (fonte Clusit).</p>



<p>La Posta Elettronica Certificata è diventata uno strumento irrinunciabile nella quotidianità, sia per i cittadini che per professionisti ed imprese, nel percepito degli utenti è uno strumento sicuro, e per tali motivi un canale sempre più appetibile per gli attacchi informatici.</p>



<p>Ma quale evoluzione avrà la PEC nell’immediato futuro? Come fare a renderla più sicura rispetto agli attacchi di phishing?</p>



<p>Danilo Cattaneo e Giuseppe Tusa per InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, e Marco Ramilli per Yoroi, società attiva nello sviluppo di sistemi integrati di difesa cibernetica, risponderanno a queste domande nel webinar in programma Martedì 22 Febbraio 2022 dalle ore 17:00 alle ore 18:00.</p>

<p>You can’t get much better than Spotify –&nbsp;some would even argue that it’s the patron saint of music, streaming here to rescue us all. The freemium business model has allowed users from across the world to access its extensive catalogue of songs and podcasts by simply registering their details. But is it as simple as we all think? Or is there a much bigger cost at hand?</p>



<p>Corporations that offer something for free always want something in return. As the most used audio streaming service in existence, boasting 356 million users, they have a staggering amount of data at their disposal.</p>



 But why does Spotify collect data? 



<p>We’re not saying that the type of data Spotify collects is bad. For years, companies of all sizes have followed our digital footprints! It’s something that we’ve all become used to. Brands like this use data to outline our behaviour patterns and target us with advertisements. However, it’s crucial that you understand the information platforms like this utilise.</p>



<p>But before we get started, it’s important to understand why Spotify collects data. As a business, they want to “provide, personalize, and improve your experience with the Spotify Service.”</p>



 The 12 slices of Spotify data 



<p>Brands as big as Spotify have a duty to be transparent with their customers when it comes to data. To achieve this and align with legislation across the world, Spotify allows its users to download it. If users choose to do this, they will find that it is split up into 12 key areas.</p>



 Playlist 
 Streaming History (audio, video, and podcasts) 
 Your Library 
 Search Queries 
 Follow 
 Payments 
 User Data 
 Family Plan 
 Inferences 
 Voice Input 
 Podcast Interactivity 
 Spotify for Artists 



<p>Spotify uses your behavioural data to make your experience with the app as personalised as possible. On Spotify’s <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/privacy">privacy policy</a>, they say they use your data for personalisation, troubleshooting, developing new features, marketing, research and other legal reasons.</p>



 How does Spotify use this data? 



<p>Remember when we mentioned that big corporations like Spotify always want something in return? Meet Spotify Advertising. If you’re a non-premium member of the app, you will be far too familiar with this. Using the data collected above, Spotify offers brands the ability to advertise to target users with their marketing campaigns. While this is nothing new in the world of advertising, it’s important to be aware of how they do this.</p>



<p>Similarly, to other platforms like Facebook, advertisers can reach people based on their age, gender, and location. Spotify works with advertising partners to share data and work out your interests and preferences. They can show advertising based on your current mood and activity, just by the genre and type of music you are listening to. For example, the selection of advertising that you see when relaxing to your romance playlist will differ from the playlist that you are working out to.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Spotify Wrapped is an example of how a company can conduct in-depth surveillance of our personal behavior over a long period of time and package it as a fun feature that we want to share with others. <a href="https://t.co/lY3yZwDl48">https://t.co/lY3yZwDl48</a></p>— CNN (@CNN) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1466659357832228869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2021</a></blockquote> 



 How can I stop my data being tracked on Spotify? 



<p>Like with many applications today, hidden in the settings of the platform you can limit this. To access these, users need to log in through the desktop app and account page. These are some of the settings that users can switch off:</p>



 Scrolling down to advanced settings, you can block “all cookies for this installation of the Spotify desktop app” and choose whether your playlists are made public or private. 
 Through your account page you can change the setting for “Tailored ads” where you can switch off highly targeted advertising. 
 Through these settings, you can turn off “Facebook data”. We highly suggest this as this stops any data that has been shared from Facebook. 
 You can view and remove what other apps have access to your Spotify account, and we’d recommend going through this, so you have no unwanted access from external sources. 
 Take back control of your data and download the <a href="https://revoke.onelink.me/OBid/746add1">Revoke</a> app today and ensure that you know who has your personal data! 



<p>Over the last few years, Spotify has truly taken on a life of its own. From Spotify Wrapped outing you for listening to Taylor Swift way more than you’d ever admit to it becoming the feature that brings your entire Tinder profile together.</p>

 Highlights <p>This week saw lots of work around Ontology technical developments, as work continues on preparing Ontology chain’s EVM. Good progress is being made to ensure the launch happens in quarter 1 of this year. As always, the community has been active across a number of platforms, discussing the progress of Ontology and looking at what the future of Web3 could look&nbsp;like.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have launched Ontology’s EVM TestNet. Developers are welcome to test it out. Related documents can be found at the <a href="https://docs.ont.io/">Ontology Developer Center</a>.  We have completed the development survey and testing on the improvement of the ONT and ONG decimals.  We are 95% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.  We are 85% done with the truebit challenge design&nbsp;survey.  We are 53% done with the Rollup VM&nbsp;design.   Product Development   ONTO hosted various online activities such as the NFT lottery campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/win-your-first-nft-puzzle-onto-joins-samurai-for-a-2-000-nft-lottery-8716315bdd43">Samurai</a>、<a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-and-haku-swap-team-up-for-a-4-000-liquidity-mining-campaign-278ada1e1d3">Haku Swap</a>、<a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-and-spartan-protocol-team-up-for-a-staking-campaign-with-3-000-up-for-grabs-d0fd13a44eed">Spartan Protocol</a> and <a href="https://gleam.io/cGg2x/onto-teams-up-with-move-network-for-1500-movd-giveaway">Move Network</a>. Participating with ONTO will earn rewards such as NFTs. Follow the <a href="https://t.me/ONTOAnnouncement">@ONTO Wallet Official Announcement</a> in Telegram for more&nbsp;details!   On-Chain Activity   125 total dApps on MainNet as of February 14th,&nbsp;2022.  6,893,839 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 3,564 from last&nbsp;week.  17,060,139 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 25,031 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1471563278023217152?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “Does Ontology realize interoperability?”. Ontology Harbingers shared the current progress of Ontology EVM. At present, Ontology NeoVM and WasmVM, which can provide support for applications built on these virtual machines. Most applications for Web3 are developed on Ethereum. The integration of the EVM will greatly improve the interoperability of Ontology, thereby providing the blockchain infrastructure and DID for both Web2 and Web3 applications. Ontology EVM will be officially launched on the mainnet soon, stay&nbsp;tuned.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He shared the progress of the Valentine’s Day special event: more than 150 community members submitted three-line love letters, which will be officially delivered by Ontology to the recipients designated by the participants.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Coin Rivet, a well-known blockchain media outlet, published an article “<a href="https://coinrivet.com/web3-will-transform-the-internet-we-know-today-says-ontology-founder/">Web3 will transform the internet we know today, says Ontology founder</a>”. Ontology’s founder Li Jun said “Web3 refers to the next era of the internet, a decentralised online ecosystem built upon blockchain, where data is collectively stored. Therefore, to become a Web3 application infrastructure, Ontology not only needs to provide high-quality DID and data solutions, but also needs to achieve high interoperability. We are looking forward to launching our EVM as it will increase cross-chain interoperability, which is key for Web3, and will expand our DID solutions across the ecosystem.”   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>The World Economic Forum — <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/web3-transform-the-internet?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social_scheduler&amp;utm_term=Internet+Governance&amp;utm_content=07/02/2022+05:00">Web3: The hype and how it can transform the&nbsp;internet</a></p><p>“The current internet, Web 2.0, relies on systems and servers owned largely by big corporations, raising concerns over system vulnerability and control. When Meta’s associated platforms suffered a global outage in early October — exacerbated by the centralization of its servers — there were calls to adopt Web3 and its decentralized architecture.”</p><p>In Web3, network interaction and data storage will rely on the decentralized network formed by blockchain, and DID technology will allow users to independently manage their own identity and data. At the same time, technical interconnection and interoperability will also become a key step to open up all systems of Web3 and allow data to flow throughout the entire network and value chain. In this process, Ontology will play the role of infrastructure provider, providing the best DID and data solutions for Web3, and providing the decentralized platform required for application construction.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

   You’ve probably heard of Elasticsearch or the Elastic Stack. The project started as a search engine based on Lucene, an open-source search engine library built by Shay Banon to index his wife’s cooking recipes. Since its early days, Elasticsearch has come a long way and has evolved into the Elastic Stack, a great suite for taking data from any source, in order to search, analyze, and visualize it

  <p>You’ve probably heard of Elasticsearch or the Elastic Stack. The project started as a search engine based on <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>, an open-source search engine library built by Shay Banon to index his wife’s cooking recipes. Since its early days, Elasticsearch has come a long way and has evolved into the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">Elastic Stack</a>, a great suite for taking data from any source, in order to search, analyze, and visualize it in near real-time.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch is a distributed document store; data is serialized as JSON documents and stored in a distributed way across cluster nodes. The inverted index is a data structure that lists every unique word that appears in any document, and also lists the documents in which each word appears. This enables fast full-text searches, a feature not supported or only partially supported by database engines. The index is a collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields. In turn, each field can be indexed in an optimal data structure; for example, an inverted index for text fields, but a BKD tree for a numeric field.</p>

<p>How can be Elasticsearch integrated into a Spring Boot application? What are the options for adding Elasticsearch to a Java app? This post will give you a quick introduction to Elasticsearch integration options.</p>

 Elasticsearch integration options for Spring Boot 

<p>For Java applications including Spring Boot applications, Elasticsearch provides the following <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html">clients</a> for integration:</p>

 
   
    <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/current/index.html">Java Transport Client</a>: Deprecated in Elasticsearch 7.0.0. Provides a client object to execute all operations asynchronously, accepting a listener or returning a future.</p>
   
   
    <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/7.15/index.html">Java REST Client</a>: Composed of the Low Level REST Client and the High Level REST Client. The Low Level Client provides load balancing, failover, persistent connections, and request/response trace logging. The High Level Client works on top of the Low Level Client and is the replacement for the <code>TransportClient</code>. It depends on the Elasticsearch core and provides synchronous and asynchronous APIs.</p>
   
   
    <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/index.html">Java API Client</a>: The new client library, independent of Elasticsearch core, provides strongly typed requests and responses, blocking and asynchronous versions for all APIs, fluent builders and functional patterns, as well as jackson and JSON-b support.</p>
   
 

 Hello Spring Data Elasticsearch! 

<p>Spring Data Elasticsearch is another integration option that adds the Spring repository abstraction at the search layer, providing access and search functionality for domain objects stored in Elasticsearch. Operations are sent through a client connected to the Elasticsearch node. With Spring Data, the High Level REST Client is the default client, although Elasticsearch documentation states that it’s been deprecated in favor of the Java API Client since version 7.15. The Java API Client is not listed as a supported client yet. In the meantime, the Java Transport Client is still supported in Spring Data, but the general recommendation is to use the High Level Client.</p>

<p>Instead of calling the Elasticsearch APIs directly, the repository and REST template abstractions provide a simplified interface for document operations, encapsulating API request/response processing, and exposing a query interface that has multiple implementations for different levels of query complexity. Through the starter dependency, it can also handle client autoconfiguration and automatic document index mapping for simple use cases.</p>

<p>Besides the high-level REST client support, Spring Data provides the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/#elasticsearch.clients.reactive">Reactive Client</a>, a non-official driver based on WebClient, with calls operated directly on the Reactive Stack. The Reactive Client also depends on the Elasticsearch core, as it is designed for handling Elasticsearch request/response types.</p>

 Build an application with Spring Data Elasticsearch 

<p>JHipster provides the Elasticsearch option to add search capabilities on top of your database. The integration is based on Spring Data Elasticsearch repositories, so let’s generate a reactive blog application to explore what the generator provides. The blog application built in this tutorial is based on the JHipster sample <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples/blob/main/reactive-ms.jdl">reactive-ms.jdl</a>, but adding Maven, MongoDB (Elasticsearch integration only works with SQL databases and MongoDB), Bootstrap pagination, Okta authentication, and Kibana for index mapping inspection.</p>

<p>JHipster has a <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/#local-installation-with-npm-recommended-for-normal-users">quick setup</a> you can follow to set up your environment. For installing Node.js, I like <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md">NVM (Node Version Manager)</a></p>

   <code>wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 14.18.3
</code>   

<p>Install JHipster with the following line:</p>
   <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster@7.6.0
</code>   

<p>Verify the JHipster version with the following line:</p>

   <code>jhipster --version
</code>   
   <code>INFO! Using JHipster version installed globally
7.6.0
</code>   

<p>Once your environment is ready, create a <code>spring-data-elasticsearch</code> folder for the project, fetch the application JDL from the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-data-elasticsearch-example">GitHub repository</a>, and generate the application with JHipster:</p>

   <code>mkdir spring-data-elasticsearch
cd spring-data-elasticsearch
https -d raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadev/okta-spring-data-elasticsearch-example/main/blog-reactive-ms.jdl
jhipster jdl blog-reactive-ms.jdl
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Then, change the Redirect URIs to:</p>
   <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc,http://localhost:8081/login/oauth2/code/oidc,http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc
</code>   
<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080,http://localhost:8081,http://localhost:8761</code> for the Logout Redirect URIs.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct (see above, below are the default values) redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The JHipster Registry is also a Spring Cloud Config server, and by default, it is configured with the profiles <code>dev</code> and <code>native</code>, which means the configuration will be provided from the location <code>docker-compose/central-server-config</code>. Update <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code> with the OIDC settings to be shared with all microservices. Set the values from the <code>.okta.env</code> file the Okta CLI created. To avoid copy/paste errors, you can do it from the command line:</p>

   <code>source .okta.env
echo \"
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: $SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: $SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID
            client-secret: $SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET\" &gt;&gt; docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml
</code>   

<p>For the experiment in this tutorial, configure the Kibana interface for Elasticsearch, which will allow visualizations of the Elasticsearch data.</p>

<p>Edit <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> and add the Kibana service like this:</p>

   <code>services:
  ...  
  blog-kibana:
     image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.15.2
     ports:
       - 5601:5601
     environment:
       ELASTICSEARCH_URL: http://blog-elasticsearch:9200
       ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS: '["http://blog-elasticsearch:9200"]'
</code>   
<p>NOTE: The Kibana version must match the version of Elasticsearch that’s used by the <code>blog-elasticsearch</code> image.</p>

<p>Also add the following additional configuration to the <code>blog-elasticsearch</code> service, to expose the ports to the local host for sending APIs requests:</p>

   <code>services:
  blog-elasticsearch:
    ...
    ports:
      - 9200:9200
</code>   

<p>Remove the Keycloak service at the bottom, as Okta will be used as the identity provider (IdP).</p>

<p>Create each application’s container image:</p>

   <code>cd blog
./mvnw -DskipTests -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
</code>   

   <code>cd gateway
./mvnw -DskipTests -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
</code>   

<p>Run all your images with Docker Compose:</p>

   <code>cd ../docker-compose
docker compose up
</code>   

<p>Access the JHipster Registry at <code>http://localhost:8761</code> and sign in with your Okta credentials. When you see all services up and green, go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and sign in with your Okta account.</p>

<p></p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: There is a potential issue observed for the blog service. As <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints.kubernetes-probes">Kubernetes probes</a> are enabled by default, the blog application might change its state to <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code> during start up and Eureka might discard the following heartbeats with state <code>UP</code>. In this case, disable Kubernetes probes in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> with the following environment variable:</p>

   <code>services:
  blog:
    image: blog
    environment:
      ...
      - MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINT_HEALTH_PROBES_ENABLED=false
</code>

<p>During startup, Spring Data Elasticsearch will create the index for the entities annotated with <code>@Document</code>, deriving the mappings from the entity’s annotations. But for the properties, if the field type is not specified, it will default to FieldType.Auto. This means that no mapping entry is written for the property and that Elasticsearch will add a mapping entry dynamically when the first data for this property is stored.</p>

<p>As our Kibana interface was configured in Docker Compose, before creating any entities, let’s inspect the index mappings that were automatically created for the <code>blog</code> microservice. Go to <code>http://localhost:5601</code>, the Kibana dashboard. On the top left menu, go to Management &gt; Stack Management &gt; Index Management &gt; Indices tab. Besides the <code>user</code> index, an index per entity should be listed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Choose for example the <code>tag</code> index. Before persisting any instance, the Mappings tab will look like the following:</p>

   <code>{
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "_class": {
          "type": "keyword",
          "index": false,
          "doc_values": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>As you can see, properties are not mapped yet.</p>

<p>Go back to the application, and in the top-right menu go to Entities &gt; Tag and create some <code>Tag</code> entities. Then create some <code>Blog</code> and <code>Post</code> entities as well. You’ll see that a search box is present on the entity list page. Go ahead and test the search functionality. The results page will return the matches with pagination.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go back to Kibana, and display the <code>Tag</code> mappings after persistence:</p>

   <code>{
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "_class": {
          "type": "keyword",
          "index": false,
          "doc_values": false
        },
        "id": {
          "type": "text",
          "fields": {
            "keyword": {
              "type": "keyword",
              "ignore_above": 256
            }
          }
        },
        "name": {
          "type": "text",
          "fields": {
            "keyword": {
              "type": "keyword",
              "ignore_above": 256
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now the <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> properties have been dynamically mapped with multi-field mapping. For example, the <code>name</code> field is defined with type <code>text</code>, for full-text searches, and it defines a <code>name.keyword</code> subfield for aggregations and sorting:</p>

   <code>"name": {
  "type": "text",
  "fields": {
    "keyword": {
      "type": "keyword",
      "ignore_above": 256
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>It is often useful to index the same field in different ways for different purposes. Text fields are searchable by default, but by default are not available for aggregations, sorting, unless multi-field mapping is in place. There is another option for enabling sorting for text fields, which is the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/text.html#fielddata-mapping-param"><code>fielddata</code> mapping parameter</a>. This option will not be covered in our tutorial, as it is discouraged in the Elasticsearch documentation, because of high memory consumption.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch exposes several APIs, and the Index APIs allow managing individual indices, index settings, aliases, mappings, and index templates. Although Kibana is a user-friendly front-end, you can also query the index mappings through the Index APIs, with an HTTPie command like the following:</p>

   <code>http :9200/tag/_mapping
</code>   

<p>The output should look the same as the mapping visualized in Kibana:</p>

 Key components in reactive Spring Data Elasticsearch 

<p>As mentioned before, the <code>blog</code> application is reactive, and that’s because the JDL file had <code>reactive true</code> in its <code>gateway</code> and <code>blog</code> application configurations.</p>

<p>This config also tells JHipster to include the Elasticsearch dependencies in the <code>blog</code> microservice. JHipster generates the web layer with the entity resource class, and it optionally generates the service class too. Two of the key components that enable the Elasticsearch reactive integration are the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchClient</code> and the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchOperations</code>. A client is required to connect to an Elasticsearch cluster or node, and <code>*Operations</code> is the interface for the execution of CRUD and query commands. The third component is the entity <code>ReactiveElasticsearchRepository</code>, which can provide domain-specific search methods.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When using the starter dependency, <code>ReactiveElasticsearchRestClientAutoConfiguration</code> configures the reactive Elasticsearch client from the Spring Elasticsearch properties. <code>ElasticsearchDataAutoConfiguration</code> is the root configuration class that triggers the reactive search template initialization. Let’s briefly describe each of the mentioned components.</p>

 The reactive client 

<p>The <code>ReactiveElasticsearchClient</code> is based on Spring’s WebClient and calls are directly operated on the reactive stack. The reactive client sends and receives high-level request and response objects. In this example, the reactive client is initialized from <code>spring.elasticsearch.*</code> properties. You can verify the Elasticsearch endpoints are set in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file for the <code>blog</code> service.</p>

   <code>blog:
  image: blog
  environment:
    ...
    - SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_URIS=http://blog-elasticsearch:9200
    ...
</code>   

 The operations abstraction 

<p><code>ReactiveElasticsearchOperations</code> is the gateway for executing high-level commands against an Elasticsearch cluster using the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchClient</code>.
The <code>ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate</code> is the default implementation of <code>ReactiveElasticsearchOperations</code>. Some high-level operations are <code>save</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>delete</code> and <code>search</code>, which accept the Spring Data Query types as parameters.</p>

 The entity search repository 

<p>The entity search repository enables the document CRUD and search operations in the application. The search repository extends <code>ReactiveElasticsearchRepository</code>, the persistence technology-specific abstraction, that builds on the core repository support utilizing operations provided through the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate</code> executed by the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchClient</code>. JHipster generates a search repository for the entities specified in the <code>search</code> option in the JDL. In the example, all entities are set to be searchable in Elasticsearch:</p>

   <code>application {
  config {
    baseName blog
    reactive true
    ...
    searchEngine elasticsearch
  }
  ...
  search * with elasticsearch
}
</code>   

<p>When the entity in the JDL definition requires the Elasticsearch engine, and also pagination, the entity search repository is generated with pagination and sorting options. For example, the generated <code>TagSearchRepository</code> adds a custom <code>search()</code> method that assembles a native search query and passes it to the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate</code>:</p>

   <code>public interface TagSearchRepository extends ReactiveElasticsearchRepository&lt;Tag, String&gt;, TagSearchRepositoryInternal {}

interface TagSearchRepositoryInternal {
    Flux&lt;Tag&gt; search(String query, Pageable pageable);
}

class TagSearchRepositoryInternalImpl implements TagSearchRepositoryInternal {

    private final ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate reactiveElasticsearchTemplate;

    TagSearchRepositoryInternalImpl(ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate reactiveElasticsearchTemplate) {
        this.reactiveElasticsearchTemplate = reactiveElasticsearchTemplate;
    }

    @Override
    public Flux&lt;Tag&gt; search(String query, Pageable pageable) {
        List&lt;FieldSortBuilder&gt; builders = new SortToFieldSortBuilderConverter().convert(pageable.getSort());

        NativeSearchQueryBuilder queryBuilder = new NativeSearchQueryBuilder()
            .withQuery(queryStringQuery(query))
            .withPageable(PageRequest.of(pageable.getPageNumber(), pageable.getPageSize()));

        builders
            .stream()
            .forEach(builder -&gt; {
                queryBuilder.withSort(builder);
            });

        NativeSearchQuery nativeSearchQuery = queryBuilder.build();
        return reactiveElasticsearchTemplate.search(nativeSearchQuery, Tag.class).map(SearchHit::getContent);
    }
}
</code>

<p>The Identity Theft Resource Center has released their 2021 data breach report, with one of their key findings being that the number of data compromises hit an all-time high. <br></p><p>The ITRC is a non-profit dedicated to supporting the victims of cybercrime including individuals, businesses, and governments. In January, they released their 16th Annual Data Breach Report, which sheds light on the persistent, ever-growing threat of cybercrime. Users, enterprises, and organizations all stand to suffer in the wake of a data breach, and this past year’s numbers indicate that threat is not subsiding anytime soon. Here are some takeaway statistics from the report: </p>  The overall number of data compromises (1,862) is up 68% from 2020’s total number  2021’s total number of compromises beat out the previous all-time high of 1,506 in 2017  293,927,708 individuals were affected in total  83% of all compromises involved sensitive user information like social security numbers   <p>According to the data, 2021 was a banner year for cybercriminals, with a significant shift occurring in how stolen data was being used. In an introductory letter to the report, President &amp; CEO Eva C. Velasquez said this: “We may very well look back at 2021 as the milestone year when we officially moved from the era of identity theft to an era of identity fraud. That is to say, the time when cybercriminals shifted from mass data accumulation (identity theft) to mass data misuse (identity fraud). Fueling most identity fraud-related crimes was consumer information stolen from businesses in data breaches.” </p><p>Velasquez went on to say that “[...] consumer information was often the means to the end of attacking businesses through stolen credentials – logins and passwords.”</p><p>In short, not only are users at significant risk when their sensitive information is stolen, but businesses are, too. Data breaches are a lose-lose for every party involved, and as long as companies collect and store passwords, this problem will continue to grow. NuID’s authentication solution can help you <a href="https://nuid.io/solution.html">stop storing passwords</a>, so you don’t become part of a statistic in next year’s breach report. </p><p>You can read the entire ITRC 2021 Annual Data Breach Report by downloading it <a href="https://notified.idtheftcenter.org/s/">here</a>.

				  Where do you put a trust registry in a decentralized digital ecosystem? Not where it turns into a wrench  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:trevor@indicio.tech">Trevor Butterworth</a></p>
<p>The Trust over IP Foundation has just published a&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">long document </a>describing a set of design principles “to inform, guide, and constrain the design of… decentralized digital trust infrastructure.”<br></p>
<p>We’re not convinced that “constraint” is the right theoretical approach for an emerging technology, especially one that is being deployed in different sectors for different use cases. To underscore this, we want to address a particular constraint implied by ToIP’s design concepts that is likely to be fatal to any deployment.</p>
<p>This follows from the design concept of “transitive trust,” which can be summarized by the deduction that If A trusts B and B trusts C, then A can trust C.</p>
<p>In other words, if a Verifier trusts an Issuer, it should logically trust a Holder bearing a digital credential that is verified as being from that Issuer. This is how passports work.</p>
<p>To scale this “trust triangle” for ecosystems where there are many, many issuers of digital credentials, ToIP proposes that the triangle must become a “governance trust diamond,” where a governance authority rules on which Issuers can be trusted by Verifiers.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>This sounds reasonable and straightforward; someone, inevitably, is going to set the rules for an ecosystem and we need to acknowledge that someone in the architecture. How could any verifier know all the possible issuers of a particular kind of credential (say a lab test result) in anything but a very small network? Wouldn’t the simplest way be to ping a trust registry or a rules engine under the control of a governance authority to get that information?</p>
<p>Yes and no. </p>
<p>Yes, because all ecosystems are going to need governance; no, because governance handled through a centralized trust registry or rules engine will, at best, be inefficient, and at worst, be unworkable.
</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>If it doesn’t work offline, it doesn’t work. The fundamental problem with a centralized trust registry is that it’s dependent on real-time calling and this makes the whole system dependent on being able to make those calls. What happens when the connection goes down — or the Internet connection is weak or intermittent? You can’t have a trusted ecosystem that is only capable of delivering trust some of the time.</p>
<p>There is, however, a simple solution to this fatal system error—decentralize the governance so that the trust registry rules are cached locally, in the software for issuers, holders, and verifiers.&nbsp;This means these rules will work offline. We call this “machine-readable governance.” Instead of calling the trust registry to verify in real time, governance authorities publish their rules in files that can be quickly uploaded and propagated across participants in a network. This has the added benefit of making verification quicker as there is no need to check in with an intermediary.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>Think of machine-readable governance as a “smart” trust registry — it makes the governance authority portable. </p>
<p>There’s also another significant benefit to using machine-readable governance: it allows for more complex governance interactions such as “A trusts B and B trusts C, but A only trusts C for some purposes or in some contexts.” A machine-readable governance file makes these “if this, then that” governance rules easy to implement without any sharing of private information with a trust registry.
</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>Diamond of Trust or Ring of Power? We understand that in any ecosystem for verification and data sharing, there needs to be a governance function—where people get to enact governance as to who can participate and how. But it’s not clear that it is wise to encode this function in a third-party entity that functions as the sole source of truth for the entire network. What if some participants want to reject some or all the governance—should they be excluded from the ecosystem?</p>
<p>Another advantage in avoiding a single centralized trust registry model is that it allows multiple governance authorities to coordinate governance rules in hierarchical ways, such as national rules superseding state or local rules. These multiple “opinions” are all available to verifiers who can then choose which combination is important as they evaluate presented credentials. The buck stops at the verifier, and nuanced interpretation is possible. This makes an ecosystem capable of mapping to the governance requirements that exist in the real world.</p>
<p>The phone home problem. A centralized trust registry also raises the problem inherent to any centralized exchange: It knows your business—who’s verifying whom, and who’s using which credentials where. This kind of surveillance runs counter to the spirit of decentralized and self-sovereign identity—especially when you combine it with the next point:</p>
<p>For whom the Trust Registry tolls. A centralized trust registry opens the door to monopolistic business practices and rent seeking. If you allow a third party to erect a toll booth, it will charge a toll. Great for the third party, not so great for everyone using the road. Unsurprisingly, when third-party trust registries and rules engines are created in the real world, this is what happens.</p>
<p>Where sovereign authorities must be in control. In our experience, national governments and global enterprises want to be in control of the things they are supposed to control and are held accountable for. That’s why they prefer machine-readable governance to governance by third parties.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, we recommend ToIP add the concept of machine-readable governance to its design principles and to explore the many ways it can be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A machine-readable governance reference implementation 
<p>For those interested in machine-readable governance, Indicio will shortly make a reference implementation available through the Linux Foundation Public Health’s open source <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea Project</a> for digital health credentials.<br></p>
<p>On March 17, Cardea will then run a second “Interop-a-thon” for companies using Hyperledger Aries Agents to practice implementation in interoperable environments.</p>
<p>Keep checking in with Cardea for more details—or join the <a href="https://lists.lfph.io/g/cardea">Cardea Community Group!</a></p>

A problem crypto actually&nbsp;solves <p>At a time when everyone and their mother has an NFT project, it’s refreshing that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html">the NYTimes is covering a compelling real world use case</a> (via&nbsp;/rcb):</p><blockquote>There are plenty of crypto exchanges, NFT trading platforms and video games that involve buying and selling crypto tokens. But so far, not many crypto projects have had what I’d call “normie utility” — solving problems that exist for people outside the crypto world, that aren’t primarily about buying or selling digital assets and that would be impossible to solve with normal, non-crypto technology.</blockquote><blockquote>Recently, though, I discovered one that&nbsp;does.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s called&nbsp;Helium.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>On a basic level, Helium is a decentralized wireless network for “internet of things” devices, powered by cryptocurrency.</blockquote><p>The key point here is that Helium might have never gotten off the ground without the incentive structure and community building qualities that crypto and tokenomics provides. Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html">the NYTimes’ Kevin Roose&nbsp;again</a>:</p><blockquote>Does it solve a non-crypto problem? Yes. There are millions of connected devices in the world, and connecting these devices to the Helium network is significantly cheaper than buying a cellular data plan for each device. Because of the hot spots’ long range, Helium’s network can also reach places that typical Wi-Fi and cellular networks&nbsp;don’t.</blockquote><blockquote>Is it useful for something other than speculation? Also yes. The Helium network itself has value, and although hot spot owners can (and do) profit when the price of $HNT rises, the main way they’re making money is by adding new hot spots, not by day-trading $HNT tokens on a crypto exchange.</blockquote><blockquote>Could Helium have worked without crypto technology? Not really. The company tried the non-crypto approach, and it nearly went bankrupt. But adding tokens to the mix solved what technologists call the “cold start problem” — the fact that attracting the first users to a new network is often hard, because the network isn’t very valuable&nbsp;yet.</blockquote><p>The concept of crypto and blockchain has been with us for over ten years now, and with all of the media attention the last few years, it’s easy to forget how nascent the space is. The market needed structure. It needed liquidity. It needed economic heft. It needed social and cultural&nbsp;buy-in.</p><p>All of that creates fertile ground for actually useful use cases. Today, projects like Filecoin are teasing concepts around decentralized file storage (aptly named the Interplanetary File System). Solana’s super speedy and scalable blockchain enables the next generation of decentralized applications.</p><p>Many of these projects might have never gotten off the ground if not for crypto’s unique financing model and built-in network incentives.</p><p>The other thing we&nbsp;need?</p><p>New frameworks and standards for identity in a decentralized world.</p><p>Your mom’s NFT project is just part of the&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html">Maybe There’s a Use for Crypto After&nbsp;All</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/133856/onlyfans-launches-verified-nft-profile-pictures">OnlyFans launches verified NFT profile&nbsp;pictures</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/news-explainers/why-some-see-web-30-as-the-future-of-the-internet/52704A70-3918-4EF8-AE02-DAD6D23727A9">Why Some See Web 3.0 as the Future of the&nbsp;Internet</a>  <a href="https://future.a16z.com/go-to-market-in-web3">Go-to-Market in Web3: New Mindsets, Tactics, Metrics |&nbsp;Future</a>  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/02/future-internet-blockchain-investment-banking/621480/">The Internet Is Just Investment Banking&nbsp;Now</a>   2.

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/15/2385399/0/en/Freddie-Mac-Announces-First-Automated-Assessment-of-Direct-Deposit-Income.html">Freddie Mac announced</a> that its Loan Product Advisor® <a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">asset and income modeler (AIM)</a> has been enhanced to provide clients with automated income assessment using consumer-permissioned, direct deposit account data from trusted third-party service providers like Finicity, a Mastercard company. AIM for income using direct deposits increases the confidence in income calculations of certain income types when there is enough direct deposit history sourced from trusted third-party service providers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services (MVS)</a> is approved for this submission through AIM providing direct deposit transaction data to fuel this innovative, data-driven approach. It identifies income streams used for mortgage qualification, delivering accurate risk assessment results.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Assets, income and employment verifications are vital to mortgage lenders looking to verify borrowers’ finances. However, between unreliable results, miscommunications and good old-fashioned paper-chases, verifying assets, employment and income can be cumbersome. MVS helps borrowers get faster approvals with fewer conditions upfront, allowing them to close and get into their homes faster. MVS can help lenders: </p>
 
 More easily assess borrower capacity/automates income calculations. 
 Reduce frustrations caused by paper submissions and reasking for documentation to verify assets, income and employment. 
 Remove subjectivity and manual errors in processing and underwriting. 
 Lower risk and probability of fraudulent activity. 
 Increase referrals. 
 
<p>“We are excited to see a single report for the digital verification of employment, income and assets through Freddie Mac’s direct deposit enhancement within their AIM solution,” said Andy Sheehan, Mastercard EVP of Open Banking Business. “Utilizing consumer-permissioned data and a single source of verification can help mitigate risk for lenders, create an improved consumer experience and ultimately increase overall financial inclusion by helping borrowers realize the dream of owning a home.”</p>
 Efficient Assessment 
<p>AIM leverages consumer-permissioned data from third-party service providers like Finicity, to automate the manual processes of assessing borrower assets and income.&nbsp; MVS improves the success rates for identifying income and employment using data from income transactions. It can also increase the assessed income amount by providing data for a more accurate gross-up calculation.</p>
<p>“Adding Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services is the next step in the evolution of AIM,” said Christina Randolph, Director, Strategic Technology Partnership at Freddie Mac. “Our partnership with Finicity has helped better identify pay deposits data to our AIM capability, using accurate and verifiable data that meet our underwriting standards. This means more opportunities for cost savings for lenders. It does all this while delivering a vastly improved lending experience to borrowers.”</p>
 How It Works 
<p>Once Freddie Mac releases this offering, lenders using Loan Product Advisor v5 0.06 or higher can use it without needing to be accepted into a controlled release program. Once turned on by Freddie Mac, a lender can automatically start using the direct deposit data generated through Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services through a single report. Lenders can use this report by simply contacting Freddie Mac and connecting to Finicity. The report includes 24 months of direct deposit transactional history and also includes Finicity-identified income streams.</p>
<p>The report generated through MVS has two sections; the top section includes credits/debits for asset assessment defaults to 61 days (but can be customized up to 24 months depending on the from date), and the bottom section is up to 24 months of income stream credit transactions only. </p>
<p>As an added bonus, the reduced cost of implementing MVS is reflected directly in the balance sheet. On average, up to 12 days can be cut off the processing time for each loan. The hours formerly spent by loan officers chasing down borrower documents are invested in higher-return work activities such as marketing and sales to drive additional loans.</p>
<p>MVS is available via direct integration, SimpleNexus, ICE Technology and Finicity Reports today. Want to elevate your efficiency while enhancing the customer lending journey? <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage">Get started today</a>.</p>

 What We’re Doing in 2022, and&nbsp;Why Ocean 2022&nbsp;Summary 1. Introduction <p>2021 was a banner year for <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean</a>: we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2021-6875bc1f804f">enhanced</a> on our datatoken-based technology foundation, witnessed an amazing builder ecosystem emerge with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1484164194127814657">hundreds of projects</a>, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2021-06-15-ocean-awarded-world-economic-forum-technology-pioneer">won the WEF Technology Pioneer&nbsp;award</a>.</p><p>2022 promises to be even better! Here’s what’s&nbsp;coming.</p>  Data-exchange products: deliver Ocean V4 including <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">Data NFTs</a> and solving rug pulls; and an explosion of ecosystem products from data wallets to federated learning.  Staking products: Data Farming, H2O stable asset, and&nbsp;veOCEAN.  OceanDAO: Broadening OceanDAO’s scope to include a treasury with yield-generating activities.  Ecosystem Funding: a refined path for teams to get early-stage grants, then scale up with grants or investment. Introduces Ocean Ventures and Ocean Shipyard&nbsp;(redux).  <p>The sections that follow elaborate on each of&nbsp;these.</p> 2. Data-exchange products <p>These are products that drive Ocean’s data-exchange functionality: smart contracts, middleware (JS &amp; Py drivers, metadata cache, etc), and frontends using it like Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> 2.1 Ocean&nbsp;V4 <p>Ocean V4 is coming in Q1 2022. Here are the key features.</p>  Solve rug pulls. In Ocean V3, a publisher would get all initial datatokens; malicious publishers could then rug pull. For V4, the publisher gets no initial datatokens. Instead, when someone adds OCEAN liquidity to a datatoken pool, a special one-sided staking bot mints enough datatokens into the pool to keep price constant. Similarly, when OCEAN liquidity is removed, the bot burns datatokens. Since the publisher is not a whale at the outset, they have nothing to rug pull (!). This mechanic also eliminates slippage when adding/removing OCEAN liquidity.  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">Data NFTs</a>. We NFT-ize base IP to enable transfer of the base IP itself, to support &gt;1 revenue streams on the base IP, to accumulate value to the base IP before monetization, and to leverage the recent growth of tooling in the NFT ecosystem. ERC20 datatokens remain as before: licenses to use the base&nbsp;IP.  Help community monetize. Now, 3rd party marketplaces can earn fees on from swapping, staking, and consuming (versus V3 just consuming), and have more control over fee rates (vs V3 hardcoded). V4 also includes architecture for &gt;1 datatoken type, for more flexible fees, pay-as-you-go Compute-to-Data, and&nbsp;more.  <p>Ocean V4 will include tooling to help migrate data assets and pools from Ocean V3. Ocean V4 will initially get deployed to all the same EVM chains as V3: Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Moonriver, Energy Web Chain. After that, we plan to deploy to more EVM chains over&nbsp;time.</p> 2.2 Ecosystem data-exchange products <p>Coming into 2022, several Ocean ecosystem teams are working on products / technologies that drive Ocean data-exchange functionality. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Mobile data wallets. Think Ocean Market on a mobile app, with built-in wallet functionality treating datatokens as first-class citizens. <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/realdatawhale">Datawhale’s</a> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/DataTokenApp">ALGA wallet</a> launches in Feb 2022. Others are coming&nbsp;too.  Enhancing Ocean Compute-to-Data. Several teams are adding unique functionalities within <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Ocean C2D</a>. These include: mPowered is building <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/first-class-integration-with-parameters-to-c2d-in-ocean-market/1421">more flexible parameters for C2D</a> in Ocean Market, Riddle &amp; Code’s <a href="https://medium.com/@TeamOcean/ocean-protocol-partners-with-riddle-code-efs-and-eloop-to-launch-drive-stake-a5400050f5b1">Drive &amp; Stake</a> has trusted execution environments running inside C2D, and the <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/lynx-building-privacy-preserving-data-infrastructure-for-biometric-wearable-data/1391">LYNX platform maintains brain data&nbsp;privacy</a>.  Federated Analytics &amp; Learning. This enables doing analytics and AI model-building across multiple data silos at once, while remaining decentralized. It leverages C2D too. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-and-raven-protocol-to-add-federated-learning-to-ocean-market-via-compute-to-data-f0314575d3c8#:~:text=Raven%20Protocol%20is%20developing%20a,training%20of%20deep%20neural%20networks.">Raven Protocol</a> and <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/round-14-feltoken-federated-learning-token/1390/4">FELToken</a> are each collaborating with the Ocean core team to make this&nbsp;happen.  Better curation in Ocean Market. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-will-introduce-ratings-reviews-thanks-to-utus-trust-infrastructure-b8a63c37c9d9">UTU is working on bringing social signals</a> to Ocean Market. And, <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/comments-rating-integration/1403">this OceanDAO project</a> is working on decentralized comments &amp; rating for Ocean&nbsp;Market.  #DataFi dapps. Several teams are shipping and continually improving their data-for-DeFi dapps, including <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1491736009390067714">DataX Protocol</a> with <a href="https://www.datapolis.city/">datapolis</a> (and more), and <a href="https://www.datalatte.com/">DataLatte</a> for passive income on staked&nbsp;data.  <p>This is just a sampling. <a href="https://www.oceanpearl.io">Ocean Pearl</a> lists many more excellent data-exchange related projects. Given so many new ones in 2021, we can anticipate more yet for 2022. 💯 for Ocean’s ecosystem:)</p> 3. Staking <p>It’s clear that the Ocean community is highly interested in staking. So far, the core team has supported this via <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">staking in datatoken pools</a>, and planned <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data Farming</a> incentives. Beyond that, DEXes and other places offer other places to stake Ocean, as <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/where-to-stake-your-ocean-12faf60c93fa">this article</a> describes.</p><p>In 2022, the core team and collaborators will bring more staking options to the Ocean community, as follows, released in this&nbsp;order.</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/stable-asset-h2o-backed-by-ocean-is-launched-by-new-order-together-with-reflexer-labs-91d3a29efb21">H2O stable asset</a>. Users can bond OCEAN to earn yield. H2O is a fork of RAI stable asset, built by <a href="https://www.neworder.network/">New Order</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://reflexer.finance/">Reflexer Labs</a>. We expect H2O-datatoken pools to become the standard.  Ocean Data Farming. The intent of the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/where-to-stake-your-ocean-12faf60c93fa">Data Farming announcement</a> remains the same. It rewards — with generous APY — stakers in datatoken pools with high data consume volume. We’re more excited than ever by the promise of Data Farming to drive Ocean&nbsp;usage.  veOCEAN. Adding “ve” will incentivize OCEAN holders to lock up their tokens for greater Data Farming rewards, governance power, and more. veOCEAN will leverage <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-gauges.html">Curve</a> “<a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html">ve</a>” contracts, which <a href="https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512">Balancer</a> <a href="https://stakedaohq.medium.com/introducing-liquid-lockers-vesdt-5febcf169170">and</a> <a href="https://gov.ribbon.finance/t/rgp-9-ribbonomics/486">the</a> broader DeFi ecosystem are adopting. The contracts also include <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-gauges.html">Curve gauges</a>, which we will use to automate Data&nbsp;Farming.  <p>These will all be accessible via an OceanDAO sub-app called OceanFarm, that has quick paths to H2O&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Here’s a rough schedule. H2O is coming in Q1 2022; then Data Farming. Optimistically, veOCEAN will ship in Q2, otherwise in&nbsp;Q3.</p> 4. OceanDAO <p>OceanDAO is currently grants DAO, with monthly batch grants (cohorts of funding). For 2022, we will be expanding the scope of OceanDAO as&nbsp;follows.</p>  OceanDAO will get a treasury. The treasury will get some initial funds from the treasury of Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF), and also leverage some of the 51% supply. OceanDAO will grow the treasury via active yield-generating activities, such as LPing into OCEAN pairs, using <a href="https://www.defipulse.com/defi-list">modern yield-farming tools</a>, and learning best practices from <a href="https://twitter.com/koeppelmann/status/1481218557535006721?s=21">GnosisDAO</a> and&nbsp;others.  OceanDAO will include tools for DAO-based decision-making.  OceanDAO will complement its status-quo batch grants (for seed stage) with rolling grants (for scale-up&nbsp;stage).  We’ll likely implement this via a 1hive garden, which has functionality for treasury, DAO-based decision making (including arbitration), and rolling grants (Conviction Voting). Then, this would be a sub-app of OceanDAO likely called OceanGarden. Schedule-wise, the initial version of OceanGarden will ship the same time as&nbsp;veOCEAN.   5. Ecosystem Funding <p>For 2022, we introduce a refined path for teams to get early-stage grants, then scale up with grants or investment.</p> 5.1 History, Learnings, Opportunities <p>Here’s a brief history of funding in the Ocean ecosystem, things we learned along the way, and some problems / opportunities seen.</p>  Shipyard first launched in fall 2020 as an core-team-curated grants program in fall 2020. OceanDAO was launched in Dec 2020 as community-curated batch grants. As OceanDAO scaled, the core team paused Shipyard in spring 2021. Now, we see that core-team curation and community curation are complementary, each with their own&nbsp;merits.  Throughout 2021, we identified several teams with potential for work of strategic importance to Ocean ecosystem. For some, we created contracts with milestones. Teams have been steadily delivering on these. While these “product contracts” were never an official program, they have been highly useful. How do we make it more official?  2021 has seen many Ocean ecosystem teams become steadily more effective, and grow. How do we catalyze teams to become investable? And, how can we help the Ocean community invest in&nbsp;them?  The Ocean core team has long recognized the value of venture investment. It’s complementary to other&nbsp;funding.  OceanDAO’s community-curated batch grants have low barrier to entry. New teams that deliver and engage the community tend to get more grants, and scale up. However, the “batch” nature means scaled-up teams might not get a grant in a round, which could lead to painful layoffs despite effective delivery. What if scaled-up teams had access to rolling grants? This would also be complementary.  <p>5.2 Holistic Approach for Funding &amp; Investment</p><p>These learnings and questions have led us to create a big-picture view of (a) How project teams can grow their projects, with a well-specified journey from getting early-stage grants, then scaling up with grants or investments, and (b) How individuals investors and OPF can invest in Ocean ecosystem projects. Here’s that&nbsp;view.</p>Project teams follow a journey from seed-stage grants, to scale-up grants, to investment (top row to bottom&nbsp;row).<p>Teams follow the journey from seed-stage grants, to scale-up grants, to investment (top row to bottom row). New teams start in the top right, in seed-stage grants from OceanDAO (top-down curation doesn’t scale well for the long-tail of seed stage). As the team delivers, it can graduate to rolling grants (community — center middle) or Shipyard (strategic — center right). Once a team becomes investable, then it can get investment from community (bottom middle) or from Ocean Ventures (bottom&nbsp;right).</p><p>Note that there are tracks for both bottom-up and top-down curation (left and right columns).</p><p>This big-picture view includes the following new components:</p>  Shipyard. Grants curated by Ocean core team, often with milestones. It draws on learnings from the previous Shipyard program, and organic product contracts. More information coming&nbsp;soon:)  Ocean Ventures. Investment curated by Ocean core team. More information coming&nbsp;soon:)  Rolling grants. This will be part of OceanDAO (section 4.1), likely using <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475">Conviction Voting</a>, as done by <a href="https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0xb25f0ee2d26461e2b5b3d3ddafe197a0da677b98">Giveth</a> and <a href="https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0x1fc7e8d8e4bbbef77a4d035aec189373b52125a8">Token Engineering Commons</a>.  Invest in for-profit tokens means that projects that can be investable, should get investable. This includes for-profit projects (token or company) and public-utility or DAO projects (token, maybe non-profit attached). Projects can create tokens with a DAO attached by <a href="https://gardens.1hive.org/">launching a 1Hive Garden</a>. At some point, there will likely be (fair) constraints on how long a project may get grants if the project can be investable.   6. Conclusion <p>In summary, here’s what Ocean 2022 holds: (a) Ocean V4, Gaia-X, and an explosion of ecosystem products, (b) H2O, Data Farming, and veOCEAN staking, (c ) OceanDAO with active treasury management, and (d) a refined path for teams to progress from early-stage grants through to investment.</p> 7. Appendix: DAOification of&nbsp;OPF <p>Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF) has had several sub-teams for years. For 2022, we have made each team more independent as Lighthouses.

 Physical asset NFTs: sell wonderful, beautiful, valuable physical things as NFTs on OpenSea, Origin or Venly&nbsp;today <p>The Original Mood Ring sells as an NFT for $65k with Mattereum — not just an image of the ring, but the solid gold item&nbsp;iteself.</p><p>Josh Reynolds is the inventor of the mood ring. The 1970s mood ring was <a href="https://www.theoriginalmoodring.io/">the original Quantified Self device</a>. It was an analogue biosensor that show stress as color. The Mood Ring (and the knock offs) became iconic symbols of a general wish for more self awareness in American&nbsp;culture.</p>The Original Mood Ring sold for&nbsp;$65k<p>Josh recently sold an NFT for $65,000 on the Venly exchange. The NFT is not an ordinary NFT of a picture of a mood ring. Rather, it’s a <a href="https://rwanft.io/">Real World Asset NFT</a> which makes you the owner of the physical solid gold mood ring, an authenticated 1970s original.</p><p>That raises three questions.</p>  How do you know what you are buying is&nbsp;genuine?  How do you get the physical asset if you are the NFT&nbsp;owner?  What happens if something goes&nbsp;wrong?  <p>Mattereum answers these questions for our clients with a groundbreaking legal-technical method to enable them to issue NFTs backed by real world assets. We call these “Real World Asset NFTs”, a category that includes intellectual property licensing and, coming very soon, real&nbsp;estate.</p><p>Here is a sample of a Mattereum Asset Passport for a half million year old stone hand axe, which was sold on&nbsp;<a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4aD73411CeC7D05c2EA1a17B4597E76/2">OpenSea</a>.</p><p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.tvg.handaxe.ach.berg.220/">Mattereum Asset Passport: Acheulian Hand Axe</a></p><p>Real estate is the world’s largest asset category. Mattereum spent several years designing bombproof legal-technical integrations to effect the legal transfer of property ownership using a single NFT transaction. Any asset can be loaded into a Mattereum NFT, given a little time and legal&nbsp;work.</p><p>So far we have done <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/47824387705324153400210554042155132922682187088261737780213014300224093421569">gold bullion</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x860849e249a208b38bd078eeb80c0a0b18436417/11">collectibles</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/0">fine art</a>, and <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/1">antiques</a>. Shortly to come: watches, wine, and extremely valuable musical instruments. Intellectual property licensing (music) and real estate are coming very&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Our next major items are an <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-andy-warhol-physical-nft-collection">Andy Warhol print: a real world asset NFT valued at around $200,000</a>; and a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/timmy-trumpet-enters-metaverse-beyond-155000600.html">superstar DJ’s musical instrument insured for $1,000,000</a>. We can do more or less any kind of physical asset&nbsp;now.</p>Superstar DJ Timmy Trumpet’s musical instrument is insured for $1,000,000. The real world asset NFT is bound with a Mattereum Asset Passport (<a href="https://timmytrumpet.story.xyz/">© 2022 ETERNAL by Timmy&nbsp;Trumpet</a>)<p>The Mattereum vision for the future of e-commerce is not just the future of e-commerce or the blockchain. It is the future of commerce. Nearly everything that we buy and sell is plagued by four&nbsp;risks:</p>  How do we know we are buying the right thing? Will the shoes fit? Is the house we want to buy quiet at night or do the neighbors party? Does it work with what I own&nbsp;already?  How do we know we aren’t being ripped off? <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kirimasters/2020/07/30/bezos-admits-to-serious-issues-for-retail-brands-in-antitrust-inquiry-what-will-change/">Even Amazon</a> and the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/billionaire-spends-35m-to-investigate-400k-wine-fraud/">highest level wine collectors</a> have these problems.  What about the environmental, social, and governance impacts of our purchases? Nobody wants enslaved children making their phones or clothing, yet both mineral mining and the garment trade have huge problems with child labour globally.  What if we get stuck with this thing we have bought? We want rid of it, but it’s too expensive to throw in the landfill, and too inconvenient to sell on&nbsp;eBay.  <p>Mattereum’s methodology answers all of these questions. That’s why Mattereum is the future of dcommerce.</p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1e65ad4fb60844925ed95dec8460d8de807b2bc4/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1e65ad4fb60844925ed95dec8460d8de807b2bc4/0</a><p>Mattereum is now accepting new projects. We are currently working with several gold bullion, real estate and collectibles projects. Their NFTs will be coming to market over the next weeks and months. We would like to diversify our client base including fashion brands and fine wine/whisky, and we are always interested in working with artists to make their collections accessible.</p><p>Our unified system makes bringing your physical assets into the NFT world as simple as it can be, but no simpler. Getting the legals right makes it possible to buy and sell genuinely valuable, rare, unique, fascinating things as NFTs, and avoids many of the pitfalls which have befallen others in the industry.</p><p>Mattereum knows that two years from now the standard way of buying large classes of physical assets will be on the blockchain: it’s better than credit cards and centralized e-commerce with Amazon and eBay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/mattereum-perhaps-the-worlds-weirdest-and-most-daring-startup-intends-to-own-literally-everything/">for all kinds of&nbsp;reasons</a>.</p><p>OpenSea alone is doing $200 million of transactions for intellectual property and visual art today. We expect the physical markets to be many times this size, particularly real estate, just as they are in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Your project can be among the first: <a href="https://mattereum.com/contact-us/">reach out to us</a> to arrange an initial consultation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/physical-asset-nfts-sell-wonderful-beautiful-valuable-physical-things-as-nfts-on-opensea-or-c70bcf9682e4">Physical asset NFTs: sell wonderful, beautiful, valuable physical things as NFTs on OpenSea or…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Da oggi è possibile acquistare i prodotti e servizi di InfoCert legati alla conservazione accedendo al marketplace dedicato alla PA messo a disposizione da AgID. La pubblica amministrazione ha infatti a disposizione da gennaio 2022 una piattaforma dedicata che offre prodotti e servizi di conservazione di più alto livello sicurezza, InfoCert è fra i primi provider di servizi legati alla conservazione ad aver ottenuto l’accreditamento. 



<p>Un nuovo ed importante passo è stato compiuto per la Pubblica Amministrazione verso la semplificazione delle procedure da mettere in atto al fine di rispettare i dettami del CAD; il Decreto Semplificazione (D.L. 76/2020), convertito con Legge n. 120/2020, ha apportato infatti numerose modifiche al Codice dell’amministrazione digitale (CAD), tra cui alcune relative al nuovo <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/regolamento_sui_criteri_di_conservazione.pdf">regolamento sui criteri per la fornitura dei servizi di conservazione dei documenti informatici</a>.</p>



<p>L’istituzione da parte di AgID di un marketplace dedicato all’acquisto dei prodotti e servizi legati alla conservazione, diventa di fatto un importante strumento a disposizione degli enti pubblici: esso permette a coloro che vi accederanno di potersi più facilmente orientare nel vasto mercato di servizi legati alla conservazione, con il valore aggiunto di poter accedere ad una piattaforma garantita dall’Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale, avendo la possibilità di reperire quindi servizi di maggior qualità e garanzia.</p>



<p>Il marketplace non rappresenta un elenco o un albo dei conservatori, ma costituisce una vetrina dove le pubbliche amministrazioni possono individuare più agevolmente i fornitori di servizi di conservazione a norma dei documenti informatici e avviare la successiva fase di contrattualizzazione.</p>



<p>La conservazione dei documenti informatici per conto delle pubbliche amministrazioni da parte di soggetti esterni deve uniformarsi – nel rispetto della disciplina europea – alle Linee guida sulla formazione, gestione e conservazione dei documenti informatici nonché al sopradetto regolamento, adottati entrambi dall’Agenzia per l’Italia digitale (AgID), che segnano il superamento del precedente meccanismo di accreditamento dei conservatori. In particolare, l’articolo 34, comma 1-bis del Codice dell’Amministrazione Digitale, prevede che le pubbliche amministrazioni possano procedere alla conservazione dei documenti informatici o all’interno della propria struttura organizzativa, oppure affidandola ad altri soggetti, pubblici o privati che possiedono i requisiti di qualità, di sicurezza e organizzazione.</p>



<p>InfoCert dal 2014 è tra le prime aziende italiane accreditate dall’Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale (AgID) come Conservatore, requisito normativo necessario per erogare servizi di Conservazione Digitale a norma per la Pubblica Amministrazione, il suo approdo al Marketplace di AgID fa sì che una gamma di prodotti e servizi di valore, siano sempre più a disposizione degli enti pubblici, i quali potranno usufruire in maniera intuitiva e veloce, di servizi ad alto valore tecnologico, con un conseguente vantaggio in termini di risparmio dei costi e aumento delle performance.</p>



<p>Per approfondire alcuni dettagli in materia di conservazione digitale a norma, rimandiamo alla lettura dell’articolo: <a href="https://www.infocert.it/che-cose-la-conservazione-digitale/">https://www.infocert.it/che-cose-la-conservazione-digitale/</a></p>



<p>Dalla 1° gennaio 2022 inoltre, hanno piena applicabilità anche le&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/linee_guida_sul_documento_informatico.pdf">Linee Guida sulla formazione, gestione e conservazione dei</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/linee_guida_sul_documento_informatico_.pdf">documenti informatici</a>.</p>

        <p>UNISOT joins The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway at the European Commission’s Early Adopters Program as the SSI technology provider.</p>
<p>The European Commission has launched an Early Adopter Program to support public sector institutions in EEA countries in testing out use cases on EBSI. UNISOT is piloting a triple accounting solution which relies on Self-Sovereign Identity principles. EBSI is the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure, a pan European permissioned public ledger based on public standards and open governments model. UNISOT is a partner on this project and is providing the technical solution for Self-Sovereign Identity compatible with the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF).</p>
<p>The European Commission’s Early Adopter Program is an initiative comprised of EU and EEA member states eager to become pioneers in implementing EBSI use cases (Self-Sovereign Identity, Document Traceability, Diplomas and Trusted Data Sharing). In this, second wave of pilots, many European countries and organizations are onboarding onto the EBSI test platform, including The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (Finanstilsynet), which in collaboration with UNISOT is piloting a use case related to triple accounting based on the EBSIs Document Traceability and Self-Sovereign Identity use cases. This aims to ensure legal compliance in accordance with eIDAS 2.0 directive.</p>
<p>The project has entrusted UNISOT to provide the participating entities with a full SSI technology platform, including an end-user wallet (UNISOT ID), which will also have Verifiable Credential issuing features and credential verification tools for relying parties. This is an uncommon model in the SSI space which foresees the wallet software being used only as a holding agent and for purposes of providing access to one’s data. The UNISOT wallet will integrate the full life cycle of a Verifiable Credential, from issuance and storage to verification as this is in line with the use case to enable document cross-signing between multiple parties.</p>
<p>Through collaboration amongst all entities, UNISOT aims to integrate its product suite with EBSI and become a fully compatible SSI solutions provider in the Scandinavian region. Through this pilot UNISOT aims to achieve compliance with EBSI guidelines and provide the market with a compliant wallet solution which passes EBSI conformance testing.</p>

<p>“As the world is increasingly interconnected, everyone shares the responsibility of securing cyberspace” – Newton Lee</p>



<p>With increasing cybercrime, single sign-on (SSO) solutions are no longer the best defense in preventing data breaches. SSO solutions rely on restricting data rather than protecting it, and since login credentials are the key focus of cybercriminals, it is no surprise&nbsp; that almost <a href="https://www.isdecisions.com/single-sign-on-active-directory-security-issues/">81%</a> of data breaches are caused by credential misuse. To overcome SSO shortcomings, it’s necessary to deploy multi-factor authentication to protect sensitive data.&nbsp;</p>



 What is Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security system that requires users to prove their identity in multiple ways before accessing user accounts, VPN, or shared resources. MFA is a core component of identity access management policy and relies on more than just a single piece of evidence. With MFA, each piece&nbsp; of evidence that the user possesses is different:&nbsp; something they have, something they know, and something they are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Small to midsize businesses are increasingly implementing MFA policies, and Gartner predicts that by the end of 2022, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-a-passwordless-approach-to-improve-security/">60%</a> of large and global enterprises and 90% of midsize enterprises will implement a complete passwordless approach.&nbsp;</p>



 How Does Multi-Factor Authentication Work? 



<p>MFA is easy-to-use and adds a powerful extra layer of protection by&nbsp; requesting verification information after a user inputs their login credentials. This additional information can include one-time passwords (OTPs), <a href="https://imageware.io/resource/biometric-authentication-access/">biometric authentication</a>, or authentication via an application.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Based on the type of authentication, MFA is be categorized into three main types:</p>



  Knowledge factor: Requires answering a personal security question. Knowledge factor authentication usually contains passwords, PINs, and OTPs.&nbsp;  Possession factor: Requires access to specific items, such as an ID badge, token key, or a SIM card.&nbsp;  



  Inherence factor: Requires biometric authentication, such as fingerprint, iris, retina, voice, or hand geometry.  



 4 Benefits of Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>MFA plays an important role in information security by protecting data against hackers and potential breaches. MFA benefits include</p>



 1. Multiple Layers of Security 



<p>MFA provides more layers of security than those offered by two-factor authentication. These additional layers ensure that the customers logging in are who they claim to be. For example, in the case of data theft, hackers may steal one piece of information but with MFA they will be unable to authenticate themselves without the additional required information.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Easy Deployment 



<p>Because MFA is easy to use and non-invasive in nature, it doesn’t affect the rest of an organization’s virtual space. Its innate user experience is one&nbsp; of the reasons why users choose MFA.</p>



 3. Regulatory Compliance 



<p>Implementing MFA can help organizations remain in compliance with necessary regulations. The PCI DSS (payment card industry data security standards) requires that MFA be deployed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing data. Even if application updates result in unintended consequences, MFA will ensure the system remains secure.&nbsp;</p>



 4. SSO Compliance 



<p>An industry-compliant MFA comes with an SSO solution. Using a secondary identification with SSO confirms user identities and reduces the risk of data breaches due to password theft.&nbsp;</p>



 Examples of Risk-based Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Organizations can use&nbsp; different MFA types for their employees, customers, and users, with some organizations bypassing the MFA for low-risk scenarios while requiring stronger authentication in high-risk environments. For example:</p>



  A bank may allow customers to simply log in with their credentials but require additional authentication methods, such as biometric authentication, before completing a transaction.&nbsp;  An organization may need a higher level of assurance that an employee is someone they claim to be when accessing certain areas of the organization, such as a server room, compared to lower risk areas such as a coffee shop, cafeteria, or conference rooms.  A retailer may set up MFA for vendors who log in from a non-company-owned device to ensure that the person logging in&nbsp; is not a hacker who is trying to gain access with a stolen password or PIN.&nbsp;  



<p>Risk-based MFA is adaptive and strengthens security only when warranted, ensuring these security measures can evolve over time.&nbsp;</p>

Is D.C. taking crypto seriously? Congressman Tom Emmer shares the latest from the ongoings in Washington. Minnesota Representative Emmer is a 4th term member of the House of Representatives. He sits on the House Financial Services Committee and is a dedicated crypto advocate. Many of us have preconceived notions that the majority of the government is anti-crypto.

  <p>Fauna is a transactional database that is delivered to your application as a secure cloud API. Fauna hosts your database and then allows your application to make calls against it. Typically, to secure such an API, you would establish a relationship between your users and the database in your code. This would mean signing in your users using your authentication provider, in this case, Okta. Then you would need to convert that user to an authorized user to connect to your API.</p>

<p>Fauna cuts out the intermediary by directly accepting Okta as an authentication provider, thus securing your application and your database using your Okta login alone.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a new Okta application, a new authorization server for that application, and a Fauna database. You will secure the Fauna database with OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect application and authorization server 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the issuer and client ID as you will need them in your application.</p>

<p>Once you have created the application you will need to set up a custom authorization server. FaunaDB will provide the appropriate audience to supply with your access token. However, Okta will not allow you to change the audience on the default authorization server.</p>

<p>Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your favorite browser. Log in and navigate to Security &gt; API. Select Add Authorization Server and give it a meaningful name and description. You can set your audience to anything (it cannot be left blank), but you will need to change this after setting up your FaunaDB database.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click on Access Policies &gt; Add Policy. Name it “Default” and give it a description.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Press Create Policy  and then click Add Rule. Name the rule “Default Rule” and make sure  Authorization Code is selected in the Grant Type section. You can leave the rest of the rule as it is, but I encourage you to review these settings should you need to change them in the future.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, return to the Settings tab and open the Metadata URI link. You will need the <code>jwks_uri</code> and <code>issuer</code> values from this page.</p>

<p>You can now create your Fauna database but leave the Okta Admin Console open as you will need to change the audience in your authorization server after setting up the Fauna database.</p>

 Create a Fauna database 

<p>Next, head over to <a href="https://fauna.com/">Fauna</a> and sign up for a new account. After you’ve registered and authenticated, click on Create Database and name your database “Products”. Select the Classic Region Group for this tutorial. Click on the Use demo data checkbox and click Create. Fauna will automatically build a new database for you with data collections for customers, managers, orders, products, and stores. You can click on any of these collections to see the same data behind them.</p>

<p>Now you will need to add a new role to the database. Fauna requires that you assign a custom role to your provider. Under the Security tab, navigate to Roles. Click New Role. Name your role “User” and add the <code>products</code> collection to it. Give this role Read access. Click Save to save the changes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you will want to list Okta as a registered provider for this database. Select the Providers tab and select New Access Provider. Name the new provider “Okta” and add the details for your Issuer and JSON Web Key Secret URI that you retrieved from Okta earlier. Add the <code>User</code> role to the provider and click Save. Now Fauna will accept the token from Okta and treat the user as though they are part of the <code>User</code> role, giving that user access to read the product’s collection.</p>

<p>Finally, under the Providers tab click the settings wheel next to Okta. Copy the audience URL from here and return to your Okta Admin Console. Under your authorization server click Edit and replace the placeholder audience value with the one you copied from Fauna.</p>

 Create a React app with FaunaDB 

<p>Now that Okta and Fauna are set up to work with each other it’s time to create your site that will make use of both. Start by using the task runner <code>npx create-react-app products</code> to scaffold a new React application. Once the task runner has completed, type in <code>cd products</code> to navigate in to your new project.</p>

<p>For this project, you will need to install a few packages from npm. First, you will want to include the packages to make securing your application with Okta quick and easy.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@6.0.0 @okta/okta-react@6.4.2
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need the FaunaDB JavaScript driver to make calls against your database.</p>

   <code>npm i faunadb@4.5.2
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to include <code>react-router-dom</code>.</p>

   <code>npm i react-router-dom@5.3.0
</code>   

<p>Now you can set up a <code>.env</code> file with your environment variables. Create a file named <code>.env</code> in the root of your application. Open the file and add the following code to it.</p>

 <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE=
REACT_APP_OKTA_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_ID={yourAuthorizationServerId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
</code> 

<p>Next, add a new file to your <code>src</code> directory called <code>AppWithRouterAccess.jsx</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Route, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

import Home from './Pages/Home';

const AppWithRouterAccess = () =&gt; {
  const issuer = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE + '/oauth2/' +
    process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_ID;
  const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
  const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + '/callback';

  const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
    issuer: issuer,
    clientId: clientId,
    redirectUri: redirect,
  });

  const history = useHistory();

  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
    history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
  };

  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home}/&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
};

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

<p>This file sets up your Okta authentication and wraps your routes with the <code>&lt;Security&gt;</code> node. This will provide access to the <code>oktaAuth</code> object in those routes.</p>

<p>You will need to add it to your stock <code>App.js</code> file to make this file work. Open <code>src/App.js</code> and replace the code there with the following.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import AppWithRouterAccess from './AppWithRouterAccess';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;AppWithRouterAccess/&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>Along with using the <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code>, this file also imports Bootstrap, which you will use for styling.</p>

   <code>npm i react-bootstrap@2.1.2 bootstrap@5.1.3
</code>   

<p>Add the pages and components that will bring your application to life. Then add two new folders to your <code>src</code> directory; <code>Components</code> and <code>Pages</code>. In the <code>Pages</code> directory, add a file called <code>Home.jsx</code> and put the following code in it.</p>

   <code>import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Container } from 'react-bootstrap';
import faunadb from 'faunadb';

import { withOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

import Header from '../Components/Header';
import Products from '../Components/Products';

export default withOktaAuth(
  class Home extends Component {
    constructor(props, context) {
      super(props, context);

      this.getProducts = this.getProducts.bind(this);
      this.handleResult = this.handleResult.bind(this);

      this.state = {
        products: undefined,
        pendingProducts: false,
      };
    }

    async getProducts(accessToken, cb) {
      this.setState({
        pendingProducts: true,
      });

      const client = new faunadb.Client({
        domain: 'db.fauna.com',
        secret: accessToken,
        scheme: 'https',
      });
      const q = faunadb.query;

      const {Documents, Collection} = q;

      client
        .query(
          q.Map(
            q.Paginate(Documents(Collection('products'))),
            q.Lambda((x) =&gt; q.Get(x))
          )
        )
        .then((result) =&gt; {
          cb(null, result);
        })
        .catch((err) =&gt; {
          cb(err, null);
        });
    }

    handleResult = (err, result) =&gt; {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      } else {
        this.setState({
          products: result.data,
          pendingProducts: false,
        });
      }
    };

    componentDidMount = () =&gt; {
      if (
        this.props.authState?.isAuthenticated &amp;&amp;
        !this.state.pendingProducts &amp;&amp;
        !this.state.products
      ) {
        this.getProducts(
          this.props.authState.accessToken.accessToken,
          this.handleResult
        );
      }
    };

    render() {
      return (
        &lt;Container&gt;
          &lt;Header
            authState={this.props.authState}
            oktaAuth={this.props.oktaAuth}
          &gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
          &lt;Products
            authState={this.props.authState}
            products={this.state.products}
          &gt;&lt;/Products&gt;

          &lt;footer className='text-muted'&gt;

        &lt;/Container&gt;
      );
    }
  }
);
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you chose US or EU for your database’s region, the domain will need to be <code>db.us.fauna.com</code> or <code>db.eu.fauna.com</code>.</p>

<p>Your application will only have one page. Depending on the state of the application, you will display different messages to the user. If the user isn’t logged in, present them with a message telling them such and a login button. When the user clicks the login button, Okta takes care of the authentication process, and signs in the user. You can access information about the user’s state using <code>this.props.authState</code>.</p>

<p>If the user is logged in but the data hasn’t loaded from Fauna, you can display a simple loading message. Once the data is received then you can present the products to the user. This will happen in the <code>Products</code> component that you will write shortly. To retrieve the data from Fauna, you need to import the <code>faunadb</code> library and provide it with the <code>accessToken</code> from Okta.</p>

<p>Next, in your <code>Components</code> folder add a file named <code>Header.jsx</code>. Add the following code for it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Navbar, Nav, Form, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'

const Header = ({authState, oktaAuth}) =&gt; {

  if (authState?.isPending) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  }

  const button = authState?.isAuthenticated ?
    &lt;Button variant='secondary' onClick={() =&gt; {
      oktaAuth.signOut('/');
    }}&gt;Logout&lt;/Button&gt; :
    &lt;Button variant='secondary' onClick={() =&gt; {
      oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect()
    }}&gt;Login&lt;/Button&gt;

  return (
    &lt;Navbar bg='light' expand='lg'&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Brand href='/'&gt;Products with FaunaDB&lt;/Navbar.Brand&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Toggle aria-controls='basic-navbar-nav'/&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Collapse id='basic-navbar-nav'&gt;
        &lt;Nav className='mr-auto'&gt;
        &lt;/Nav&gt;
        &lt;Form className='d-flex'&gt;
          {button}
        &lt;/Form&gt;
      &lt;/Navbar.Collapse&gt;
    &lt;/Navbar&gt;
  );
};

export default Header;
</code>   

<p>This file gives a home button for the user as well as a logout button for logged-in users or a login button for those who need it.</p>

<p>Finally, add a file for <code>Products.jsx</code> in your <code>Components</code> folder and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

const Products = ({authState, products}) =&gt; {
  if (!authState?.isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      &lt;div className='row'&gt;
        &lt;div className='col-lg-12'&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            Hey there, it looks like you aren't logged in yet. To log in, click
            here.
          &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  } else if (!products) {
    return (
      &lt;div className='row'&gt;
        &lt;div className='col-lg-12'&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            Loading...
          &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;table className='table table-striped'&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;

        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        {products.map((product, i) =&gt; {
          return (
            &lt;tr key={i}&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;{product.data.name}&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;{product.data.description}&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;
                {'$ ' +
                  product.data.price
                    .toFixed(2)
                    .replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, '$1,')}
              &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
          );
        })}
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default Products;
</code>   

<p>This component handles the presentation of the products once they have returned and provides the loading message for the user.</p>

 Run your React + FaunaDB application 

<p>With your application ready you can execute the command <code>npm start</code> to see your application. Log in using your Okta credentials and wait a moment for the data to be returned from FaunaDB.</p>

 Learn more about FaunaDB and React 

<p>This is just the beginning of what you can do with FaunaDB and custom providers. The best part is you don’t have to move away from Okta to properly secure your application. You can now manage access and authorization levels to your database from Okta rather than on the FaunaDB side. And using the libraries provided by Fauna and Okta, it’s fast and easy to set up a secure web application with a FaunaDB backend.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-faunadb-react-example">@oktadev/okta-faunadb-react-example</a> repository.</p>

<p>From an industry-leading solution to the Travel Rule to a truly frictionless customer experience, this is what CCOs and CEOs should know about our FATF Travel Rule solution — and why you should use&nbsp;it.</p><p>To comply, or not to comply? That is the question for many VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) in blockchain and crypto. Uncertainty and apprehension are not entirely surprising given the current regulatory landscape, where implementation of the FATF’s guidance on VASPs has been overly nebulous. We know that for many, compliance is considered an unnecessary cost and confusing path to navigate, where FUD exists around PPI (Protected Personal Information) and data security, decentralization, and interoperability. We’re here to change&nbsp;that.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-core-team-open-sources-veriscope-makes-travel-rule-compliance-open-free-and-adb4a8b6945e">Shyft Network Core Team Open Sources Veriscope, Makes Travel Rule Compliance Open, Free, and…</a></p><p>Enter Veriscope, Shyft Network’s Travel Rule solution: a decentralized discovery and coordination infrastructure and P2P data transmission network, allowing VASPs to remain compliant, preserve data integrity and sovereignty and enable a truly frictionless customer experience. We focus deeply on global interoperability with participation from large VASPs across several jurisdictions. To date, leading <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf">exchanges</a> globally like <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/%E2%80%8Bbinance-deploys-shyft-networks-veriscope-to-support-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-421499824684902555">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/17/bitmex-deribit-tap-shyft-network-for-fatf-travel-rule-solution/">Bitmex</a>, Bitfinex, Deribit, and <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/tether-begins-testing-and-integration-of-veriscope-shyft-networks-solution-to-the-travel-rule-55af3e800fd8">Tether</a> have already announced their participation and collaboration with Veriscope.</p><p>We know that when navigating the compliance space — whether you’re an exchange, custodian or CCO (Chief Compliance Officer) — you will have questions about how different solutions work and what your options are. Below, we’ve highlighted some of the key advantages of Veriscope, which we believe truly separates us from the pack of other Travel Rule solutions in the&nbsp;market.</p> 1. How frictionless is the Veriscope customer experience? <p>Very. While other Travel Rule solutions might ask their customers for VASP details (name, address, VASP code, etc.) Veriscope doesn’t. When using our solution, you don’t need to collect beneficiary VASP details, including VASP codes. Veriscope offers automated and accurate detection of beneficiary VASP details directly from the beneficiary’s wallet address — so you don’t have to. Imagine, from your customers point of view, there will be no change to how they transact&nbsp;today.</p> 2. Is Veriscope a safe and secure solution? <p>Security of customer information and trust are paramount to Veriscope. We offer a VASP-to-VASP transfer of customer PII, and there is never any storing of customer PII by Veriscope. Customer PII doesn’t even relay or route through our servers; it is a completely P2P solution. You can also trust our secure technology to prevent data mining of your customer PII through an explicit and unique customer consent mechanism.</p> 3. How can we trust the VASPs who use Veriscope? <p>Good question! Veriscope utilizes VASP due diligence information to internationally recognized standards, with an option to seek a third-party verification from major global law firm DLA Piper. We also offer you the capability to select counterparty VASPs based on jurisdiction, license, and/or due-diligence status. This is the only solution to offer this capability to meet FATF guidelines and protect your customer&nbsp;PII.</p> 4. Is Veriscope a popular solution? <p>We’re already in advanced stages with the majority of transaction flow for the global VASP market — and the numbers don’t lie: VASPs responsible for over 60% of global transaction flow are already evaluating or integrating Veriscope. Significant large-scale VASP development input since inception means you can expect unparalleled support and industry alignment from our&nbsp;product.</p> 5. Is Veriscope committed to open technology and decentralization? <p>Absolutely. Veriscope is a future-proof, completely open technology. Decentralization is on our radar as a priority to prepare for next-generation VASPs, such as DeFi. And yes, we’re already speaking with DeFi providers about participation in Veriscope because our technology is perfectly aligned. Regarding openness, Veriscope is built by VASPs, for VASPs. Our open architecture allows for co-development by VASPs to continuously improve our solution.</p> 6. Does Veriscope require expensive fees — and a lot of&nbsp;them? <p>Our blockchain-based architecture enables consistently low transaction fees. We have zero set-up fees, zero minimum charges, and zero ongoing licensing fees. You only pay per-transaction network fees with a native token, where you can control the&nbsp;fee.</p> 7. Does Veriscope work with other Travel Rule protocols? Is it interoperable? <p>Yes, and yes. Veriscope is integrating with other Travel Rule protocols to enable the broadest VASP network reach. Watch for our announcements as these come online in the coming weeks! Veriscope can also integrate with third-party service providers such as blockchain analytics firms to provide an all-in-one solution. It’s a one-stop-shop for VASPs — from big to&nbsp;small.</p> 8. Is Veriscope able to look back at past transactions? Can you protect against the “Sunrise&nbsp;Issue?” <p>We’re proud to be the only Travel Rule solution protecting against the Sunrise Issue. No other solution can provide this. We permit a historic transaction lookback on any transaction involving a VASP broadcast to Veriscope before the date of integration. Additionally, transaction broadcasts are immutable records on-chain, providing an open, permanent audit&nbsp;trail.</p><p>If Veriscope sounds like the solution for you and you’d like to learn more, and receive integration guidance, <a href="https://veriscope.network/">contact us&nbsp;now.</a></p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems.

				 <p>Some ideas or concepts are by nature perfect. Look at the wheel, over thousands of years it has remained the same. Humans are natural storytellers and are wired to think in terms of stories. When we hear stories we can’t help but imagine ourselves being inside them. Like the wheel, it has always been this way. It’s not often that things stay the same in the technology ecosystem. This video was shot eight years ago, and it’s still just as relevant in 2022.</p>
<p>In this short video I discuss Requirements vs. Stories and the role they play in the ops and application environment. Sometimes, frustrating discussions can take place around the concept of requirements. There are many players on the contract bringing about different requirements. Everyone wants to understand the deep requirements, but putting them front and centre can create a problem. Players are constantly looking to put a check in the numerous requirement boxes once they’ve been met. The trouble in this comes when you have a mass amount of data to break down. In the ops and application space, there can be a lot going on and far too many moving pieces to meet just the requirements. We don’t instinctively think in terms of requirements. They are there, and they are important, but it is the operational story that matters.</p>
<p>It’s all about the stories.</p>

This is a risk organizations can’t afford to ignore.

  As companies shift to cloud-native applications, the complexity of a microservices framework can be daunting. When applications are built in a cloud-native stack, authorization is also infinitely more complex. Crucially, Open Policy Agent (OPA) decouples policy from code, enabling the release, analysis, and review of policies without impacting availability or performance.

  <p>AngularJS 1.0 was released in October 2010. At the time, it was considered one of the most revolutionary and popular web frameworks ever to see the light of day. Developers loved it, and created many apps with it. However, as a pioneer in the JS framework space, AngularJS had some growing pains and significant issues. The team went back to the drawing board for a major breaking release with Angular 2. It took two years to develop and influenced many devs to hop onto other frameworks in the meantime.</p>

<p>Today, five years after Angular 2 was released, we just call it “Angular”, and its version numbers have far less meaning. Five years is a long time for a modern JS web framework to live and thrive. If you look at the number of Stack Overflow questions, you’ll see that users struggle with React far more than Angular.</p>



 


<p>I kid, I kid. 😅</p>

<p>I don’t think Stack Overflow tags indicate that developers have a hard time with the framework; I think they indicate a thriving community. The more people use technology, the more they submit questions for it.</p>

<p><a href="https://hotframeworks.com/">hotframeworks.com</a> lists a score that combines GitHub stars with Stack Overflow tags and says the top six web frameworks are as follows (at the time of this writing):</p>

 
   React 
   ASP.NET MVC 
   Angular 
   Ruby on Rails 
   AngularJS 
   Vue.js 
 

<p>Angular is still very popular among developers. If you’re developing an Angular app today, you probably need a way to authenticate your users. That’s where OpenID Connect (OIDC) can help you. OIDC is a layer on top of OAuth 2.0 that provides identity.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to add OIDC authentication with Auth0 to a new Angular app in just a few steps.</p>

<p>If you would rather follow along by watching a video, check out the screencast below from <a href="https://youtu.be/YiR7XFgsD8w">the OktaDev YouTube channel</a>.</p>

 
            
         

 Create an Angular app 

<p>First, you’ll need to create a new Angular app with routing enabled. Install the Angular CLI globally, then create an app.</p>

   <code>npm i -g @angular/cli@13
ng new auth0-demo --routing
</code>   

<p>You’ll be prompted to select your favorite stylesheet format. The selection you make doesn’t matter for this example since we’re focused on functionality rather than updating visuals.</p>

 Add Auth with OpenID Connect 

<p>To add authentication with Auth0, you’ll first need a <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">free Auth0 account</a>. Install the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli#installation">Auth0 CLI</a> and run <code>auth0 login</code> to register your account. Then, run <code>auth0 apps create</code>. Use the name <code>auth0-demo</code> and specify a description of your choosing. Select Single Page Web Application and use <code>http://localhost:4200/home</code> for the Callback URL. Specify <code>http://localhost:4200</code> for the rest of the URLs. We’re using 4200 as the port here because that’s the default for local Angular development.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can also use the Auth0 Console to create an OIDC app:</p>

   
     <a href="https://auth0.com/auth/login">Log in</a> to Auth0 or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">create an account</a> if you don’t have one. Go to Applications &gt; Create Application. 
     Choose Single Page Web Applications as the application type and click Create. 
     Click Angular, then the Settings tab. 
     Add <code>http://localhost:4200/home</code> as an Allowed Callback URL and <code>http://localhost:4200</code> as a Logout URL. 
     Specify <code>http://localhost:4200</code> as an Allowed Origin and click Save Changes at the bottom. 
   
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have a new Angular app and Auth0 OIDC set up, you can use <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#angular--auth0">OktaDev Schematics</a> to add OAuth 2.0 and OIDC support to your Angular app. Be sure to execute this command in the folder for the app itself (<code>auth0-demo</code>) adjacent to <code>package.json</code>.</p>

   <code>ng add @oktadev/schematics --auth0
</code>   

<p>The Auth0 CLI will prompt you for an issuer URL and client ID, which were displayed when setting up the app in Auth0. If you used the CLI, it would have shown the issuer URL right above the client ID.</p>

   <code>=== dev-0ua1y-go.us.auth0.com application created

  CLIENT ID            TJgZxGnlSkqUe6JfMFSipZcFsbpl6LS2
</code>   

<p>This process will perform the following steps for you:</p>

 
   Install the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular">Auth0 Angular SDK</a>. 
   Add <code>src/app/auth-routing.module.ts</code> with your OIDC configuration and initialization logic. 
   Configure an <code>AuthHttpInterceptor</code> that adds an <code>Authorization</code> header with an access token to outbound requests. 
   Create a <code>HomeComponent</code> and configure it with authentication logic. 
   Update unit tests for <code>AppComponent</code> and <code>HomeComponent</code> to mock Auth0. 
 

<p>To see all the changes it makes to your files, see <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-angular-example/pull/1/files">this pull request on GitHub</a>. If you’re interested in learning more about Schematics, I recommend reading my <a>Use Angular Schematics to Simplify Your Life</a> tutorial.</p>

</blockquote>

 Test your Angular authentication flow 

<p>Run <code>ng serve</code> in your app, and you should see a login button at <code>http://localhost:4200/home</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Login button and sign in with one of the configured users for your Auth0 application. Because this is just a demo, you probably haven’t done that - more likely, you should sign up as a new user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After login, you’ll be redirected back to your app, and you’ll see a Logout button displayed in the bottom left corner.</p>

<p></p>

 Display the authenticated user’s name 

<p>To display the authenticated user’s name, you can use the <code>user$</code> observable on the <code>AuthService</code> instance.</p>

<p>Modify <code>src/app/home/home.component.html</code> to display a welcome message to the user.</p>

   <code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="(auth.isAuthenticated$ | async) === false" (click)="login()" id="login"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;div *ngIf="auth.user$ | async as user"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Welcome, {{user?.name}}!&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated$ | async" (click)="logout()" id="logout"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Refresh your app, and you should see your name displayed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If everything works—congrats!</p>

<p>Introduction: Isolationism: AERGO’s Solution: The Utilization Of Merkle&nbsp;Bridge</p>The Great Connection<p>Blockchain isolationism is a focal problem that the totality of the cryptocurrency space faces; multi-chain technology enables universal interconnectivity between different projects. Although the usage of digital assets and different blockchains are increasing at a rapid rate, isolationism is still the predominant “law” of blockchains. The exchange of information has become stuck in a “blockchain stagnation” because of the lack of interconnectivity between ecosystems. For example, since Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own isolated ecosystems, consensus model and transaction methods, the smooth transference of information and communication is all but impossible to achieve in an immediate fashion. This creates a problem of convenience and efficiency.</p><p>The Merkle Bridge: The Creator Of Convenience</p>Merkle Bridge: The Technology Of Interoperability<p>The Merkle Bridge has solved a simple yet imperative function for the expansion of blockchain: that function being interoperability. The Merkle Bridge is a technology that interconnects heterogenous blockchains together. In essence, the technology is designed to enable the exchange of assets and information between inherently different blockchains or platforms; Ethereum to AERGO being an example as such. This is a major stepping stone of interconnectivity between AERGO and the collective totality of ERC-20 tokens and Ethereum&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For more details, please refer to the follow article&nbsp;below:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-merkle-bridge-what-else-is-needed-for-nft-c5170502da3a">Aergo Merkle Bridge: What else is needed for NFT?</a></p><p>The Great Relationship: GEMpay, A Blockchain Based Simple Payment Service And The Merkle&nbsp;Bridge</p>Merkle Bridge: Bridging The&nbsp;Gap<p>GEMpay works with different scalable economies; it is imperative to understand that GEMpay is a simple and easy to utilize blockchain service payment system. The more users that pay with AERGO Gem, the more discounts they receive as well; this is the cornerstone of economic self-interest and practicality. All GEMpay users must first top-up their AERGO Gem to use their points. AERGO Gem has the same value as the KRW, and you will receive an appropriate discount or profit in this functional rewards paradigm built within the GEMpay system based on your participation in the ecosystem. AERGO Gem natively supports swaps through the AERGO token. In addition, plans are put into place to support to enable swaps to Ethereum through the Merkle Bridge, which will enable swaps with various ERC-20&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>For those who’re unfamiliar with Ethereum, ERC-20 is the token standard within the Ethereum ecosystem; every Ethereum based token is an ERC-20 token. In essence, this compatibility with AERGO through the utilization of the Merkle Bridge will enable easy and seamless access for ERC-20 holders to utilize the service platform with Ethereum based tokens of their own choosing.</p><p>📊 Token Price&nbsp;Indexes</p><p>We would like to request for the patience of those who wish to utilize GEMpay. Discussions with various companies are ongoing to conduct a sufficient POC to create an appropriate index for AERGO Gem prices. It is not easy to create a reliable index in the current cryptocurrency token environment. Whether it is a centralized exchange or a decentralized exchange, since the price value in the virtual currency market depends entirely on the liquidity pool of the active wallet, it is a structure in which the exchange party must bear the risk of the index. This is because it is an environment in which anyone can attack the price whenever they want. Our plan is to open the GEMpay service according to the timeline set forth, starting with the POC and pre-booking openings in March and until the second quarter of&nbsp;2022.</p><p>If You Have Gem, You Garner A Double Discount With&nbsp;GEMpay:</p><p>March POC And Advance Reservations Are&nbsp;Open:</p><p>📍 The Three Line&nbsp;Summary</p>  The Merkle Bridge is a technology that enables interoperability between heterogenous blockchains.  GEMpay works with different economies of&nbsp;scale.  Discussions are underway with various companies to conduct POC to create an appropriate index for AERGO&nbsp;Gem.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/merkle-bridge-the-causality-that-connects-gempay-with-ethereum-and-erc20s-4d8bfc3c57b5">Merkle Bridge: The Causality That Connects GEMpay With Ethereum And ERC20's</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The debate over which type of database is superior – the traditional relational (SQL) or modern document (NoSQL) ones – has continued since the NoSQL concept itself emerged around 2009. Back then, a popular opinion was that relational databases with their rigid data schemas and very limited horizontal scalability were already on the way out and alternative schema-less database architectures with their flexibility, ease of use, and seemingly limitless scalability were just the right tool for modern, highly distributed, cloud-native applications.</p>
<p>Alas, the enthusiasm of those early years turned up to be overly optimistic – over a decade later both SQL and NoSQL solutions are going strong without a clear winner. Personally, I have always been on the fence with regard to this argument – I firmly believe that the original dichotomy is largely artificial, caused by technology limitations that have long been resolved, and, last but not least, is completely meaningless from the business perspective.</p>
<p>In a sense, this reminds me of a similar situation with Big Data. Do you remember when you had to invest in a complex and mind-bogglingly expensive hardware and software platform to be able to manage a few terabytes of data? Nowadays, the only thing you need is a credit card and a public cloud account. The very notion of Big Data has almost completely disappeared already – from a modern business perspective, it’s just “data”.</p>
<p>The same considerations apply to the SQL vs NoSQL debate: as long as your corporate data is available, consistent, and reasonably protected from misuse, your applications meet certain performance criteria and can be quickly adapted to changing business requirements, and your IT costs remain within the budget, the LOB people couldn’t care less about the name of your favorite database. Unfortunately, under the hood, the situation is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>For people working in cybersecurity, one of the daily mantras is “Complexity is the worst enemy of security.” This is true for every kind of IT infrastructure, but perhaps nowhere can making an early mistake lead to catastrophic consequences than in data(base) management. Sure, having a selection of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/">over a dozen specialized database engines</a> to choose from for your new project might sound like a great idea at first. Yet, sooner or later, you will inevitably stumble upon an unexpected limitation and face a difficult decision: should you refactor your application to support a different, more suitable engine, or should you add another one into the mix: for example, to solve a scalability challenge or simply (ha-ha!) to be able to run business analytics on live data?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, modern database vendors think about these challenges all the time and constantly work to address them for their customers, preferably in advance. And, even less surprisingly, these developments lead to a convergence of SQL and NoSQL databases towards a universal multi-model data management platform.</p>
<p>Take MongoDB, the <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/">most popular NoSQL</a> database platform. Over the years it has become such a de facto standard for NoSQL that other document database engines like Amazon DocumentDB and Azure Cosmos DB implement MongoDB APIs to allow existing apps and tools to connect to their services instead. Developers that rely on this compatibility layer get more flexibility in choosing a more suitable (better scalable, more integrated, or simply less expensive) alternative to MongoDB. The downside of this approach, of course, is that not all functions of the original are implemented, and the degree of compatibility can vary a lot across different projects. An even bigger challenge, however, is making NoSQL instances available to 3rd party tools that expect relational data – the most common use case being business analytics. Connecting existing BI tools to MongoDB is possible but requires additional infrastructure to set up and operate and most often does not provide access to real-time data, resulting in analysis of stale data.</p>
<p>Well, the more interesting is the latest news from Oracle – the database vendor known for not one but two of the most popular database engines in the world. The company just announced its own alternative for MongoDB, aptly named <a href="https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/autonomous-json-database/">Oracle Database API for MongoDB</a>. But wait, you’re probably saying, isn’t Oracle Database a relational database? How can it possibly emulate the capabilities of a document database like MongoDB?</p>
<p>Although its origins are firmly in the RDBMS camp, over the years Oracle Database has evolved into a multi-model data management platform, with native support for JSON data model available since 2014. Many customers have been using Oracle for their NoSQL projects for years, but now, with the new compatibility API, this functionality can be transparently available to any existing MongoDB-compatible application without any changes to its code. The announced API is compatible with MongoDB 4.2 and offers support for transactions and load-balanced connections. According to Oracle, the only thing developers need to change in their app is the database connection string.</p>
<p>But wait, you’re probably asking again: how exactly is it different from other compatibility APIs mentioned above? Well, this is where the most interesting things begin… As a proper multi-model database, Oracle Autonomous Database can transparently convert document collections to relational data structures and vice versa. This means that it is possible to import an existing MongoDB database into Oracle, continue running your existing app without any modifications, and get all the benefits of SQL-based business analytics on live data. The opposite is possible, too: you can expose existing relational data as MongoDB collections – for example, to make analytics reports available back in the original app with no effort.</p>
<p>The security and compliance benefits of this approach are also worth mentioning. Since all data previously spread across disparate data sources can now reside within a single database instance, it is no longer exposed to various threats and risks during the ETL process. On the contrary, all the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev70965/oracle-database-security-assessment/">enterprise-grade security features</a> of the Oracle Autonomous Database ensure consistent protection and compliance without the need to configure or tune them manually. Oracle’s MongoDB API is also backed by Oracle’s native user and role management, simplifying overall access management and governance.</p>
<p>So, where’s the catch? Well, the only one I can think of is that at the moment, the MongoDB API is only available as a part of Oracle Cloud. There are no technical limitations that would prevent it from working on-prem as well, but the company is naturally planning to use this capability to further promote its cloud services. However, considering that Oracle’s solution claims to overcome several key technical limitations of both the original MongoDB Atlas service and their competitors’ alternatives while remaining more economical to use, migrating your NoSQL workloads to Oracle Cloud might not be such an unthinkable idea at all… In fact, it could be just what developers tired of moving data from one database to another and dealing with complex manual processes are looking for.</p>

<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
<p>Antti Kettunen is a digital identity and digital trust expert and advisor. He designs ecosystem solutions, actively participates in standards and industry groups (e.g. CEN, Trust over IP, Mobey), and helps customers deliver value in their digital identity projects. He also writes and speaks about digital identity and the ongoing paradigm shift in his blog Identifinity. Antti is also one of the co-founders and advocates of the FindyNet cooperative, a digital identity network for Finland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 During this conversation, we discuss: 
 
 
 
 The current digital landscape in the Nordics, the maturity of e-Government and digital registries, and the trust that citizens of these countries have towards their governments. 
 
 
 How does the private sector in the Nordics look at self-sovereign identity? Where do they see the benefits? How do they look at the onramp from their existing federated authentication models? 
 
 
 Knowing where my organization fits inside my value chain and why knowing this will help me understand how to both benefit, contribute and thrive within an ecosystem-centric system. 
 
 
 How to decide whether or not to participate in the governance of an ecosystem? 
 
 
 The problems with API-centered architectures and the benefits gained from adopting data-centric architectures. 
 
 
 Why focusing too much on the Verifiable Credential Trust Triangle isn’t sufficient as the only tool to help with the adoption of SSI ecosystems. 
 
 
 An update on the EU Wallet and some thoughts on how it can spur SSI adoption, while looking at the risks of it possibly impeding private sector adoption. 
 
 
 
 
<p>And more!</p>

With the shift to microservices architectures and container-based deployments, new models for protecting workloads are required, that also mitigate the risk of lateral movement of attackers in the CI/CD pipeline and between software components. The R&amp;S®Trusted Application Factory addresses today’s challenges by providing a “cloud native app protection” approach that protects the individual pods/containers, building on central management and proven security engines that analyze for a wide range of potential attacks.

 Spherity joins the Global Battery Alliance to support the development of the GBA Battery&nbsp;Passport <p>Spherity, one of Europe’s leading providers of decentralized, digital identity technology, has become a member of the Global Battery Alliance (GBA). The GBA is a public-private collaboration platform founded in 2017 at the World Economic Forum to align interests of the stakeholders operating in the battery industry. The goal of the GBA is to establish a circular and sustainable battery value chain by 2030. Spherity was recognized by the group in respect of its efforts in the field of developing and innovating identity technologies around the concept of the Digital Product Passport.</p>Spherity joins the Global Battery Alliance to support the development of the GBA Battery Passport.<p>The Paris Agreement of the United Nations defined the goal to decrease global warming by 2°C and to build a fairer and more sustainable society. To implement it the European Union has ratified the European Green Deal, which is defining several activities.</p><p>As one of the activities to reach a circular economy, the European Commission has proposed the “new EU Battery Regulation” which mandates a Digital Product Passport for batteries (short battery passport) above 2 kWh capacity from January 2026. The battery passport shall carry all relevant information of a battery that makes it longer lasting, reusable or recyclable. In the GBA, the battery industry is coming together to find an industry-wide solution to comply with this regulation.</p><p>Being one of the pioneers developing solutions for the Digital Product Passport, Spherity is working closely with policy makers and international companies to conceptualise a globally acceptable technology. Spherity is engaged in the track &amp; trace working group of the GBA to develop a battery passport that embraces standardization, interoperability, inclusivity, privacy, and an affordable cost structure.</p><p>“Spherity’s GBA membership is yet another move towards the company’s strong commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in general and towards enabling the circular economy with digital product passports in particular.” says Susanne Guth-Orlowski, Chief Innovation &amp; Solutions Officer of Spherity.</p><p>About the Global Battery&nbsp;Alliance</p><p>The Global Battery Alliance (GBA) is a public-private collaboration platform founded in 2017 at the World Economic Forum to help establish a sustainable battery value chain by 2030. The GBA brings together leading businesses along the entire battery value chain, international organizations, NGOs, academics and multiple governments to align collectively in a pre-competitive, multi-stakeholder manner to drive systemic change. All its activities follow <a href="https://www.globalbattery.org/media/publications/gba-10-guiding-principles.pdf">Ten Guiding Principles</a> in an effort to realize the <a href="https://www.globalbattery.org/media/publications/WEF_A_Vision_for_a_Sustainable_Battery_Value_Chain_in_2030_Report.pdf">GBA 2030 Vision</a> across three dimensions: establishing a circular battery value chain that is a major driver to achieve the Paris Agreement targets; transforming the economy in the value chain, creating new jobs and economic value; and safeguarding human rights and economic development in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) is the Secretariat of the GBA.

<p>In business banking, 2022 is all about the fintech sector. In the past, huge strides have been made in digital banking and fintech services for individual customers’ needs. Apps, customer service chat, and 24/7 transaction times have all revolutionized the banking experience for the customer. While some of these services have benefited business and commercial banking, banks and financial services could do more.</p>



<p>Business banking specialists provide small and medium business owners a great deal of services and opportunities with a <a href="https://getpenta.com/en/business-account/open-an-account/">business bank account</a>, to get entrepreneurial ventures off the ground and help established businesses flourish. This year is going to see a lot more innovation in these areas from them and others.</p>



<p>Below are some of the biggest business banking trends set to take off in 2022. Take these predictions as both things to get excited about and to prepare yourself for. It’s going to be a big year for business owners.</p>



 Super apps 



<p>2021 saw the release of<a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/107787/paypal-venmo-banking-super-mobile-app-payments/?internal-link-blist"> PayPal’s ‘super app’</a> and banks and financial services would have done well to pay attention. PayPal’s app combined a huge breadth of services for consumers, integrating shopping, investing, mobile payments, crypto services, and more all into one app.</p>



<p>For business banking, the super app’s potentialities are even more exciting. Business banking services are consistently updating their apps, taking advantage of what <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/regulatory-risks-fintechs/">fintechs</a> offer to create the ultimate app from which any <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/entrepreneur-of-the-year-idnow-leadership-in-the-final/">entrepreneur</a> can handle all their financial responsibilities.</p>



 Sustainable banking 



<p>The reality of climate change is finally arriving in the business sector. It is easier now than ever for companies to measure their carbon footprints and achieve<a href="https://getpenta.com/en/blog/penta-is-carbon-neutral/"> carbon neutrality</a> or offset their pollutive output by funding sustainable organizations.</p>



<p>The expectation is growing in the business banking sector. We are now seeing the demand from business owners to align themselves with financial services, which align themselves with sustainable models, and actively participate in the fight against a rising climate. Fintech has shown itself to be a suitably disruptive sector regarding sustainability in finance. This is especially important in banking, an industry historically fraught with fossil fuel funding. As the consumer demand for a sustainable world grows and green tech <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/companisto-crowdfunding-startups-growth-companies-powered-idnows-videoident/">start-ups</a> dominate the market, business banking services will race to meet these demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Artificial intelligence 



<p>The list of AI’s capabilities in finance today would require a much lengthier post than this—and its future capabilities are limitless. Already, AI has helped banks and financial services with improving security and fraud detection while streamlining various services for consumers, but 2022 promises more exciting developments.</p>



<p>AI and business banking are ideal pairing. Businesses need from their financial services intelligent interfaces, smart chatbots handling the bulk of inquiries, and powerful machine learning tools to gather important data about how entrepreneurs run their businesses. Be prepared to see developments in all these areas this year.</p>



 Open banking APIs 



<p>Despite controversial claims to<a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/11/open-bankings-failure/#:~:text=Speaking%20to%20MPs%20at%20a,has%20not%20been%20a%20success%E2%80%9D.&amp;text=One%20of%20the%20heroes%20of,incentivise%20consumers%20to%20switch%20accounts."> its lack of success</a>, open banking is here to stay, and it’s likely to expand in 2022. The exciting prospect stands to increase consumers’ data portability and make data sharing easier without the interference of institutional banks. While this has been met with some skepticism over data protection and safety, the recent executive order in the US to<a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/118023/white-house-tells-cfpb-to-hit-the-accelerator-on-bank-data-share-rules/?internal-link-embd"> implement data sharing provisions</a> demonstrates that these concerns are being met, and the trend is gaining traction.</p>



<p>APIs that allow easy communication for business owners will make open banking a huge time saver in business banking. Through these platforms, entrepreneurs with business banking accounts in an open banking landscape can expect to reach more clients and manage many complex transactions with ease.</p>



<p>Staying ahead of the trends in business banking means knowing what to expect and allowing yourself the opportunity to learn about it before everyone else. Big things are happening in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-tv-interview-oliver-obitayo-money20-20/">fintech</a> in 2022 and many of them will directly benefit business banking.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, the decentralized data exchange protocol that unlocks data for AI, is excited to announce the launch of DataX Protocol, a project financed through <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a>, Ocean’s community-curated grants&nbsp;program.</p><p><a href="https://datax.fi">DataX Protocol</a> has an ambitious lineup of innovative DeFi tooling for datasets in the roadmap. Its goal is to build DataFi infrastructure to help onboard masses to the data economy and also boost Ocean Protocol’s footprint by building innovative tooling around datatokens.</p> DataX: DeFi Tooling for Data&nbsp;Dapps <p>DataX Protocol is building an open and decentralized financial layer on datasets. It aims to create complementary infrastructure around Ocean Protocol’s datatokens that will boost new integrations into the Ocean ecosystem. The DataX Protocol at the onset will enable any developer or dapp to use its libraries and tooling to build and create multi-token trading and staking infrastructure.</p><p>DataX tooling promises to increase metrics in the Ocean ecosystem like number of dapps being built, daily active users, total value locked, and trading volume of datasets.</p><p>Ultimately, DataX Protocol aims to make data liquid and a dominant asset&nbsp;class.</p> <a href="https://datapolis.city">Datapolis DApp</a> <p>To further the adoption of the data economy, DataX Protocol is launching the concept of Data Nation — a template for the states and countries who treat their data as an important asset and engage in creating a data economy for their citizens.</p><p>To implement this template and to make the prospect of staking and investing in datatokens for the masses interesting, DataX is also building a white-label platform named Datapolis. Datapolis is a virtual sovereign city state that prides itself as the world’s first Data Nation. It is also a showcase of DataX features.</p><p>Datapolis shows how an ideal real-world scenario could be for sharing data, trading datasets, or earning from data. Datapolis is built around the core principles of decentralization and democracy where citizens have a say via voting, economic activities like trading and staking, or help grow the DataX Community and earn incentives.</p><p>Trent McConaghy, Founder, Ocean Protocol, commented:</p><blockquote>Ocean was built with the aim to level the playing field around data &amp; AI, so that everyone can be a participant in the new Data Economy. DataX Protocol strengthens the Ocean ecosystem by catalyzing data as assets and the communities that form around data&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><p>Manan Patel, Founder, DataX Protocol&nbsp;added:</p><blockquote>DataX Protocol will play a leading role not only in furthering the growth of the Ocean ecosystem but also in establishing data as a dominant asset class at the global level. DataFi holds the key to solving global issues from data privacy and data ownership to income inequality and even poverty. This launch of the DataX Protocol is a major step in that direction.</blockquote><p>The Datapolis platform will be launched in February 2022, with trading and staking datasets. In the long run, Datapolis will add more features to the roost, like data farming, data insurances, data&nbsp;loans.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a new Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality data. Ocean’s intuitive marketplace technology allows data to be published, discovered, and consumed in a secure, privacy-preserving manner. By giving power back to data owners, Ocean resolves the tradeoff between using private data and its public exposure.</p><p>About DataX&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>DataX Protocol is a DeFi protocol building an innovative open financial infrastructure on datasets. DataX brings DeFi to data, and is a gateway to unlock DataFi for the masses. DataX is creating money markets specially suited for datasets and related services with a goal to make data truly liquid assets and a dominant asset&nbsp;class.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-announces-the-launch-of-datax-an-oceandao-grantee-4ff6c4f665b4">Ocean Protocol announces the launch of DataX, an OceanDAO grantee</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>From baby boomers to Gen Z, each successive generation is more comfortable with using technology tools to manage every aspect of their daily lives. Gen Z (born 1997-2012) only knows a world that’s almost completely digital. It’s no surprise then, to find out that Mastercard’s <a href="https://openbanking.mastercard.com/the-rise-of-open-banking">Rise of Open Banking</a> study showed that they were the most willing and eager to adopt cutting-edge fintech apps and services before older generations. Given that millennials have recently <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/">surpassed baby boomers</a> as the most populous generation in the U.S. and Canada, sensitivity to their financial needs and desires is critical for fintech developers and entrepreneurs, as well as banking sector incumbents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked about why you would use technology to manage finances, convenience is the top driver. The desire to try something new is motivation responsible for the biggest gap between younger and older generations. A full 28% of Gen Z and 33% of millennial consumers selected to try something new as the reason for using technology to manage finances. This compared to 21% of Gen X and 12% of boomers using technology because they wanted to try something new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gen Z and millenials are also far more responsive to social pressure from their peers to adopt new technologies. Twenty-two percent of Gen Z consumers and 21% of millenials react to social pressure by adopting technology to manage finances, while only 8% of Gen X and 4% of boomers feel compelled to do the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having been born into a digital world, digital natives are unafraid to try a new payment app or digital lending service, just because it’s better than anything else available. They’re accustomed to the fast pace of technological development, and the accelerated life cycle of digital tools. Thirty percent of Gen Z and 34% of millennials have little hesitation to jump on board with newer, better offerings, as opposed to 23% of Gen X and 17% of boomers.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Next-Gen Use Cases Built to Serve Younger Generations 
<p>One of the newest, fastest-growing use cases powered by open banking is <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/september/mastercard-reinvents-installments-to-give-consumers-more-payment-choices-wherever-they-shop/">Buy Now, Pay Later</a>. BNPL is essentially a riff on layaway payment plans, where consumers gradually paid off a piece of merchandise before taking it home. BNPL apps and services allow users to have the merchandise right away, but split payments up over a short period of time, in many cases at zero percent interest. BNPL usage grew <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/buy-now-pay-later-gen-z-millennials/">an astounding 81.2%</a> from 2020 to 2021, with nearly 75% of BNPL users in the Gen Z and millennial cohort. They’re far more willing to adopt these new fintech tools, while Gen X and baby boomers trust a branded card over new digital innovations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some BNPL lenders are using open banking and consumer-permissioned data points to look beyond FICO scores to <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/buy-now-pay-later-redefines-credit-worthiness/">qualify borrowers</a>. This benefits consumers who have thin credit files, who can now establish a history of borrowing and repaying, without the traditional FICO barrier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young consumers are also loving the new wave of gamified digital banking experiences that open banking can enable. For a generation raised on video games, this is a natural fit. Gamification has been hugely successful in <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/103616/banks-millennials-gen-z-personalization-loyalty-fintech-gamification/">education, health and fitness</a>, and is steadily growing in the <a href="https://financesonline.com/gamification-statistics/">finance sector</a>. Through challenges where the user can compete against others, themselves, or even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/how-gamification-can-help-you-meet-financial-goals/">build a virtual world</a> to entice smart financial moves, next-gen apps and services are catering to the tastes, desires and motivations of younger consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that most of their daily lives take place on a mobile screen, it’s not surprising that Gen Z and millennials are far more likely to connect their bank accounts for digital payments. Recurring transactions like gym and streaming memberships, digital wallet top-ups, and even retail purchases are all use cases that young consumers are readily adopting to make direct digital payments.</p>
 Digital Banking Isn’t Trending, It’s the Future 
<p>Digital natives are driving innovation in the finance sector. A full <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/millennials-personal-finance/">78% of millennials</a> use mobile banking, and one-fourth of millennials now have their primary checking accounts in digital-only banks. Open banking platforms can empower these consumers to benefit from their data through a wide variety of third-party financial apps and services. These apps and services utilize that data to offer them the new money experiences they want in their financial lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As consumers adopt and demand more personalized digital tools to save time and money, and look to improve their financial outlook, our partners can leverage open banking solutions to drive stronger customer engagement and loyalty. Consumers should be at the center of the data experience, helping them feel more connected and in control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity’s Global Open Banking Platform is democratizing access to data, providing consumers with greater access to credit, payment choices, and convenient digital banking experiences. With their growing purchase power, this is what Gen Z and Millennial generations expect and demand, moving into the next evolution of financial apps and services.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs already maintains validator nodes in support of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/our-recent-upgrade-to-our-sovrin-network-validator-node-in-australia-supports-the-decentralized-identity-community/">Sovrin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/anonyome-labs-joins-the-indicio-mainnet/">Indicio</a>&nbsp;networks. Recently we increased our contribution to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials by becoming a founding member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>&nbsp;production network. With more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bosch.com/stories/self-sovereign-identities/">companies leveraging SSI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.egovernment.ch/en/umsetzung/schwerpunktplan/elektronische-identitat/">governments beginning to implement them</a>, large-scale public adoption of these technologies appears to be around the corner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is particularly interested in new economic models for SSI technologies and infrastructures that can amplify adoption by end-users, businesses, and governments. Economic incentives provide a way for validators to be rewarded for running the network and for issuers of verifiable credentials to be rewarded for issuing credentials. The adoption of these new economic models in turn increases the amount of SSI credentials in circulation, making it increasingly easier, more efficient, and more secure for organizations to get trusted data from the consenting identity subject. These financial incentives are a clear driver for transition from centralized and federated identity systems to an SSI ecosystem.</p>



 What are verifiable credentials? 



<p></p>



<p>In short, they are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically. Their use cases include checking the validity of travel visas, healthcare certificates, airline tickets, credit score checks and credentials for opening a bank account. Three parties take place in the verifiable credential workflow: the&nbsp;issuer&nbsp;digitally signs a document and sends it to the&nbsp;holder&nbsp;which can then present their credential (to W3C specifications) to a&nbsp;verifier.&nbsp;A verifier checks presented credentials and verifies the contained authority, validity, and tamper-proof characteristics of the credential. If validity conditions are met and the presented credential contains the required claims, the holder is granted access to an associated resource or service.</p>



 Why do we need tokens for SSI? 



<p></p>



<p>Currently the main method of paying for verifiable credentials is through conventional payment networks. This has several drawbacks as mentioned in Sovrin’s&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf#Sovrin-Whitepaper-v5b.indd%3ABut%20today%2C%20the%20only%20option%20for%20paying%20for%20verifiable%20credentials%20is%20conventional%20payment%20networks%3A132">whitepaper</a>, where:</p>



  markets are restricted to only the highest value credentials  current issuers are at risk of data breaches  credentials are not privacy respecting.&nbsp;<br>  



<p>Since third-party identification issuers (such as credit bureaus) charge a fee to verify a user’s identity, it can be assumed that paying for credentials will remain a fundamental element of SSI. Tokens act as a solution to this problem, with&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/sovrin-foundation-launches-test-token-for-decentralized-identity-network/">Sovrin having already designed and tested tokens for their network (but not put them into production).</a></p>



 <a href="https://www.cheqd.io/ssi-self-sovereign-identity-explained">What is cheqd?</a> 



<p></p>



<p>cheqd’s network is bult on the Cosmos blockchain with a dedicated token for payment which enables new business models for verifiers, holders and issuers. In these business models, verifiable credentials are exchanged in a trusted, reusable, safer, and cheaper way — alongside a customizable fee.&nbsp;</p>



 How cheqd uses tokenomics&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>cheqd employs concepts of tokenomics on top of governance which sets it apart from the Sovrin network. With any of the three participants – holders, validators, and issuers – capable of receiving tokens as an incentive, it promotes participation and accountability, which will facilitate a greater adoption of the technology and SSI as a whole. This allows users to reclaim their privacy, and organizations to build their reputation and reduce the potential for fraudulent credentials. The value of $CHEQ depends on&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/cheqds-tokenomics-for-ssi-explained-part-2-c4ecfc32b813">several factors</a>&nbsp;including overall cryptocurrency market health, cheqd protocol resilience and the real-world implementation of use cases by SSI vendors.</p>



 cheqd’s choice of SDK 



<p></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.sovrin.org/hyperledger-welcomes-project-indy-77e8b2c62dcf">2017 Sovrin open sourced their codebase to Hyperledger Indy</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/">Indicio builds upon to provide its services and network</a>. Hyperledger Indy is a collection of tools, libraries and further components for digital identities rooted on blockchains. It’s important to note that tokens are not natively supported; in fact Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director of the Hyperledger Project, mentioned in an interview that “<a href="https://www.eweek.com/cloud/hyperledger-blockchain-project-is-not-about-bitcoin/">you’ll never see a Hyperledger coin</a>” and “by not pushing a currency, we avoid so many political challenges of having to maintain a globally consistent currency.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>cheqd’s network is built on the&nbsp;<a href="https://tendermint.com/sdk/">Cosmos SDK</a>&nbsp;which has&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/advanced-concepts/building-on-cosmos">several benefits</a>. They include Cosmos’s identity capabilities, easily customizable token behavior, on-ledger voting for governance frameworks and smart contract functionality. cheqd’s&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/master/intro/why-app-specific.html">application-specific blockchain</a>&nbsp;implementation addresses the shortcomings of smart contracts by building a full-node client, a light-client, and all the necessary interfaces (CLI, REST, etc.) to interact with the nodes. These reasons make Cosmos a viable solution as an SDK since the added benefits that tokenomics bring allows cheqd to develop a network for SSI applications.&nbsp;</p>



 cheqd DID method 



<p></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are cryptographically proven, verifiable and decentralized digital identities. DIDs are designed to be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers and certificate authorities. A DID can refer to any subject, entity, organization, thing, data model or abstract entity as specified by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-controllers">DID controller</a>. Where DIDs come into play is their ability to be stored on the blockchain as a public verifiable data registry. These immutable records can be queried for the authenticity/validity of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/gentle-introduction-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credential</a>&nbsp;to see who issued without consulting the issuer.<br></p>



<p>cheqd has&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-cheqd-did-method">proposed</a>&nbsp;that it will build on Hyperledger Indy DID method, renaming&nbsp;<a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/transactions.html#nym">NYM</a>&nbsp;transactions to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> transactions and removing&nbsp;roles&nbsp;to move from a&nbsp;public-permissioned&nbsp;network to&nbsp;public-permissionless.</p>



 The Anonyome validator configuration 



<p></p>



<p>Because of the potential advantages of having a token as part of the decentralized identity network, Anonyome Labs has configured and brought online its own&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.cheqd.io/validator/cheqdvaloper1djh8syeug9ylw7v8ca6jvq3s59klzmm4fm949w">validator</a>. We use Amazon Web Services to deploy our validator, however the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/docs/setup-and-configure">cheqd-noded software can be run by other hosting providers or even locally</a>.</p>



<p>To successfully become part of the cheqd production network and have an operational validator, we:</p>



  set up an AWS elastic cloud (EC2) instance running Ubuntu 20.04  configured a virtual private cloud (VPC) using security groups at the network interface level to act as a firewall  enabled automatic backups via AMI policies  created custom SNS topic to Slack notifications for outlier detection within CloudWatch Metrics.  



 AWS elastic cloud (EC2) 



<p></p>



<p>To run the cheqd validator installation we currently use a t3.small EC2 with the Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. The storage is split across two EBS volumes: a 10GB EBS volume for the operating system and cheqd software and another 150GB EBS for the cheqd home directory containing the increasingly large data directory which stores the ledger.</p>



<p>Both disks are encrypted, and the 150 GB volume is mounted within the operating system and set as the home directory for the cheqd user account.</p>



 Virtual private cloud (VPC) 



<p></p>



<p>The VPC security groups are configured to whitelist inbound and outbound traffic, only allowing specific access to SSH, RPC and HTTP/HTTPS ports from pre-determined IP addresses. Deliberately specifying which traffic the validator allows/expects reduces the potential for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. An elastic-IP connects to the EC2 instance which grants the validator a static IP.</p>



 AMI backup policies 



<p></p>



<p>To ensure swift recovery from any outages, attacks or node misconfigurations, an EBS-backed AMI policy has been put in place to make daily and monthly backups. These backups create live snapshots of the system such that when the validator must be restored, it resumes from the snapshot’s instance state. This aims to minimize downtime on the network and the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/tokenomics/slashing-explained">slashing penalties</a>&nbsp;that incur. When restoring from an AMI, the validator only needs to catch up from its latest block height and match that of the networks rather than a new validator which would have to catch up from the beginning, potentially saving days of downtime.&nbsp;</p>



 SNS topic to Slack notifications 



<p></p>



<p>Enabling telemetry via Slack notifications allows for real-time error handling and informative reporting on the status and health of our validator. This minimizes the risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the node through notifying problem-specific alerts which can be acted on immediately.</p>



<p>Some of the triggers our system looks out for are:</p>



  abnormally high resource usage (CPU, RAM, NetIO)  unusual cheqd network statistics (no validators on the network)  security alerts (unauthorized access)  general instance status metrics.  



 Future plans 



<p></p>



<p>With new technologies come new challenges and by nature many learnings and improvements are discovered. While we have our&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.cheqd.io/validator/cheqdvaloper1djh8syeug9ylw7v8ca6jvq3s59klzmm4fm949w">node</a>&nbsp;actively validating, there are several improvements that we are making to our system architecture to tighten security and reduce the risk of downtime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upgrading the network to a multi-node&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html#setting-up-a-validator">sentry-validator architecture&nbsp;</a>allows for stronger protection from DOS attacks and other threats which can be mitigated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/honey-pot">honeypots</a>. Although more complex than a single validator instance, the benefit of reduced downtime in the case of an attack ensures a lower risk of slashing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to reduce the risk of lost or stolen tokens earned through validating, we aim to use a cold-wallet backup solution. The implementation will include further steps to tighten security, such as multi-factor authentication, hardware cold-wallets and internal auditing, which in turn minimizes the attack vector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other future considerations may include securing validator keys using a&nbsp;<a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/hardware-security-modules">HSM</a>&nbsp;or other implementations which secure the&nbsp;<a href="https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a>&nbsp;keys used by&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html#validator-keys">Tendermint Core</a>. These improvements and alterations to the validator are first performed on our Testnet node before they are applied to the Mainnet. Since Testnet tokens have no actual value, they can be used to develop, test, and deploy security changes without having the risks associated with making changes on the Mainnet validator.</p>

<p>Indicio was fortunate to have the opportunity to host Gabriel Rene, Author and Co-Founder &amp; Executive Director of the Spacial Web Foundation, at the Indicio Identity Community meetup in January to discuss his thoughts on how the future of the spatial web will look and break down how he thinks the transition will happen. Moderated by senior Indicio Engineer Sam Curren, the conversation went in depth on how some of the transitions and changes are already starting to happen and where Gabriel’s team has made strides to implement this technology in their own day-to-day lives.</p>

<p>DeFi , KYC and Crypto – A mighty triumvirate? Learn more about KYC in a decentralized world.</p>



 DeFi, the next big thing in crypto?&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">DeFi or decentralized finance</a> is one of the hottest buzzwords in fintech and crypto right now. Together with NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) it’s dominating the news since 2021. But what is the noise all about, and why is the criticism from the regulators so loud?&nbsp;</p>



 What is DeFi?&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralized finance means financial services or instruments which are not managed by a central company or authority, but rather operated on a form of blockchain or DLT. Essentially, DeFi allows users to directly interact with a product or service without any intermediaries. By being open, borderless and permissionless, DeFi wants to democratize financial services and make them accessible for everybody in this world.&nbsp;</p>



 Limitless potential: The future of finance.&nbsp; 



<p>DeFi means much more than just <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">cryptocurrencies</a> and payments. It is expected that DeFi will replicate all forms of assets, financial instruments and contracts that exist in traditional finance today. Furthermore, the advanced technologies are creating the opportunity for entirely new financial services and products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The risk: When AML meets anonymity.&nbsp; 



<p>In the beginnings of crypto, many of the early crypto exchanges did not require a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC check</a>. Not without reason, crypto had and for some parts still has a negative stigma around money laundering and cyberfraud. What’s more convenient than an anonymized and fully digital cryptocurrency with little to no AML monitoring?&nbsp;</p>



 Is DeFi the new wild west?&nbsp; 



<p>The unregulated times of crypto are long gone, at least for central providers. Following the rising popularity and increasing mass adoption, the financial authorities caught up and included crypto into existing laws. Some countries even created new rules, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/crypto-license-guide/">crypto custody license in Germany</a>. However, through the rise of DeFi, the industry is on the best way of turning back into the wild west.</p>



 How is DeFi different from other crypto services?&nbsp; 



<p>The straight answer is: control. While the offered services might be the same at first sight, there is a huge difference in governance. While a crypto exchange like Coinbase or Bitpanda is operated by a company with a legal entity, decentral exchanges, like Uniswap, are not controlled by a central company or entity. In consequence, there is no single entity to be governed or sued.&nbsp;</p>



 How unregulated DeFi puts the image of crypto at risk.&nbsp; 



<p>Open, borderless, permissionless – for the same reasons DeFi offers limitless opportunities, it brings along the same amount of risk of money laundering and fraud. In our traditional financial systems, central institutions and governing authorities were created to prevent fraud and ultimately create trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e6e7d9d6-7778-4286-ba6f-e5831fcbc538">Regulators are struggling</a> to comprehend and process DeFi applications without institutions or intermediaries. In consequence, the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) published a <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html">new guidance for virtual asset service providers (VASP)</a> with a new focus on DeFi. In their guidance, the FATF is essentially recommending its members to crack down on DeFi without a KYC check and proper AML monitoring.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC does not mean centralization.&nbsp; 



<p>Critics say that any form of KYC would transform a DeFi application into a centralized service. However, that is not necessarily true, as the KYC check does not need to be performed by a central entity. Instead, DeFi protocols could create the mechanisms to allow trusted third parties, like identity providers, to perform the KYC and verify the holder of a crypto wallet. Based on the successful identity verification and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML screening</a>, a wallet address could be whitelisted. This way a DeFi protocol could remain decentralized, but the trust and security would increase tremendously.&nbsp;</p>



 DeFi is global, but regulation is local.&nbsp; 



<p>One of the key benefits of DeFi is it being borderless and accessible to everybody on the internet. At the same time, traditional finance is centralized and financial and AML regulations highly local. To onboard and service customers from all around the world, you not only need partners that can handle a large variety of identity documents, but also comply with the respective country-specific AML regulations.&nbsp;</p>



 How KYC could boost DeFi mass adoption.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/first-use-of-idnow-video-identification-throughout-europe-for-corporate-customers/">Corporate users</a> and institutional investors require compliant solutions in order to comply with their own regulation. For example, big players like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/07/28/uniswap-says-its-talking-with-paypal-robinhood-and-more-in-deleted-video/">PayPal and Robinhood are asking Uniswap</a>, the largest decentralized exchange, as well as OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, to implement mandatory KYC checks before they can integrate the services. Therefore, complying with KYC and AML regulation would open up DeFi to new user groups and hence boost mass adoption.&nbsp;</p>



 The light side: DeFi plus KYC &amp; AML.&nbsp; 



<p>Ultimately, the discussion about KYC or not, will split DeFi into a light and a dark side. It’s now upon DeFi protocols and their developers to decide on which side they want to play. Those who intend to join the light side should look into implementing KYC checks into their protocols, before the regulators will crack down on DeFi for good.&nbsp;Furthermore, a lot is happening in the area of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nft-non-fungible-tokens-new-art-money-laundering/">NFTs and anti-money laundering</a>.</p>

It is true that people in the decentralized field are increasingly interested in DAOs, but the development of DAOs still faces difficulties. Ontology community members believed that implanting DID in DAOs can eliminate “centralization” based on digital assets to a certain extent. DID can encourage DAO members to become more active, and balanced decision-making between the development team and ordinary&nbsp;members.  The Ontology Chinese Community <a href="https://twitter.com/ontologycn/status/1485878035580854273?s=21">Twitter</a> was live to track more information and progress of Ontology. Through this Twitter, community members can learn about Ontology’s global dynamics in real&nbsp;time.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Ontology published the <a href="https://twitter.com/ontologynetwork/status/1487975370552791040?s=21">DAO 101</a> series on twitter, discussing a key point in DAO governance: What kind of incentives should be set up? Ontology proposed the following solution: Set up a DID with a reputation scoring system for each DAO member. When you enter a DAO, you need to first register/own a DID and submit certain verifications (authorization through encryption to protect privacy), such as on-chain/off-chain assets, whether you have similar experience or capabilities, and so on. After verification, you will be given an initial value and mark to help you better participate in&nbsp;DAO.  Ontology cooperates with the famous media <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1489844335205965828?s=20&amp;t=5KziQ6PiyZB8JI7wNwJI8A">Blockster</a>, users can now keep up-to-date with Ontology news via the Blockster platform. Based on the Blockster platform, Ontology will further expand its influence to reach more potential partners.

That includes securing the enrollment process and taking a multi-layered approach to verifying and authenticating identity throughout the customer lifecycle. From enrollment to payment, managing change events to ongoing KYC and compliance. ”</p><p>For the above requirements, Ontology’s DID and data solutions provide reliable technology. ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the W3C commendations for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, using blockchain and cryptographic technology, that can quickly identify and connect people, data, and services. It is decentralized, self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, and easy to use, enabling users to fully control their own data and identities. At present, Ontology’s DID and data solutions can be seamlessly integrated into many platforms and applications, and have served many enterprises and platforms. In the future, Ontology will continue to expand global industry-wide partnerships to protect the digital identity and data of Web3 and the Metaverse.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>200,000 OCEAN available for Web3 data economy projects!</p><p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the month. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">The Ocean ecosystem becomes self-sustainable</a> as the builders of the Web3 data economy leverage Ocean Protocol to create products, services, and resources that the community finds valuable and fosters value creation for the Ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">The OceanDAO website</a> has up-to-date information on getting started with OceanDAO.</p><p>OceanDAO’s next funding round — Round 15 — has 200,000 OCEAN available. Submissions are due March 1st 2022; we encourage you to submit early, reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a> for feedback and guidance. The rest of this post has details about Round&nbsp;15.</p><p>Thank you to all of the OceanDAO participants, voters, and proposers.</p> OceanDAO Round 15&nbsp;Outline <p>Funding Amount</p><p>There is 200,000 OCEAN in grant funding available in Round&nbsp;15.</p><p>Grant Funding Categories</p>  Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself  <p>Submit your&nbsp;Proposal</p><p>As a builder, you can check out the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO home page</a> to get onboarded and create your proposal. Once completed, you can submit your proposal to our forum:&nbsp;<a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-15/75">Port</a>.</p><p>As a voter, Port is where you can see all proposal details and cast an informed&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO receive funding in&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Project Standing</p><p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing. This enables eligibility in upcoming Funding Rounds. Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p><p>Funding Tiers</p><p>To continue incentivizing completion and outcomes we are continuing Funding Tiers, which can be achieved by Teams delivering on their grant promises.</p><p>The funding tiers&nbsp;are:</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>4. Veteran&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $35,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 5 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>Above are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects by projects in OceanDAO. The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  24,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  12,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  134,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>A total of 200k OCEAN is available.</p><p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to Ocean Protocol there are earmarked Core Tech Initiatives that are being continuously expanded upon. You can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Round-15-Tech-Earmarks">view them inside our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech Working Group discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p><p>Unleash Data&nbsp;Category</p><p>In Round 13 we have revised the Unleash Data Category to have the same rules as the rest of the Funding Categories. They can qualify again for funding up to 35,000 OCEAN conditional that Unleash Data projects:</p>  “Unleash data” has actually always had a broad intent, towards driving Data Consume Volume. It is intended for projects like: becoming a data broker to get data owners’ data into Ocean Market, networking / “hitting the phones” to increase consumption on Ocean Market, integrating Filecoin &amp; publishing data on Ocean Market, etc. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#3-unleash-data">Here are further examples</a>. It was never meant to be solely for constructing / maintaining a small number of datasets.  Whatever is proposed should be high value-add to the Ocean ecosystem.  Example of poor value-add: requesting a lot of OCEAN to construct / maintain a small number of datasets to sell with expectation of profit. We expect and encourage OceanDAO voters to downvote such proposals.  <p>Burning becomes Recycling</p><p>Starting Round 13, any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the Treasury.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">For intuition on how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>You can find all the steps&nbsp;below:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  Any remaining funds inside an Earmark, are then moved towards [General&nbsp;Grants]  [New &amp; Core Tech] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Categories].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds inside the [General Grants] Category are moved back to the treasury.  <p>Quadratic Voting</p><p>Quadratic Voting has shipped in Round&nbsp;14!</p><p>The Quadratic Voting formula may be tweaked into Quadratic Funding, so that more teams get&nbsp;funded.</p><p>You can now visit the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">Web3 Portal</a>, register yourself with BrightID and receive a voting&nbsp;boost.</p><p>Voter Delegation</p><p>In Round 15, we will be introducing Voter Delegation to our grants&nbsp;program.</p><p>Participants will now be able delegate decision making, and easily assign their voting power to other addresses.</p><p>We look forward to having more votes unlocked inside OceanDAO, and contributors acting as delegates while stewarding positive outcomes in the ecosystem.</p><p>Working Groups</p><p>Head to the <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> and dive into each Working Group. There you will find each Working Group’s respective documents, stewards, members list, meeting times, and&nbsp;more:</p>  Project Guiding Working&nbsp;Group  Parameters &amp; Roadmap Working&nbsp;Group  Core Tech Working&nbsp;Group  OceanDAO Engineering Working&nbsp;Group  Data Consume Volume Working&nbsp;Group  Ambassadors Working&nbsp;Group  <p>Working Group&nbsp;Outline</p>  Each Working Group has its own public discord sub-channel. Then, each Working Group can leverage real-time discord channels (voice/video).  Each Working Group has its own membership + working&nbsp;process.  Each Working Group has a weekly or bi-weekly call.

<p>It’s no longer safe to use only a secured network or to just put your systems behind a firewall. Cybercriminals are constantly searching for loopholes in digital processes where personal — especially healthcare — information is available. When it comes to healthcare information, the vulnerabilities outnumber the safety measures that have been implemented. The cost of healthcare fraud is $68 billion USD every year, which is about 3% of the nation’s entire healthcare spending! Hackers can extort millions from a single data breach, which makes service providers easy targets. Healthcare providers store highly confidential and private patient data, which cannot be protected using passwords alone.</p>



<p>A crucial sore spot that has put healthcare services on the radar of e-criminals is the use of outdated technology in hospitals and other medical institutions. This archaic technology provides a broader surface for cyber attacks. The software that is most widely used has almost no security layers at all. One example that illustrates the magnitude of loss is the over 5 million health records that were breached in August 2021 alone across just 38 incidents. Weak IT networks at medical facilities open doors for all kinds of cyber threats, including malware, viruses, and ransomware attacks.</p>



<a href="https://imageware.io/resource/healthcare/"></a>



<p>Though the lack of advanced security solutions is a major deficiency in healthcare risk management systems today, there are some big challenges faced in other areas of healthcare, too. For example, administrative staff at hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with mismanaged online information, such as health and insurance records and staff information.</p>



<p>Switching to <a href="https://imageware.io/resource/healthcare/">digital identity</a> is no longer a choice – it’s a necessity – especially when the e-healthcare sector is currently undergoing such a highly volatile phase with constant pressure to deliver fast and high-quality services. However, 99% of attacks can be prevented by using biometric multi-factor authentication. To ensure safe and effective patient care, healthcare technology professionals must work towards incorporating these reliable security tools to create a zero-trust security approach.</p>



<p>Biometrics plays an increasingly important role in reducing identity fraud and protecting healthcare data by establishing highly secure, controlled access to medical records. Replace usernames and passwords with Imageware’s biometric MFA, a seamless and more secure way to access your systems.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thank you for joining. Today, we’ll have now a conversation with an entrepreneur in the tech industry that is not directly connected in the identity industry, but they are very innovative company and the CEO has a very interesting story to tell us.</p>
<p>So let’s welcome Aran Khanna. He has been labelled many things. A thought leader, an innovator and at times, a troublemaker. Now, in his search to give technological control back to the developers and business leaders, he has added cloud management entrepreneur to that list, as being the co-founder and CEO of Archera, a company that helps organisations find cloud solutions that fit their companies.</p>
<p>Hello, Aran.</p>
<p>Aran Khanna: Hi, Oscar. Thanks so much for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome to the show. Let’s talk about digital identity. But of course, first of all, we want to hear your story, a bit of your journey, how, since the beginning of your career, you end up in this world of – you tell us about your company, and also about identity, please tell us.</p>
<p>Aran: I can tell the short version here, I don’t want to bore you guys with a 30-minute background. But in short, I was born and raised in Seattle, I’ve really grown up all my life around technology. Both my folks worked at Amazon and Microsoft in the early days. And my first foray into technology was actually working at, funnily enough full circle, at the cloud provider that was soon to become Azure, it was called something different back then. But essentially started in that world. Really, from there, I started to get really interested in digital privacy as myself and all of my friends at college and high school were migrating all of our communications, all of our financial activity on to platforms like Facebook, Venmo, Twitter, etc., Instagram, right?</p>
<p>And I started to think a little bit about particularly the data leakage that was coming out of that sort of migration of really society, and started my journey as a privacy researcher in college working with the former FTC CTO Latanya Sweeney on a number of projects, including one very well-known one that actually got me fired from Facebook for revealing some pretty invasive defaults that they had in their platform around location sharing.</p>
<p>From there, I actually went into machine learning research, there was very interesting story behind that, but really started working on fundamental deep learning research, and actually then got pulled right back into the cloud world when AWS acquired that team that was working on to become their internal deep learning team. We launched a number of products at Amazon. And I started again, to start seeing this disconnect between platform users and the platforms themselves and the rules they were putting forward, similarly to what I was looking at in the privacy space, but really around financials in the cloud space.</p>
<p>And that’s when I spun off and started this company Archera to help customers, just like I did in the privacy space and the social media space, understand data leakage, and how platform incentives were not aligned with them, and how they had to orient their behavior to correct against that, trying to apply that sort of thinking into the B2B space with businesses who are migrating to the clouds, and trying to parse the incredible complexity of pricing and the different offering types on the cloud service provider platforms.</p>
<p>So in a nutshell, that’s sort of the arc of the journey. There’s obviously a lot more detail in there. But really, I’ve touched identity and access management and identity and privacy more broadly, both on the consumer side and the business side throughout that journey. So excited to chat more about that with you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, thank you. And definitely your company, Archera, sounds very interesting. As you said, also, that the case of data there in cloud platforms that are becoming, well inevitably, most of cases, most services require some level of cloud. And also something that I was also checking your website about finding the right model, so you can save money on that is interesting. Sometimes it feels like, in my own case, I feel that the cloud providers make it difficult to find how to save money just by using the elements on the cloud. And also about yourself, I went actually to search just put Aran Khanna on using DuckDuckGo. And first of all, I think you’re the most famous if not the only Aran Khanna I have found.</p>
<p>Aran: I think I might be the only one – so the least and the most famous one.</p>
<p>Oscar: If not the only one, the most famous for sure, all the top 10 entries are about you. And yeah, a few of them talk about your Facebook story. So tell us a bit more about that.</p>
<p>Aran: That’s a real fun one. So actually, at that time, I was in college in 2015 at Harvard, and studying computer science. I had actually not started doing my privacy research yet. This was one of the things that catalysed that world of research and projects that I did, but I was learning how to develop web applications and extensions at the time. And what was interesting is all of my friends at Harvard had migrated to using Facebook Messenger on their mobile devices largely – this was 2015.</p>
<p>What was interesting about the product was every time one person would send a message to another person, the default behaviour of the application, you have to go into the settings deep and turn this off – was that it would attach your location to that message. And this wouldn’t matter if you’re in a one-on-one chat with friends, or a massive group chat with 200 people in a class, and you’re constantly texting back and forth, your location was actually being leaked and revealed.</p>
<p>And what I started to think about was, “Hey, wouldn’t it be in the user’s best interest to understand that this default is on. And it’s not just one-off location data points being shared, there’s so much information given the volume of chat that’s happening here, that you can actually build an incredibly detailed picture of someone’s historical locations, their future locations, given their routine, and really come up with some fairly invasive data if you aggregated this.</p>
<p>So that was sort of my hypothesis. And I thought this was something that users would be really happy to know about, Facebook would be really happy if I actually kind of built something that helped people understand this data leakage, and then showed them where the knobs were to control it if they thought it was a problem.</p>
<p>So I went ahead, move fast and break things, and built this Chrome extension and wrote a blog post alongside it. The Chrome extension was called Marauder’s Map, you know, just like in Harry Potter, if you’ve read the books, there was a map where Harry and other folks would actually use it to track people’s live locations around the castle. And very similarly, people say Harvard looks like Hogwarts a little bit, I was able to build a little prototype where I could actually stalk my friends around Harvard campus using this Chrome extension.</p>
<p>So I wrote up that story, released the extension. And really, the point was to educate users, educate what I thought were the customers of the Facebook platform on this very interesting design decision, this product decision that might be affecting them and something they may want to turn off. So I thought this was a great thing for Facebook users, for Facebook as a company, I released it. And at the same time, I actually had an internship lined up at Facebook on a completely different team, on newsfeed ranking, which funnily enough became the source of a whole another set of controversies years later, with respect to echo chambers and digital amplification and misinformation.</p>
<p>But what happened was right before I was supposed to join Facebook, right before I was supposed to start my internship, the VP of Engineering and the Head of HR called me up and said, “Hey, by releasing that extension, you didn’t act in our best interest as a company, so we’re going to let you go.” And this was the Friday before I was supposed to start my internship, I had a place already booked in California and paid for and it was quite a rug pull.</p>
<p>And I think that whole journey really taught me a few key things. I think, first and foremost, it taught me a lot about Facebook’s culture, and that they do not see the people who are using the platform, you and me, as users or customers. They view us as cattle, that is more likely to be happy when the wool is pulled over our eyes versus transparency about how the platform operates being given to us.</p>
<p>And the other thing I realised was that this is a pervasive problem, that is not just a Facebook issue. If we have more and more of our lives moving online to these sorts of platforms, often the incentives of the users are misaligned with growth incentives, and the incentives of the platform, which are really not just to suck all the data out of users, but also to reveal that data publicly in a way that benefits their growth in some advantageous manner.</p>
<p>So that was one of the things that I think it really launched me into looking more deeply at these privacy issues throughout the tech industry. And then really focusing a few years of my life doing research there and additional projects, just like the Marauder’s Map Project with companies like Venmo to reveal all of the issues around the transparency with which these platforms operate, particularly with respect to customer data.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s a very interesting story. I’m sure you learned a lot about that. And it’s interesting that as you explained that, so the user, if the user was curious enough or observant enough, would see the location just in front of his or her eyes, correct?</p>
<p>Aran: Correct. You just have to click on the message and the exact location it was sent from was attached. So all you really needed was a piece of paper and a pencil to go and do this by hand. I just happen to do it programmatically and release an application to help customers do this. So they could make the decision for themselves, whether or not this was something that should be left on or turned off.</p>
<p>Oscar: You also mentioned the example of Venmo. I know you have shown also in some of your blog post Venmo is, I think not so familiar here at least in Finland, I think it’s an app for splitting the bills, right? When you buy something together with your friends?</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, it’s more generally like peer-to-peer payment. The way that they really came at it was it was a mobile-first peer-to-peer payment solution that had a very big social component to it. And I believe the company thought the social component was a big part of their growth. So what they did was that by default, when you sign up for Venmo, and you know, if your friend wants to pay you back for a meal, you have to sign up for Venmo. All transactions that you put into the system, become default public and actually show up on a global news feed.</p>
<p>And the thinking and I saw a number of talks from folks at the company including their Chief Growth Officer saying the thinking behind this was, the more people who share the more people see them sharing and the more the company grows. So even if it wasn’t in the user’s best interest to share all of their financial transactions with friends. And I did a very similar project where I went back, added up all of those transactions and built a map to show things like who’s your best friend, who are you going on dates with, what clubs are you a part of, etc. But the user, basically, it may not be in their best interest to share all this stuff publicly. But by default, they make it very difficult to turn off, and it helps the business grow.</p>
<p>So that was another instantiation of the same problem. And I think it’s intertwined with identity moving to the net, in that era, right, in the 2010s, people started to use their real names on the internet. And now that identity was tied to these things in such a tight way, you could really get fairly clear signal about specific individuals from all of this public data that these platforms were in a sense, forcing them to reveal by hiding defaults and controls behind different layers of friction.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, for instance, the case of Facebook, that map you created, it was in 2015, now we are 2022 so a few years forward, so how – today, if you still continue with social media for a bit while, social media platforms are doing better in data privacy?</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, I think the target has shifted a little bit. I think the major things that happen were things like GDPR, between 2015 and now, and honestly, I don’t think it was very effective. I think from a privacy standpoint, the most effective thing has been increased scrutiny, and increased public awareness of these issues. And hopefully, my projects and other journalists writing on this actually did something to catalyse that.</p>
<p>But what I’m seeing now, and what I’m most concerned about now is actually, even if the data on people is not being publicly revealed to the world, for the purposes of growth, or inadvertently through features like location sharing in Messenger, what I’m really concerned about is how that data that’s now been collected even internally in a secure database is being used with things like machine learning algorithms to actually manipulate people at a much broader scale.</p>
<p>So I think the ball has shifted a little bit on where my concern is. I don’t think the privacy issue is necessarily completely solved or rectified. But I think it’s not the most pressing issue of the day, because there are other issues that are downstream from that, that are also causing large, inordinate impact and likely have to be addressed before we even go back and address the privacy issue. And that kind of brings me to why I even started researching machine learning in the first place coming out of 2015.</p>
<p>Oscar: So that was one of your drivers to go deeper into machine learning.</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, I think after seeing the amount of data just being leaked, it was very clear how much data was being collected. And the natural consequence of that data collection to me was OK, I know who you are, I know all this data associated with you. And I have a cohort of folks who look like you, can I not build models and experimentation to do things that are basically not in your best interest as a user?</p>
<p>I think it’s a very similar sort of thought process I went through on the privacy side, which is how are these platforms going to use these technologies in ways that are not aligned with customers or their users. And how do I help users actually navigate that? Educate them about it, so they can make informed decisions on what they use and how things are used against them.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how social media platforms currently handle more broadly, identity management?</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, that’s a very interesting topic, because I think it varies broadly between platforms, right? Working on Venmo, I think the places with the highest fidelity kind of identity mapping are, by necessity, these social cross financial platforms where you need KYC AML, to actually enter into the gates, you need to upload your ID to be a member of Square Cash or Venmo. So from that perspective, I think there’s sort of a bifurcation where you have these strongly enforced identity social platforms, largely correlated with some regulatory requirement.</p>
<p>And then you have these much more weakly enforced platforms, things like Twitter, and Instagram, and Facebook, where you see even today, huge issues with identity, with bots, with harassment. And I think that it’s not a one brush that you can paint the whole space with. There’s a lot of nuance there. And I think identity plays a different role in different places around the social ecosystem today that is really dependent on what the goal of that underlying social platform is and sort of what regulatory regime it operates under.</p>
<p>Oscar: And if go a bit broader, not only on social media platform, but any company that has users, many tech companies, how do you think from your perspective, of course, you have your own company, you might have an idea how the companies do on that side, but other companies who have services/applications are handling the identity management?</p>
<p>Aran: I think there’s a few questions in there, right. One is how are these companies, these technology companies, many of which we serve, we serve social media companies, B2B companies, kind of all over the space of technology, how do they handle internal identity and access management for their engineers, for their employees? And then how do they handle user data and identity for their customers?</p>
<p>Again, I think the customers piece is something that varies a lot more, because it’s a function of trying to have minimum friction, while meeting regulatory requirements at the space, the FinTechs that we work with obviously have much, much tighter regulations around their customer data, where it can be stored, the keys that manage it, so heavy usage of KMS and other services within the cloud providers that assist with that sort of process.</p>
<p>And on the other side, what’s heartening is seeing a lot of the internal practices around engineering teams, regardless of what the company is doing standardised with respect to identity and access management So we see lots of folks using internal SSO providers now, I think that’s the majority of our customers, whether or not they’re in the B2B or B2C space, we see widespread usage of KMS, and other custodial encryption services that help encrypt data at rest. And I think in flight as well, though, a lot of cloud providers have done a really good job of, by default, encrypting data in flight within their networks.</p>
<p>And I think what we’re seeing as well is with a lot more focus, particularly in the B2B space, on things like SOC 2 Compliance and ISO Compliance in Europe, a much more standard operating model for engineering teams with respect to when passwords are rotated, who has access to what, you know, are people all sharing the same account, the login, the stuff. A lot of that gets hammered out with these broader certification schemes.</p>
<p>So I think in the enterprise space, specifically with how customers‘ data is being managed, there’s variance, but internally with respect to how identity is being enforced, within organisations, for the internal teams, we’re seeing a lot more standardisation. And I think that’s very heartening. It’s showing a much greater level of maturity entering into the space. And obviously, that raises the bar for everyone in terms of security.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, as you know, many service providers – mixing the topic with the social media, again – many use social media authentication, what’s your opinion on that, the use of that and how, for the ones who use it, what could you say are good practices?</p>
<p>Aran: I think that’s a mixed topic again, because frankly, from my perspective, I view login with Facebook and login with Google, even though they’re both technically social logins for consumers, as very, very different. And I think it really goes back to the motivations behind those specific products.</p>
<p>I look at the motivations behind the login with Google product, it’s really around things like making sure that these users who are already Gmail users are being safe with password management on the internet. It’s very much a function of doing good for the community of users by giving them a tool to sort of authenticate and log in globally without having to deal with passwords, which are sort of a mess. So if you secure your Google account, which most folks do, becomes really easy downstream to log in and use best practices. So I actually view that as a net positive.</p>
<p>When I go to the other side with Facebook’s login, which came a little bit later, for their single sign-on solution, it’s useful. And I think it accomplishes many of the same things. And especially for parts of the world where Facebook is the internet, like the developing world, it’s kind of the only option you have. But in terms of the data that it extracts from customers, it becomes much more invasive.</p>
<p>So it really becomes a function of yes, the customers ultimately have the choice and you should give them the choice as the platform. But do you have a point of view as a business when you’re offering this? And is your customer base one that is going to, for example, if you have both individuals and business customers, you’re probably not going to have a login with Facebook, you might actually have a login with Google because that handles G Suite and the enterprise side as well as the consumer side.</p>
<p>So again, there’s a nuance there. But I think in terms of best practices, selecting one of those providers is really a function of what is your customer base? Who are they? Where do they live? And then do you have any strong views as a business on where you expose their data?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think it’s an interesting distinction. You mentioned, Google, yeah, tends to be more oriented to business because there is a Google Suite, for instance, that doesn’t exist in the Facebook world. Yeah. So to your view is Facebook, it’s much more invasive as this identity provider point of view.</p>
<p>Aran: It’s purely extractive in terms of why they created that, right? They don’t have a business to business service on the backend, that they’re actually serving and building this as a legitimate solution for.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, because they are in a position of power. In many cases that’s, as you mentioned, some places it’s just the only way to have this log in.</p>
<p>Aran: It’s a way to get Facebook pixel out into the world, essentially, they just want more pixels on more sites so they can track you on more parts of the internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And what if one business has decided, OK, we’re going to use anyway log in with Google, log in with Facebook, log in with LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, LinkedIn and GitHub I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Oscar: So what do you say in terms of making that more robust as an authentication to safeguard the data, what do you say are important things for the service provider who is adding that functionality and sign in with Google or sign in with GitHub, what would you say?</p>
<p>Aran: It’s difficult, right? Because when you do that, you assume that you’re pinging the API on the GitHub side or the Facebook side or the Google side. They’ve done all the heavy lifting for you. They done the 2FA, they’ve really gone in and made sure that the person who is giving you the token, is the person they say they are.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that you are outsourcing that trust. Now obviously, from a development standpoint, that’s exactly what you want to do. You don’t want your engineers going and building this thing that’s been built 500 times, you just want to use someone else’s sort of version of this where customers already have credentials and already have a process set up.</p>
<p>That being said, if you’re the service provider, I think it’s incumbent on you to think about what is the level of security I need here? Facebook, for example, is never going to kind of enforce 2FA in a strong, strong way for their customers, because they want people logging in and looking at the site. I think GitHub on the other hand, especially like for corporate GitHubs or G Suite on the other hand, for corporate accounts, they do have the ability to enforce that centrally. And you know, if you need even stronger access controls, getting something like an Okta with SSO is a consideration.</p>
<p>But again, I think it’s really a function of what is the level of security that your customers are requiring from you. And do you choose a platform that matches that? And we’ll give them those downstream controls and that you can trust to actually maintain that contract.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And on your case, I was checking also the Archera website. So you offer on this type of social media, you offer Google and Microsoft, correct.</p>
<p>Aran: Google, Microsoft and yeah, Okta more broadly, which is powering the whole thing. And it’s really just because we serve enterprises, right, big and small, we need to be where those enterprise admin accounts are set up, be it in G Suite, be it in Office 365, in Active Directory, or be it in Okta.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So based on the customer that the enterprise already use.</p>
<p>Aran: Correct.</p>
<p>Oscar: For all business leaders listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Aran: Hmm, the one actionable idea. I think one thing that has been surprising to me when I go in and audit platforms, including our own, or those of our customers for security and identity and access management best practices that I constantly see is the fact that the defaults, and the policies often don’t change from kind of the first setup to whenever I go and look at the thing, even if it’s three years, five years, N years down the line.</p>
<p>So having a review every quarter of particularly our identity and access management policies internally and for customers and being thoughtful about the goals of those policies, being thoughtful about setting them, having a cross functional team talk about it, at least once a quarter, because things change really quickly in this world, frankly. It’s something that I think is really important for leaders to go and do and build a cadence around.</p>
<p>And often, you know, if you’re doing SOC 2, or ISO, whatever, you’re going to have to do this anyways, there is some sort of cadence that is built into getting that certification. But building that muscle, regardless, I think is going to be very important going forward for business leaders.</p>
<p>Oscar: And normally what kind of position in the company normally takes care of that?</p>
<p>Aran: It depends on the scale. I’ve seen dedicated CISOs, Chief Information Security Officers, in less mature companies, sometimes the CIO, the Chief Information Officer, and even less mature companies, sometimes it’s the CTO and team of SRE or developers underneath them. But in general, it’s someone on the engineering side, who has deep knowledge of the architecture of the infrastructure, and likely deep knowledge of the cloud provider that the core infrastructure is being run on.</p>
<p>Because nowadays, and we see this in a lot of our customers, to really get in and fix a lot of issues or update a lot of issues, when you find them, you need to have that deep understanding of the offerings of the cloud provider, and how to actually orient and change those without impacting the application in a negative way. Or on the flip side, something we see a lot is impacting the costs in a very negative way by turning on things like detailed logging, when it might not be necessary and blowing up the amount of ingress or egress that you have from certain systems.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. Well, thanks a lot, Aran for this very interesting conversation, I definitely like all the work you have done, not only talking about your story, of course, the story you had with Facebook, and also other cases when social media and other providers didn’t take privacy seriously. So thank you for that, for sharing that story. Please let us know how people would like to get in touch with you.</p>

It also provides for the ancillary tasks associated with them such as the generation of API keys, DID anchoring, validating holder response, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>The entry point for this package is a method called CommonNetworkMember. By default, this will use Affinidi’s staging environment, though you can initialize it with specific service endpoints.</p> Generate API&nbsp;keys <p>It creates apiKey and apiKeyHash values after you register your entity at Affinidi’s stack environment, which can be staging, production, or dev. They are both request headers. apiKey is used when calling SDK methods and apiKeyHash is used for making <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api">API&nbsp;calls</a></p> const options = {  env: ‘staging’,  apiKey: ‘YOUR API KEY’ (or accessApiKey: ‘YOUR API KEY HASH VALUE’)  }  Access Through an Interface <p>You can call/access the wallet through any platform.</p> const { AffinidiWallet } = require(‘@affinidi/wallet-{PLATFORM}-sdk’) // where platform is one of ‘browser’, ‘expo’, ‘node’, ‘react-native’ <p>Accordingly, you will use the sdk/browser, sdk/expo, and sdk/react-native packages respectively.</p> Create a&nbsp;DID <p>A DID is a type of unique identifier (URI) that enables entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Creating a DID is easy with our tech stack as you’ll just have to make the below&nbsp;calls.</p> const wallet = await AffinidiWallet.createWallet(options, password)  const { did, encryptedSeed } = wallet <p>Here, encryptedSeed is a random auto-generated value that’s used as an input for private key generation.

<p>The <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">first article</a> in this three-part series explored unenclosability as an essential property of non-corruptible communication channels. We suggest heading there, if you haven’t already, before reading this article.</p><p>This piece explores what becomes possible in a world of unenclosable carriers. Which is not an easy thing exactly, because really what becomes possible in such a world is an explosion of innovations, the evolution of entirely new social patterns that are beyond what we can predict through the lens of existing ideas. Just as it’s hard to speculate on the kinds of biological organisms that will thrive a million years from now, we can’t really guess at what social organisms will be most useful in the next 10 or 20 years once no holds are barred.</p><p>Still, if we can’t fully paint a picture, maybe we can at least offer a palette sufficient to inspire a sense of what’s possible. As we do, we’ll find out that the prospect of a world built on unenclosable carriers (Holochain or otherwise) isn’t just exciting; it’s completely necessary for people and planet to thrive in the coming generations. Maybe that’s a bold claim, because it amounts to saying that an unenclosable carrier system is a key ingredient in, well, saving the world. And yet it’s what our analysis indicates, so we’d be amiss if we didn’t state the matter clearly and directly. If the boldness of the claim intrigues you to read on, all the better. </p><p>We offer the palette by considering well-known, far-reaching challenges in four domains: food production, energy production, money systems, and planetary stewardship. Within each, we look at how the challenges may actually be symptoms of broken or outdated underlying architectures – patterns of carrier enclosure that were created for good reasons but have actually painted us into a corner such that there’s no way out except to shift the architectures themselves. We then consider a number of alternatives, either experiments already underway or ones we can easily imagine, that gesture in the direction of what’s possible in a world of unenclosable carriers.</p><p>Alright, let’s dive in.</p> 1. Restoring the Quality of Our Food  The problem: <p>The nutritional content per calorie of the modern diet has declined significantly over the last 100 years, thanks to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/05/16/723693839/its-not-just-salt-sugar-fat-study-finds-ultra-processed-foods-drive-weight-gain">predominance of ultra-processed food</a>, the <a href="https://directorsblog.nih.gov/tag/low-quality-carbohydrates/">filling of many mass-produced products with simple carbohydrates and non-nutritional fillers</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15637215/">changes in varieties of crops grown to increase yields</a>, and a decline in the quality of fresh food as a result of soil depletion [<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soil-depletion-and-nutrition-loss/">1</a>] [<a href="https://soils.wisc.edu/facstaff/barak/poster_gallery/minneapolis2000a/">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/may/15/foodanddrink.shopping3">3</a>] and possibly even <a href="https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511">increased carbon in the atmosphere</a>.</p> But what if… <p>…these problems are actually symptoms of structural issues with the very mechanisms by which food is created, sold, and distributed? What if the soil is depleted and the food is overprocessed because of enclosed-carrier dynamics that have created <a href="https://www.tharawat-magazine.com/facts/top-ten-agribusiness-companies/#gs.xknwd5">big-ag</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-companies-control-the-food-industry-2016-9">big-food</a> giants who control much of the market — and whose incentives are directly misaligned with our nutritional needs?</p><p>Independent family farming used to be much more common [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/16/the-decline-of-the-small-american-family-farm-in-one-chart/">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2018-04-04/family-farms-pushed-to-get-big-or-go-bust">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.salon.com/2015/02/10/what_nobody_told_me_about_small_farming_i_cant_make_a_living/">3</a>] [<a href="https://www.t-g.com/story/2646155.html">4</a>] [<a href="https://www.thedailystar.com/news/local_news/number-of-family-farms-continues-to-decline/article_7b3c5532-e02e-5e07-8c62-5881899f616c.html">5</a>]. But increased centralization throughout the food markets have <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/08/small-farms-big-business-family-farms-struggle-against-industrial-agriculture/">made it more difficult for farmers to survive</a> without growing big. “Get big or get out,” said Earl Butz, Richard Nixon’s Secretary of Agriculture <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/04/usa.obituaries">said in 1973</a>. Today, it’s the largest growers — or at least the ones that subscribe to the big-ag programs for seed, feed, fertilizer, and distribution — that enjoy reliable access to the financing needed to compete at scale. And garnering space at grocery chains, even at the more principled ones such as Whole Foods, often <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/getting-your-product-on-shelves-at-whole-foods-just-got-harder-1518085801">requires 6-figure slotting fees</a> and the ability to produce at massive scale.</p><p>Want to ‘buy local’? Good luck: you’re limited to what’s available during the growing season in your area, and you’ll pay <a href="https://www.fdrsinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JFDR_49.1_4_Curtis.pdf">more than at the supermarket</a> because local growers generally can’t come close to matching mass-produced pricing. Want to go organic? Studies suggest that the herbicides known as glyphosates — which Monsanto markets as Roundup, and which the World Health Organization has concluded is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)70134-8/fulltext">“probably carcinogenic to humans”</a> — make their way <a href="https://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/glyphosate02.html">into water supplies</a> and even <a href="https://www.producer.com/2019/01/glyphosate-residues-snare-organics/">organic crops</a>.</p>Shelves at supermarket chains display the products that most serve the interests of the industry’s major stakeholders, and those products are filled with ingredients that do the same.<p>Our access to food is controlled by centralized market players that we don’t get to choose. Mega-corporations like Kraft &amp; Nestle control companies up and down the whole supply chain. Shelves at supermarket chains display the products that most serve the interests of the industry’s major stakeholders, and those products are filled with ingredients that do the same. Farmers are paid simply for pounds of yield, so they understandably favor the cheapest way to achieve high outputs, without regard to the nutritional content of the food or the harmful effects of chemical herbicides or fertilizers.</p><p>And regulators and legislators, many of whom are former big-ag executives or at least receive campaign funding from them, naturally favor centralized interests over those of independent growers.</p><p>Food quality inevitably declines as profit-driven companies race to the bottom in a quest for ever-cheaper sources and ingredients, with governments incentivized to cheer them on.</p> An alternative future is possible. <p>The explosion of labels and certifications like “organic/bio”, “fair trade”, “free-range”, “hormone-free”, “cage-free”, and so on point to the info-age demand for more visibility into the flows and processes that define our food production. A newer generation of certifications focus on “<a href="https://www.scsglobalservices.com/services/sustainably-grown-certification">sustainable</a>” growing practices and even “<a href="https://regenorganic.org/">regenerative</a>” ones, meaning they restore the health of ecosystems that have been degraded through industrial farming or other industry.</p><p>Labels may be only partial indicators — organic food can still come from depleted soil, for example — but at least they move the industry in the right direction. And they point to an opportunity to create massively greater accountability in our food supply chains, incentivizing producers through market dynamics to do right by the consumers.</p><p>Yet supply-chain transparency and consumer information really only works at scale in the case of carrier unenclosability. Without it, certifications themselves can easily become stale or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/organic-milk-may-not-be-organic-2017-5">corrupt</a>. The ability to create a new certification standard needs to be like creating a new turn of phrase in a language: anyone can do it, and the expression spreads if it’s useful, rather than being subject to centralized (government or corporate) oversight over what takes hold. This way, any community can invent, evolve, and enforce the kind of quality assurance that it needs.</p><p>One promising example is the <a href="https://justoneorganics.com/pages/mission-arc-4">Just One Organics Living Economy System </a>(JOOLES), which plans to incentivize regenerative, high-nutrition growing practices by creating a feedback loop directly within the economics of food production. Growers who maintain high soil standards (as verified by spectroscopic analyses of the nutritional content of their produce) gain access to valuable contracts for their grade-B produce known as ‘seconds’ as well as interest-free credit lines that they can use to increase their growing capacity.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>Today, even as healthier growing practices become theoretically more profitable as a result of rising consumer demand, many farmers remain entrenched in low-nutrition, high-chemical growing practices because they lack access to the funding required to shift their operations. It’s the biggest agriculture companies that have access to the cheapest funding, and they make that funding available only to growers who buy the company’s products, sell the company their outputs, or both. Low-quality, high-yield agriculture remains dominant, at least in part, because existing powers have an incentive to perpetuate their already-profitable practices, despite their destructive impacts and growing consumer appetites for something different.</p><p>Projects like JOOLES have the potential to flip that script by linking quality-oriented producers directly with funding from quality-oriented consumers. And doing so using a framework like Holochain ensures that, while money can flow to companies who create value for consumers, no one will be able to concentrate power by virtue of saying who can or cannot transact or collaborate. In a world of unenclosable carriers, consumers will be empowered to continually invent new structures to incentivize the nutrition they actually want, free from the enclosures of entrenched interests that seek to extract short-term profits.</p> 2. Solving the Energy Crisis  The problem: <p>Humans are using the planet’s energy stores faster than they can replenish. This appears to be a function of our reliance on cheap, finite stores of fossil fuel to power an ever-hungrier array of industry, combined with the difficulty of bringing online alternative energy solutions in a cost-effective way. Despite massive sums spent on research and development over many years, we remain drastically ill-equipped to meet energy demands in the coming post-fossil-fuel era.</p> But what if… <p>…this problem is actually a symptom of a centralized energy economy in which entrenched powers have strong incentives to keep us reliant on how we harvest and distribute energy today rather than scale up viable alternatives?</p><p>Consider, for example, how the utility monopolies have used their influence to protect themselves against competition from renewables. They have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/climate/rooftop-solar-panels-tax-credits-utility-companies-lobbying.html?_r=0">worked to curtail production of solar power in homes</a> by lobbying to eliminate tax breaks for solar installations. When ‘net-metering’ legislation has been introduced to require that utility companies pay consumers for surplus power produced at home, energy companies have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/utility-companies-lobbying-campaigns-solar-2017-7">lobbied against it</a> and successfully eliminated it in several U.S states, in some cases doing so explicitly on the grounds that solar proliferation could hurt their profits. Even U.S. government agencies have moved to protect the fossil fuel industry from competition by alternative energy sources, pursuing policies to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/energy-environment/wind-power-base-load.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fdiane-cardwell&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=collection">discourage utility companies from investing in renewables</a>.</p>The utility monopolies have used their influence to protect themselves against competition from renewables.<p>Or consider how oil-industry power brokers in both the private and public sector <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F#Oil_companies">worked to undermine the development and adoption of early electric cars</a> in the early 2000s in the United States, including through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation">disinformation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>, because electric vehicles threatened oil company profits.</p><p>These kinds of counterproductive scenarios, commonplace as they may be, are not necessary. They are consequences of how the flow of electricity is enclosed by centralized power brokers as it moves across the world. There may have been good reasons to allow for those enclosures at the time, such as reliability and scalability, but when building on unenclosable systems like Holochain, it’s actually possible to have it both ways: clean-energy projects that have the resources for large-scale impact and are immune to corruption by proprietary business interests.</p> An alternative future is possible. <p>There is actually an abundance of innovative energy solutions in existence today, and there is promising research into new solutions for tomorrow. The challenge is circumventing the destructive grip the leading energy corporations have on the market that keeps innovations from proliferating. If communities of consumers, researchers, property owners, and entrepreneurs were able to collaborate and transact with true freedom, we could rapidly evolve new approaches to our energy problems.</p><p>Here are just a few kinds of solutions waiting to spread their wings in an unenclosable system:</p><p>A. Self-owned, self-generated power: the production of power on one’s own property, for one’s own use. One recent study found that residential solar production alone <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70901.pdf">could supply around a quarter of the United States’</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_of_the_United_States#Electricity_consumption">total energy needs</a>. Add in the rest of usable rooftop space nationwide and <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65298.pdf">you get to 39%</a>, while California, where it’s especially sunny, could produce 74% of its power just through solar on existing rooftops.</p><p>B. Peer-produced power and micro-exchanges: the sharing of self-generated power across peer networks, with payments made through unenclosable currencies from those who net-consume power to those who net-provide power. Imagine if everyone were simply buying and selling electricity to one another – harvested from sun, wind, and rivers – &nbsp;with absolutely no centralized entity brokering or extracting value from those transactions. This ‘Internet of Energy’ is what <a href="https://redgrid.io/">Redgrid</a>, <a href="https://holo.host/project/redgrid/">powered by Holochain</a>, aims to create.</p><p>C. Smart grids: comprehensive restructuring of power grids to increase efficiency and decrease fuel usage, required infrastructure, and pollution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid#Load_adjustment/Load_balancing">Smart grids</a> involve different components (such as appliances, meters, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_conditioner">power conditioners</a>) ‘talking’ to each other and taking actions that reduce or balance system loads across time. For example, a smart grid might cause air conditioners at neighboring buildings to ‘take turns’ cycling on and off, thereby reducing spikes in overall usage and, in turn, reducing the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_demand">peak power</a> that the grid needs to be built to provide. Today, energy companies have incentives to suppress smart-grid technology since it threatens their current business models, but in a world of unenclosable carriers and open energy exchanges, micro-markets could emerge where small players compete to establish healthier patterns of energy use.</p><p>D. Novel developments in energy production. In a climate of unfettered research and development, resources could also flow to a variety of promising energy research frontiers (beyond wind and solar) that make sense to pursue but are today disregarded as fringe by centralized economic channels. Waves, tides, geothermal sources, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hawaii-first-to-harness-deep-ocean-temperatures-for-power/">deep ocean water</a>, and even <a href="https://medium.com/predict/no-longer-30-years-away-two-new-major-fusion-breakthroughs-bcb65106a013">fusion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion">cold fusion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy">zero-point energy</a>, and <a href="https://topmagneticgenerator.com/mit-experiments-with-overunity/">over-unity devices</a> have yielded promising discoveries which have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_encumbrance_of_large_automotive_NiMH_batteries">shelved or blocked</a> within today’s centralized energy climate. With peer-production and smart grids in place, it could become economically feasible to create a ready evaluation path and an open market for every garage inventor’s creative energy solutions.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>The very idea that energy production needs to be centralized is actually fairly new. During the early industrial age 150 or 200 years ago, you didn’t need to plug into a centralized, monopoly-owned grid to run your factory; you just needed a river to turn your belts. Even steam engines that ran trains and turned heavy equipment could run on wood harvested and renewed within the local forest.</p><p>As foreign as it may sound today, decentralized power production was once the norm and could easily be again, sending centralized facilities the way of industrial-age relics like broadcast TV service, print-newspaper conglomerates, and the U.S. Postal Service. This is especially true now because we have technologies not just for producing large amounts of energy locally, but also for efficiently distributing and transacting for it across peer-to-peer networks. Add in the possibility of major funding sources being directed to mainly support, rather than suppress, the scaling of clean energy solutions, and we have a whole new ball game when it comes to powering humanity for centuries to come.</p><p>Of course, all of this would require a complete dismantling of the current enclosures around our energy systems. Existing patterns perpetuate because existing incentive structures perpetuate them. The future of energy production, like the future of nutrition, must be underpinned by the ability for groups to spin up new patterns of coordination at will.</p><p>And spinning up new patterns at will, it turns out, requires unenclosability not just in our communication systems but also our transacting systems. So let’s turn next to money.</p> 3.

This forces the issuance of more money each year than the previous (and thus more debt) in order to keep up with interest and avoid collapse due to foreclosures, defaults, and bankruptcies. Through compounding interest, this debt grows exponentially, ever widening the gap between money owed and the money supply available to repay it. The debt is owed by individuals, corporations, and governments who rely on borrowed money in order to invest in homes, infrastructure, and so on — all of whom then need to earn even more each year as interest compounds. The economy is literally forced to grow, or collapse.	</p><p>If this doesn’t already <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-wall-street-ponzi-scheme-called-fractional-reserve-banking/11600">sound a lot like a Ponzi scheme</a>, consider it from the angle of the bankers: as they issue money through loans, the debt owed to them on that money compounds, so in order for borrowers to repay the debts on the money issued last year, bankers need to issue even more money as debt this year. Just like in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi Scheme</a>, this cycle continues and builds exponentially until it reaches its limits of growth, at which point it collapses. </p> An alternative future is possible. <p>We may have so taken for granted that our currency is issued by central authorities and used to manipulate commerce that it’s hard to imagine alternatives taking hold at any kind of scale. And we previously explored how blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, despite their rhetoric, are actually enclosable and are ultimately subject to the same pitfalls of centralized power as corporations and governments. But if we toss out all of our assumptions, we can actually imagine currency taking on entirely new forms. Here are two.</p><p>A. Mutual credit.<br>In a mutual credit system, currency is issued not by a central authority, but by participants granting each other credit according to mutually agreed-upon rules. Money is issued when someone spends into the negative, thus borrowing against the system, while others keep positive balances by receiving revenue before they spend. Since every transaction involves offsetting positive and negative balance adjustments, the currency supply is net-zero, meaning that the sum of all the outstanding positive and negative balances in the system is always zero, just like on a balance sheet.</p>In a mutual credit system, the currency supply is net-zero, meaning that the sum of all the outstanding positive and negative balances in the system is always zero.<p>The rules for who can draw credit vary among mutual credit systems, but one favored approach is to allow only established producers of value to borrow money. In <a href="https://files.holo.host/2017/11/Holo-Currency-White-Paper_2017-11-28.pdf">HoloFuel</a>, for example — the currency system of the <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo hosting network</a>, which is powered by Holochain — users who have demonstrated past capacity to provide hosting power receive lines of credit backed by their future hosting. Thus, not only are “loans” backed by actual value being created, but the very size of the active currency supply — the sum total of the positive balances (which is the inverse of the sum total of debt) — is grounded in the actual size, the actual supply and demand, of the hosting economy.</p><p>Similarly, JOOLES, which we mentioned earlier in this article, is a mutual-credit currency backed by the production of food, with the money supply growing or shrinking proportionally to the supply and demand for produce.</p><p>With the currency supply grounded in the economic output it represents – and with no debt created beyond what’s issued directly for value-creators – there’s no ‘economy’ that needs to keep growing just to feed itself. And with currency issued directly by the value producers, no one can extract value just by virtue of having a monopoly on money issuance. A mutual-credit currency based on an unenclosable carrier such as Holochain is truly peer-to-peer, completely free of any centralized components.</p><p>A bonus benefit of mutual credit is that it may bypass the challenges that many cryptocurrencies face with regard to securities laws (which are themselves a form of carrier enclosure). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in particular has a penchant for shutting down blockchain-based projects that issue speculative tokens, but because mutual credit is issued only in the moments when value is actually exchanged, it is not a future-based investment and, as such, may be difficult to classify as a security.</p><p>B. Triple-bottom-line currencies.<br>Triple-bottom-line currencies are another way of optimizing currency, and thereby the economy, for wide collective benefit. You may have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line#People,_the_social_equity_bottom_line">triple-bottom-line (TBL) accounting</a>, which some companies use to evaluate their performance on the basis of not only profit but also people, which is the well-being of everyone impacted by the business, and planet, which is the business’s impact on the natural environment. (Profit, people, and planet are sometimes known as the three ‘P’s.) TBL accounting is an attempt to account for, or ‘internalize’, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externalities</a> of transactions, which is to say the costs (or benefits) of doing business that are not reflected in revenues. It’s a noble idea, but it’s impossible to accurately account for a transaction’s externalities, given all the hidden and chain reactions that take place in the complex systems of human dynamics and planetary ecosystems.</p><p>Another way of stating this problem is that any company’s internal assessment of their external effects is skewed by the company’s limited perspective (which is a kind of enclosure in its own right) even if it has the best intentions.</p><p>In an unenclosable financial system, however, there’s a way around the problem: incorporating external feedback loops into the currency itself, based on input from people who are in a position, from vantage points outside the company, to assess its external impacts. This way, instead of expecting companies to care about people and planet and also do impossible accounting, a TBL currency enables a much simpler thing, which is to allow a company’s reputation for doing good or harm to impact its overall cost of doing business.</p><p>This approach is actually similar to what we know today as credit ratings, which are essentially reputation currencies that act in conjunction with today’s money systems to affect the cost and availability of money. But credit ratings factor in only your payment history, which corresponds to just one of the P’s: your ability to earn money (profit) and, in turn, reliably make profit for the bankers who lend you money. A ‘triple credit rating’, which could drive a ‘triple-bottom-line currency’, would also factor in your effects on people and planet. One possible approach could be:</p><p>(i) Your people rating affects your interest rates, in order to make it more attractive for you to borrow money if you’re deemed to affect people positively through your commerce, and less attractive if you’re not.</p><p>(ii) Your planet rating affects your transaction fees, with the idea being that polluters and extractors pay a tax to the system to offset the environmental costs borne by everyone. If you have a reputation for positively impacting the planet, you could actually incur a negative tax, which means you’re essentially being paid to transact by the system, in reflection of the good you externalize.</p><p>(iii) Your profit rating affects your credit limits, similar to existing credit ratings, with the idea being that your likelihood to pay back funds ought to remain a central factor in how much you can borrow.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>Today, business is driven by the short-term imperative of financial profit and staying ahead of ever-compounding debt. Of course such an extractive system is driving a pattern of cancerously consuming the planet’s natural resources in the almighty name of Economic Growth. Of course we’re burning cheap but limited energy stores instead of building renewable infrastructure. And of course we’re farming in ways that maximize pounds of yield over soil health and more sustainable growing practices.</p><p>One mechanism by which today’s debt-driven economy has such a troubling effect is through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money">time cost of money</a>, which means that a dollar now is worth more than a dollar later. With debt everywhere, compounding interest is everywhere, so carrying a negative balance is expensive, while carrying a positive balance can be lucrative. The time cost of money incentivizes everyone to liquidate physical assets for cash as soon as possible. A tree is worth more dead than alive, goes one saying.</p><p>In other words: no matter what business asset you own — a forest, a website, a factory — you have an incentive to convert that asset into numbers on a balance sheet as quickly as possible, even if it could produce more cash on a longer timeline. The more cash you can get now, the more you can put that cash to work in high-return financial instruments. Plus, if you’re like most business owners, you’re paying interest on the loans you took to capitalize your business — as well as on your personal debt (home, cars, college, and so on) — and cash could help pay off those costly loans.</p><p>It’s no wonder that long-term sustainability (of a business model or a planet) is such a low priority for most businesses. Extracting more fossil fuel, catching more fish, and selling more plastic is not just profitable but compoundingly profitable, even if we are completely outstripping the carrying capacity of our ecosystem.</p>Extracting more fossil fuel, catching more fish, and selling more plastic is not just profitable but compoundingly profitable, even if we are completely outstripping the carrying capacity of our ecosystem.<p>Speaking of which: the fact that it’s even possible to outstrip the carrying capacity of our ecosystem is, in part, a function of our currency supply being disconnected from the limits of the physical systems upon which the economy operates. Reconnecting these two phenomena is actually imperative for having a sustainable economy: if we don’t, we have no guardrails against outstripping the planet’s capacity to regenerate itself.</p><p>Mutual credit systems have a particularly seamless ability to connect to the carrying capacity of an economy, since the creation of currency can be strictly a function of spending into the negative by those who have demonstrated the ability to produce actual value, and the currency is backed by their future production of that value. Such a system also shifts the power away from the bankers who derive influence from their ability to create and charge for the money supply, allocating power instead to the value-creators themselves (those who are actually able to provide for people’s needs). Add in a triple-credit rating system and you bring greater good into the equation as well.</p><p>Imagine if the most powerful individuals on the planet were those who demonstrated the capacity to create the most benefit, rather than those who can extract the most resources.</p><p>It’s a good thing that we can imagine such a scenario, because this is exactly what it will take to tackle perhaps the most intractable problem we’re facing today.</p> 4. Saving the Planet  The problem: <p>There are, of course, many human-caused problems related to our natural ecosystem. We are currently causing the sixth major extinction event in biological history, we are polluting the oceans and atmosphere beyond what may be reversible, and we are rapidly outstripping the carrying capacity of our ecosystem.</p><p>For the purpose of illustration, let’s narrow things down and focus on the destruction of the rainforests, which are clearly disappearing at a rate faster than they can renew [<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation/">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/11/18/20970604/amazon-rainforest-2019-brazil-burning-deforestation-bolsonaro">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/world/americas/amazon-rainforest.html">3</a>]. Reasons appear to include narrow-minded policies in many tropical nations that are out of touch with the importance of rainforests to our planet’s health, along with the desirability of rainforest land for industrial farming and oil exploration.</p>Rainforests are disappearing at a rate faster than they can renew. But what if… <p>… these are actually symptoms of a deeper cause: that our enclosable systems have led us to account for the value of rainforests in short-term and shallow ways, making it inevitable that their stewards would choose to liquidate them now versus reap their benefits over time?</p><p>What is the true value of an acre of rainforest? It may be difficult to place a number, but any true-value calculation would have to account for the myriad ways the forest contributes to the greater ecosystem (and the economy) by continuing to exist: the carbon storage that keeps the planet from overheating, the oxygen supply that keeps us breathing, the rare tropical hardwoods which might be harvested sustainably over time, the utility of plants as food and medicine, the biodiversity that took billions of years to evolve and helps sustain food chains worldwide.</p><p>But try comparing the value of a thousand chairs or ten thousand gallons of milk this year to the value of keeping a million tons of carbon out of the atmosphere over the next 100 years, or to the survival of a certain salamander species that could keeping eating bugs and being food for birds for millions of years. That’s a challenging task in any case, but it’s completely impossible when our financial systems account for only the most shallow and short-term benefits: X dollars for the lumber, Y dollars for the drilling rights, and Z dollars for agricultural leases.</p><p>Which means there’s (at least) two issues at play here, if we break things down. One is the oppressive time cost of money: it’s better to get $10M now than $20M over the next 20 years. The other is that financial accounting is an inadequate representation of wealth in a complex system. Without proper accounting for externalities, it’s inevitable that we continue to eat the world for profit, unsustainably extracting natural resources for their cash value.</p> An alternative future is possible. <p>We’ve already looked at mutual credit and triple-bottom-line currencies as ways to foster sustainability and positive feedback loops at the level of currency design. Both would help bring incentives more in line with rainforest preservation. Now we look at an approach one layer up: the ways that assets are owned and shared.</p><p>Sharing economies.<br>Is it necessary for us to outright own as much as we currently do? Is it beneficial?</p><p>For example: How many hours of use per year does the average suburban lawnmower see? Maybe an hour a week for part of the year? That means they sit idle more than 99.7% of the time… yet it’s typical to have one in every household, causing all manner of negative externalities through their manufacturing, raw materials, waste, and (often) indoor storage space. Conventional accounting celebrates the manufacturing, sale, and maintenance of all these lawnmowers as positive numbers in “the economy”, but there’s a bigger picture badly missed by that perspective. Can you imagine the massive net benefit if neighborhoods could easily coordinate their use of lawnmowers through a shared-ownership, shared-use system built on unenclosable carriers?</p><p>Expanding outward, cars also seem ripe for this kind of exploration, as do, say, many kitchens and laundry spaces. Maybe someday even land might not need to be individually owned, but rather commonly owned and privately leased. This is the basis of Georgist economics, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Georgism</a>, which also imagines that lease-holders could reap benefits from improving the land and be taxed for extracting resources from the land.</p><p>But we don’t need to go full Georgist to imagine hybrid systems – ‘sharing economies’ – that would retain basic property ownership but still lead to more efficient use of resources. One version is a kind of <a href="http://artbrock.com/blog/new-kind-commons-land-weaving-society">land-weaving society</a> in which owners permit the use of their property for a variety of beneficial purposes, using reputation and certification to authorize access. If I have a permaculture certification, for example, I might be invited to farm your land, perhaps for a fee or a share of yield, or maybe because it benefits you in other ways, like soil improvement or social rewards. Other certifications might permit me to sustainably harvest wood, gather food or medicinal herbs, hunt, or graze your livestock. “No Trespassing” signs could be replaced by technologically enabled “Enter Here” checkpoints, with RFID or smartphone-based tracking – and with micropayments transferring automatically in cryptocurrencies as agreed upon.</p>“No Trespassing” signs could be replaced by technologically enabled “Enter Here” checkpoints.<p>For a land-weaving type of approach to remain effective at any kind of scale, it would be critical that the systems for granting and tracking access — and for tracking reputations and certifications — be guaranteed to always remain fully decentralized, which means being built on an unenclosable carrier framework like Holochain.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>What’s typical today is that only those who own or fully rent a piece of land can make much use of it. But this tight coupling of ownership and stewardship makes holding natural resources unlucrative as compared to liquidating them, due to the costs of ownership and the time cost of money. But we can begin to imagine how, if we decouple ownership from stewardship, the balance could tip such that growing the capacity of the land is more beneficial to the landowner than depleting it.</p><p>The closest analog we have today to what something like this might look like might be national parks, but these exist mainly as nature preserves reliant on government subsidies (and a bit of tourism revenue). As a result, they are subject to all the complications of centralized power, including <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/07/who-wants-disposable-plastic-water-bottles-in-national-parks/399113/">lobbying</a>, politically motivated <a href="https://www.npca.org/articles/2029-how-is-the-partial-government-shutdown-affecting-national-parks">government shutdowns</a>, and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/trump-bears-ears.html">declassification from protected status</a> by unilateral action.</p><p>In order to truly tip the balance such that stewarding a rainforest on an ongoing basis is more advantageous than destroying it for cash, multiple land uses need to be allowed to occur: not solely ecotourism, or harvesting edibles, or gathering medicinals or wood, but all of these and more, all gated through the appropriate membranes of access such as certifications, reputation systems, and fee structures.</p><p>And because each of these land uses are complex in their own right, it might not be one enterprise operating all of them, but various enterprises doing work within their zones of core competency, choreographing their operations with one another to maximize efficiency. For instance, the group permitted to harvest lumber might mark the trees they plan to cut down with three months’ notice, so that the gatherers could prioritize harvesting food, herbs, and other materials from those trees in particular. The type of coordination this requires is what makes unenclosable carriers so important: to whatever extent the coordination is channeled through central points of control, the system will corrupt over time, with power and money flowing to those who control the means of coordination.</p>There might be various enterprises doing work within their zones of core competency, choreographing their operations with one another to maximize efficiency.<p>Growing What’s Ours<br>Extrapolating from the idea of sharing economies, we might begin to completely reimagine what it means to solve for scarcity in general. As the naturalist Paul Krafel has pointed out in his enlightening (if productionally spartan) short film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuBMpc_3S04">The Upward Spiral</a>, there are basically two responses when faced with limited resources: one is to compete to maximize your own personal gain at the expense of others’, and the other is to act and interact in patterns that expand the amount of usable resources for everyone (including yourself).</p><p>We call the first strategy ‘get mine’, and we call the second ‘grow ours’. And what’s fascinating is that if you look across natural history, it’s ‘grow ours’ that evolution selects for over time, contrary to what we might infer from the ‘survival of the fittest’ narrative dominant within our cultural understanding of evolution (and in nature documentaries). Natural selection might actually be better understood as ‘<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Nature-Deliberate-Encounters-Visible/dp/189013242X">survival of the fit</a>’, as in “those whose characteristics are most fit for their environs are most likely to survive”. And a great way of being highly fit to one’s environs is to treat existing resources regeneratively, using the ones that exist to produce even more valuable resources.</p><p>Plants are great as this. They combine the abundant resources of sunlight, air, and water and produce all the carbon-sugars that comprise our planetary food chain. And look at how well that works out for them: they have literally spread to most of the surface area on earth, and they make up a vast majority of biomass on the planet. Carnivorous mammals, which need to employ more ‘get mine’ than plants to compete for limited food, are far more rare. But even they typically take only what they need, and not more than can be renewed, from their surroundings and from prey populations.</p>Plants combine the abundant resources of sunlight, air, and water and produce all the carbon-sugars that comprise our planetary food chain.<p>Growing ours is a good strategy in part because most of the resources we need to survive are actually renewable, meaning there’s an infinite supply if we treat them regeneratively. When we’re only competing against one another for how quickly we can extract those resources and short-term-profit from them, we outstrip the carrying capacity of the incredible engine of life that is our sun-fueled natural ecosystem, and the engine stops. On the other hand, when we take on a posture of enhancing the regenerative behaviors of ecosystems, the engine thrives, and so does humanity.</p><p>It’s not that ‘get mine’ is not useful in the right context and scale; individual agents within a market often need to compete for shares of a pie. But that’s precisely why it’s so critical that, at a collective level, we have feedback loops that check and balance our overall consumption, or else we’re just like a yeast colony that overconsumes its environment and causes its own demise. We must have systems that track our impact and make it visible, facilitate and reward the sharing of resources, and incentivize working together to leave the pie at least as big as we found it. And these systems must be built on unenclosable carriers or they will get hijacked again and again for the benefit of only a few, and the story plays out once more – different cast maybe, but same outcome.</p> A ‘Holocene Explosion’ of Social Organisms <p>Starting 541 million years ago, a remarkable thing happened: a period of just 20 million years gave birth to most of the biological diversity that exists today. It’s known as the Cambrian Explosion, and it was catalyzed by the information carrier known as DNA.</p><p>Here at the beginning of the 21st century, we are standing at the outset of a similar explosion, only this time, it’s social organisms, not biological ones, that are emerging. And it’s social DNA, not biological DNA, that is powering it. </p><p>Just as biological organisms are more than the sum of their cellular parts, with the whole living on as the cells die and are replaced, social organisms (or social patterns) are forms of collective coordination that live on beyond the participation of particular individuals. Corporations and governments are the most familiar examples, having dominated the human systems landscape for centuries, with religious groups, tribes, and all kinds of community structures also in the mix along the way.</p><p>Early challenges to that dominance began decades ago with experiments in more participatory ownership (such as different kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative">cooperatives</a>) and more participatory governance (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy">liquid democracies</a>), but it’s really the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web2</a>’ era of user-generated content, with its social networks and online marketplaces, that kicked the explosion into higher (second?) gear.</p><p>Now, ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a>’ organisms like decentralized marketplaces and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) use blockchain-based smart contracts to eliminate the need for corporate or government intermediaries entirely. Even though these new organisms end up giving power to new intermediaries (as we discussed in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Part 1 of this series</a>), they are still shaking the snow globe and enabling us to at least imagine a world without centralized power.</p><p>The aim of this article has been to hint at such a world. Mutual credit, peer energy exchanges, sharing economies… these are examples of the kinds of social organisms that might emerge in an era of truly peer-to-peer communication and collaboration, built on a system of unenclosable carriers. But there are so many more unknowns than knowns about this new era. When any two or two billion people can invent new ways of interacting, unfettered by anyone moderating their behavior without their permission, the DNA of social organisms evolves with unprecedented speed. New ideas are encoded and tried, with the most fit being refined, combined, iterated, and propagated.</p><p>It’s an explosion of new social organisms like we’ve never seen before, a complete reimagining of how humans interact and organize. We call it the Holocene Explosion, named for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene">current geological epoch</a>, and it begins now.</p><p>Let’s tune in to one more thought experiment that might (barely) hint at the scope of something like this. Imagine you’re the CEO of a huge multinational corporation, and it’s your job to keep a pulse on the whole organization and to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues as they arise. Today, you get the information you need periodically in dense reports containing financial statements and other long-form statistics. The report has taken time to compile from all the different departments and field locations, so by the time you receive it it’s not very current. Plus it takes you time to read it, digest it into a mental model, and hopefully draw some kind of useful conclusions about the complex system the data represents.</p><p>But let’s say that this is the future, and you get your information very differently. What you’re looking at is not a 400-page report, but rather a nature scene depicted on a screen — maybe an aquarium of fish, a bit like the old screensavers. Each type of fish represents some part of the massive, complex system you’re managing, while the fishes’ behavior — like how fast or high they’re swimming, or how coordinated a school’s movements — represents some metric, interpreted and compiled by the sort of advanced intelligence that’s already available today.</p>What you’re looking at is not a 400-page report, but rather a nature scene depicted on a screen — maybe an aquarium of fish, a bit like the old screensavers.<p>What works so well about this scenario is not just that the data is delivered in real time, but also that it’s delivered in a format that is consistent with how the human perceptual system is designed to operate. You have on the wall in your office not paragraphs, charts, and graphs, but a simulated ecosystem acting as the real-time health monitor of a complex system, displayed in such a way that you can take in large amounts of information at a glance, millions of simultaneous data points even, by observing patterns among the fish or their environs: the rippling seaweed, the blooming algae, the bubbles, the water’s cloudiness, the current, the light. When something seems ‘off’, you open up an interface on your computer, click on the item of interest, and drill in for more information.</p><p>Imagine how effective you would be at taking the pulse of a system and adapting to it under these conditions.</p><p>Now imagine that it’s not just the CEO who has access to this monitor, but actually everyone in the company as well, in corners of their screens or on the walls in their departments, maybe with their views adapted according to what’s most relevant for their work. Now instead of only a few executives being responsible for managing everything, the whole is holding the whole. Everyone can see the system they’re impacting, feel a direct relationship to it, and problem-solve for its optimal health. Can you imagine how the spirit of ‘grow ours’ could spread across an organization if all the people who were actually doing the work to bring about change could see the effect of their activities on the system?</p><p>Now consider applying these kinds of feedback mechanisms to all manner of global conditions: intercontinental trade, harmony among peoples, and, yes, the health of rainforests, oceans, and the atmosphere. How much faster might we solve humanity’s most intractable problems if we were all seeing the impact of our collective action in real time? If we were problem-solving not through marching-in-the-streets social activism that tries to compel power brokers to act against their own economic interests, but rather by tapping into humankind’s collective creativity to invent new social and economic patterns that incentivize everyone to grow the whole?</p><p>What we’re talking about here is a quantum leap in coordinative capacity that doesn’t actually require a vast leap in technological capacity, at least not in the ‘high-tech’ sense. It’s more like the arising of language than advancements in nuclear fusion or space travel. Sure, there’s complexity in building an unenclosable framework for decentralized software applications, but the leap is mainly about arranging building blocks into new, more eloquent, more sustainable forms.</p><p>The fundamental technology needed, therefore, is a coordinative technology, one that facilitates the mashing up and remixing of components quickly and with as few barriers as possible. We need an efficient, tamper-proof, and resilient carrier for social DNA.</p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unleashing-the-power-of-unenclosable-carriers-and-how-holochain-can-help/">next and final article in this series</a>, we look at how Holochain is designed to be just such a technology.</p><p><br></p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">first</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">second</a> articles in this series explored the nature of unenclosable carriers and their potential to underpin an unprecedented explosion of human creativity and social flourishing. We suggest starting there if you haven’t already.</p><p>This final installment delves into the unenclosable carrier Holochain specifically, including what makes it unenclosable and how it can be used.</p><p>(One thing this article doesn’t provide is much of a comparison between Holochain and blockchain technology; we wrote <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">another piece</a> to serve that purpose.)</p><p>Let’s get right to it.</p> What Holochain Is <p>Holochain is an open-source, unenclosable framework that enables hosting of peer-to-peer applications without any centralized or consensus-based infrastructure. It provides a way of ensuring the integrity and accuracy of data in a network while also enabling every user to host and represent their own data. Rather than having actions validated and information verified by centralized entities (as in internet apps) or <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/blockchain-blind-spots-1904d490218d">global consensus mechanisms</a> (as in blockchain apps) — both of which are enclosable and result in power imbalances (see <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Part 1</a>) — actions and data within Holochain apps are validated entirely peer-to-peer.</p>  By “framework”, we mean a database for storing, organizing, and finding data that is spread across many computers, so that no one has to hold a lot of data. In Holochain apps there can be data that remains local to one’s own computer, on what’s called a Source Chain, and there can be data that is shared across many computers, on what’s called a Distributed Hash Table (DHT).  By “peer-to-peer applications”, we mean a version of decentralized applications (dApps) that are hosted entirely by the participants in the app, rather than by a central company. (Holochain applications are sometimes called hApps.) There are no limits to the kinds of apps that might be built on Holochain, other than that they have to involve two or more parties communicating or transacting. Apps for social networking, currency systems, ride-sharing, travel booking, buying and selling, team coordination, collective decision-making, chat, weather, and news applications are all possible. Most ways that you currently interact digitally with people or businesses, as well as many ways you might imagine doing so, can be built on Holochain and can probably be enhanced by unenclosability.  By “data integrity”, we mean the assurance that data cannot be tampered with once it has been created, including by anyone storing data about themselves on their own Source Chain. For example, if you have 100 currency units and you spend 50, it has integrity for you to represent to the network that you have 50 units remaining; it would not have integrity for you to be able to represent that you still have 100. Similarly, it would not have integrity if you could display a 5-star user rating when the average of your ratings is actually 3 stars. Holochain provides a way of cryptographically ensuring that if you misrepresent any data, such as your account balance or reputation score, it will be obvious, and your communication or transaction will be flagged and rejected by the peer-based validation mechanisms.  <p>Each Holochain app is a collaborative platform within which users host themselves and also provide just a little extra computing power and storage so that extra copies of data are always online and agreements are mutually validated and enforced.</p> What Makes Holochain Unenclosable <p>Holochain is agent-centric. Holochain enables individual choice over just about everything, including which applications and networks to participate in, your identity and address within those networks, and what information you expose to other participants. And you always store and own your own data, taking it with you as you move between applications, which is not possible with internet search engines, social networks, or shopping sites — or even blockchain apps.</p><p>Holochain enables direct interaction. With Holochain, you act truly peer-to-peer, free from intermediaries except those you freely choose. You and your actions write directly to the ledger of events, and you share only share with the network what you have agreed to share according to the terms of whichever apps you have freely chosen to participate in. You represent yourself, rather than being subject to representation by central authorities like legislators, miners, stakers, or even internet service providers.</p><p>Direct interaction also means that Holochain functions on any network. It can operate through the internet (TCP/IP) but doesn’t require it; apps can just as easily operate on mesh networks or even local area networks, Bluetooth networks, or any other means of communicating data among peers. Even when offline from the larger network of app users, a subgroup of connected peers can run the app with full functionality among themselves (since everyone hosts a copy of the core application code) and synchronize their changes with the network later.</p><p>Holochain enables groups of any size, whether 2 people or 2 billion people, to operate on a shared set of agreements. Most blockchains have problems at the low end, requiring hundreds if not thousands of players before there is enough of a distributed consensus mechanism to prevent attacks by a majority of nodes. And so far, blockchain-based dApps (decentralized applications) haven’t demonstrated much of an ability to scale beyond <a href="https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings">a few thousand active users</a>, suggesting they may have problems at the high end too. For a carrier to be unenclosable, it’s important that any number of people can interact and mutually enforce the integrity of the space they’re participating in.</p><p>Holochain is free to use. Since all users host themselves on Holochain, there is no need for costly central hosting infrastructure as there is in web apps, nor any need to pay tax-like ‘gas’ fees to miners or stakers to run the network as there is in blockchain apps. Each peer carries a bit of extra load to store and validate a portion of the information that’s distributed to the group. Any fees that occur in Holochain apps are chosen and mutually enforced by those freely participating within a given app space, with no revenues skimmed by the network.</p><p>(Holochain is not to be confused with Holo, which is an optional, peer-to-peer hosting framework that enables users who are not hosting themselves to access Holochain apps through a web browser.)</p>Virtually all of today’s web and blockchain apps could be improved in some way by shifting to unenclosability and peer-to-peer infrastructure. What You Can Do with It <p>In <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2</a>, we imagined how applications built on an unenclosable carrier like Holochain could have game-changing effects on our food supply, energy infrastructure, financial systems, and natural ecosystems. But virtually all of today’s web and blockchain apps could be improved in some way by shifting to unenclosability and peer-to-peer infrastructure.</p><p>Consider:</p>  An agent-centric social network, intrinsically proofed against centralized surveillance and the selling of data to advertisers, with content-ranking algorithms that serve the common good – or your own individual preferences – not the interests of an enclosing corporation.  A self-hosted community chat, similar to WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, where freedom-of-speech policies can be implemented by the communities themselves according to mutually-agreed rulesets, not imposed by a centrally controlled software company that is subject to all sorts of economic and political pressures.  A self-hosted team chat, similar to Slack, that doesn’t share your data with a corporate entity, works asynchronously and can be used offline, and operates without infrastructure costs. (<a href="https://elemental-chat.holo.host/">Elemental Chat</a> is currently live as a proof-of-concept.)  A rideshare system, similar to Uber and Lyft, that eliminates most of the hosting costs and corporate overhead that is currently paid by riders and drivers. Rideshare networks could even be owned collectively by drivers, with relatively small fees paid to a software provider that could serve hundreds or thousands of driver collectives. Rides could become more affordable even as drivers are paid more. And bonus: rider locations would never be visible to a corporate entity.  A knowledge base like Wikipedia that is collectively held by the people who use it.  A media-sharing platform like Spotify or YouTube that could reinvent revenue-sharing models from the ground up, without the layers of royalties paid to ‘distributors’. For example, what if subscribers of a given artist actually participated in hosting music for others to stream, with those gains being partly retained by the artists and partly cycled back to the fans as rewards in some form or other?  A document-editing system similar to Google Docs that is truly private, not vulnerable to observation by anyone who might gain (or already have) access to Google’s centralized databases.  A system for peer-reviewing scientific articles that could replace expensive scholarly journals while promoting more diversity of thought.  A tamper-proof election system: an immutable, crypto-signed voting system in which any voter is able to verify that their vote was accurately included.  <p>Or imagine (or build upon!) these more innovative possibilities:</p>  A location-sharing app (like a <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Weasley_Clock">Weasley clock</a>, for Harry Potter fans), where your information is shared only with family and friends you choose, not exposed to companies or governments.  A medical data repository where you are in charge of your data and can grant access to providers – and to trusted family members – so that they are able to provide information in cases of emergency.  A neutral layer for sense-making that sits atop the web, enabling people to associate into networks and then comment on, share, and discuss the information they find online.  A simplified supply-chain system: Cross-organizational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources,_events,_agents_(accounting_model)">REA accounting</a> where digitally signed payments become the accounting entry for both parties in their ledger history. An immutable, easily-auditable, self-populating accounting framework that streamlines compliance with contracts and regulations.  <p>(By the way, in case you’re wondering whether blockchain technology could support some of the same ideas: probably not most of them, due to its <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">limitations around speed and cost of storage</a>.)</p><p>And building on Holochain doesn’t mean sacrificing profitability. You can't make money by controlling data, but there are lots of other ways of earning a profit. In fact, most Web-2.0 revenue models still work for Holochain apps, including:<br>- ‘Software as a subscription’ (Saas), with or without a free trial<br>- ‘Freemium’ in which a free version remains functional while subscribers get upgraded features<br>- Service fees, like on Airbnb or Uber<br>- Fees for hosting data, like on Dropbox or Gmail<br>- Sponsorships from service providers relevant to the audience<br>- Promoted listings by item sellers or service providers, like on Amazon and eBay<br>- Donations, like on Wikipedia</p><p>The only Web-2.0 model that doesn’t work, really, is the one that many people today find the most distasteful: surveillance-driven advertising, in which a company collects personal information or tracks user activity, then uses that information to either sell targeted advertising on its platform or straight-up sell the data to advertisers.</p><p>So, what’s different about a Holochain-based social network versus Facebook or Instagram isn’t that the Holochain version is more philanthropic; it’s (1) the choice that people have in how to interact with one another and with the application, (2) the ownership and authorship that people retain over their own data, and (3) the decreased infrastructural costs because the load of running the software and hosting the data is spread across the user base.</p><p>Of course, for people that do want to create hApps just for the common good and not for profit, Holochain makes that easier because the infrastructure costs are so low. Maybe you want to set up a reputation-enabled child-care directory because you want easier, safer access to reliable babysitters and nannies in your neighborhood, not because you want to make money. You can do that without needing to configure, manage, or pay for servers, plus Holochain’s developer tools simplify app development (more on those in a bit). Then if your application happens to become a big success, it can scale on Holochain without adding cost, and you could choose to adopt a business model at that time.</p> Why All of This Matters (a Recap) <p>Today, a single person’s message can reach billions of people in seconds. This phenomenon, which would have been unfathomable to prehistoric humans, exists thanks to a progression of carrier technologies that have emerged over thousands of years, including written records, the printing press, sound amplification and recording, radio, television, film and, more recently, the internet, email, and social media. These developments have unleashed tremendous human coordination, but, as a side effect, we have surrendered covert power to those who control the carriers, enabling them to decide what gets transmitted and how we interact with each other.</p><p>Our mainstream monetary systems are examples of carrier enclosure, too, since they empower governments and financial institutions to say what counts as legitimate currency and trade, as well as to make fiscal policies that affect the behavior of our currencies. Blockchain technology commendably turns over the job of legitimizing transactions to a ‘decentralized’ consensus network, but it still converges to the same side effect, simply replacing governments and corporations with people who control computing power and cryptotokens. A system that is unenclosable is not just decentralized; it cannot ever be centralized.</p><p>Over the centuries, the power and wealth differentials have become so extreme that instead of a level economic playing field we have a steep mountainside that most people aren’t able to climb. (We explored some of these imbalances and their consequences in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2 of this series</a>.) When disproportionately powerful people (understandably) act in their own interest, it often comes at the expense of the greater good. This is why many of humanity’s greatest challenges — rainforest destruction, pollution and climate instability, food supply degradation, the looming energy crisis, and so on — won’t be solved at the levels of policy or diplomacy, but only by shifting the underlying architectures that determine how wealth and power are allocated and how people are incentivized to act.</p><p>The good news is that such a shift is technologically possible in ways it hasn’t been before. Suddenly, at the outset of the 2020s and for the first time in history, we are now able to build communication and transaction systems that let us have it both ways: capacity for massive scale and freedom from the power distortions of enclosability. What is available, and what we must undertake, is a proliferation of new forms of social organizing so expansive that it deserves to be named analogously to the Cambrian Explosion of new biological organisms. We call it the Holocene Explosion, after the current geological epoch.</p><p>Designed as a carrier for this Explosion, Holochain preserves individual sovereignty by giving all agents the power to represent themselves in all interactions, and to voluntarily enter (or not) into spaces where mutually agreed-upon rules are mutually enforced. If someone comes to have broader influence than someone else, it’s not because of carrier control, but because that person has gained capabilities according to rules voluntarily opted-into by the people participating in that app space. If anyone doesn’t like the rules of a given space, they are free to leave and join or start another, and since they own their data, they can take it with them.</p> Holochain is the spark. You are the flame. <p>It’s come time to close out this series, and we’ve considered a number of ways of doing so. What haven’t we said, we asked ourselves, that still ought to be said?</p><p>We considered getting into how scalable Holochain apps are – how easily they can accommodate millions or billions of users because everyone shares in the work of writing and storing data. Or how fast they are – how they enable virtually-real-time interaction. These are actually key reasons, beyond unenclosability, that Holochain may be more suitable than blockchain for real-world collaborative applications. But we covered these topics in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">Holochain-blockchain comparison</a> we published recently, so you can go there if you want to learn more about them.</p><p>We also considered talking about how a truly unenclosable, peer-to-peer future implies a truly peer-to-peer internet, completely replacing the existing one. But this seems like a story for another time.</p><p>We have said – but it's probably worth reiterating – that we can only speculate about what new social forms will emerge through the Holocene Explosion (see <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2</a>). We’ve also said, or at least implied, that Holochain’s architects don’t claim to fully know how it will be used in the future: the idea in designing it was not to build a whole bunch of new social patterns, but rather to build a framework for new social patterns. This means that the list of possible Holochain apps we shared earlier is truly partial; it’s likely that the most profound and transformative uses for the framework will only emerge over time. (Even within the apps we listed earlier, the most transformative features are TBD: novel incentive systems, governance systems, currency designs, and so on, yet to be invented.)</p><p>We have also said that what makes Holochain so suitable for rapid evolution is its unenclosable nature: Holochain is peer-to-peer, agent-centric, free to use, and able to operate on any transport protocol (even without the existing internet). From <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Part 1 of this series</a>: “With free association and forkability in place, an evolutionary phenomenon emerges: the spaces themselves, each with their own patterns and protocols, enter into a process of natural selection. The ones that solve problems better or serve people better will gain greater adoption, while the ones that don’t do as good a job will die off.”</p><p>If there’s one more aspect of Holochain worth mentioning, it might be how Holochain the project (distinct from Holochain the framework) is building an ecosystem to foster experimentation and iteration. Creating a truly optimized evolutionary space isn’t just a matter of building the right core technology; it’s a matter of making that technology as easy to utilize as possible. To that end, Holochain the project is creating:</p>  Dev tools: A suite of developer tools designed to make it easy to build with Holochain, including a “RAD” (Rapid Application Development) suite that streamlines common functions into essentially drag-and-drop actions.  A DevHub: a Holochain application that functions like a decentralized Github for sharing developer resources: modules, applications, and user-interface components. Developers can draw from these resources to mash up new apps from existing elements, and to collaborate on and review code.  A hApp Store: a Holochain application where people can browse or search for Holochain apps, complete with end-user ratings and reviews.  <p>Lowering the barrier to development increases Holochain’s composability, which means how easy it is to mix and match elements – with one another, as well as with whatever outside elements that the technology needs to interact with. Composability also encompasses cost-efficiency of new application development and making updates to existing software.</p><p>(Fixing a bug or making an update is a particular challenge in blockchain-based dApps, where the smart contracts are immutable once live – and already have assets connected to them! It’s notoriously nerve-wracking for blockchain devs to push to mainnet because there’s no way to revise live code the way there is in centralized apps.)</p><p>The lower the cost and risk of change, the more participation in creating change, and the faster the change. And rapid change is what we need to keep up with the pace of change in the world, and to address the problems we’re facing on the timeline we need to address them.</p> A Complex Technology for a Complex World <p>In one sense, Holochain is quite a simple piece of software: it’s a lightweight framework that allows people to create and share data in a way that ensures accuracy without relying on concentrated power-brokers. It’s not an application layer in and of itself, and it’s highly neutral as to the kinds of applications that are built with it. And it’s unburdened by many of the complications of web2 (where data is subject to centralized control, surveillance, censorship, and points of failure) or early web3 (where global consensus mechanisms and massive data replication result in high computing costs and slow processing).</p><p>In another sense, though, Holochain is highly complex: there’s actually a lot of technology that goes into ensuring data integrity without centralized components. This is partly because Holochain is a networking system, and any networking system has to deal with many ‘states’ of data (across many computers) by either updating them all together or otherwise integrating them with one another. But it’s also because Holochain doesn’t force the network into a universally shared state (which would result in enclosure points) but rather enables massive simultaneity of perspectives. Everyone in a Holochain application space represents their own record, yet all the records remain tamper-proof. If that sounds like a complex challenge, you’re on the right track. It’s no wonder Holochain has only recently become ready for prime time, after years of work.</p><p>And yet, nothing less complex would map to the problem space Holochain is designed to address. Global challenges are interrelated and multi-faceted in their causes and effects, so they require interrelated and multi-faceted solutions. You can’t solve the energy crisis, pollution, deforestation, or hunger with centralized systems – or, as it turns out, with blockchain tokenization – any more than you can fix a meadow with a hammer. Matters have gotten out of hand precisely because we have been force-fitting living systems through power-entrenching enclosure points for centuries.</p><p>What is required is a radical, widespread shift away from extractive economics and toward regenerative economics, yet the power imbalances we’ve created over time perpetuate the cycle of extractive power. This is why we maintain that Holochain or something like it is a necessary foundation for saving the world.</p><p>The technological capacity to have built Holochain, and now Holochain itself, have come along not a moment too soon. Now we just need to put it to work.</p>

<p>All communication relies on one or more carriers. At the most basic level, when you’re speaking to a group of people in a room, the air is the carrier for the sound waves moving through it. You pass air through your vocal chords and shape your mouth in funny ways, and a bunch of compression waves emerge and fill the room with information that others then decode. No one can just grab the words out of the air to stop them from reaching someone else. The carrier is unenclosable.</p><p>For the sake of contrast, let’s say your boss puts out a suggestion box, in order to give you and your fellow employees the opportunity to make a difference in the workplace. Sounds nice, right? And yet, the box is enclosed; there’s no way to see how many suggestions have been made, or which ones have been discarded before even reaching the people who could implement them. The system includes a filtering mechanism that allocates some degree of control to whoever is in charge of the box. And isn’t the suggestion box system designed, in part, to enable that layer of control? If they didn’t want the ability to filter, they might have just invited suggestions openly during a meeting with everyone present.</p> A Brief History of Communication <p>Before modern technology, or really before the development of written language, communication was generally transmitted by unenclosable carrier. Oral traditions were the norm in prehistoric times, and they are preserved today in indigenous cultures around the world — cultures we often respect for their ways of reaching alignment quickly, resolving tensions directly, and treating their members with honor. (Consider our postmodern fascination with the talking stick and council of elders.) This social wisdom is surely related to the unenclosable medium of communication they used.</p><p>The point at which direct oral communication reaches its limits is the point at which it becomes important to communicate at scale, across distance or time. Want to rally a crowd? You’ll need amplification. Want to coordinate troops in the field? You’ll need some form of written communication. Want to operate a nation or empire? You’ll need carriers of all different sorts: messengers, letters, telegraphs, whatever.</p><p>And yet, all of the carriers we have successfully used to extend the reach of communication have also introduced more potential for enclosure, which in turn has led to power imbalances. Writing gave rise to the literate class, the clerical class, who by virtue of privilege or position suddenly had outsize power, with access to libraries and information and the ability to make deals or even laws that others couldn’t understand without the help of the literate. The printing press gave rise to the editors, publishers, and booksellers who determined which books were published or promoted. Broadcast media gave rise to the media empires who could then influence what was broadcast. The ability to control the carrier results in the ability to control the message.</p> Covert and Overt Control <p>What’s actually true about oral cultures is not that control over messaging is impossible, but rather that the available control mechanisms are more overt. You can stop someone from speaking up around a fire if you physically attack them or try to shout over them. But then everyone knows you’re doing that, which means that your actions are subject to whatever social feedback mechanisms exist to temper abuses of power. So, really, what carrier enclosure gives rise to is covert power. The manager filtering the suggestion box; the allocation of FM bandwidth to someone over someone else; the private understandings between interest groups and politicians.</p>Really, what carrier enclosure gives rise to is covert power. Awash in Enclosable Carriers <p>As the speed and scale of communication has increased, so have the layers of enclosable carriers on which our communication relies. In newsprint and on television, it’s the advertisers, as well as executives who are bound to the interests of boards and shareholders, who exert (largely unseen) control over the content we receive. Our phone lines are subject to a variety of costs, controls, and oversights that we don’t have much of a choice about. Even getting on a plane (or flying one’s own) to a distant land — which is another way to communicate across distances — is highly constrained by licenses, airspaces, borders, passports, airport fees, and so on.</p><p>And of course we have the internet, which has given us a taste of radical participation and democratized access to information, but whose filters on access and information have begun to cause increasing alarm. There are centralized entities controlling the allocation of web addresses, domain names, and root servers. ISPs have the ability to block access to the internet altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and the like decide what content is inappropriate, and, perhaps more importantly, what content appears in your feeds. Amazon determines which products you can use the convenience of its site to buy, as well as which to promote. And, of course, Google steers you to some web sites over others, according to its secret algorithms.</p><p>Our ability to coordinate activity at scale has never been greater, but that coordination is also subject to centralized control and corruption like never before — and really to an unknown degree, because it is largely covert. Do we have any way of knowing the extent of Russian influence on recent U.S. elections? We don’t. We also don’t know the degree to which our ‘real’ news is adulterated and filtered, which is part of what makes fake news such an intractable problem: when all news is vulnerable to corruption to some degree, it’s hard to tell the difference between legitimate and falsified sources.</p><p>If we want to move into an era of intelligent, mutually beneficial, worldwide coordination, we will have to address the problem of communication enclosures. But first, a word about money.</p> The Enclosability of Money <p>Monetary systems are special cases when it comes to enclosability and covert control. We all have the capacity to produce value, but we have allowed our exchange of value to be mediated through money, which we’re not allowed to produce. (If we do, it’s called counterfeiting.) The few who are allowed to issue money use that privilege to constrain our participation in the marketplace.</p><p>In principle, a financial transaction could be as simple as two people exchanging value through a direct agreement, but in our world of enclosable carriers, transactions are controlled by many third parties that we don’t get to choose.</p><p>By way of example, let’s look at transacting through PayPal, which claims to offer peer-to-peer payments to ‘anyone with an email address’. But if you want to pay your friend for something, you’re subject to many layers of control you cannot opt out of:</p>  You must connect to the internet via a semi-monopoly of telcos/ISPs.  The connection must supply an IP address, which is under the control of ICANN, the international body that delegates ranges of addresses to specific licensees of their choosing.  You need to establish an HTTPS connection, which requires certificates issued by a root authority.  Your email must be routed to and stored on an email server, which is typically not under your control.  The email address uses a domain name, which is subject to central control via ICANN, domain registrars, root servers, and nameservers.  You must go through the PayPal app or website, which is under their corporate control (as well as all the aforementioned domain handlers and routers).  Your PayPal account must be active and in good standing, at their discretion.  You transact in a currency, whether dollars, euros, or yen, that is fundamentally out of your control. Governments can freeze accounts, limit international transactions, and garnish wages, not to mention influence the money supply in ways that affect what your currency is worth.  You use a central payment source, such as a bank or credit card, that can reverse transactions, charge fees, block access, and close accounts.  <p>Does that sound like peers interacting directly with each other? Or does it sound like a bunch of people got invited to your party who you’d have preferred to leave out of the mix?</p> But What About My Favorite Blockchain Project? <p>And so we come to the blockchain and, more broadly, the whole decentralization movement. If you’re a participant in this ecosystem, you might be thinking that blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications, at least the ‘best’ ones, are precisely the antidote to the problem of carrier enclosability.</p><p>It’s true that blockchain applications have, in many cases at least, offered an exciting means of collaborating outside the reach of outsized government and corporate middlemen. But how unenclosable are they really? Blockchain protocols all rely on some mechanism of global consensus to determine which transactions are considered legitimate enough to be added to the shared record. This means that many nodes – computers on a given network – must agree with one another before officially adopting any information, then storing it as a global state, meaning that all nodes hold all the same data. It’s an understandable approach: replicating data globally might seem like the only way to coordinate at scale without being subject to centralized authority or being susceptible to data-tampering.</p><p>One problem with this approach, though, is that global consensus mechanisms turn out to be a form of carrier enclosure, since they necessarily give power to some people over others to determine the legitimacy of transactions. Ordinary users like you and me do not write directly to the blockchain, nor do we participate in the consensus mechanism that results in data being written to the blockchain. We defer to miners and stakers do those things on our behalf, and in doing so we turn over our authority to them to say what’s written to the record.</p><p>What’s more, not all miners and stakers have equal power. In proof-of-work (PoW) protocols, those who own more computing resources have more say. In proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, which have become more popular in recent years, those who put up more money as betting stakes have more say. The more computing resources or the more betting stakes you own, the more money you make, which earns you the ability to buy more of those things. Thus, both protocols have a rich-get-richer effect and converge toward greater and greater consolidation of wealth and power over time.</p><p>Even more carrier enclosure has resulted from blockchain’s attempts to solve its efficiency problems. It turns out that achieving global consensus and managing global state require a tremendous amount of processing power and storage capacity, resulting in wait times and fees for every transaction, as well as <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">posing an obstacle to blockchain’s ability to scale to the needs of real-world challenges</a>. Blockchains and blockchain-related projects have tried to address these issues in various ways: so-called ‘layer-1’ solutions attempt to increase the efficiency of global consensus, generally by concentrating authority to some nodes more than others in determining the global state (EOS has 21 ‘block producers’, Cardano has ‘slot leaders’ and ‘pool representatives’, and TRON has 27 ‘super representatives’), while ‘layer-2’ solutions perform computations or store data off-chain on more centralized networks or more concentrated ‘side chains’, then periodically merge records into the blockchain. Both layer-1 and layer-2 solutions channel control through an increasingly narrow club of authorized representatives who are empowered to accept (or refuse) our transaction.</p><p>And real communication enclosures can happen and have happened in blockchain projects. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">Ethereum hard fork in 2016</a>, right-minded as it may have been, was a means of invalidating transactions that had occurred. EOS has also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-reverses-previously-confirmed-transactions-as-pundits-decry-centralization">reversed transactions</a>, as has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cash-miners-undo-attackers-transactions-with-51-attack">Bitcoin Cash</a>.</p><p>So, even though the very intention of many blockchain projects is to address intermediation and the centralization of power, they are actually subject to the same kinds of power imbalances we see in other mediums. It’s a tilted playing field, and even a slightly tilted playing field results in a <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/blockchain-blind-spots-1904d490218d">self-reinforcing feedback loop</a> that eventually leads to massive wealth imbalances – which is a fair narrative for what’s happened in economies around the world over the course of the last 500 years.</p><p>So we’re back to our original question: is it possible to have a system of communicating and transacting that 1) is truly unenclosable and 2) is capable of massive scale?</p> Having It Both Ways <p>In considering how a communication system might be both unenclosable and scalable, let’s look at the evolution of language itself. How does language arise? Who gets to change the rules of language? We do. Any one of us can create a new word, turn of phrase, or other language pattern that may or may not spread based upon whether others freely adopt it. If it spreads far enough, it becomes part of a language. There is no central committee that determines what you can say or not, or what gets adopted or not.</p>A new ecosystem of communication might look something like the spaces of language itself.<p>So, a new ecosystem of communication might look something like the spaces of language itself. We can imagine a scenario in which anyone can spin up new protocols for interacting — protocols that can be voluntarily adopted by those who choose to participate in them. Anyone is free to transfer the rulesets of any given space into another space, just as anyone is free to populate an uninhabited island, start speaking any particular language there, and invent new words.</p><p>This does not mean an absence of rules. Protocols are essential within any given space for filtering signal from noise, and to avoid the gaming of that space. People need to be free to create any kind of space on the network, but that doesn’t mean that all the activities within voluntarily joined spaces must also be unrestricted. To continue with our analogy: maybe on a certain island there’s a protocol that new residents introduce themselves at a weekly meeting, or post a bio on a bulletin board or profile page. Maybe there’s a social norm not to interrupt one another at certain meetings, and there might be corrective protocols activated if someone repeatedly violates that norm. Notice, though, that these rulesets only pertain to the particular scope of this island (which people can choose to join or not), rather than being built into the language itself or governing migration among islands in general.</p><p>So, one key ingredient in making any system fundamentally unenclosable is free association: the ability for anyone to create segmented spaces that people can join or not, with rulesets that are particular to those spaces. An unenclosable version of Wikipedia would be free of the centralized servers that host the data today, but it would still have protocols that say how articles are written. An unenclosable version of Twitter would still have a character limit. It wouldn’t make sense for someone to be able to post a tweet on Wikipedia or an encyclopedic article on Twitter. Within the scope of each app, people are free to express themselves according to the parameters they opted into when joining the app.</p><p>Many apps will even need to have centralized aspects of control, such as moderation by individuals or groups. But if the underlying carrier system is unenclosable, everyone owns and controls their own data (versus having it held in centralized or third-party enclosure points), so everyone always has the option of leaving the application space for any reason, including if they don’t like some new rule or the way the space is being moderated.</p><p>Which leads us to another fundamental aspect of an unenclosable system: forkability, which is the freedom for anyone to spin up alternative application spaces, based on the same (or similar) source codes and rulesets, and invite people to the new version. For true forkability, users need to be able to migrate easily between versions, taking their data from one version — such as their complete activity history on a social network or search engine — and load it into the new version. This is, of course, very much not the case with the likes of today’s Facebook and Google, who own and control your data, making only a fraction of it available to you.</p> A Natural Selection <p>With free association and forkability in place, an evolutionary phenomenon emerges: the spaces themselves, each with their own patterns and protocols, enter into a process of natural selection. The ones that solve problems better or serve people better will gain greater adoption, while the ones that don’t do as good a job will die off. To return to the island analogy again: if people can move freely between islands, bringing language patterns from one to the other, the dialects that are most suitable to people’s needs will be the ones that thrive and spread.</p>With free association and forkability in place, an evolutionary phenomenon emerges. Holochain Is Unenclosable by Design <p>Holochain is designed to foster this kind of evolution. It’s a framework for building and running applications in a truly peer-to-peer way, with zero centralized infrastructure and therefore no vulnerability to corruption over time. Wealth and influence can still flow within the application spaces according to patterns mutually agreed to within those spaces: reputation systems, ownership systems, subscriptions, sales, badges, degrees, or whatever else makes sense for the nature of the application. But no one can gain influence by simply controlling the medium of communication itself. The work of holding and transferring the data is distributed among the regular participants within the application, with everyone hosting their own data and sharing a bit of the load of hosting the data published to the network. Same thing with the work of validating data, such as verifying account balances or making sure posts conform to formatting rules: that job is also spread equally among the regular participants within the application.</p><p>And in case you don’t like the rulesets of a given application space, Holochain guarantees, through a combination of technical and legal provisions, that you can spin up alternatives and take your data with you between applications.</p><p>(We get deeper into how Holochain works in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unleashing-the-power-of-unenclosable-carriers-and-how-holochain-can-help/">Part 3 of this series</a>.)</p> The Future of Communication	 <p>What becomes possible in a world of unenclosable carriers isn’t just better versions of Twitter or Wikipedia. It’s an explosion of entirely new ways of collaborating and transacting whose forms we can only begin to guess at. What might be possible if we didn’t have corporations, governments, or surveillance systems in the middle of our communication? Could a system of unenclosable carriers help us solve some of humanity’s most intractable problems? We turn to this very question in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2 of this series</a>.</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce that the <a href="https://xinfin.org/">XDC Network</a> is integrating GlobaliD, one of the first DeFi projects to leverage GlobaliD’s decentralized identity solution.</p><p>The XDC Network is a hybrid, enterprise-ready blockchain with public and private architecture and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine&nbsp;(EVM).</p><p>DeFi or decentralized finance experienced explosive growth in 2021 with volume growing 912 percent year on year, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/crypto-scammers-took-a-record-14-billion-in-2021-chainalysis.html">according to Chainalysis data</a>. At GlobaliD, we see DeFi as a core pillar to the future of web3 with the potential to democratize finance.</p><p>That massive growth has also shone a light on issues such as fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing.</p><p>Money laundering spiked 30 percent in 2021, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">according to Chainalysis</a>, with DeFi protocols receiving $900 million from illicit addresses.</p><p>DeFi projects typically rely on non-custodial wallets that aren’t tied to an identity and forgo KYC (know your customer) protocols altogether. Part of the issue is that relying on traditional identity frameworks undermines the decentralized vision for DeFi. Ignoring those procedures has driven DeFi’s frenetic growth, but it’s also attracting increasing attention from regulators.</p><p>SEC chief Gary Gensler has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">stated on more than one occasion</a> that projects are still required to follow relevant regulations — no matter how “decentralized” they&nbsp;are.</p><p>Allowing any unidentified wallet to connect to and participate with the platform also opens DeFi projects up to bot attacks and bad&nbsp;actors.</p><p>This is where the natural symbiosis between decentralized finance and decentralized identity comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>GlobaliD’s self-sovereign identity solution allows DeFi projects to address their identity needs while maintaining the decentralized spirit of their&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Meanwhile, DeFi users used to being anonymous or pseudonymous can rest easy knowing that they control their digital identity, and that no one — including GlobaliD — can access their encrypted data without their permission.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/why-self-sovereign-identity-matters-8fd2c982ca2e">Why self-sovereign identity&nbsp;matters</a>  <p>From the XDC Network press&nbsp;release:</p><blockquote>As Layer 1 networks, like XDC Network, continue to roll out mainstream solutions, there is an increasing need for users to be able to bridge identity with on-chain solutions for fast and secure verification. This is where the GlobaliD integration can address today’s identification challenges by providing self-sovereign ID (SSI) for passwordless login to XDC Network’s leading dApps, protecting users from bots, scams, and bad actors. By combining GlobaliD’s reliable, trusted SSI with the XDC Network’s array of decentralized finance (DeFi) and dApps services, users now have a more safe and secure way to access XDC’s growing web3 ecosystem with a pathway for regulatory compliance.</blockquote><p>And here’s Billy Sebell, Head of Ecosystem Development for the XDC&nbsp;Network:</p><blockquote>As Web3 matures, enabling users to roam across networks without constant identification holdups is going to be crucial. Mainstream users shouldn’t have to understand the complexities of safe IDs and network bridging — nor should they bear the responsibility of complex identity management. Integrating GlobaliD with our new XDC Observatory creates the foundation for a streamlined user experience and represents a big step forward towards chain interoperability</blockquote><p>GlobaliD users will also have access to a brand new feature called the XDC Observatory, a block explorer that enhances data management and accessibility on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>This integration with XDC Network and DeFi is just the beginning at GlobaliD.

 GiD Report#198 — How stablecoins break the monetary&nbsp;system <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-197-how-solana-makes-web3-possible-24a8acc23a96">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  How stablecoins break the monetary&nbsp;system  When regulators get it&nbsp;right  9 things you need to know about&nbsp;web3  This week in&nbsp;Solana  Tweet of the week — Wormhole&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. How stablecoins break the monetary&nbsp;system Image: Sefa&nbsp;Ozel<p>When people think of money printing, they typically think of central banks like the Federal&nbsp;Reserve.</p><p>But outside of extreme circumstances such as quantitative easing in response to once in a generation disasters like the financial crisis in 2008 and the recent global pandemic, the Fed has historically outsourced the creation of money to&nbsp;banks.</p><p>Which makes sense. Banks have branches and customers. They have closer ties to the community. Banks are better positioned to understand where new money should&nbsp;go.</p><p>It’s a way to decentralize money creation.</p><p>That new money is created through a process called fractional reserve banking, which is really just a fancy term for how really boring banking works. Banks take in deposits. They also lend money. The amount of money they lend is greater than the number of deposits they take in — hence, their reserves are only a fraction of their&nbsp;lending.</p><p>When banks lend out more money than they have, they’re essentially creating new money out of thin&nbsp;air.</p><p>The Fed is generally happy with this system. It’s also why they’re worried about stablecoins. Unlike fractional reserve banking, many stablecoins are set up with 1-to-1 reserves. That’s not an issue in and of itself — some people prefer their coins to be&nbsp;stable.</p><p>The problem is the potential impact on the rest of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-02-01/hedge-funds-are-a-job-now">Matt Levine</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a>):</p><blockquote>A less obvious risk of stablecoins is that they might be too stable. A stablecoin is, among other things, a substitute for putting money in a bank. Banks are generally very safe places to put money, but they are not perfectly safe. There can be runs on banks; banks can fail. For most U.S. retail bank accounts this is not a very salient problem, since they are backed by government deposit insurance, but many large institutional pools of money (corporate cash accounts, money-market funds, etc.) park their money in short-term bank instruments and are sensitive to risk. If a bank gets riskier, it will lose deposits. And if a stablecoin is so stable that it is safer than a bank, then banks generally will lose deposits.</blockquote><blockquote>Why is this a risk? Well, banks do useful stuff. Classically, they take people’s deposits and lend them out to other people to start businesses and buy homes. The provision of credit by banks helps the economy grow. More to the point, the withdrawal of credit by banks hurts the economy, and the risk here is wrong-way. If people get nervous about banks and pull out all their money to put it in safer stablecoins, then (1) that will probably happen at a time when the economy is shaky and (2) that will definitely make the economy shakier. The bulk of the response to the 2008 financial crisis involved preventing runs on banks, because those would have made all of the problems of the crisis much&nbsp;worse.</blockquote><p>In other words, the existence of stablecoins could potentially exacerbate a retreat in money supply during economic downturns. It would also generally undermine the way modern money&nbsp;works.</p><p>Adding fuel to the fire are the returns being offered for stablecoins on certain platforms, which far exceeds what you’d get with a typical bank savings&nbsp;account.</p><p>(On the other hand, the world’s biggest stablecoin, Tether, doesn’t <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">appear all that&nbsp;stable</a>.)</p><p>Of course, none of these means that we should be writing off stablecoins. It just means there’s plenty to consider in the context of what this means for our monetary system going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>(The U.S. Senate will be looking at just that next week in <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/132540/us-senate-slates-hearing-on-stablecoins-for-february-15">a hearing scheduled to discuss stablecoins</a>.)</p><p>As Matt&nbsp;adds:</p><blockquote>I should say here that my sympathies are with the Fed researchers: I think that fractional reserve banking and credit intermediation are good, and accidentally getting rid of them would be bad. But I am also aware that lots of crypto people disagree; they got into crypto specifically because they are suspicious of the existing financial system and of fractional reserve banking. And while “U.S. regulators want to crack down on crypto to protect banks” sounds a bit like a conspiracy theory, it has some truth to&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— Matt Levine: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-02-01/hedge-funds-are-a-job-now">Hedge Funds Are a Job&nbsp;Now</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/132540/us-senate-slates-hearing-on-stablecoins-for-february-15">US Senate slates hearing on stablecoins for February&nbsp;15</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/31/silvergate-bank-confirms-diem-tech-acquisition/">Diem Confirms Shutdown as Silvergate Acquires the Project’s Assets</a>   2.

Naturally, it’s from an Ethereum-centric perspective, but the high level points are&nbsp;good:</p>  Web3 is the new trendy name for the decentralized web.  Web1 is read-only, Web2 is read-write, Web3 is read-write-own.  Web3 is a money layer for the internet.  Web3 is an identity layer for the internet.  Web3 is a reaction to social networks not keeping our data secure, and selling it for their own&nbsp;profit.  Web3 is a way for artists and creators to not only own what they produce on a platform, but the platform&nbsp;itself.  Web3 is a new patron model for the internet.  Web3 makes it easy to set up cooperative ownership and governance structures.  Web3 is still not entirely decentralized.  <p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-web3-here-are-some-ways-to-explain-it-to-a-friend/">What is Web3?

MetaMUI 5.0 implemented a new feature “Coin Burn&nbsp;Feature”<p>We are delighted to announce that MetaMUI 5.0 is now officially live.</p><p>MetaMUI, the world’s first identity-based blockchain, successfully upgraded its version to 5.0 on February 7th. When the genesis block of MetaMUI Blockchain was created at 12:00 PM(UTC+8) on January 3rd, 2021, the crypto community and media celebrated the commemoration of Bitcoin’s 12th anniversary.</p><p>Until now, MetaMUI team has implemeted 4 upgrades to its blockchain.</p><p>Here is a brief description of each&nbsp;upgrade.</p>  V 1.0 — MetaMUI Mainnet&nbsp;Launch  V 2.0 — Memo Feature&nbsp;added  V 3.0 — Code Rebasing &amp; Structural change  V 4.0 — VC and Tokens(CBDC) Pallet added / Updated DID Pallet to add Validation On-Chain  V 5.0 — Coin Burn Feature&nbsp;added  <p>In 5.0 version, 15,403,071.526791 MMUI coins were burned. MetaMUI team already mentioned in the previous post (<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/celebrating-the-1st-anniversary-of-the-metamui-mainnet-launch-18ddea251678">Celebrating the 1st anniversary of the MetaMUI mainnet launch!</a>) about this burning event.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>For anyone trying to keep up with “crypto” trends, good luck. Very often, articles and news around “crypto” lumps together everything that is futuristic about currency, investments and payments. As usual, the hype around new or trending concept leads to an overgeneralization of what that concept actually means. Organizations do need to decide what “crypto” means for their business, but they should be on their guard so as not to fall prey to a blind “crypto” craze. There is influence, risk, and legitimate business models to be found in the term “crypto”, but the first challenge is to understand it.</p>
 “Crypto” is a Misrepresentative Term 
<p>It’s first necessary to understand that “crypto” is a term that shouldn’t really be used to describe futuristic digital payments and currency systems. Its evolution is likely a short one, from cryptocurrency to cryptography. Cryptography, described at its simplest, is the mathematics of converting information into secrets. Cryptographic methods are used in some of the things that “crypto” tries to include: decentralized finance (DeFi), distributed ledger technology (DLT), cryptocurrencies (crypto), blockchain, Bitcoin, central bank digital currency (CBDC), and so on. Overall, “crypto” is an unsuccessful umbrella term for very different technological developments with very different risks, opportunities, and trajectories. A more suitable umbrella term for these terms could be Digital Currency, which has a wide enough definition to include the varying methods like cryptocurrency and stablecoins. The figure below lists a few of the terms most often lumped together under “crypto”, offers a very brief definition, and some of their distinctive features.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Terms Often Misrepresented by “Crypto”</p>
 Questions to Ask About Cryptocurrency 
<p>It’s worth it to keep these terms separate, but with an open eye for overarching trends. Cryptocurrency, for example, has plenty of people on edge. Cryptocurrency is intertwined with digital crime, ransomware being among the largest threats. Chainanalysis estimated that there was $14 billion worth of cryptocurrency lost to criminals in 2021, primarily from ransomware attacks, scams, and darkweb transactions. Concern is valid, as this is a <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/01/06/crypto-crime-all-time-high-2021/">79% increase over 2020</a>. But cryptocurrency should not just be a looming threat and risk to business, especially given that the overall volume of cryptocurrency transactions increased far more than criminal transactions did: <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">Chainanalysis also estimates</a> that legitimate cryptocurrency transactions reached $15 trillion in 2021, which is a 567% increase over 2020.&nbsp;Legitimate use of cryptocurrency is outpacing criminal use, and if cryptocurrency can ever get out of the speculative market there are strong opportunities for business.</p>
<p>These strong opportunities for business must be framed carefully. Cryptocurrencies in and of themselves don’t bring value to the business, but they can help to deliver business value. Their strengths lie in harnessing smart contracts to trigger payments only when certain required actions have been completed. Businesses should pay close attention to the ways that cryptocurrencies are stabilized to reduce their volatility. When this is achieved, the regulatory environment will be pressured to move quickly on issuing standards. The quickly evolving decentralized identity space will also play a role here, namely in enabling <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity">reusable, verifiable identities</a> for transacting parties. Pairing verifiable identities with cryptocurrency transactions may be a stabilizing factor for business transactions.</p>
<p>So how does the modern business reconcile itself with the astounding opportunities of a risky, crime-infused, and nonregulated technology? It begins with asking more questions:</p>
 
 What are the business models that align well with your business? 
 How do you move cryptocurrency from a private, peer-to-peer dominated space to enterprise functionality? 
 How do you separate the legitimate opportunities from risky, over speculative, or criminal use of cryptocurrency? 
 How do you secure cryptocurrencies (or do cryptocurrencies even need securing)? 
 Who can establish governance requirements and technology standards to enable successful leveraging of cryptocurrencies by enterprises? 
 
<p>Be on the lookout for future blog posts that consider these questions, and be sure to check the agenda of the European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC), coming up in May.</p>

<p>Munich, 08 February 2022, IDnow, a leading German provider for identity verification, will in future, enable every user to store their verified ID data locally on their smartphone in addition to their digital proof of vaccination in the luca app. This makes it possible to visit a restaurant, café or bar just by the luca app and without a manual ID check.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows the situation: you enter a restaurant and are asked for proof of vaccination. You pull out your mobile phone and have the QR code quickly at hand. Then the search for the wallet begins, as you must show your ID card. This annoying everyday problem will soon be a thing of the past. We are giving restaurants and other locations digital tools to work more efficiently and cost-effectively and to get back to pre-Corona levels more easily. In addition to the integration of payment services, this includes the uncomplicated ID solution that we are now providing with IDnow,” says Patrick Hennig, Managing Director of culture4life GmbH, operator of the luca app.</p>
<p>The reason for the ID check is the fact that the vaccination certificate, with whose QR code the digital proof of vaccination is generated, can also be scanned by other people. To avoid fraud, most state governments require the person to be matched by an ID document in addition to the vaccination certificate.</p>
<p>In the future, the luca app will digitize and simplify this process together with IDnow. luca users will soon be able to identify themselves once via the IDnow app and their digital identity will be stored locally on the smartphone. Within the luca app, the identity will be linked to the vaccination certificate. Only the identified person can check in at the restaurant using fingerprint or FaceID. This eliminates the need to show the ID card.</p>
<p>Technically, the identity is transmitted back to luca as so-called verifiable credentials from IDnow. The data is saved exclusively on the smartphone and encrypted with the help of the Secure Element. There is no central storage of the data. By storing the data locally, the user retains full control over his or her digital identity. From a data protection point of view, this approach is optimal because neither luca nor IDnow can access the data stored on the smartphone.</p>
<p>“With this use case, luca and IDnow are setting a positive example for the use of digital identities in everyday life. While the use of digital identities is already enjoying great popularity in other European countries, such as Belgium and Sweden, Germany is lagging behind. IDnow wants to change that and is already working with other partners on relevant use cases that use digital identity to simplify everyday situations.” Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and CTO of IDnow.</p>

 Navigating uncertainty — part&nbsp;2 <p>How three Swedish food actors coped during&nbsp;Covid-19</p><p>This is a series of two blog posts by Rapid Transition Lab, a collaboration between Stockholm Resilience Center, Dark Matter Labs, and Vinnova. <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/navigating-uncertainty-part-1-74029c9986d3">The first one</a> presents the findings from interviews with three Swedish food system actors. In this second post presents key learnings and further research.</p> Insights and takeaways <p>Based on the three cases presented in the last blog post, evidence shows that the pandemic opened up a critical ‘need for change’ for food system actors, since pre-existing operations were unable to function during parts of the crisis. The structure below outlines layers that enabled the transformational potential of each actor, along with different factors that helped them to shift and iterate their methods over&nbsp;time.</p>  Preparedness: Features of each actor that existed before the&nbsp;pandemic  Uncertainty: Emergent context with an uncertain time-frame that has a direct effect on the organization  Buffer: Cushions to reduce the emergent situation and enable a ‘softer landing’, eg., financial support for the organization  Trigger: Factor that creates space or opportunity for transformational potential  Transformational potential: Long-term strategic thinking and actions towards sustainable development  Layers of enablers for transformational potential © Rapid Transition Lab 1. Preparedness <p>Preparedness can be defined as a set of inherent organizational features each actor held before the pandemic. Depending on this foundational layer, actors were directly and indirectly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic to different extents, and so their responses were also unique. These features include actors’s defining mission[1], vision for the future[2], financial or growth strategy, network, organizational structure, or capabilities and knowledge built through experience. These features are embedded in their context and change over time, and are challenged during times of&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>All three cases revealed how financial security, such as external investors or savings, became crucial as preparedness during the crisis. But also, shared objectives and a shared belief in the vision for the future are the significant drivers that lead to secure investors and investment. For example, the shared trust in the mission that Karma experienced from their investors, gave them financial security. For Martin &amp; Servera, the owners’ belief in the long-term vision allowed them to proceed with investments towards sustainable development that were planned already before the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> 2. Uncertainty <p>Uncertainty became a critical aspect throughout the crisis period. Actors from all three cases had difficulties making decisions because they were uncertain of how long the pandemic would last, or for how long crisis packages would apply. For instance, after keeping the restaurant open for 9 months after the breakout, Debaser chose to fire all the staff and close the restaurant. When the stricter regulations were introduced, it was too hard for them to remain profitable while open. After all, the interviewee expressed a clear regret of firing all the staff, as if conditions concerning restrictions and support packages would have been known beforehand, they might have kept the staff temporarily furloughed instead.</p><p>On the other hand, uncertainty such as not knowing for how long the crisis would last could provoke actors to rethink and reinforce what the business wants to achieve in the longer term. Karma decided to expand the mission from reducing food waste to establishing a much broader mission: enabling the sustainable restaurant of the future. The restaurant (Debaser) has established a new strategic objective: to educate customers about the climate impact of food. Martin &amp; Servera kept their focus on their long-term goals despite the uncertainty, not letting it hinder them in achieving their strategic vision.</p><p>Uncertainty turned out to not only be a hindrance, but also a catalyst for change — without it, change in both operations and longer-term strategies might not have happened. In the face of unknown time-frames and uncertain conditions, actors were forced to act on what they believed to be the right decision in the present, using their existing core values or vision in order to act rapidly, and with some&nbsp;agility.</p> 3. Buffer <p>A buffer, in this case, can be thought of as a reserve that helps actors to better cope with a crisis, such as their financial security. In the three cases, the crisis package from the Swedish government provided a buffer of financial support to cover for lost income. It also gave companies the possibility to temporarily furlough staff with salary. Thus, the organization could keep the business running even if the company stopped making a profit. This assurance, in combination with existing financial savings or support from investors, unlocked certain triggering factors during the pandemic: the space to learn, self-reflect, experiment, and collaborate rapidly.</p> 4. Trigger <p>In face of the crisis and its consequent uncertainty, the actors managed to stay resilient due to their inherent preparedness in combination with external support (e.g. government packages). Triggers can be described as factors or actions which led actors to change their strategies and modes of operation in response to the altered context. From the above cases, these core triggers&nbsp;emerged:</p>  Rapid experimentation and immediate feedback  <p>Karma had an organizational culture that encouraged fast, small-scale experiments, in place well before Covid-19. This appetite for risk, in terms of trying new things, enabled them to experiment during the crisis, responding as conditions constantly changed. The actor launched two new services during this time, and the immediate feedback received helped them to make further strategic decisions, changing their service and business model. This actually re-focused the company’s mission, enabling it to become more resilient to future&nbsp;crises.</p>  Time for rapid learning and self-reflection  <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, Debaser decided to temporarily close their business and Karma scaled-down operation to a bare minimum. This break gave the actors time for learning and self-reflection and ultimately allowed the organizations to re-evaluate their visions for the future. Karma’s strategy had previously been to focus on aggressive growth (re-investing all their earnings directly into the company’s growth agenda), something that turned out to be a vulnerability rather than a strength during the crisis. They changed their strategy to focus on a slower, more-controlled growth dynamic, including securing savings as a buffer. Debaser also took the time for self-reflection and learning about the impact of food production on climate. The owners ensured that their staff was also educated in these matters. By redesigning the menu to reduce their climate impact, and communicating this impact to their guests, the company’s new objective became to educate customers about the carbon footprint caused by different dishes and to inspire other actors to do the&nbsp;same.</p>  Opportunity for a new collaboration  <p>All three cases initiated new collaborations during the crisis. For Martin &amp; Servera, closer collaborations with other actors in the food chain became a positive effect of the pandemic and a key to coping with the crisis. From finding new logistics collaborations, as volumes became smaller, to collaborating with suppliers around receiving the right products. Debaser also initiated a new collaboration with Klimato to help make changes in their menus. For Karma, many new collaborations emerged. For example the initial collaboration with delivery companies and also with food producers as they introduced their weekly boxes of fruit and vegetables.</p><p>Each of these triggers functions as crucial conditions for building capabilities and capacities to make use of emerging opportunities for positive change. They enable, iterate and reinforce the actor’s preparedness for resilience in face of uncertainty.</p> Further research and next&nbsp;steps <p>As these cases reveal, whilst a crisis can often be overwhelmingly negative, it can also be interpreted as a time of forced experimentation. It can force the formation, refinement, and consolidation of new relationships in face of uncertainty. As we have seen from supply chains to healthcare provision to food systems, the Covid-19 pandemic revealed the fragile interdependencies that often underpin what was previously perceived as seemingly stable systems. It could be argued that the prevailing tendency to reduce food to a product or a thing — seeing it merely as an industry, supply chain, and resource flow — neglects our ability to cherish it as a richer kind of process, as embodying sets of relationships, a complex and diverse set of cultures, and a core part of our personal and collective health, and our ecosystems and environments. Covid-19 has revealed this narrow, reductive reading of food, just as it has of other fundamental aspects of our everyday&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Prior to the pandemic, we have become increasingly aware that multiple actors pursuing unsustainable social, ecological, and economic practices produce outcomes that make our whole food system unsustainable, unhealthy and un-just. However, Covid-19 has functioned as a form of ‘highlighter’, underscoring this dynamic very clearly. In coming blog posts we will further explore this relational aspect of food — as culture, ecosystem, collective health, environment — and how Covid-19 puts these more fundamental questions about food on the table. This first set of posts concentrates on only three cases from our extensive interviews conducted thus far, and on the restaurant ‘end’ of the food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>This analysis is one way of looking at the changes during the pandemic. Going forward, we will continue exploring what innovative responses during the Covid-19 pandemic could have the potential to move food systems towards sustainable pathways — and how those opportunities could be harnessed. Further, we will be reflecting on other parts of the systems as it was stress-tested by the pandemic, drawing insights from other actors and their experiences. We will translate these insights, and the questions they raise, into tangible, speculative, and exploratory scenarios, highlighting possible intervention points, relationships, and systems transformations.</p><p>This blog is co-written by Aleksander Nowak and Juhee Hahm from <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, and Jenny Norrby from <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/">Stockholm Resilience Centre</a>, with contributions by My Sellberg, Per Olsson and Garry Peterson from Stockholm Resilience Centre, Alexander Alvsilver and Dan Hill from <a href="https://www.vinnova.se/">Vinnova</a>, and Linnea Rönnquist from Dark Matter Labs.

 Navigating uncertainty — part&nbsp;1 <p>How three Swedish food actors coped during&nbsp;Covid-19</p><p>This is a series of two blog posts by Rapid Transition Lab, a collaboration between Stockholm Resilience Center, Dark Matter Labs and Vinnova. In this first one presents the findings from interviews with three Swedish food system actors. The <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/navigating-uncertainty-part-2-857e4edd4f56">second post</a> presents key learnings and further research.</p> 1. Introduction <p>The Covid-19 pandemic, as every crisis, happens unevenly in time. It both rapidly and gradually shapes the entangled relationships across the food system, forms new alignments, collaborations, and opportunities as well as challenging circumstances for its&nbsp;actors.</p><p>For some, the current crisis has meant a fight for survival. For others, as a result of ‘<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9502904">forced experimentation</a>’, it turned out to be a learning and evaluation process, leading to new ideas, new strategies.</p><p>This first blog post presents the results from interviews with three Swedish food system actors on their Covid-19 responses. These results, combined with selected official regulations introduced during the crisis, are visualized in time as an attempt to analyze their connections.</p><p>Juxtaposing the influences of the crisis on the individual system actors with the regulations, restrictions and support measures over time, allows for a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between policy and action. In the second blog post, we will analyze this further and present the key findings and takeaways.</p><p>These insights can provide important recommendations for all food systems actors, including policy makers, not only for responding to the current pandemic, but also to other crises such as climate, biodiversity, health, social justice — now and in the future. The insights can also inform the process of navigating transformations towards more resilient, just and sustainable food systems’&nbsp;futures.</p> 2. Cases <p>The cases presented below are based on interviews with three Swedish food system actors that have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in somewhat different ways. Interviews were conducted in December 2021 and are not taking into consideration events that occurred after that. We are continuing to interview food systems actors, and look through multiple different lenses on the systems around&nbsp;us.</p><p>The timelines, illustrating each case, present Covid-19 related regulations, the emerging impact the crisis had on each actor, how the actor responded and the effects it had on the organization. Actors’ responses are highlighted according to their nature; if they were results of actors adapting to the new situation or if actors used the opportunity to develop long-term strategic thinking and actions towards sustainable development and thereby show transformational potential.</p>Legend of timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Case 01 — KARMA <p>Interviewee: App service that helps restaurants to sell their leftover food to consumers at discounted price.</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, Karma was operating in Sweden, London and Paris and had about 90 employees. The business model was based on relationships with foremost urban/city-center restaurants and customers residing in that&nbsp;area.</p><p>When Covid hit Europe, in March 2020, the app service experienced its most profitable month since launching in 2016. However, due to the pandemic, the following months were the hardest since the start of its operation.</p><p>Across Europe restaurants closed down, and Karma’s operations in London and Paris stopped abruptly. In Sweden, however, most restaurants were still open. Pre-pandemic, app users were mainly people on their way home from work buying leftover meals from city restaurants to have for dinner. So, as people began to work from home, they started using the app in their local areas instead with a more dispersed supply of food. At the same time, as the pandemic hit, using the app to save leftovers was no longer a priority for the restaurants as they went into a survival mode. Due to these dynamics, the app service operations went down by about&nbsp;50%.</p><p>In order to cope with the new reality, Karma started providing home delivery through the app to ensure people could still rescue food albeit being forced to stay home. The home delivery service was launched within two weeks after the pandemic outbreak in Sweden and was made possible through the collaboration with delivery and transportations companies who were also affected negatively by the pandemic. Karma also introduced home delivery of boxes of leftover fruit and vegetables, as well as the possibility for restaurants to sell boxes of leftover meals as well as non-leftover meals through the app. After three months, they realized that delivering leftover meals was too costly. In consequence, the company decided to focus only on subscriptions of weekly delivered boxes of leftover fruits and vegetables from producers and wholesalers to customers’ doorsteps.</p><p>Initially, when Covid hit, the company put their staff on temporary furlough with support from the government. However, as the pandemic continued, they realized that in order to survive, the organization had to be slimmed down to a bare minimum. As such, nine months after covid hit only 18 of originally 90 staff members remained employed in the&nbsp;company.</p><p>The service of delivering weekly boxes of fruits and vegetables continued until the end of 2020, when the company realized they had moved too far away from their original business operations. This left the company in a situation where continuing to grow both businesses would mean building two different companies from an operations standpoint. A strategic choice that would be too costly. Hence, they phased out the service and took time to contemplate around their vision and future and then re-launched again in March&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Meanwhile, as restrictions eased and customers started going out again, restaurants were struggling to find staff. To meet this demand, Karma developed a service whereby customers can order and pay online while seated at the restaurant, to help reduce the workload on staff. This has led the company to re-formulate and expand their vision. Originally, their main focus was reducing food waste, yet now they want to be a bigger part of establishing the sustainable restaurant of the future. Saving leftover food remains highly important, but is now part of a wider, more systemic approach.</p><p>As a result of the experiences of Covid-19, the company has changed its strategy. From being a company focusing on aggressive growth rather than profitability, they are now looking to be more resilient, ensuring savings and more carefully managed growth, as well as innovation.</p>Karma’s Covid-19 response in the timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Case 02 — Debaser <p>Interviewee: A business that entails a concert arena, a nightclub and a restaurant.</p><p>When Covid-19 hit, the concert arena and the nightclub closed completely but the associated restaurant, Calexico’s, stayed open until December 2020. The concert arena was hit both by the fact that performing actors could not travel and also by limitations for public gatherings. When the government forced the concert arena and nightclub to close, they based the decision on the wrong law according to the interviewee. This hindered Debaser and other actors from using their epidemic insurance. The CEO tried to influence the government to change this decision but without any&nbsp;luck.</p><p>From 11th of March 2020 to mid/end of April the restaurant Calexico’s had practically no customers. In connection to the restaurant, Debaser has a large outdoor seating area that became particularly valuable during the pandemic. When opening this area at the end of March, unusually early in the season, customers started to return throughout spring and summer. Yet they still had only 30% of the pre-pandemic capacity.</p><p>The interviewee explains that like many others in the restaurant business, they thought the crisis would be over after that first summer. So they kept the restaurant running and kept the staff. However, as restrictions came in during autumn and finally the requirement to stop serving alcoholic drinks after 8pm and close at 8.30pm, they decided to shut down the restaurant in December 2020. They had to let go of almost all their staff. They kept the restaurant closed between the end of December 2020 until the end of April&nbsp;2021.</p><p>During this period, starting already during the autumn, they took the opportunity to self-reflect. They learned more about the climate crisis and the impact of food production during this time. This resulted in a decision to re-design their whole menu, which they did in collaboration with <a href="https://www.klimato.co/">Klimato</a>, a service that calculates the carbon footprints of specific dishes by using the <a href="https://www.ri.se/en/what-we-do/expertises/rise-food-climate-database">RISE food climate database</a>. The restaurant now wants to act as an educator for their customers and inform them about the impact that food has on climate. Their experience is that a lot of people lack this knowledge.</p><p>When opening again in April 2021, they retained half of their staff, but they regretted firing everyone in December 2020. If the company had known from the beginning for how long the restrictions would last for, and the support packages that they could apply for, they would have only temporarily furloughed their staff with salary for the whole period&nbsp;instead.</p>Debaser’s Covid-19 response in the timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Case 03 — Martin &amp;&nbsp;Servera <p>Interviewee: Wholesaler distributing food and beverages to private restaurants (incl. fast food), public restaurants, cafes, hotel chains, conference facilities, nightclubs and other businesses offering food and beverages.</p><p>When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the wholesaler had a lot of stored food, and food on the way to be delivered to their customers. But since the restaurants and hotels had no guests at that point, they canceled their orders and the wholesaler had to find other sales channels. For a while, they sold bulk packages of cornflakes and beef to supermarkets, for example, until they had managed to correct their orders towards the suppliers to match the lowered&nbsp;demand.</p><p>In this initial phase, the wholesaler was hit hard. At the lowest point, they lost 50% of their total orders. But during summer 2020 business went up again. Tourists never came to visit Sweden in any great numbers, but equally Swedes were not overseas tourists either. They stayed in Sweden and spent money on amusement parks, in hotels, and in restaurants. Restrictions were not yet limiting opening or serving hours; they were mainly focused on distancing. But in Autumn and Winter 2020, new restrictions were introduced and the situation got tougher again. Usually, a lot of the sales at this time of the year comes from the restaurants’ Christmas offer, and from New Years Eve and seasonal tourism. But little of this happened in 2020’s version of the holiday&nbsp;season.</p><p>During Spring 2021 sales recovered somewhat, and as restrictions were eased during the summer, sales improved as people again went out to eat, travel, socialize, stay in hotels and visit places and attractions. During Autumn 2021, the wholesaler was back to about 90% of their pre-Covid sales. The ‘missing’ revenue was mostly due to conferences, tourism, and traveling not returning to pre-Covid levels.</p><p>During the pandemic, Martin &amp; Servera had to fire some of their staff, but they also used the financial support provided by the government to retain the staff part-time, using flexible working patterns when needed. They also received support to cover for lost&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Despite the outbreak of the pandemic, the company still managed to pursue planned investments in electric trucks and a large solar cell park, and they also built a new, more energy-efficient, warehouse. The company owners had taken a longer-term perspective, which enabled them to conduct strategic investments even during these difficult conditions.</p>Martin &amp; Servera’s Covid-19 response in the timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Thoughts and questions — Transitioning to part&nbsp;2 <p>We can look through multiple lenses to analyze the resilience of the food system. Looking at the cases presented in this post, we can assess the conditions created by a pandemic: the direct and indirect impacts, coping and adapting strategies, the transformational potential as well as the opportunities or barriers for change that the system actors engaged with and encountered during the&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>Through this perspective, some of the critical questions emerge: How might actors navigate times of crisis towards ultimately-necessary sustainable practices? How might actors survive whilst adapting to ever-changing conditions? What are the responses that have the potential to contribute to transformations? What forms of resilience are being exhibited? And what are the multiple time-frames and paces in which change occurs?

				  The companies that make up Indicio Network Node Operators share more in common than just hosting a copy of Indicio’s public ledger. This community of global innovators share a common mission: furthering the adoption and increasing the business value of privacy-preserving ways of proving identity and authenticity to people, businesses, and even the Internet of Things.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				 <p>It is for this reason that we are thrilled to see Sumiran Agarwal, Director of Indicio Network Ecosystem, <a href="https://gbbcouncil.org/news/announcing-gbbcs-2022-ambassadors/">appointed as Ambassador to India</a> for the The Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC).</p>
<p>The Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC) is the leading global industry association for the blockchain technology ecosystem. Conceived during the Blockchain Summit on Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island, the GBBC is a Swiss-based non-profit launched in 2017 in Davos, Switzerland that&nbsp; is dedicated to furthering adoption of blockchain through engaging regulators, business leaders, and global changemakers on how to harness this ground-breaking technology to create more secure, equitable, and functional societies.</p>
<p>Sumiran’s role as Ambassador to India for GBBC will not only bring her depth of experience and expertise to the GBBC membership, but will also help to grow the understanding of the value of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials to a wider, global community.</p>
<p>Sumiran’s work at GBBC and Indicio has already led to the inclusion of Indicio and five of our Node Operators in <a href="https://gbbcouncil.org/news/gsmi-2-0-announcement/">GBBC’s Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI) 2.0 summary report</a>. GSMI 2.0 is GBBC’s most comprehensive effort to map and analyze the blockchain and digital asset landscape and was spearheaded by the GBBC in partnership with 131 institutions, organized into nine working groups and one of the groups was Digital Identity.</p>
<p>GSMI 2.0 includes an Interactive map of blockchain and digital asset regulation and guidance across 187 jurisdictions and also a report dedicated to the findings and guidance of the working groups with focuses in five key areas:</p>
 
  Legislation and regulatory guidance 
  Technical standards 
  Industry standards and recommendations 
  University courses and degree programs 
  Industry consortia 
 
<p>Indicio was mentioned in several areas of the report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, in the <a href="https://gbbcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GBBC-GSMI-2.0-Report-1.pdf">main GSMI Report 2.0</a> (1) cite’s Indicio’s recommendation on the use of machine readable governance . Machine-readable governance embeds governance rules in the software for each party in a decentralized ecosystem. This allows governance rules to be cached, meaning the system can work offline, as well as providing the most effective and efficient way for managing complex information flows and conditional logic. Machine-readable governance was&nbsp; <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-decentralized-identity-revolution-is-powered-by-machine-readable-governance/">developed by Indicio</a> in collaboration with SITA and an open-source version will bedonated to Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) for use by health authorities as part of the Cardea project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the report highlighted use cases from some of Indicio’s node operators:&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.snowbridge.se/">Snowbridge</a> – Usecase is in real estate industry vertical and is based in Taiwan 
 <a href="https://snapperfuturetech.com/">Snapper Future</a> – Use case is in E-governance and education vertical and is based in India 
 <a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralized-identity-opens-the-doors-for-safe-travel-and-tourism/">Indicio for Govt</a> – Use case is in government industry vertical and is based in US 
 <a href="https://indicio.tech/cardea/">Indicio for Healthcare</a> – Use case is in healthcare industry vertical and is based in US 
 <a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a> – Use case is in hi-tech industry vertical and is based in US 
 <a href="https://idramp.com/">ID Ramp</a> – Multiple use cases in cross industry and public sector identity services and is based in US 
 <a href="https://finclusive.com/">Finclusive</a> – Use case is in financial industry vertical and is based in US 
 
<p>This section is particularly valuable for those in the Digital Identity space as it summarizes the commercial benefits of the technology with real life use cases in this space along with recommendations for adoption. Listing these solutions also helps advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 16,1— “Identity for all by 2030.”</p>
<p>Indicio is a global network for a technology that brings value to everyone. We are extremely proud to have the expertise of Sumiran helping to support the diverse community of twenty-six companies on five continents as they operate our growing global network. Each organization is an innovator. All are committed to building a better way to manage digital identity and to create the trust in data needed for the machine, spatial, and Web3 age.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%2523HoloMonday">#HoloMonday</a> everyone! If you’re not familiar with Holo Monday, it’s an initiative our community has created to celebrate our devs — both people working on hApps and Holo team members — on the first Monday of each month.</p><p>In that spirit, I want to share updates from a number of projects building on Holochain, as well as dev tools reaching new stages of maturity and even a new project I’d never heard of! Let’s see what’s fresh.</p> Holochain Launcher 0.3.8 <p>Launcher, the user-friendly Holochain runtime and hApp runner, has been updated for Windows, macOS, and Linux to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.3.8">include Holochain 0.0.124</a>. The previous Launcher version included Holochain 0.0.119, and the HDK and network protocol have changed since then, so applications built for newer versions should direct their users to update their Launcher version.</p> Flux 0.2.16 <p><a href="https://github.com/fluxsocial/flux/">Flux</a>, the flagship communities app from <a href="https://junto.foundation/">Junto Foundation</a>, is progressing nicely. This is the first time I’ve reported on this application, so there’s a lot to talk about.</p><p>Flux is the newest iteration of Junto’s vision of healthy online social spaces. Long-time followers will know that Junto were <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/junto--a-new-breed-of-social-media-powered-by-holochain/">one of the first</a> projects to commit to building on Holochain. A few years ago, they produced a proof-of-concept app for mobile phones and learned a lot in the process. Their newest iteration, Flux, embodies their core insight: focus on community creation rather than a new social media platform, because close-knit communities are what create healthy online social spaces.</p><p>To me this feels like this takes the best parts of early Web2 — the community cohesion of old-fashioned forums and blog networks — and brings them into the hyperconnected Web3 world. Right now, Flux just gives your community a multi-channel chat server, but they plan on <a href="https://www.fluxsocial.io/">adding more features</a>, like blogs, knowledge bases, DAO-style governance, and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>This is early days for Flux, and you may notice a few bugs and speed issues, but I’m very impressed by what they’ve already accomplished. It feels like a professionally-designed, well-thought-out app.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/fluxsocial/flux/releases/tag/v0.2.15">Download Flux and create a community!</a></p> Acorn 0.6.0-alpha <p>Acorn, the collaborative goal-planning whiteboard, has gotten a cool new feature in <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha">its newest version</a>: presence indicators! Built on Holochain’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">signals</a> feature, it shows you which cards your colleagues are currently working on, giving you the comforting feeling of working in the same room as them. As the release notes point out, it’s also good for keeping you from stepping on each other’s toes!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha">Download Acorn and try it out with your colleagues!</a></p> Electron template for hApps <p>Sprillow, the dev shop behind Acorn, have created a super useful template repo for anyone who wants to bundle their hApp, UI, and Holochain itself into a single cross-platform executable. I understand they’ve done a huge amount of work getting it usable, from taking care of cross-platform build issues to dealing with the tricky bits of getting the app trusted on macOS. If you’re planning on releasing your hApp as a standalone, you ought to check it out.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain-template">Clone the electron-holochain-template repo</a>.</p> Clutter lives again! <p>Those of you who went to a hackathon or simply checked out Holochain back in 2018 might remember Clutter. It was a demo app (written in both JavaScript and Lisp) that aimed to create a microblogging experience like Twitter.</p><p>Well, a small team of developers, headed by Moritz (a former colleague), is rebuilding Clutter for the new Holochain SDK. The project has gained attention from a number of developers (including some who weren’t previously involved in building hApps!) who are working on it ‘hackalong’-style. This means arranging regular times where they can all work on it together over a video call. This is a side project for most of them, and this format doesn’t demand much from them (and working together is more fun), so this appears to be a great format for getting things done.</p><p>If you’d like to get involved in Clutter development, head over to the <a href="https://discord.gg/wEuA2C4R">new dev.hc Discord server</a> and look for the ‘clutter’ channel!</p> New Discord server for hApp developers <p>I think the aforementioned Discord deserves a mention of its own: There already are a few Discord servers for developers, and they seem to be where the action is right now rather than the forum. Most of them have membership criteria, though. So if that feels intimidating to you, the <a href="https://discord.gg/wEuA2C4R">dev.hc server</a> is wide open to all developers!</p><p>It seems that the chat format serves a lot of developers well, especially for building community around the work they’re doing. Recently the Clutter working group is using it to coordinate meetings, share information, and generally get to know each other better.</p> Koru: a mutual credit module for your hApp <p>Recently I learned about a project called <a href="https://koru.finance/">Koru</a>, which claims that it’s building software that lets any group spin up their own customised mutual credit currency. If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you’ll know I am <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/mutual-credit-part-1-a-new-type-of-cryptocurrency-as-old-as-civilisation/">pretty excited about mutual credit</a>. I don’t think it’s the perfect design, a currency to end all other currencies, but I think it comes pretty darn close. So I was doubly excited when I discovered this project — not only did it feel like my dreams were coming true, but it turns out they’re already <a href="https://github.com/KoruProtocol/koru">prototyping on Holochain</a>!</p><p>I get the impression that it’s still early days for this project, but their lead dev is very active in our ecosystem and it seems like it has a lot of promise — in terms of development activity, plus usefulness for your own hApp and of course value to real humans. Wishing Koru lots of success!</p><p>When I discover a project like this, it makes me wonder, what other projects are building on Holochain that I know nothing about? If you know of any, please <a href="https://twitter.com/helioscomm">share them with me on Twitter</a>!</p>Imran, Koru’s lead developer, shares about the project Reusable Modules mini-site <p>Recently I came across this <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/reusable-modules/">mini-site called Reusable Modules</a>, created by the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev">Holochain Open Dev</a> group. It captures a design philosophy that appears to be very popular among Holochain devs (and really, should be popular among all devs): composability. It describes how the community feels about how to architect hApps: as collections of small, single-purpose, customisable, open-source components. It addresses both the front-end and back-end aspects this design philosophy, and is really worth reading.</p> Holochain 0.0.124: no-op <p>This release brings some compilation fixes and some documentation updates (note: we’ll be giving renewed focus to documentation in the coming months). The HDK has seen a version bump to 0.0.120, but there are no breaking changes. <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.124/CHANGELOG.md#20220126200716">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.125: DHT arc resizing stability <p>This release brings some of the gossip improvements the core dev team has been working on, and finally turns on sharding by default! It’s not the end of our improvements, though; a future release will have a lot of big improvements to both the stability of arc (AKA shard) resizing and the efficiency of syncing between nodes. <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.125/CHANGELOG.md#20220202112225">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> What’s on the horizon for Holochain? <p>That’s a good question. As we approach beta, what sorts of things should application developers expect? When will we see new features, how much churn will we have to refactor through? We intend to produce a more solid Holochain roadmap soon, but here are the most important things to know for now. (Keep in mind that most of these things are still subject to change; I just want to give you a heads-up so you can plan for contingencies.)</p>  Stabilisation of the HDK, so you can develop against a more slow-moving target. We’re currently taking a fresh look at how validation works, and there ought to be some changes soon which will make it easier for you to keep your hApp more stable. In short, we may create two separate HDKs, one with validation callbacks and one without. The idea is that your DNA will be made up of ‘integrity’ zomes which contain data type definitions (including validation callbacks) and rarely change, and ‘coordination’ zomes which contain your app’s controller logic, don’t affect the DNA hash, and can hence be changed more often.  Stabilisation of the gossip protocol — including a new DHT arc resizing algorithm and syncing algorithm. The reduced network and CPU load should make the user experience much nicer, and it should make it less necessary for you to keep recompiling your hApp for the newest and greatest Holochain.  New HDK and DHT features, including ‘baseless’ links, saving you from requiring every user to test for the existence of a base anchor at app startup; links that can have headers as their base or target; ephemeral (off-chain) storage; a pub/sub model for signals to replace the current everybody-gets-everything model; ‘true’ deletes via two new DHT operations: ‘purge’ and ‘withdraw’; and validated rate limiting to prevent DHT spamming and other time-based abuses.  More core hApps that are useful to all devs, including <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey">DeepKey</a> for distributed key management, Verifiable Credentials for people to make signed claims about others, Compository for managing shared source code and distributing binaries, Personas and Profiles for managing and syncing personal information across all your devices, and Source Chain Backup for easy recovery of lost agency.  Security and resilience features, including warrants and defensive action for warrantable offenses, plus a top-to-bottom security review of the codebase.   FOSDEM 2022 recap <p>I didn’t attend FOSDEM myself this year, but it looks like a lot of great projects presented their work. A few colleagues mentioned that it was good to hear about what others are doing, partly because it’s always valuable to learn new things, but also because there seems to be an agent-centric trend among P2P projects that validates Holochain’s approach.</p><p>Here are three of the four Holochain-related presentations. I have to say, I’m personally thrilled about all of them; I think they will be important projects in the growing Holochain ecosystem.</p>Harlan Wood shares TrustGraph, a framework for building subjective reputation in P2P networksEmaline Friendman and Michael Hueschen share Neighbourhoods<a href="https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fosdem/2022/D.web3/where.mp4"></a>Eric Harris-Braun presents Where, an app for collective sensemaking using a simple question: "Where are you at right now?"<p>Check out all the other talks in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/web3_infrastructure/">Web3 Infrastructure room</a>.</p><p>Well, I think that’s plenty for this Holo Monday!

<p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates – 7 February, 2022: IDnow, one of the leading <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/idnow-client-trueprofile-io-raises-standard-global-hiring-expansion-identity-verification/">global</a> digital identity verification providers, has announced its launch in the Middle East, with the opening of its new office in DIFC’s Innovation Hub. This is the first IDnow office outside of Europe, adding to its headquarters in Munich, and offices across Leipzig, Düsseldorf, London and Manchester.</p>
<p>The business is targeting the huge Middle East and Africa (MEA) digital identity verification market, which is expected to reach USD 800M by 2025*. It is a rapidly expanding market, with the facial verification sector expected to grow at 20 percent CAGR for the next five years. IDnow’s regional team will be led by Oliver Obitayo, Chief Commercial Officer of IDnow Group and Head of Region – Middle East, Basil Macklai.</p>
<p>On the occasion of its Middle East launch, Oliver Obitayo commented, “The Middle East is a rapidly growing market for digital identity verification, supporting the region’s booming and innovative digital economy. We have been working in conjunction with regional regulators for more than two years, and the time is right to expand our presence with a dedicated team and office. IDnow’s combination of international experience, German-quality standards and in-depth knowledge of requirements across Middle East jurisdictions, puts us in a unique position to serve government, regulators, banks, financial services, enterprises and fintechs.”</p>
<p>More than half of businesses in the MENA region have faced new financial crime risks due to the pandemic, including payments fraud, account takeovers and identity theft. According to a study by Comparitech, in the UAE alone cyber crime claims 166,667 victims annually, losing $746 million, with identity theft and fraud key contributors. McKinsey research highlights financial services as the largest driver of identity verification services. As such, these businesses will account for around 62 percent of digital identity verification spend this year (Juniper Research).</p>
<p>For nearly a decade, IDnow has been developing quality technology that serves some of the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions. The IDnow platform provides a range of secure and seamless products, including its signature IDnow AutoIdent, an automated, AI-powered identity verification. Benefits include reducing onboarding friction, improving customer experience and automating conversion at scale. For banks and financial services, deploying IDnow enhances KYC, AML and regulatory compliance, helping to reduce risk of fraud to protect businesses and their customers.</p>
<p>Aligning with the vision of regional governments to strengthen the digital transformation of the banking sector and underline trust in Middle East financial services, IDnow facilitates greater integration with the global financial system and supports development of legislative and legal frameworks to ensure compliance with international standards.</p>
<p>IDnow is an industry leader and has set the standard for digital identity verification in the EU. It is backed by significant investors including Corsair Capital, Seventure Partners, BayBG Venture Capital, and a consortium of other financiers. The business has also received debt funding from the European Investment Bank, the European Union’s investment bank which is owned by the EU Member States.</p>

<p>Introduction: What Is GEMpay And What Are Its Intricacies?</p><p>GEMpay is a points-based payment system specialized for small business owners and entities. Instead of small business owners being plagued by brokerage fees charged in the normal terminal payment process, small business owners can become the subject of point issuance. By turning the small business entity into the focal component of the point-based system, a business can provide more benefits to loyal and new consumers alike. In the most brief manner of speaking, it is a win-win model for both the business and the consumer.</p> 🌟 First, The Dream, The Direction And Vision Of&nbsp;GEMpay <p>The direction of GEMpay, like blockchain technology, intends on eliminating the necessity of middle-men and payment intermediaries. The point discount concept has been adopted by GEMpay to increase discounts as opposed to fees, providing numerous benefits for the producer, business and consumer alike! GEMpay is a blockchain based solution as a service. With the innovation of blockchain, merchants and consumers are directly connected. Lets think if the merchant and consumer are two end points in a peer-to-peer network in the Bitcoin network; directly connected, without middle-men. This enables virtually zero commission costs. Unlike traditional financial systems, the core paradigm of the blockchain is “decentralization.” By excluding PGs and VAN companies that have gotten in the middle of the payment process, it is possible to conceive of a “double discount” with&nbsp;GEMpay.</p><p>GEMpay aims to become the subject of the service by transparently sharing the transaction process. Payment details and discount rates are shown in a direct and concise manner with GEMpay and enables users to exercise their own choice in operation. This is the ethos of decentralization that GEMpay aims to&nbsp;achieve.</p><p>GEMpay transparently shares the transaction process with users, allowing users to be the subject of payment data thereof. Rather than just sharing payment details and discount rates, you can easily check the details of why such a discount is possible through the GEMpay application. This creates efficient and easier services which allow users to exercise choice in a huge platform base created with their own data and aggregation. This will in return increase the actual benefits they will&nbsp;receive.</p><p>From the user’s point of view, it is quite burdensome to use coins that are extremely volatile and fluctuate in valuation on a second-by-second basis. BLOCKO intends on creating the AERGO Gem token on the self developed AERGO mainnet to ensure the consistent value of 1:1 value exchange with the KRW. BLOCKO will initially focus on the exchange pair with the KRW. Users can then use the AERGO Gem charged through the GEMpay app into the Korean&nbsp;won.</p> 🧐 So How Do I Use&nbsp;GEMpay? <p>To use GEMpay, it is necessary to follow these steps provided. To begin, you first must top-up your AERGO Gem tokens. AERGO Gem has the same value as the KRW, and when more users utilize the AERGO Gem on the GEMpay platform, users are able to garner more discounts. So how can individuals charge up their AERGO Gem with AERGO tokens? We want to increase user convenience by supporting the ARC-1 (based on the AERGO native token) and ERC-20 (based on Ethereum) AERGO&nbsp;token.</p><p>Since the AERGO mainnet has a Merkle Bridge function, it is possible to recharge your AERGO Gem with numerous different ERC-20 tokens, which include Ethereum. To do this, we need to pull the price for each token, and we need to have an Index for the price. However, there is no reliable index to date. The price shown on the exchange is not a reliable index because the exchange has the lead. If there is a transparent index related to Ethereum in the future, GEMpay will support various tokens through the Merkle Bridge function at any time.<br>The Merkle Bridge is a technology that enables the exchange between assets of the AERGO blockchain and assets of the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Because AERGO Gem is charged with AERGO tokens, the GEMpay app also serves as an ‘AERGO wallet’ as well. Users can transfer their AERGO tokens to the GEMpay app seamlessly for storage and recharge with AERGO GEM whenever they want. GEMpay supports both online and offline payments. At offline issuer A, a QR payment is made through the GEMpay app, and at online issuer B, payment is made with AERGO Gem by selecting ‘GEMpay’ among various payment methods such as credit card, Naver Pay, and Kakao&nbsp;Pay.</p><p>The issuing point is the subject of point issuance and can initially set the exchange rate of the issuing point points and the AERGO Gem. The moment a user pays with AERGO Gem, AERGO Gem is automatically converted into points at the point of issue. AERGO Gem is then exchanged for points which exclude brokerage fees, so a discount is automatically applied when paying with AERGO Gem. Users simply need to proceed with all payments with AERGO Gem. With this type of payment paradigm, payments become easy and seamless and you receive more discounts.</p><p>Issuers can settle accumulated points in the AERGO Gem and periodically receive AERGO Gem in the form of the Korean won currency. Through the GEMpay app, specifically on the administrator page, the issuer can glance and see the contents of the GEMpay payment and can then easily apply for a KRW settlement of the transaction. GEMpay provides consumers and businesses ample opportunities for discounts, efficient payment processes and more use-case for the AERGO token through these various mechanisms.</p> 💎 If you have a Gem double discount, you will have a lot to look forward to in the very near future! 😇 Provided is a three line summary of GEMpay for your convenience.   The AERGO Gem can be charged with AERGO tokens (ERC-20 and Native&nbsp;AERGO).  AERGO Gem can be used both online and&nbsp;offline.  Issuers can settle AERGO Gem in KRW through the GEMpay app on the admin&nbsp;page.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/gempay-so-how-is-it-written-dfbd16f5a30d">GEMpay: So How Is It Written?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 January 2022 — Verus Monthly&nbsp;Recap  The latest Verus updates on development, community, ecosystem and more. <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">Subscribe to the newsletter here</a>. <p>Next to the monthly recap on Medium, you can receive the exact same content through a newsletter. <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">Subscribe here</a>. I’ll keep things short and to the&nbsp;point.</p> 🌎⚠️🔒 VaultAlert.net Release <p>With <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert</a> users can check the status of their VerusID Vault from anywhere in the world. VerusID Vault always protects your crypto assets even if your private keys are compromised. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/%EF%B8%8F-vaultalert-net-always-know-your-crypto-assets-are-safe-a20b4d537c61">Read more on VaultAlert here</a>.</p><p>Last month a lot of quiet progress was made on the development of the Verus multichain protocol. A new public testnet is on the verge of release with additional core protocol features. All effort is put into making Verus a decentralized and robust protocol that just&nbsp;works.</p> Exporting Currencies <p>Currencies on one PBaaS-blockchain can be exported to any other PBaaS-blockchain. This means that a currency can easily be made available on multiple blockchains.</p><p>An example: we have CHICKEN-currency on a PBaaS-chain and want it to be available on the Verus-blockchain as well. We export CHICKEN-currency to the Verus-blockchain for a fee and now CHICKEN-currency is available there too. It goes without saying that all fees go to the miners and stakers of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We can pay this fee in whatever currency we want, as long as it is available in the bridge-converter.</p><p>This fee is defined by the PBaaS-chain where you want the currency to be exported to, and thus can differ within all the multiple blockchains in the&nbsp;network.</p> Fee Structures <p>On the previous public testnet you could only make transactions if you had the native currency of the blockchain. Now you can use any currency that is in the bridge-converter as a fee to do operations on any PBaaS-blockchain.</p><p>Any currency on a blockchain can be used as fees to do transactions. Example: if you have USDC on the Verus-blockchain you don’t need VRSC to send the USDC around. It automatically converts a small fee of USDC to VRSC through a bridge-converter and uses that as its transaction fee.</p><p>This is an incredibly hard problem to solve. Yet it is working now on internal Verus test&nbsp;builds.</p> 🔊 Public Technical Updates from Mike Toutonghi <p>On January 8, 2022, Mike Toutonghi gave the community technical updates on the Verus Discord channel. 🔊 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6M0l0zjkQ0&amp;t=1168s">You can listen to it&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Awesome Mining&nbsp;Rigs <p>Some community members have shown their mining rigs in the #mining channel on <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discord</a> this month.
