The addition of consumer-permissioned data from an open banking platform allows early-stage FinTechs access to the data they need to mitigate fraud, maximize confidence, and provide more choice in payment transactions to improve user experiences.</p>
<p>“Mastercard’s open banking platform provides consumer-permissioned data that is critical to enabling all ecosystem players, opening the door for the future of financial experiences, and can help streamline account verification to reduce friction between apps and consumers,” said Andy Sheehan, Executive Vice President, U.S. Open Banking at Mastercard. “Mastercard and Synctera’s partnership enhances the support and collaboration that is critical to FinTech innovators and will allow entrepreneurs and developers the ability to go to market quickly and ultimately deliver more consumer choice.”</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>IIW was established in 2005, and boasts over a hundred sponsors, with hundreds in attendance. As the focus is on “getting things done” the agenda is created live each day by attendees present at the opening of the day, giving you the opportunity to establish what you want to talk about and getting the real time ability to see which topics others will be deliberating that you might want to join in on.</p>
<p>IIW is an un-conference, which means that there are no keynote speakers, presentations, or sales pitches (for the most part). Participants are encouraged to come with topics they would like to discuss with the community in attendance, with the goal of “moving topics, code and projects downfield.”</p>
<p>The Take Aways</p>
<p>Because of the unique style of this conference you are sure to take part in, sit in on, or just overhear a variety of conversations on all kinds of work in the identity space. Here are some of the topics Indicio’s team at IIW found interesting.</p>
<p>Trust registries and Machine Readable Governance: The question, “How do we know which Issuers to trust?” was brought up several times at IIW with “Trust registries” being a common response. But&nbsp; there seemed to be a division over what a trust registry is or should be. One interpretation saw it as a third party fulfilling a top-down, command-and-control, pay-to-play, API-to-call function in determining which credential issuers can be trusted. The other saw it as something collaborative, a resource for governance files that allows those files to be cacheable among agents through machine readable governance. This triggered interest in what machine readable governance was, how it made a trust registry portable,&nbsp; and how it could be implementedThere</p>
<p>DIDComm as a Control Channel: This concept is all about using DIDcomm as a coordinating service, connecting two endpoints that want to communicate and handling everything from authentication to coordinating money transfers or shipping details, while also adding an additional security layer for the end user. While it was a new idea to many, there were a few people that raised their hands and said that they have already implemented something like this and showed some real world examples, increasing excitement around the possibilities and promoting further adoption.</p>
<p>Interoperability: As usual, many people were concerned with how to solve interoperability challenges in the community. The crowd was very keen on the idea of running an Aries Interop-a-thon (based on the hackathon style events Indicio has run for the Cardea Project at Linux Foundation Public Health) The idea that IIW tickets be issued as credentials so the community can personally test its solutions and try to iron out some of the interoperability challenges was proposed, and has a good chance of moving forward.</p>
<p>The really thought provoking discussion was about the current state of identity interoperability vs interoperability in other areas of tech. When compared to browsers, it was said it is tempting to feel like we are in the Netscape era of standardization. When in reality we are likely more in line with the Compuserve-AOL era of standardization and have much further&nbsp; to go.</p>
<p>AnonCreds VS W3C JSON-LD Creds: Our team expected some disagreement about this topic, but both sides seemed to realize that delivery is what matters here, and additional argument isn’t going to help. Multiple sessions were run trying to identify which credential format to use, resulting in 7+ different formats being discussed, with Anoncreds &amp; W3C JSON-LD being the most popular for debate. The ISO mDL 18013-5 credential format was also brought up for use in drivers licenses.</p>
<p>Why should you participate in the next IIW?</p>
<p>No wrap up or bullet point list can capture every conversation. This year was the first in-person conference since the start of the pandemic and every member of our team was excited to go.</p>
<p>While it was cheaper to attend over zoom, the conversational opportunities presented by in-person attendance—the ability to to really dig into the technology, simply don’t occur online. While this could be said for any conference, the unconference style of IIW encourages much greater audience participation. The number of engineers in these discussions drives challenging, exciting, and insightful ideas, so much so in fact, that In the middle of this IIW they decided to do the next one in person, rather than one remote and one in person per year as had been previously planned.</p>
<p>And worse case scenario, you can use the opportunity of bringing your team together for some sweet photo ops like our team did.</p>
<p>Tickets sell out quickly so for more information and to make sure you can join the next event we encourage you to check out the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW website</a>!</p>

<p>Es zirkulieren falsche Annahmen und Missverständnisse in den Medien über das Potenzial und die Risiken von SSI. In diesem Artikel setzen wir uns mit einigen Missverständnissen auseinander und fassen die wichtigsten Kernthesen über SSI zusammen. So entsteht am Ende ein übersichtliches Bild darüber, was SSI ist, und vor allem: was SSI nicht ist und sein soll.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Können SSI Daten gestohlen und ohne mein Wissen verwendet werden? Ermöglicht SSI einen Datenmarkt und weiteren Missbrauch von unseren Daten?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bei SSI stehen die selbstbestimmte Nutzung und gleichzeitige Datensicherheit für das Individuums im Mittelpunkt. Gleichzeitig ist Datensparsamkeit wichtig: der User sollte immer nur das erforderliche Minimum der Informationen über sich preisgeben müssen, das für die Nutzung eines Dienstes notwendig ist. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass man bei SSI nur entscheiden kann, wem man die Daten gibt, nicht aber, was mit ihnen passiert – was keine technische Frage ist, sondern den Trust Frameworks und der Umsetzung von Policies geschuldet. Dies wird über Zertifizierung und Zulassung geregelt, da so Vertrauen in die am Ökosystem beteiligten Akteure hergestellt werden kann. SSI selbst bietet keinen allgemeinen Schutz vor Datenmissbrauch. Dennoch stellt es die Möglichkeit dar, durch das Prinzip der Dezentralität die eigenen Daten sicher und selbstbestimmt zu verwalten. Die Dienste, an welche man persönliche Daten übermittelt, sind letztendlich ebenfalls an die Datenschutzgrundverordnung gebunden. Man kann nicht nur entscheiden, wem man die Daten gibt, sondern auch wie (bspw. als ZKP oder als VP).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wieso bietet SSI mehr privacy als derzeitige Systeme?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weil wir unsere Daten nicht an Hunderte von Plattformen auslagern, sondern zentral bei uns verwalten. So wären im Idealfall beim Hack eines Dienstes keine Tausende von Userprofilen mit sensiblen Daten zu erbeuten, sondern nur wertlose peer to peer connects. Dadurch entstehen mehr Privatsphäre und Eigenverantwortung über die persönlichen Daten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schon im ersten Artikel zu SSI von Christopher Allan steht: Der User kann und soll selbst entscheiden, wem er oder sie persönliche Daten zeigt und wofür. Voraussetzung dafür ist Interoperabilität und Portabilität der Identitäten. Diese Idee ist gewissermaßen der Kern von SSI. Doch die Aussage, dass ich als User die komplette Hoheit über meine digitale Identität habe, wird oft missverstanden und ist in dieser Form falsch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ist SSI mit Klarnamenpflicht gleich zu setzen und verliere ich meine Anonymität?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Welche Daten ein Dienst einfordert liegt beim Dienst und an den gesetzlichen Vorgaben. Ist der Dienstanbieter nicht an eine Klarnamenpflicht gebunden, also nicht verpflichtet einen Klarnamen abzufragen und zu überprüfen so kann er das auch nicht vom Nutzer einfordern (nach Datenschutzgrundverordnung). Tut er dies trotzdem, muss der Benutzer zustimmen und es muss ein konkreter Grund genannt werden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wieso hat SSI nichts mit Blockchain zu tun?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SSI wird oft mit der Blockchain Technologie gleichgesetzt. Dadurch entsteht der Eindruck, dass SSI nur gemeinsam mit Blockchain funktionieren kann. Das ist jedoch nicht der Fall. Wir haben eine umfassende Erklärung hier zusammengefasst: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/">https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week we released a new version of Holochain Launcher with a lot of new features. I took it for a test run and I have to say… I'm excited. It feels like something my dad could actually use! The new Launcher is much more welcoming to non-technical users. I’m going to unbox it below, but first, the Holochain release notes for this week.</p> Holochain 0.0.139: Keystore version bump, simpler link CRUD <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130, 0.0.131, 0.0.132<br>Compatible Lair version: 0.1.3</p><p>This release is another small one, albeit with a couple meaningful changes for devs and users:</p>  The compatible Lair keystore has been bumped to version 0.1.3 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1377">#1377</a>). This brings mostly documentation updates, but also fixes a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/all-agents-busy-please-stand-by/#holochain-00137">bug</a> involving spaces in Lair’s socket/pipe path (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/91">lair #91</a>) and gets more strict about the version of Lair that it intends to connect to (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/95">lair #95</a>).  The link CRUD functions <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.create_link.html"><code>create_link</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.get_link_details.html"><code>get_link_details</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html"><code>get_links</code></a> now take any DHT hash that can be converted to a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/prelude/type.AnyLinkableHash.html">linkable hash</a>, rather than requiring you to convert it yourself. On the flip side, entry, header, and external hashes now have <code>Into&lt;AnyLinkableHash&gt;</code> implementations to make this all possible. Surprisingly, this isn’t a breaking change, as it all happens in the HDK before getting sent to the host. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1365">#1365</a>)   Unboxing the user-friendly Launcher 0.4.4 <p>Compatible Holochain versions: 0.0.127, 0.0.131, 0.0.132, 0.0.136</p><p>If you’re not familiar with the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a>, it’s a user-friendly manager for running hApps. This will eventually be our end-user offering, and one of the primary ways you’ll be able to distribute web-based hApps to your users.</p><p>Version 0.4.4 is a huge jump toward the goal of user-friendliness, in a few ways:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas">DevHub</a>, a built-in package manager that lets your users download and install hApps right from within the Launcher!  It supports multiple Holochain versions, which means that you don’t have to worry quite as much about whether your users have the right Launcher installed. It also means they also won’t have to perform any more factory resets and lose their data!  <p>Okay, let’s unbox this thing.</p> 1. First run <p>Here’s something new: When you start up Launcher 0.4.4 for the first time, there’s already a hApp running! It’s the first public preview of the new DevHub hApp. (I’ll talk more about that at the bottom of this Dev Pulse.)</p> 2. hApp Library <p>If you click on the ‘Install new app’ button, instead of getting a file dialog, you see the new App Library! It’s powered by the DevHub DNA, and it lets you download, install, and start a hApp with just a couple of clicks. Currently there’s only one hApp with a public release, called Notebooks, but it’s a fun one.</p> 3. Installing a hApp <p>As you can see, I didn’t have to hunt around for a hApp bundle file on the internet, and I didn’t have to hunt for the downloaded file on my device’s storage. The Launcher just downloaded Notebooks and showed me a simplified installation dialog. The membrane proof fields are hidden; all I have to do is change the hApp’s name if I feel like it.</p> 4. Behold, a newly installed hApp <p>Now I have two hApps, DevHub and Notebooks. They each require a different conductor version, but that’s no problem; you can see that Launcher started up 0.0136 automatically for me. Users probably won’t notice or care about this detail, but what it means for them is that It Just Works.</p> 5. Using Notebooks for the first time <p><a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks">Notebooks</a> is a real-time collaborative document editor, similar to HackMD or Google Docs. It’s built using a framework called <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/">Syn</a>, created by Eric Harris-Braun and his son last year. I’d like to say more about Notebooks, but for brevity’s sake I’ll say this: I was surprised by how delightful it was to use. The real-time editing experience is smooth and snappy, just like you’d expect from a cloud app. But I’m comforted by the knowedge that all the stuff I care about is on my machine!</p><blockquote>So, now that you’ve seen the new Launcher, why not <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.4.4">give it a try</a>? I invite non-developers to try it out too!</blockquote> DevHub public preview <p>So the other big news that got bundled with Launcher 0.4.4 is, of course, the first public preview of the DevHub hApp. It’s not ready for prime time yet (that will likely happen after the Stable Validation milestone) but I’m still excited by the possibilities it hints at.</p><p>So what is DevHub? If you’re a developer, it’s easiest to think of it as a package manager and distributed repository for hApps, built on Holochain. You can distribute releases of your zomes, DNAs, hApps, and web-based UIs for other developers to remix, or for users to download.</p><p>If you’re a user, it’s like an open-source hApp store or library. As we’ve seen, the Launcher can talk to the DevHub DNA natively, giving it the power to search, download, install, and update hApps.</p><p>The DevHub hApp comes with a web-based GUI that attempts to serve both devs and users. In the future, it will split into two GUIs — one specifically tailored to devs, and a user-focused ‘hApp store’ experience.</p><p>This demonstrates that you don’t have to use a hApp’s default UI — you can fork it, create your own, or even build it into a desktop app, as the Launcher’s native support demonstrates. This is what happens when an app’s API is totally accessible to you on your machine. It’s all under your control!</p> Unboxing the DevHub GUI <p>Now let’s take a look at this first iteration of the DevHub GUI. It’s being redesigned at the moment, but this will give you a taste of what the DNA is meant for.</p> 1. Main page <p>When you open up the GUI, you see a listing of hApp packages, sorted by date. You can get info on a package, add your own hApp, or choose instead to look at individual DNAs and zomes if you’re interested in remixing and creating your own hApp.</p> 2. hApp info page <p>Let’s take a look at the Notebooks listing. We can see some information about the hApp — what it’s for, how fresh it is, who wrote it, etc. Below that, you can see all the individual releases of the hApp.</p> 3. Release page <p>Let’s take a look at the 0.0.1 release of Notebooks. It was published on 9 May 2022, and we can see the changelog. To the right we can see the DNAs that comprise it — `syn` and `notebooks` — and download a headless `.happ` package or a full `.webhapp` package.</p><p>That’s all for now — once I learn more about DevHub I’d like to do a more in-depth study of what it can do!</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@spacex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">SpaceX</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/launch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> The need for authentication standards 
<p>In the cybersecurity industry, many new technologies–particularly those related to identity management and authentication–are constantly driving change and innovation. Yet one thing remains the same: the use of passwords continues to pose a threat to an organization’s IT security. As long as passwords continue to be used, users and organizations will remain vulnerable to attacks. Fortunately, due to the development of new solutions and authentication standards, replacing passwords as the dominant form of authentication on the Internet now seems to be possible.</p>
<p>Various annual surveys demonstrate that password compromises are associated with 70-80% of data breaches. As a response to the over-reliance on passwords, the non-profit organization FIDO ("Fast IDentity Online") Alliance was launched in 2013 to develop and promote authentication standards. With the help of the FIDO Alliance, a set of open, scalable, and interoperable specifications has been developed to replace passwords as a secure authentication method for online services. The alliance has also worked with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple to integrate and adopt FIDO standards across their operating systems.</p>
 <br>FIDO Alliance reveals its latest whitepaper 
<p>Most recently, the FIDO Alliance and the W3C WebAuthn working group published a whitepaper in March 2022 explaining how the introduction of multi-device FIDO credentials will enable FIDO technology to supplant passwords for many consumer use cases. The framework goes further by outlining two proposals for phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms:</p>
 
 Using your phone as a roaming authenticator: Essentially, this involves connecting the user's smartphone (which becomes the FIDO authenticator) and the device from which the user is trying to authenticate via Bluetooth. Since Bluetooth requires physical presence, the use of proximity-based authentication should be resistant to any phishing attacks. As a result, the smartphone becomes a sort of smart card while providing the necessary FIDO requirements to the device from which the user is trying to authenticate. 
 
 
 Multi-device FIDO credentials: To improve user experience, the second proposal encourages FIDO authenticator vendors to adapt their authenticators in the event of lost or stolen devices. As users move from device to device, FIDO credentials should be available on a user’s new device without the need of implementing a password.&nbsp; For example, a smartphone, a desktop, and a USB token could act as a mutually exchangeable FIDO authenticator. 
 
<p>The whitepaper argues that the syncing of FIDO credentials, together with the Bluetooth alternative, allows FIDO authentication to be a secure and convenient solution for existing two-factor deployments. Furthermore, the paper makes it clear that the proposal is not a change in standards, but rather a set of prescriptions for vendors to implement themselves.</p>
<p><br>However, there is one crucial point that the FIDO and WebAuthn proposals seem to ignore. So far, the whitepaper has not specified whether users will feel comfortable with a password successor where the cloud operator has access to secret keys. If users roam enterprise-issued keys via potentially insecure clouds, organizations must understand the risks that come with convenience when syncing is not end-to-end secured.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it comes down to what end users will do and only time will tell if they are willing to trust<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless"> Microsoft</a>,<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/protect-gce-vms-with-managed-fido-security-keys"> Google</a>, and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/expanded-support-for-fido-authentication-in-ios-and-macos/">Apple</a> as the ultimate confidants of their organization's credentials.</p>
<p><br>In addition, if the deprovisioning of access within applications is not properly implemented, former employees might gain access to cloud-based applications when leaving an organization and returning their physical FIDO key. By not having proper controls in place, this new level of convenience will increase the risk and reduce the level of control an organization is able to exert.<br>Therefore, KuppingerCole believes that companies and other organizations that are looking to modernize and improve authentication solutions should understand the consequences beforehand. If done right, this solution has the potential to provide a frictionless user experience while improving security at the same time. We expect to see a significant number of FIDO authenticators, vendors, servers, and compatible web apps in industry over the course of the next few years.</p>

<p>Nel numero 57 del magazine <a href="https://www.impresacity.it/">IMPRESACITY</a>&nbsp; uscito lo scorso Aprile 2022, è possibile leggere un’intervista rilasciata da Carmine Auletta – CISO di InfoCert – all’interno dello speciale dedicato alla sanità digitale.</p>



<p>Nel corso di questi ultimi anni una serie&nbsp;di progetti innovativi, come&nbsp;l’invio digitale, certificato e sicuro, delle comunicazioni di inizio quarantena per Covid da parte dei medici di base ai propri assistiti&nbsp;o&nbsp;ancora, la raccolta del consenso informato dematerializzato dell’avvio della campagna vaccinale di inizio 2021 hanno contribuito in maniera forte alla digitalizzazione nel campo sanitario.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“L’obiettivo è giungere a una digitalizzazione completa di tutte le fasi dell’iter pre-intervento di un paziente per garantire ai cittadini maggiore efficienza e anche migliore qualità di comunicazione con le strutture sanitarie.”</p>Carmine Auletta, CISO di InfoCert</blockquote>



<p>Negli ultimi anni la sanità è stata oggetto di numerosi&nbsp;cambiamenti, dettati prima dalla pandemia e ora dagli investimenti in ambito Pnrr. In questo contesto numerose sono state le soluzioni digitali adottate nel campo sanitario, facendo sì che ad oggi la digitalizzazione della sanità risulti essere uno dei pilastri dei recovery plan di tutta Europa. &nbsp;</p>



<p>InfoCert è da sempre protagonista della digitalizzazione nel mondo Health Care grazie soprattutto a LegalCare e ProxySign, le soluzioni Trust studiate per la digitalizzazione dei processi&nbsp;di lavoro clinici e amministrativi e già adottate da importanti Aziende Sanitarie Italiane.&nbsp;</p>

 Ionic is a framework for building mobile apps with web technologies that look and act like native apps.
Because they’re built with web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS), you can also deploy your Ionic apps as single-page applications.
Or, even better, as progressive web apps (PWAs) that work offline.

<p>Ionic supports the big three web frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue.
Once you’ve written your app, you can deploy it to a simulator or device with <a href="https://capacitorjs.com/">Capacitor</a>.
Capacitor (pictured as the blue layer) provides the runtime for your app to communicate with the native operating system and vice versa.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>Ionic’s main competitors are native apps built with Swift or Objective-C (for iOS) and Java or Kotlin (for Android).
Ionic also competes with React Native, which uses web technologies and translates them to native components.</p>
 
 
<p>The Ionic blog has a recent post that <a href="https://ionicframework.com/blog/ionic-vs-react-native-performance-comparison/">does a performance comparison between Ionic and React Native</a>.
TL;DR: Both options will give you a high-performance app with a truly native look and feel.</p>

 What the heck is JHipster? 
 
 
<p>This tutorial will show you how to use Ionic, Angular, and Capacitor to build a mobile app that talks to a Spring Boot backend. It won’t take but a few minutes, thanks to JHipster!</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a> is an application generator that creates an Angular frontend and a Spring Boot backend based on the options you choose. It has the ability for you, as a developer, to customize what it generates with blueprints. The blueprints feature has resulted in many additional options for an app: Kotlin, Spring Native, Micronaut, Quarkus, .NET Core, NestJS, and Svelte.</p>
 
 
<p>Below is a diagram of the app you’ll create in this tutorial and its authentication flow.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 ✨ Introducing the JHipster Ionic blueprint! 
 
 
<p>The JHipster project has supported generating an Ionic app using a <code>generator-jhipster-ionic</code> module for the past several years.
As the primary maintainer of this module, I’m proud to announce that it has been re-written as a blueprint, and it’s much easier to understand now.
The previous module relied on the Ionic CLI, the base Angular <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/starters">starter</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/ionic-jhipster-starter">Ionic JHipster starter</a>, and custom code to glue it all together.
Now, the source code is all contained in one project.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/mshima">Marcelo Shima</a> volunteered to do the conversion, and after a couple of months, I’m proud to say the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-ionic">JHipster Ionic blueprint</a> is now available!</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>Ionic for <a href="https://twitter.com/jhipster?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JHipster</a> v8 is now available! There's lots to love in this release:<br><br>💙 Now available as a blueprint<br>🧪 Migrated from Protractor to Cypress<br>⭐️ <a href="https://twitter.com/auth0?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Auth0</a> support<br>🅰️ Upgraded to Angular 13 and Ionic 6<br><br>✨ <a href="https://t.co/WQ6ZTsTkPP">https://t.co/WQ6ZTsTkPP</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ionic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ionic</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jhipster?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#jhipster</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/angular?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#angular</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springboot?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#springboot</a></p>— Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1523893356744609792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2022</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>Here’s how to use it:</p>
 
 
<p>Create an <code>ionic-app</code> directory alongside your JHipster app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- backend
- ionic-app</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Navigate into <code>ionic-app</code> using your terminal.
Install Ionic for JHipster and create a new app using <code>jhipster-ionic</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-ionic
jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll be prompted for the location of your JHipster app, a name for your Ionic app, and then you’ll be off to the races!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also create a JHipster app and an Ionic app simultaneously by using the bundled JHipster.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir bug-tracker &amp;&amp; cd bug-tracker
jhipster-ionic jdl bug-tracker.jh
cd ../ionic4j</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This process will follow the same convention where the generated backend and frontend apps are side-by-side on your hard drive.</p>
 
 
<p>Then you can run both apps from your Ionic app using easy-to-remember commands.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run backend:start
# open a new terminal window
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 






The JHipster Ionic blueprint currently only supports Angular.
Now that it’s a blueprint, it will be much easier to add support for Vue and React.
If you’re interested in helping out, please let me know!

 Build a mobile app with Ionic and Angular 
 
 
<p>To see Ionic + JHipster in action, let’s start with a <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/">Full Stack Java + React app I created for the Auth0 blog</a>.
I updated the app to the latest version of JHipster (v7.8.1) and created an Ionic app with JHipster Ionic, so everything is guaranteed to work.
This Flickr clone allows you to upload photos, tag them, and organize them into albums.
First, clone the example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example.git \
  jhipster-ionic --depth 1
cd jhipster-ionic/backend</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Start the app:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run ci:e2e:prepare # starts Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker
./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favorite browser.
Sign in with <code>admin/admin</code> credentials and rejoice when it all works.</p>
 
 
<p>Open a new terminal window and enter the <code>jhipster-ionic/ionic-app</code> directory.
Install its dependencies and run <code>npm start</code> to test the Ionic client.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should be able to sign in and add a new photo.</p>
 

  
    
    
  
  
    
    
  

 
<p>Please keep reading to learn how JHipster made all of this possible.
Or, skip ahead to <a>run your Ionic app on iOS using Capacitor</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 How to integrate Ionic and Spring Boot 
 
 
<p>JHipster makes it easy to create a Spring Boot API that Spring Security protects.
The JHipster Ionic blueprint generates an Ionic client that talks to your Spring Boot API and understands its auth mechanism.
I created the <code>jhipster-ionic</code> project using the following steps:</p>
 
 
<p>Install the JHipster Ionic blueprint:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster-ionic@8.0.0</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a parent directory to hold everything:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># take is a shortcut for mdkir &amp;&amp; cd
take jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Clone an existing JHipster Flickr example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git backend --depth 1</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a new directory to hold your Ionic project, then run <code>jhipster-ionic</code> in it:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>take ionic-app
jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Provide the path to your backend JHipster app and name your app <code>flickr2</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>That’s it!
The blueprint will generate an Ionic client, complete with screens for editing entities, unit tests, and end-to-end tests with Cypress.</p>
 
 
<p>Pretty slick, don’t you think?!
😎</p>
 
 
 Run your Spring Boot API 
 
<p>You’ll need to start your backend first, so your Ionic app can talk to its API.
First, start Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker containers:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd backend
npm run ci:e2e:prepare # starts Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, update <code>backend/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code> to allow CORS from <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100'
    allowed-methods: '*'
    allowed-headers: '*'
    exposed-headers: 'Authorization,Link,X-Total-Count,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-alert,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-error,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-params'
    allow-credentials: true
    max-age: 1800</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, start the backend app using <code>./mvnw -Pprod</code>.
You should be able to log in at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> (with <code>admin/admin</code>) and add new photos using Entities &gt; Photos.
Add a few photos so you have some data to work with.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app 
 
<p>Open another terminal and navigate to the <code>ionic-app</code> folder.
Launch your Ionic client using  <code>npm start</code>.
In your default browser, the app will be opened at <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You should be able to log in with Keycloak and see all the listed entities in your app.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>In the JHipster app’s tutorial, there’s a section where you’re instructed to remove photo fields that can be calculated.
Specifically, height, width, date taken, and date uploaded.
These values are calculated when the photos are uploaded, so there’s no reason to display them when adding a photo.</p>
 
 
<p>To add this same functionality to your Ionic app, modify <code>src/app/pages/entities/photo/photo-update.html</code> and wrap these fields with <code>&lt;div *ngIf="!isNew"&gt;</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;div *ngIf="!isNew"&gt;
  &lt;ion-item&gt;
    &lt;ion-label position="floating"&gt;Height&lt;/ion-label&gt;
    &lt;ion-input type="number" name="height" formControlName="height"&gt;&lt;/ion-input&gt;
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;
  ...
  &lt;ion-item&gt;
    &lt;ion-label&gt;Uploaded&lt;/ion-label&gt;
    &lt;ion-datetime displayFormat="MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm" formControlName="uploaded" id="field_uploaded"&gt;&lt;/ion-datetime&gt;
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The Ionic CLI will auto-compile and reload the app in your browser when you save this file.
You can prove everything works as expected by stopping your app (with Ctrl+C) and running all the end-to-end tests with Cypress.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app on iOS using Capacitor 
 
 
<p>Generate a native iOS project with the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx ionic build
npx ionic capacitor add ios</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add your custom scheme (<code>dev.localhost.ionic</code>) to <code>ios/App/App/Info.plist</code>.
This scheme is configured in <code>src/environments/environment.ts</code>; you can easily change it to something else if you like.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
  &lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.getcapacitor.capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;dev.localhost.ionic&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
  &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the JHipster app’s CORS settings (in <code>backend/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code>) to allow <code>capacitor://localhost</code> as an origin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100,capacitor://localhost'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your backend app.
Deploy your Ionic app to iOS Simulator and run it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx cap run ios</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Confirm you can log in and rejoice in your success!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app on Android 
 
 
<p>Generate an Android project with Capacitor.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx ionic capacitor add android</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Enable clear text traffic and add <code>dev.localhost.ionic</code> as a scheme in <code>android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;activity ... android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"&gt;
  &lt;!-- You'll need to add this intent filter so redirects work --&gt;
  &lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" /&gt;
    &lt;data android:scheme="dev.localhost.ionic" /&gt;
    &lt;!--data android:scheme="com.okta.dev-133337" /--&gt;
  &lt;/intent-filter&gt;

  &lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;
  &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the JHipster app’s CORS settings to allow <code>http://localhost</code> as an origin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100,capacitor://localhost,http://localhost'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your backend app and run your Ionic app on Android using the Capacitor CLI:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx cap run android</code> 
 
 
 






If you get an error when running this command, make sure to use Java 11.



 
 
<p>You’ll need to run a couple of commands to allow the emulator to communicate with JHipster and Keycloak.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
adb reverse tcp:9080 tcp:9080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should be able to log in and edit entities, just like you can in a browser and on iOS!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Why use OpenID Connect for mobile apps? 
 
 
<p>Storing <a>API keys and secrets in mobile apps is not safe</a>.
OAuth 2.0 solves this problem by not shipping any secrets in mobile apps and instead involving the user in the process of getting an access token into the app.
These access tokens are unique per user, and they’re updated every time the user logs in.
The <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/">PKCE extension</a> provides a solution for securely doing the OAuth flow on a mobile app even when there is no pre-provisioned secret.</p>
 
 
<p>If you need to access an API from a mobile app, hopefully, it supports OAuth and PKCE!
Thankfully most of the hard work of PKCE is handled by SDKs like <a href="https://appauth.io/">AppAuth</a>, so you don’t have to write all that code yourself.
If you’re working with an API like Okta, then Okta’s SDKs do PKCE automatically, so you don’t have to worry about it.
The JHipster Ionic blueprint uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionic-appauth">Ionic AppAuth</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The previous sections showed you how to use Keycloak as your identity provider. If you’re deploying to production, you might not want to manage your users and authentication system. That’s where Okta and Auth0 can help!</p>
 
 
 Switch your identity provider to Okta 
 
<p>If you don’t have an Okta developer account, you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">sign up for one</a> or run <code>okta register</code> after installing the Okta CLI.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to change your JHipster app to use Okta, the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> makes this as easy as <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>.
This command creates a <code>.okta.env</code> file you can source to override the default Keycloak settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .okta.env
./mvnw -Pprod</code> 
 
 
 
<p>With Keycloak, you don’t need a separate OIDC app for Ionic.
With Okta, you do.
See JHipster’s documentation to learn <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#create-a-native-app-for-mobile-on-okta">how to create a native app for Ionic on Okta</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>After you’ve changed the client ID in your Ionic app, run it using <code>npm start</code>.
You’ll be prompted to log in using your Okta credentials at <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 Switch your identity provider to Auth0 
 
<p>To switch your identity provider to Auth0, you first need an <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">Auth0 account</a>.
Then, create a <code>.auth0.env</code> file and see <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#auth0">JHipster’s Auth0 docs</a> for how to populate it.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#create-a-native-app-for-mobile-on-auth0">configure a native app for Ionic on Auth0</a>.
Once you’re finished updating your Ionic app with a new client ID and audience, you should be able to run your backend and new frontend client using the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .auth0.env
npm run backend:start

 Learn more about Ionic, Spring Boot, and JHipster 
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning about Ionic and the new Ionic blueprint for JHipster.
In my opinion, it’s pretty neat that you can rapidly prototype a mobile client for your JHipster.
It’s even better that you can use a leading-edge mobile application framework to do it.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example">@oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example</a> repository.</p>

<p>What if semiconductor manufacturers made chips especially intended for crypto-wallets? That’s the topic of Blockchain Commons’ first <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Silicon Salon</a>, which will feature two different chip manufacturers who are expanding into the crypto industry. The first is CrossBar, a leader in Resistive RAM (ReRAM) technology, which can implement high-performance physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Together, ReRAM memory and PUF solutions enable a new class of secure computing and storage with physical countermeasures — and CrossBar is interested in bringing that to digital-asset management. The second is Tropic Square, whose tropic01 secure element offers a fully transparent and auditable chip as a basis for better hardware security. They use transparency as a driver for innovation.</p>

<p>Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to bringing together a community of developers and manufacturers to jointly develop specifications that will empower the entire industry, we’ve seized upon our work with these two companies to produce our first salon since the pandemic: a virtual Silicon Salon, where semiconductor manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and other interested parties can come together to talk about the next generation of semiconductors, which for the first time ever will be specialized for our cryptographic needs.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon is scheduled for June 1st, running three hours beginning at 9am PT (noon ET, 6pm CET). Signups for the Salon are now available on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Eventbrite</a>, with tickets limited to the first 40 participants.</p>



<p>The first hour of the Salon will feature presentations from silicon manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and experts in the field about how semiconductor design can support cryptographic functionality. Companies CrossBar, Tropic Square, and Proxy and experts Bryan Bishop and Christopher Allen are all scheduled to talk.</p>

<p>The other two hours of the Salon will feature facilitated discussion of topics intended to determine the needs of the hardware-wallet community. Specific topics may include: the importance of MCU and secure enclave integration; the importance of secure and persistent storage; the need for physical countermeasures; the advantages of hardware and software cryptography; the use of open licenses for hardware; and discussions of how new semiconductor designs intended for cryptography can improve security and efficiency. We don’t have all the answers: one of the most important goals of the salon is to find out the needs and thoughts of the community!</p>

<p>We hope you’ll <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">join us</a> to learn a bit about what’s already going on and to share your ideas, requirements, and expertise!</p>

<p>We are limiting the number of attendees to allow for Q&amp;A from the community, thus we are charging US$25 to hold a space at this unique virtual event. So <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">sign up</a> soon! If you are already a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/sponsors.html">Patron</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">monthly sponsor on Github</a> of Blockchain Commons, please check your email: we will be sending you a free invite code automatically.

<p>In traditional banking, to get a loan, make a deposit or speak to a banker, customers have usually traveled to a physical branch.</p>
 
<p>But today, more banking services are available digitally. As a complement to existing online banking services, innovators are building the new and improved financial experiences that consumers are looking for. These innovators may not even have a brick-and-mortar presence, but they add multiple layers of value on top of existing financial services.</p>
 
<p>The digital movement is giving customers more tools and options to build their financial lives in the way they see fit, and Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) is making this possible. Customers can now turn to innovators who offer niche financial services that cater to their unique needs, creating new ways for them to split dinner bills, take out a microloan, invest in crypto, track spending, saving and more.</p>
 
<p>But creating a new fintech company, app or product has not been simple. The traditional path to creating financial services was a long, hard road, from getting a banking license to building a new tech stack. Synctera is one fintech that offers an easier on-ramp to new, innovative financial products through BaaS. BaaS platforms and technology solutions provide the building blocks necessary for a fintech or neobank to quickly start creating innovative financial use cases for the modern consumer.</p>
 
<p>Synctera acts as a fintech banking platform, connecting a fintech builder with a community bank that has the requisite banking license. On the development side, Synctera provides an end-to-end toolkit, offering the critical technology services and providers that help innovators build their ideas. This includes consumer-permissioned data for account verification through Mastercard’s open banking platform, to help bring financial service ideas like quick money movement to life.</p>
 Modularizing banking solutions 
<p>All the things an entrepreneur needs in order to offer a banking service—including the ability to accept deposits, make loans and payments — BaaS service providers like Synctera encapsulate into the application programming interface (API) as modular blocks, so a fintech can tap in and build new solutions. Whether it’s issuing cards, sending ACH payments or more basic financial operations, developers can take these blocks and reassemble them to meet their needs.</p>
 
<p>The key to building with a BaaS provider is having just one API that’s simple to connect to. This reduces architecture and modeling requirements on the fintech development side. These tools allow fintechs to set up new customer accounts without delays from microdeposits, using instant verification, enabling customers to connect their external accounts and transfer funds into new financial services faster.</p>
 
<p>Another advantage of BaaS: Since multiple solutions are offered in the same API, it’s easy to make changes. If a company that’s scaling up tries an account authentication solution that’s slow and not quickly verifying that customer accounts are funded, they can replace it seamlessly with an alternate solution. That means less disruption to operations; money can keep moving.</p>
 Offering a marketplace of options 
<p>BaaS wraps all of its services, including those developed in-house and those from outside developers, into one API marketplace to make it easy for fintechs to launch everything together. Instead of trying to integrate tech from multiple financial services partners, a fintech developer can come to a BaaS provider like Synctera and build more, with less overhead and less plumbing.</p>
 
<p>Working with a BaaS provider allows fintech builders to focus more on the features of the product they’re offering to customers, like offering a virtual storefront to artists, discounted pet insurance to pet owners or easier access to small business capital. The marketplace solution means a fintech could choose a waterfall approach; if one solution fails, the system can be set up to automatically try another one.</p>
 How Mastercard fits in 
<p>Consumer-permissioned financial data can also be piped into BaaS solutions. Mastercard’s open banking platform provides secure connections to consumer-permissioned financial data from 95% of bank deposit accounts in the U.S. This data can power use cases like credit decisioning, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/digital-account-opening-report/">account opening</a> and linking. It creates more choice in <a href="https://www.finicity.com/payment-open-banking-effect/">payments</a> and transaction data for better financial insights.</p>
 
<p>Every fintech product needs financial data, the ability to manage consumer permission and to access those accounts. It’s one thing to have a customer knock on your door. It’s another to help them walk through the door without unnecessary obstacles blocking their way, and to make the first deposit into their new accounts happen quickly and compliantly.</p>
 
<p>Mastercard’s open banking platform provides consumer-permissioned data to power the tools that Synctera and other BaaS providers and innovators create. By using account verification and transaction data from Mastercard’s open banking platform, all ecosystem players can authenticate users and get them online fast, and in a compliant manner.</p>
 Fraud detection and speed are of utmost importance 
<p>Understandably, the risk, compliance and customer experience balance is delicate–efficiency can’t compromise fraud prevention. By adding open banking data to the BaaS platform, financial service providers can verify and access bank account data with instant account verification, helping to ensure that the person opening a new account actually owns the account they are linking to the new fintech app, before moving money.</p>
 
<p>Speed is another top concern for fintech builders. And since banks are not tech companies, many operate on pre-internet tech. COBOL, a programming language developed in 1959 that underpins many banking systems, can make it difficult to upgrade systems quickly, or to seamlessly connect with today’s technology. This can result in a speed mismatch between banking networks and the world of fintechs, who want to be able to release new products and services in a few weeks. Mastercard helps connect customer accounts quickly and speeds up the customer onboarding process.</p>
 
<p>There’s a lot of new and improved technology being created in the world of financial services, and more options for developers result in more next-gen products that help consumers on their financial journeys.</p>

 Over the past few years we’ve seen the development and standardization of the concept of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>. Built on blockchain technology, decentralized identity provides a strong foundation for a much-improved privacy experience for a user – and it has been&nbsp;called the most important privacy innovation for the coming decade.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Anonyome Lab’s Sudo Platform provides enterprise developers with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;capability to use for their applications and users. The platform offers both client- and service-side capabilities.</p>



 



Sudo Platform identity components.



 



<p>You can see above some of the key areas of decentralized identity development within Anonyome Labs. On the left side, we have how a user can leverage decentralized identity capabilities within the context of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo digital identities</a>. This extends&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;of digital interactions into decentralized identity-based interactions.</p>



 



 On the right of the diagram are the current areas of decentralized identity development within the Sudo Platform: 



<p></p>



  Identity Wallet&nbsp;– A user-controlled local data store that safeguards a Sudo’s decentralized identity identifier (DID), cryptographic keys, verifiable credentials, and other artifacts for use with issuers, verifiers, public ledgers, and other third parties. The wallet supports multiple devices, cloud backup and recovery.  



  Mobile Agent&nbsp;– Usually an app that lets users interact with the Identity Wallet, as well as enabling various external activities, such as interacting with any standards-based public ledger, streamlining the login process to accounts and services, providing end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer interaction, assisting users with the request and presentation of verifiable credentials, and more.  



  DI Relay&nbsp;– The DI Relay (i.e., decentralized identity relay)&nbsp;provides mobile agents with an&nbsp;always onconnection point that facilitates user-to-user and user-to-service communications. Without an always on relay, mobile agents wouldn’t be able to communicate reliably with each other.  



  Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;– The Sudo Platform issuer service&nbsp;can create verifiable credentials. The issuer service first registers a credential definition on the blockchain which references an existing schema as well as registers the issuer service’s DID and public key.&nbsp;<br><br>Using their mobile agent, a user can request a verifiable credential from the issuer service. The new credential will be securely transmitted to the user’s mobile agent, which will secure it in the user’s identity wallet.<br><br>Additionally, via their mobile agents, users can present their verifiable credentials to a verifier, including the Sudo Platform’s verifier service. The user will be prompted to approve (or deny) presenting all of the requested verifiable credential claims, just some claims, or may even elect to only provide zero knowledge proof.<br><br>  Encrypted Messaging (end-to-end)&nbsp;– Whether used for user-to-user, user-to-service, or service-to-service communication, messages are encrypted end-to-end using peer-to-peer connections secured using the DIDComm protocol.  



 



<p>Next week, in part 4, we’ll outline the benefits to enterprises from proactively adopting decentralized identity.</p>

 A deep dive into the current state of crypto regulation, the FATF Travel Rule, and how our recently-launched solution, Veriscope, has solved the unsolvable: the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue. <p>On May 4th at 11:00 am EST, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> launched the debut edition of the Unhosted Webinar Series, with 80 attendees joining. It was presented by Shyft Network and <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope’s </a>Head of Strategy for Global Regulatory and Compliance Solutions, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/bitmex-compliance-chief-malcolm-wright-jumps-to-shyft-network/">Malcolm&nbsp;Wright</a>.</p><p>The webinar’s theme was the current state of crypto regulation, the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf">FATF Travel Rule</a>, and how Shyft Network’s recently-launched solution, Veriscope, has solved the unsolvable: the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue.</p><p>We’ve also done a short re-cap of the key themes and challenges discussed in the&nbsp;Webinar:</p> FATF Recommendations on Virtual&nbsp;Assets <p>Financial Action Task Force, the global anti money-laundering &amp; terrorism financing watchdog, has made recommendations to prevent the use of virtual assets in illicit activities. Countries are required to adopt these recommendations within a definite period of time, which will then become a guideline for the industry to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>After countries implement FATF recommendations, the global watchdog will make periodic assessments on the implementation of the guidelines. Countries that fail to receive satisfactory scores on various parameters can be penalized by FATF, which can affect their financial standing globally and impact their ability to obtain funding from external sources, such as the World Bank and the&nbsp;IMF.</p> The Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The Travel Rule is the most crucial recommendation on virtual assets issued, to date, by FATF. It was adopted in June 2019 when FATF issued draft guidelines. Then, during the first (June 2020) &amp; second (June 2021) assessments, FATF found that countries and industries are still not following its recommendations. Then, in October 2021, FATF issued its final guidelines on virtual assets &amp; Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).</p><blockquote>Under the Travel Rule, both originator and beneficiary VASPs must store and exchange certain personally identifiable information, such as the customer’s name, wallet address, location, national ID number, and DOB. They must also present the information to authorities when requested.</blockquote> Risk of Sanctions <p>Although Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and blockchain analytics are among the must-have tools that VASPs should have to ensure sanctioned parties cannot find a way around sanctions through virtual assets, they aren’t enough to mitigate the sanctions risk.</p><p>To fully comply with the FATF recommendations, it is crucial to know both parties involved in the transaction, which requires the implementation of the Travel Rule. Failing to comply with FATF recommendations can result in sanctions from authorities, which can yield devastating results.</p><p>To mitigate the risks, ensure GeoIP monitoring, proper KYC with name screening, implement blockchain analytics, and Travel Rule. Following these steps enables businesses with a significant amount of business volume outside their jurisdiction to have a solid defense against any potential sanction violation.</p> The Challenges  1. Poor Data&nbsp;Accuracy <p>Receiving incomplete or inaccurate data from the originator or beneficiary VASPs can result in significant challenges, such as increased customer support &amp; compliance costs, failed payments, and poor customer experience.</p><blockquote>Shyft Network’s Veriscope has implemented automated discovery of counterparty VASP through the token’s address to solve this problem. Also, Veriscope has automated exchange of personally identifiable information (PII) of both originator and beneficiary to ensure 100% accuracy.</blockquote> 2. Data&nbsp;Security <p>Storing PII on Travel Rule Service Provider’s (TRSP) infrastructure can result in internal and external hacking attacks, intermediaries meddling in and snooping on the data, and malicious actors exploiting the entire process to obtain counterparty PII by submitting fake transactions. There are also challenges to storing PII without user&nbsp;consent.</p><blockquote>The solution? Veriscope. It offers data security through three measures.</blockquote><blockquote>(i) User consents every time before PII is&nbsp;shared.</blockquote><blockquote>(ii) PII is encrypted and off-chain to prevent malicious actors from accessing the user&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>(iii) The transmission of PII data between VASPs is through peer-to-peer mode only, which means Shyft Network does not handle PII at any point in&nbsp;time.</blockquote> 3. Know Your VASP&nbsp;(KYV) <p>Opting for just any average TRSP comes with a fair share of challenges. First, all data that a VASP relies on is collected by the TRSP; with such TRSPs, there is no option to choose a counterparty VASP. Then, there is the issue of inaccurate VASP discovery, as it may fail to capture granular data at the entity&nbsp;level.</p><blockquote>Veriscope’s design mechanism enables it to solve these complex problems swiftly. It ensures that PII data is sent to the correct VASP entity and that the network participants have undergone due diligence at internationally recognized standards. It is also highly scalable and can easily accommodate the growing needs of both legal and operational teams.</blockquote> 4. Payment Screening <p>The usual approach to obtaining beneficiary data is to collect the information from the originator. There are several issues with this approach. For instance, such data can be incomplete or inaccurate, further complicating screening efforts. It can even lead to higher exposure to sanctions risk.</p><blockquote>Veriscope has implemented a mechanism that mandates obtaining beneficiary data from the beneficiary VASP. Shyft Network’s approach ensures that the data is accurate and complete, resulting in efficient name screening. That’s not all, as it also enables VASPs to request any additional information through the RFFI&nbsp;process.</blockquote> Sunrise Problem: A Major Roadblock in Implementing the Travel Rule&nbsp;(Recap) <p>The most significant problem that VASPs face in implementing Travel Rule is the Sunrise issue. The problem is that countries have adopted or will adopt the Travel Rule into local regulations at different times. Thus, most VASPs located in jurisdictions that have not yet adopted the Travel Rule are unlikely to have a Travel Rule Solution and will issues for those VASPs who do have a Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>Recent data suggests there are over 600 cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Depending on their jurisdiction, they may or may not have adopted the Travel Rule yet. That’s where the problem lies, as the countries that have adopted the Travel Rule may mandate compliance both domestically and internationally. So, a compliant VASP must obtain data from the counterparty VASP regardless of their compliance status. If the compliant VASP fails to comply with the rule, they may receive severe penalties.</p><p>Suppose a VASP based in a country that has adopted the FATF Travel Rule (VASP A) sends Requests for Information (RFI) to a VASP operating in a country yet to adopt the Travel Rule (VASP B) on day zero (April 1st, 2022). They may or may not provide the information. After all, they are not legally obligated to do so yet. But VASP B will want to respond after the country they are based in implements the regulations. Meanwhile, without the necessary information, how can VASP A be compliant? This problem is referred to as the sunrise&nbsp;problem.</p><p>So, what’s the solution here? Veriscope. Thanks to Veriscope’s Historic Look Back feature, whenever VASP B’s home country adopts the Travel Rule, they can sign up for the solution and access all the RFIs sent to them even before they were legally required to comply with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Let’s say the VASP B joins six months after day zero (October 1st, 2022). They will see all the RFIs when they join and can respond to all of them. So, VASP A &amp; VASP B finally successfully exchanged the information required under the Travel Rule because of Shyft’s Veriscope.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner. Shyft Network allows and gives incentives to individuals and enterprises to work together to add context to data, unlocking the ability to build authentic digital reputation, identity, and credibility frameworks.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">Medium</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/z65MC5JkrG">Discord</a></p>

 From Start-up to Scale-Up: How Tokeny Prepared for Large-Scale Tokenization 
<p>Our solutions now become more scalable and flexible as we have our own indexer and nodes to interact with relevant data on the blockchain. This improvement eliminates any downtime for our services and enlarges our capacity to handle thousands of tokens in parallel.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the Product Focus newsletter April &amp; May 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Scalability is one of our top priorities as we are working with large financial institutions with very high volumes anticipated. We regularly run intense scalability tests and a few months ago, we concluded that we should reduce our dependence on some third parties to provide faster and enterprise-grade solutions. This newsletter explains how we became more autonomous and scalable by running our own blockchain Indexer and nodes:</p>
 Blockchain data Indexer 
<p>In order to build the real-time cap table of token holders with fully accurate information, our <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> needs to&nbsp;scan and read the&nbsp;blockchain to index relevant transactions&nbsp;happening to the ERC-3643 tokens and ONCHAINIDs. Technically, it can be very challenging for complex operations, and tools like The Graph, the “Google for blockchains”, enables developers like us to tackle these issues.</p>
<p>However, in our testing, we encountered some upcoming limitations as the use of these third party tools and protocols can be slow and requires some manual procedures. Therefore,&nbsp;we decided to build our own Indexer technology, enabling automated token indexing that can be completed within minutes, without any downtime, for thousands of tokens in parallel.</p>
<p>Also, we realized that many Web3 applications were having trouble interacting with blockchain through third-party services,&nbsp; so we decided to improve this as well:</p>
 Blockchain connector (Remote Procedure Call)&nbsp; 
<p>A RPC is a set of protocols and interfaces that enables a software to&nbsp;interact with the blockchain, to read and write, similar to a website interacting with a server. In blockchain terms, a server is referred to as a node, a synced database of the blockchain. Most applications use Infura to do so; it provides RPCs and AWS-like services for nodes, so developers don’t need to build a RPC or manage their own nodes.</p>
<p>Due to Infura’s popularity, blockchain applications become less decentralized and it could become a single point of failure, such as the time it went down because of a service outage one week ago, causing many dApps, including MetaMask, to not function.</p>
<p>It became obvious to us that we had to run our own nodes and build our own RPC to provide better services for our customers. As a result, we have built a system that we can monitor, scale, and rapidly fix if needed.&nbsp;We even enabled switchable RPCs to keep the T-REX Platforms always available by monitoring the state of nodes to connect with functional nodes including our own nodes and third party nodes (e.g. Infura, Alchemy, …).</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We are proud of our tech team, especially our DevOps Engineer Cyrille, Lead Core Developer José and Senior Full Stack Developer Mihalis, for their hard work to complete these improvements. We will continue pushing the limit to provide the most advanced, flexible and secure solutions for you.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: You might have heard of eIDAS before, especially if you are in the payment industry. But now in the recent years, the European Commission is working on a new version, eIDAS 2.0. We’re going to talk about that and especially from the perspective of Finland. We have a special guest who has been working in Finland. And our special guest today is Bo Harald.</p>
<p>He started his career in banking in the 1970s by promoting and building electronic banking, payments, and e-business services. He developed Nordea’s Electronic Banking and payments operation for 30 years, after which he started working with TietoEvry as the Head of Executive Advisors.</p>
<p>He has also served as the Chairman of the EU Expert Group on Electronic Invoicing, the Chairman of Mobey, Mobile Financial Services Forum, and has held and holds directorships in various companies and associations. He has been named as one of the most influential technologists of the 20th century by Institutional Investor, and has been awarded for advancing the Information Society by the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications.</p>
<p>Bo currently works as an independent advisor at Findy.fi, a Senior Advisor at the Finnish Council of Regulatory Impact Analysis, a Founder and Steering Committee member at MyData.org, and with the publicly funded, Real Time Economy programme.</p>
<p>Hello, Bo.</p>
<p>Bo Harald: Hello, and thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure, Bo. Thanks for joining us. And definitely, I want to hear all these very interesting things about eIDAS 2.0. So let’s start, let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. We’d like to hear from your very extensive and varied background in banking and technology. Please tell us a bit more about your career journey – how everything until today working in the Finnish eIDAS 2.0 workgroups.</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, it’s a long ladder, and I want to call it a ladder. It started back in the late ’70s, when we developed the first versions of home banking, the PC banking in the very early 1980s for private customers at Union Bank of Finland, and nowadays Nordea. And also for SMEs long before internet. And the first step was obviously with payments, invoice payments, typically, bill payments. And then we moved on to put all banking services actually into e-banking before internet already. And so that was the first phase.</p>
<p>The second phase was about interconnecting bank customers, not only with payments, but also with e-identification, e-signatures, e-invoice and e-salary, for example. This was a very important step when you look at the benefits for society at large, you get the economy of trust the economic reuse, the economic repetition, the economy of scale, and all that.</p>
<p>And from here, when internet then came in the mid ’90s, we had already half a million people on e-banking in Finland. And we were the biggest bank in e-banking in the world, in absolute terms for many, many years, all the way to Nordea.</p>
<p>So from here, we established then the public-private real time economic programme, focusing very much on e-invoicing, accounting automation, real time income register for the tax authorities. And that’s what I tried to also promote when I was the Chairman for the EU Commission Expert Group.</p>
<p>The next phase, if I condense this ladder, was the MyData principles that started to grow out in 2016, putting the citizen in control of all of his or her data, naturally supported by the legal promise from GDPR in Europe. But we could see at that early stage that there was no practical way of getting this data to travel from the enterprises that had the legal obligation to send it and that’s where we started to look for a new solution in 2017 and ’18.</p>
<p>And there we could see that Self-Sovereign Identity and Trust over IP was the solution to go forward with. And we established this public-private Findy cooperative as the solution. And it was a real eye-opener and this is soon coming to eIDAS to see that we were able to solve the pressing need for being able to trade and issue non listed, unlisted shares.</p>
<p>And there you have this pretty tricky situation that you need to serve private shareholders, organisational shareholders, the issuer, the state, the trade registry, the banks, for payments, for trading, for settlement, for delivery, for keeping up the registers. But when you issued all of these parties, with the same generic wallets or fact wallets, we prefer to call them fact wallets – identity wallets is the other name for it. Then it was astonishingly easy to interconnect these parties – four coders, four months, and it worked like a dream.</p>
<p>So that’s when I got the eyes open for the eIDAS architecture needs. That’s the ladder. And actually, the ladder is important to understand that you should have all the ranks or the steps on it, you know, enabled to rise to the higher platforms in between. That was the path, my path.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, very, of course, been long, long journey and super interesting all the type of projects you have been involved. And now, you are working very heavily on eIDAS, especially this new version 2.0. If you can tell us about that but also tell us for the ones who are not so familiar, what is eIDAS? And then tell us the difference between the current eIDAS 1.0 and the new one, eIDAS 2.0.</p>
<p>Bo: Yes, eIDAS 1.0 and eIDAS 2.0 are two entirely different things. eIDAS 1.0 failed. It was focusing on cross-border identification services with pretty stiff requirements. And there were two things missing that led to the failure – supply and demand. There is such a limited need for identifying citizens, organisations, cross-border. And in the Nordic countries, we already have extremely well-functioning identification services in place, mainly run by the banks in Finland, also teleoperators are involved, I think that may be the only country in the world where teleoperators are doing this as well. It’s good with competition.</p>
<p>But when you talk about eIDAS 2.0, it’s not a question of identification, it’s a question of identity. And that’s a totally different thing. You could say that the identity is built from credentials from all sorts of sources in the private sector, in the public sector, statements about your knowledge, your skills, your vaccinations, where you live. We’re disclosing as little as possible, thousands of different statements that build a person’s identity all the way to – you might call it a “digital twin”.</p>
<p>And, here, obviously, eIDAS 2.0 is promising that every European will get a wallet issued by qualified issuers, possibly also by the states, if needed. And these wallets are then the ones where you will get these credentials, statements, the verified data about you when you need it.</p>
<p>So that’s a big difference between eIDAS 1.0 and eIDAS 2.0. And obviously eIDAS 2.0 is an absolutely enormous opportunity for the economy at large on the one hand, and for building a real single digital market on the other hand.</p>
<p>Oscar: As you have mentioned wallets, earlier you mentioned fact wallets or identity wallets, does it already exist? Just to understand that concept better, could you describe how it would be in practice? Is there anything like that today so we can have an idea?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah. There are already wallets out there, pretty many, many versions of them actually. Obviously, Europe is working on trying to establish what kind of standards such a wallet should have, be it then an application in your mobile phone, which seems to be very much in focus now, mainly serving citizens, also, perhaps smaller enterprises.</p>
<p>But obviously, these kinds of applications or wallets, ID wallets or rather fact wallets, are also needed by larger organisations. And then the mobile application is not the solution, but an application, a computer or in the cloud. But obviously, all these wallets, be they then in a mobile or in a computer or in the cloud, should be interoperable by design. That’s the whole idea here.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yeah, understanding now the, what is this new concept of eIDAS 2.0 based on identities that you say in wallets, tell us more about the opportunities that this new framework is going to provide for the future across Europe.</p>
<p>Bo: Yes, I’m very happy to see that the commission work is really embracing Self-Sovereign Identity, which is obviously the standard, and I can’t see any alternative to that. And in many, many countries already Trust Over IP stacks are the starting point like they are here in Finland, and have been already for five years.</p>
<p>And here, what will happen is that the data rights holder, you as a citizen, or you as working for a company, you are in the driver’s seat. You can go to a data source, public or private, and say, that now I have a life event of this sort, looking for a job, establishing a company, somebody has died in the near family, which is the most stressful life event, and thousands of other life events, and now I need the data from all of these, all relevant sources. And I have a wallet, and the wallet is helping me to find those sources. And then I get the data to my wallet. And then I go to a service provider of my choice, I have this data and you are specialising in this particular life event. If I need financing, it may be a bank. And could you please take care of the need.</p>
<p>And the beauty of this is these three parties, the data rights holder with the wallet, the source and the service provider do not need to be technically integrated, do not need to be technically integrated. Because in this infrastructure, the technical connection is handled in the infrastructure, which is very cheap to build, of course, it needs rulebooks. And that’s the whole beauty of it.</p>
<p>Obviously, this infrastructure, we call it the data highway here in Finland is used both by the public sector and the private sector. That’s a no brainer, like a road is open to everyone to use. And it should obviously be a non-profit organisation that handles this. That’s why we have established this in the cooperatives to do that. So that’s how it works. And it’s not that difficult to understand, actually.</p>
<p>The benefits of Self-Sovereign Identity are absolutely enormous to reducing risk and friction in the economy at large. It’s of course, improving automation. It’s protecting privacy like nothing we have seen before. It’s preventing crime and grey economy. And this book that I mentioned to you, Self-Sovereign Identity by Drummond Reed, is quoting sources saying that the cost of cybercrime is something in the region of $6 trillion. So that’s a kind of a big picture. McKinsey for its part estimates the benefits of the trust infrastructure to be 3% to 6% of GDP, depending on the maturity of a country.</p>
<p>So this is an absolutely massive step forward. Some people say that this is more important than Internet, I agree. And some people say that the fact wallet is at least as important as the internet browser was when internet started. So you can see that this is something that every state, every government should actually do everything they can, and obviously, European Union to happen as fast as possible. We have no time to lose in this world. But they cannot do it on their own. And they are– the clever governments understand that they have to do this hand-in-hand with the Self-Sovereign Identity experts and the enterprises that are working in that field, and that’s the way it works in Finland.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely the way you say it sounds like there are definitely plenty of benefits. And yeah, we hope to see these benefits in the near future definitely.</p>
<p>Bo: Oh, I mean, it’s a kind of a responsibility of any government that are looking for reducing crime and improving privacy and above all, naturally, getting the productivity in place and the benefits of data according to the MyData principles. And this is the really only practical way I can see that they could implement the MyData principles, protecting people’s data. I’ve seen during 40 years of digital work, I’ve seen a lot of important things, but this is the biggest by far.</p>
<p>And if you want to go into the wallets, which will get a lot of so-called credentials or statements, verify data, the e-receipt is something of the highest volume. And even the lines in the e-receipts, if you look at the number of lines in e-receipts and e-invoices in Finland, and both of them will in a couple of years’ time be the only kind accepted legally. In accounting, there are some 20 billion of them every year and these can– each line can be verified on its own. So it will be by far the biggest volume of credentials sitting delivered from the seller’s wallet to the buyer’s wallet, be the buyer or seller private or an organisation.</p>
<p>And the reuse of this e-receipt is a fantastic opportunity. We all know what travel expense means for all of us. We know how difficult it is to get financing in enterprises, and you have an invoice there, verified by the buyer, it’s so much easier for insurance companies. In Finland only there is a calculation saying that about 100 million can be saved when e-receipts are actually available. And obviously the insurance fraud is a big issue in any country. That’s just one example. But there are any number of them that– what is the– when you get a verified data statement, a credential that can be used in so many different places.</p>
<p>Oscar: So the e-receipts is also part of eIDAS 2.0?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, it’s not directly but I mean, when you have eIDAS 2.0 in the right way. And I’m a little bit worried, I have to admit, about the Commission’s, let’s say, level of understanding of the importance of this 3% to 6% of GDP. They are focusing, in my opinion, too much on the private wallets and not enough on the enterprise wallets, to get the real benefit. If you focus only on private wallets, and for example, then government-issued credentials, then you get to a point 0% or 0.1% perhaps of the benefits. But when you have a full picture then you can get 90% of the enormous, enormous benefits.</p>
<p>That’s why I wrote this <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/22017/open-letter-to-the-eu-commission">open letter</a>, which can be found in my LinkedIn account. Also, if somebody’s interested to the Commission, but we should understand how big this step can be if it’s done correctly, and not only looking at some sort of additional identification tool and only government-issued credentials.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, we’re going to add this, I read your open letter to EU Commission. So yeah, we’re going to add it also to the show notes of this episode so people can read it, definitely. How can we centre the users’ needs while at the same time balancing organisational priorities in any new solution?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, this is a very good question and an important question, and I don’t have all of the answers here. But I have some basic answers based on my experience from banking, and so forth. I think that the, the mission and the– must always be the passion in any organisation that wants to be successful is to think hard about what the customers need tomorrow. And it’s a familiar phrase is that you should never ask the customer what he needs, because he doesn’t know, you should know before he does.</p>
<p>And in this particular time now, I think it’s time to start all the service design from the customer’s life events. Both data is needed for this live event and where does it sit? How can the data be verified and available in real time? The value of data arriving one second faster is quite different from the one that comes later. And it’s then in this particular setting, natural for many, many organisations to issue these wallets, be they in a mobile phone or in a computer. And also then include the National ID, invite the government to make the root idea, the electronic ID card into these wallets, so that it can be used for opening bank accounts and whatnot, where this is always needed according to the law, at least in the Nordics, but also other credentials from the public sector.</p>
<p>Then you can produce fantastic value for the customers, be they private customers or for SMEs who are going to take and actually charge. So that you [indiscernible] and the costs are not big, that is the fantastic feature here with open source technology and open data and open standards. So, I see that the solution will be that the role of public and private sector organisations will be, and is already, in GDPR supply data, but it should be verified data. The value of verified data is a thousand times more than just generic data. Also for machine learning and artificial intelligence, to supply that data to citizens and SME fact wallets and these are generic tools, generic tools, standardised interfaces all over the place.</p>
<p>The data rights holder as I said before here, then herself decides which service provider is best suited to use the data, to solve the need. And then in an ideal world, the public sector would not need to act as a service provider at all. They can let the enterprises do that on their own, and that will save a lot of taxpayers’ money. But of course, we have to see to it that there are no walled gardens built, that data is flowing freely, that you can always change your service provider without any lock ins, and that the competition is serving us all.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be that difficult because the whole Self-Sovereign Identity is built on open standards and no wall gardens and no technology and no– it’s a kind of religion in that so that’s why I feel so comfortable in promoting it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Now with your experience working in Finland in banking and several other projects until now, how can Europe – and even if we see it globally with initiatives like GAIN, the Global Assure Identity Network – how these can learn from the experiences in Finland and in the Nordics in general?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, I have to admit that I have failed miserably in one aspect. This e-identification services that GAIN is now looking at was started back in I think ’93 in Finland. And we have then taken it from here to the other Nordic countries so that the banks are actually the suppliers to the identification services. And I have been preaching this in conferences all over the world all the time, since then, and I have written any number of blogs, in the <a href="https://www.finextra.com/latest-blogs?memberid=43145">Finextra blog posts</a>, you can you can find it on frequently. That banks should be doing this and not only by their own will but should actually be forced into this kind of service by the government. Because they are so suited, because they are trusted, trusted institutions and the economic trust is immensely important and they are legislated into it because of the anti-money laundering legislation and all that.</p>
<p>And now GAIN is looking at it and unfortunately, it is very late. And now with the wallets, you don’t need it in the same time as– in the same way as you would have done it if you had started 20 years ago, 25 years ago as we did. But I didn’t get in my way, there has been so many different crises in banking that has taken away the attention. A little bit the same has happened also in electronic invoicing, banks woke up a little bit late. I can only look myself in the mirror.</p>
<p>But the lessons learned in Finland was that the economy of reuse and the economy of trust, using bank ID for identifying in all kinds of services was really, really important. It became a generic tool, both in your private role and in your work roles. And now, when you have this in overflow of everything – I mean, the attention span is– if it is eight seconds, still, it’s good. I mean, the goldfish has nine seconds. And everything else is overflowing except time and the value of something that you know already and trust is growing exponentially.</p>
<p>But now, I jump from there to the wallets, a generic wallet that you can use at home and at work supported by a generic public-private joint infrastructure is, of course, even more valuable, many times more valuable than the e-identification services provided by the banks. And this is something that not only the banking sector should be providing but many other sectors as well and everyone should naturally use it. So we have to live with the times and realise that people don’t have time to learn anything new if it can be avoided.</p>
<p>Oscar: Now, seeing the evolution because eIDAS 2.0 as I understand is still being cooked, let’s say, so it’s not completely finished. So how, let’s say smaller EU countries, and even individuals, who are really concerned about this or how is it going to be the standard and the standard coming can have more power to influence the commission decisions that is going to affect so many residents?</p>
<p>Bo: And this is a very critical question, an important question. And to get anything done now, the first thing to say is that even if you have the best public servants in the world, they are not Self-Sovereign Identity experts. Even if the European Commission has said that the Self-Sovereign Identity is at the core of eIDAS, they haven’t yet understood– had time to understood the full picture perhaps.</p>
<p>The remedy is that EU and any country, sit down with the public sector and say that OK, you government, you have realised that you can have 3% to 6% GDP benefits out of this Trust Infrastructure. And you do understand that your lawyers and economists and whatnot, they are not experts in building this radically new infrastructure. You have to do it together, in this public-private team, formulate the narrative. And some basic use cases like the receipts, or whatnot, so that the citizens will actually start asking for it, demanding it from their own government. That’s what you need.</p>
<p>And from Brussels, because we do understand that the Europe is the biggest economy in the world and if it becomes one single market, the benefit for everyone will be absolutely massive. And this is real – this trust infrastructure is a bigger step than Internet. And the fact wallet is the new browser. So we have to get people to understand how big this is.</p>
<p>And then the countries, once you have done it in your home country, then you join forces with others, like we now do with Sweden, Norway, and Germany, Holland, and so forth, and influence Brussels so that it is not overregulated, which will make it too expensive for small players, and actually just help large organisations to protect their positions. They have money enough to do this, even if it’s very regulated. So it’s important to see to it that the competition from the smaller guys is possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: So yeah, it’s important to, as you say, join forces, right, with the countries that have already– countries and organisations that are already active in… yeah, quite knowledgeable and active today.</p>
<p>Bo: Exactly. And that’s what they are doing now. Very happy to see that our neighbour Sweden has been quite keen to work together with the other countries also.</p>
<p>Oscar: And when is it expected to be ready, eIDAS 2.0?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, we’ve had a very tight timetable when it was launched. And we were of course quite happy about that last summer, it was announced and this was exactly what we had been hoping for, and even more. So that was good. But then it has now taken a lot of time and gone into overregulation aspects, which we fear and not enough understanding for the need for organisational wallets and of course or for wallets for things and bets and whatnot to get the full benefit.</p>
<p>So I’m, let’s say, prepared to wait half a year more if these aspects get into the drawings so that you can get the benefits out of it. The economic benefits and privacy benefits and single market benefits. So we must work hard to avoid, let’s say, minimal mobile application for citizens only. I don’t know how long it will take but probably not much will be seen how in way of use cases this year, next year should be a breakthrough year.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. In 2023, we’ll see some of the fruits at least will be available for people to use and as you say organisations as well, all together.</p>
<p>Bo: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla Excellent. Final question for you, Bo. For all business leaders listening to us now what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, this is of course a very challenging question. But if I choose from a long list of experiences from the past in electronic banking, electronic invoicing, e-identification services and all and how they come together and form the ladder. And when this ladder was– when they started to raise this ladder, we were happy enough to have hundreds and hundreds of bank branches that could do the selling on a personal basis to the individuals. Now, we are not really that many bank branches left anymore so it’s a new, it’s a new game, you have to do it without much personal selling.</p>
<p>So my simple line would be to say that, for God’s sake, do not serve your customer, to have a life event, with the fact wallets for all needed verified data into the wallet, and you have to do it closely together with the public sector. And they should also help with the financing because so much of the benefits will be for the society at large and only a small part for the enterprises and such. But this is the joint effort, the biggest one I’ve seen ever.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, thank you very much, Bo, for this very interesting conversation and shedding light about eIDAS 2.0 and everything that is, yeah, behind that. I definitely learned a lot from this conversation. I’m sure our audience had fun and also super interesting. If someone would like to hear more about you, or get in touch with you, or follow you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, I have such an unusual name so it’s easy to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bo-harald-4768b51/">find me on LinkedIn</a> and please feel free to contact me. I have <a href="https://www.finextra.com/latest-blogs?memberid=43145">written blogs for at least 10 years on Finextra</a>. So there, most of the material that I have myself produced can be found there in a fairly condensed form, not too long texts. So please feel free to use as much as you like.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, perfect. Again, thanks a lot, Bo, for this conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Bo: Thank you very much.</p>

				 Internet Identity Workshop IIWXXXIV <p>The 34th Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View, California was a major success. Our Trinsic team, sporting our Trinsic-blue Vans, gathered with hundreds of other buzzing minds to discuss the disruptive technologies and principles that are shaping the internet movements around us. The conference covered a wide array of topics with over 80 sessions held in the span of a few days. While we can’t begin to do a comprehensive overview of all of IIW, below are some key insights our team gained from this latest IIW.</p> &nbsp;  Building in Under 30 Minutes <p>IIW is the perfect staging ground for testing out ideas and experimenting with emerging technology. Keeping in tradition with other IIW conferences, our Trinsic team talked with new innovators this spring about building an SSI proof of concept in under 30 minutes. This year’s group taught us the following in regards to building and testing SSI proof of concepts:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  You truly can build a proof of concept in under an hour. The feasibility of building and testing a concept is not only thrilling but it also means we can make advancements in digital identity quicker. If testing is easier, more ideas can be brought to light which enables us to sift through and make headway in building better identity products for everyone. If you’re someone with an idea but have been hesitant about where to begin building and testing, <a href="https://trinsic.notion.site/Build-an-SSI-Proof-of-Concept-dae9d6e565eb4770be41b61d55e090cb">this is an excellent place to begin working within minutes</a>.  We build better products when we openly collaborate with each other. If you’re looking to build a new ecosystem, seek feedback from community members who have been through the process or are building a product that could complement yours. At the end of the day, we’ll only be successful if all our identity products are interoperable. Yet that won’t ever happen if we aren’t talking with one another and following the same standards. <a href="https://slackcommunity.com/">Trinsic’s developer slack community</a> is a great place to start meeting and speaking with fellow builders.  The best SSI proof of concepts are built by teams with great chemistry. We’ve worked with a lot of companies, and those that are the most successful are successful because of their team. Having the right resources in terms of talent often outweighs the importance of other capital resources. This spring’s IIW conference showcased a growing community of talented companies, with a rapidly growing need to hire. It seems we’re all hiring, which means we can each expect to put a lot more effort into attracting top talent.   &nbsp;  The Catch-22 of Interoperability <p>Verifiable credentials and adoption were among the hottest topics of IIW. The unique value of a verifiable credential is the fact that it is an interoperable standard–that is, one credential can be accepted and verified across multiple institutions. However, the value of a standard is less obvious before being widely adopted. Thus, we find ourselves with a chicken-and-egg problem: how do we get people to use verifiable credentials while the main value is the fact that other people are using the standard? The key is to focus on solving business problems today for a single ecosystem. That’s why Trinsic created Trinsic Ecosystems, a product focused on enabling adoption among issuers and verifiers. If you’re building an SSI ecosystem, reach out for a demo.</p> &nbsp;  Decentralized Identity Has Great People <p>IIW once more established that this industry has some of the best people. From veteran faces like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-m-smith/">Sam Smith</a> to newcomers (Josh from our team attended for the first time), we truly have some of the kindest, most brilliant minds around. Here are a few noteworthy folks we’re going to be following after IIW:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evin-mcmullen/">Evin McMullen.</a> Evin spoke about adoption among web3 users at IIW.

  <p>Continued advances in authentication technology have made the "identity" part of "identity and access management" more manageable over the years. Access management on the other hand, is still very much a "wild-west" landscape. As enterprises move to a zero-trust network access model, access management is the only way in which attackers can be prevented from gaining unwarranted access to enterprise data. Attackers can include both malicious insiders and those using compromised identities. Numerous organizations have suffered significant financial damage as a result of such unwarranted access from legitimately identified users.</p>
<p>Authorization rules in an enterprise can apply to many types of assets: files on a network drive, cloud resources such as virtual machines and storage buckets and enterprise applications and actions within them. Managing authorization across all these assets is complex in and of itself. Most enterprises also use third-party “Software as a Service '' platforms that maintain their own permissions, further complicating enterprises’ efforts to effectively manage authorization.</p>
<p>This talk identifies common causes of "privilege sprawl" in enterprises, and discusses management techniques that can result in "least privilege" permissions to personnel while ensuring no business disruption</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-tulshibagwale-enterprise-authorization"></a>

These adjustments are based on related changes at other network services, such as identity providers, device management services or others. A set of standards from the OpenID Foundation enable independent services to provide and obtain such dynamic information in order to better protect organizations that rely on zero-trust network access.

  <p>Most OAuth deployments today use bearer tokens – tokens that can be used by anyone in possession of a copy of them, with no way to distinguish between legitimate uses of them and those that stole them and used them for nefarious purposes. The solution to this is proof-of-possession tokens, where the legitimate client supplies cryptographic material to the issuer that is bound to the token, enabling it to cryptographically prove that the token belongs to it – something attackers cannot do because they don’t possess the proof-of-possession cryptographic material.<br> <br> The OAuth DPoP (Demonstration of Proof of Possession) specification defines a simple-to-implement means of applying proof of possession to OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens. We will describe real attacks occurring every day against bearer tokens and how they are mitigated by DPoP, providing defense in depth and making real deployed systems substantially more secure with minimal implementation and complexity costs.<br> <br> These attacks and mitigations are particularly relevant to high-value enterprise deployments, such as in the financial, manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and government sectors.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-jones-oauth-dpop"></a>

  <p>During this best practice session we will present you with hands-on experience from one of our financial services industry customers.</p>
<p>The company used a handcrafted xml signature mechanism to authenticate their business partners when initiating machine-to-machine communication to exchange data between data centers. When the customer decided to migrate to REST APIs in a cloud native setup, the existing mechanism was no longer fit for purpose. Together, we designed a solution to keep the benefits of certificate based authentication while establishing an interaction model conforming to the OpenID Connect standard. We implemented the mechanism based on the open source software Keycloak, successfully passed an external penetration test and have to this point authenticated hundres of thousands of sessions. After our session, attendees will</p>
 
 be familiar with standard conforming approaches to use OpenID Connect with certificates for authentication 
 be able to assess which parts of their authentication flow will benefit from using certificates 
 know relevant open source technologies and technical approaches to use in their own implementations 
 understand common pitfalls and relevant considerations when implementing the standards in a real-world, cloud based scenario

  <p>The world of modern urban mobility is full of - unused - opportunities. To get to their destination, people can use public transportation, take a cab or rent an e-scooter. But many options also means many providers. Anyone who uses more than one of the aforementioned forms of transportation to get from A to B will inevitably be confronted with a fragmentation of their journey. This is anything but smooth and user-friendly. A simple example makes this particularly clear: If Erika Mustermann has to go to London for a business meeting, she first takes the suburban train to the airport, then gets on a plane, and then has a cab take her to the hotel. That's three different booking processes with three different mobility providers. Decentralized technologies, on the other hand, enable a new kind of efficiency and effectiveness in the back-end networking of different providers. But how can such a seamless customer journey be implemented so that both mobility service providers and customers benefit equally? Sophia Rödiger, CEO of bloXmove, is happy to tackle this challenge in a talk on IT Trans. In doing so, she explores the question of how, for example, the individual players in local public transport can cooperate with each other while remaining independent and what role blockchain technology plays in this. She also explains how providers can save resources through the decentralized concept while gaining more customers. In addition, she puts a special focus on how the cooperation between the public and private sectors can be changed by the approach in the long term.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-roediger-decentralized-tech-collaboration"></a>

  <p>The internet was designed without a trusted identity layer to connect physical entities to the digital world. This layer is now emerging in the form of decentralized digital identity systems (aka self-sovereign identity or “SSI”) based on digital wallets and digital credentials.&nbsp;What industry insiders have demanded for long is becoming reality. This is bringing challenges to the forefront including resistance of the identity establishment and major questions about interoperability between emerging and existing identity systems.<br><br>The Trust over IP Foundation was founded by a pan-industry group of leading organizations with a mission to provide a robust, common standard and complete architecture for internet-scale digital trust. In this session, leaders in digital identity from the ToIP Steering Committee will outline the impact this missing layer has had on digitization of trusted interactions, why technology alone won’t solve this and how the ToIP stack is designed to tackle both technology and human governance to bring open and interoperable standards at each layer of the trust architecture. This interactive panel will be moderated by ToIP’s Director of Strategic Engagement and will explore the views of its member organizations for a lively and engaging debate on how we finally establish trust in the digital age.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-stack"></a>

  <p>As digital business pushes organizations towards an accelerated multi-cloud adoption, CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management) emerges as a strong enabler for securing access and entitlements across an increasingly distributed cloud environment. Traditional PAM and IGA tools aren't natively designed to manage cloud infrastructure entitlements and therefore can't be easily re-purposed to discover and remediate excessive cloud permissions across multiple IaaS and PaaS platforms. The confusion arising from un-identically structured CSPs and misaligned cloud terminology is further aggravated by the quest of IAM, PAM and Cloud Security providers to enter CIEM space and capture market share.</p>
<p>In this session, we will focus on how the CIEM market has been evolving over the last few years to manage the critical cloud security gaps left unaddressed by CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) and CWP (Cloud Workload Protection) tools, and how CIEM complements these tools to offer a wholistic cloud security advantage. We will also discuss how CIEM addresses some of the most critical security tenets of your organization's cloud adoption program and future planning.</p>
<p>As for the key takeaways of this session, you will be able to understand and articulate:</p>
 
 When and where does CIEM fit in your overall cloud security and access governance strategy? 
 What are the critical capabilities of CIEM to help evaluate the right CIEM product for your multi-cloud environment? 
 What are industry best practices for implementing and operationalizing CIEM for your cloud security and achieving faster ROI?

  <p>This session is a continuation of the opening keynote by Martin Kuppinger on the future Composable Enterprise. Together we take a look at what powers the composable enterprise and which concepts and technologies can contribute to building a composable enterprise.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole proposes an engine that powers composable enterprises, made up of composable services, identities, and data. Since this journey towards becoming composable is intensely individual based on business goals and requirements, there countless ways of cultivating this modular trifecta. Therefore, this session identifies some of the building blocks that organizations use to cultivate interchangeability and agility to achieve their continually shifting business goals. These building blocks are modular themselves, allowing organizations to exercise different aspects to power composability.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-bailey-composable-enterprise"></a>

She recommends having a clear reason for saying no, being able to communicate that reason, and standing behind your decision. Davis ends with how to decline while avoiding burning bridges and saying no without regrets. She emphasizes thinking of the benefits of saying no: more time to focus on another project, more time with your family or doing something for yourself, reminding us that these are great reasons to say no and are favourable to our lives.<p></p>

<p>I wanted to share this video because it meshes well with a blog that Darrell wrote in 2018, “<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/say-no-with-grace/">Say No With Grace</a>.” Darrell gives a lot of great examples for start up’s on when to say no and the best ways to approach this most awkward encounter. Tessa dives a little deeper with a clear action plan to master the art of saying no that you can apply anywhere in your life.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Richard Hill</a></p><p>Industry 4.0 is the fourth revolution in manufacturing. I won't bore you with the details of the prior iteration or versions and how we got where we are today, only that Industry 4.0 promises to take the interconnectedness of devices and machines to a new level. Smart or intelligent computing and autonomous systems using analytics and AI/ML techniques supported by big data are integral parts of the industry 4.0 paradigm. Industry 4.0, in short, is a significant change and will impact a manufacturing organization's digital transformation.<br><br>A Bow Wave of Devices and Machines<br>Since the start of Industry 4.0, there has been a bow wave in the number and types of device types to account for. Beyond the basic desktop, laptop, and tablets, other device types making their appearance are industrial mobile devices, mixed reality (VR) headsets/smart glasses (e.g., Oculus, HoloLens), industrial internet of things (IIoT), smart cameras, beacons, and the list goes on. And sure, there was some robotics back in the industry 3.0 timeframe, such as stationary Articulated Robotic Arms. Today, there is a broader range of robotic types in manufacturing like Autonomous Mobile Robots and Inventory Robots, Automated Guided Carts and Forklifts, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, etc.<br><br>IIoT, Data and AI<br>Since the inception of the Internet of Things (IoT), the use of IoT devices has steadily grown. IoT devices at their core collect data via sensors and perform actions using actuators. IoT sensors and actuators can be applied to many different business sectors, which account for the wide range of IoT use cases. A more recent trend is the convergence of OT and IT networks, systems, and sharing of data that Industrial IoT devices collect, allowing both businesses and operations to utilize and benefit from information sharing. With the wealth of data becoming available, AI/ML and predictive analytics can provide insights that can be of value. Also, because of the sheer amount of data generated, the trend is clearly moving towards edge computing in closer proximity to a manufacturing facility that utilizes AI/ML processing, as well as other services.<br><br>Communication is Key<br>With the number of machines and devices throughout today's industry 4.0 manufacturing environment, and the need for orchestration and automation, communication to and from machines and devices is key. The networks used in these environments include the ethernet, mesh networks, wireless, and, more recently, public and private 5G networks. The introduction of Wi-Fi 6 and 5G networks is driven by the need for faster / lower latency communications to/from machines and devices and data throughput. The communication protocols have also increased to include ZigBee, LoRa, NB-IoT, Z-Wave, Sigfox, LTE, and Bluetooth Smart, as some examples.<br><br>So, Where Does IAM Fit In?<br>I’ve talked a bit about what has changed, but what hasn’t changed or remains the same? Within the Industry 4.0 environment, each machine and device on the network still needs to be identified, and each connection across the systems-of-systems still needs to be authenticated. Access to digital resources continues to require authorization and controlled by digital policies. This is where Identity and Access<br><br>Management (IAM) fits in. An extension of IAM that can help with the management of devices is a Unified Endpoint Management solution which can track, perform device health assessments, and patch devices on an ongoing basis. An IoT Device Management platform can manage the lifecycle of IoT devices, as well as the monitoring, protecting, and visualization of IoT device status and health and the control of its data. Other cyber security solutions can also be added, but at the core, IAM will continue to be needed in the industry 4.0 digital transformation.<br><br>European Identity and Cloud (EIC) Conference<br>Because we understand the importance of protecting critical assets, and because we are committed to helping your organization succeed, KuppingerCole has a great deal of content available in a variety of formats, including live events such as the 2022 KuppingerCole European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference taking place in Berlin and online in May.<br><br>The agenda includes keynote presentations and panel discussions on Assessing the Business Impact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine, Reinventing Government with Technology, Future Government: Transforming Public Services to Be More Agile and Innovative, Zero Trust Best Practices, and The Changing Cyber Threat Landscape, as well as other cyber security-related presentations including:</p>

				  The completion of the Indy DID Method by Indicio paves the way toward a network of networks. Verifiable credentials issued on multiple networks can now be verified by any agent that supports did:indy, affirming Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries as the most advanced framework for interoperable, decentralized identity  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>Network interoperability has taken a major leap forward with the release of the Indy DID Method for Hyperledger Indy-based networks. With this new upgrade, completed by Indicio, verifiable credentials issued on a specific Hyperledger Indy network can now be resolved by any agent supporting the did:indy method regardless of which Hyperledger Indy network the verifying agent might use to anchor its issuing DIDs, schemas, or credential definitions. The Indy DID Method paves the way for Hyperledger Indy credentials to scale globally by allowing Indy networks to seamlessly interoperate and create a “network-of-networks” effect.</p>
<p>The Indy DID Method was also needed to bring Hyperledger Indy—the most popular open-source codebase for creating robust distributed ledger networks for identity—into sync with the more recent World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifier (DID) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Specification</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">Indy DID Method</a> originally began as a community development effort within <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>. Earlier this year, the government of British Columbia, Canada, announced a “Code with Us” challenge, to push the effort to completion. The challenge was won by Indicio and, thanks to the hard work of our talented engineers, the Indy DID Method is now available to the entire Indy community.</p>
<p>It’s hard to understate why this is a really important step forward for decentralized identity adoption. It means adding the potential of scale to every deployment, which is something we and all our customers want. With interest in verifiable credential technology increasing every day, the timing could not be better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also important to recognize that this is the kind of the rapid innovation that can be achieved in open source technology when a nonprofit-led community, a government, and an enterprise collaborate. We are enormously grateful to the government of British Columbia for sponsoring this “Code with Us” challenge.&nbsp; We also applaud it: This is a model for open source infrastructural innovation that governments everywhere should learn from and follow.</p>
<p>The next step is for networks and agent frameworks to incorporate did:indy&nbsp; into production software stacks. This community adoption will increase the viability of the Indy and Aries project stack and position it to be the globally dominant way to issue and share verifiable credentials in a multi-ledger world.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Indicio team would like to thank BC Gov for funding this work and Dominic Wörner, another contributor to the Code With Us challenge, for his work on Indy VDR.</p>

  <p>As the pace of digitalization gathers momentum, organizations are witnessing a dramatic increase in the number of digital identities. These identities interact with systems and applications relentlessly to perform day-to-day IT tasks. Nevertheless, maintaining the privacy of this data is a daunting task. Enterprise data is hosted in multi-tenant cloud, managed service providers and distributed data center environments. How an organization can maintain data privacy in this evolving IT access control use-cases depends on the level of preparedness to protect and monitor those digital identities. An identity and access management solution provides adequate safeguards to enforce IT practices necessary to maintain data privacy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-bhandari-digital-identity-privacy"></a>

  <p>The future of the enterprise is changing. In the Digital Age, much is different than it has been in the past. The focus must be on agility in business models and delivery, innovation, and reliability in delivering to the customers. This requires a shift in focus, in all areas, including IT. IT must focus on enabling the business to deliver digital services that stand out from the competition, with leading-edge customer experience. IT must be able to adapt to change in competition as well as in technology, and to support the continuous innovation of businesses in the digital age. It must focus on what makes a business different from others. Thus, IT must focus way more on innovation than on just delivering standard IT services from the shelf. However, IT must ensure that this is safe, secure, reliable, available – the new IT as well as the old IT. Cybersecurity and Identity today are at the forefront of the digital business, with Identity as an enabler and Cybersecurity as the foundation for secure delivery.</p>
<p>With the demand on agility and innovation in IT, and the focus on distinguishing from others instead of reinventing baseline IT that is available of the shelf, the themes of “decentralization” and decentralized technologies (as in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies), and of “composable” (as in orchestration, APIs, business processes, etc.) move to the focus. This keynote will look at how to utilize identity, security, and decentralized technologies for the composable enterprise and for differentiation from competition in the digital business. Done right, technology enables enterprises to stay ahead of the competition, without failing in security.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-kuppinger-identity-security-decentralized"></a>

<p>But wait – less than a third of businesses that we at KuppingerCole have asked recently, say that they have processes, staff, structures, skills, and cybersecurity implemented in a way that they feel adequately prepared for what analysts may soon call the age of the composable enterprise. In this CISO panel session, we will try to look into the future of Cybersecurity, without losing sight of today´s threats and ways to continue building cyber resilience in a time of so many unknowns.

  <p>Last November, the creator of the 7 Laws of Identity, Digital ID thought leader and focal point of a Global Identity Community, Kim Cameron, passed away. He not only left us with an uncountable number of unforgettable moments. He also left us with those 7 laws of Identity, a set of fundamental principles that have helped shaping modern privacy legislation and which are more relevant today as ever before. In this keynote session, 7 of Kim´s friends, colleagues and co-founders will talk about today´s relevance of Kim´s work. The session will be moderated by Jackson Shaw who worked with Kim back in the 90ies at ZoomIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-privacy-7-laws-of-identity"></a>

 Sign-in with Solana — Use Your Solana Account for Web2 &amp;&nbsp;Web3  Users will now be able to control their digital identity with their Solana accounts instead of relying on traditional/custodial profiles.  The Importance of Building a Self-Custodial Future <p>In crypto, there is a saying that goes ”Not your keys, not your crypto’’ exemplifying the importance of non-custodiality — the need to shift the dynamic of ownership from entities to the end-user. The principle also extends beyond just the crypto you hold to your very identity itself. While traditional Web2 entities have done a tremendous job in making the user experience incredibly intuitive but that has also come at a cost — the cost of privacy and centralization.</p><p>There is excessive monetization of the users’ activity and their residing information on the web. Security compromises even among the biggest names in cybersecurity are increasingly common. As the average user is becoming more and more aware of these tradeoffs, the voice to safeguard their identity is growing louder by the day. We at Web3Auth firmly believe that self-custodiality is the future and we want to lead the way in making it happen. Do check our recent <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">announcement about the Auth Network</a> for our roadmap towards&nbsp;this.</p> Sign-in With Solana — You Own Your&nbsp;Identity <p>Web3 has to a large extent cracked the code for the user privacy problem. The power of public and private keys, enabled by crypto technologies, allows users to own their username, and profile data, and use their accounts across different applications. This is the fundamental on which Web3Auth was built — to leverage the power of threshold cryptography to shift the dynamic of power from entities to individuals.</p> What does Sign-in With Solana&nbsp;Solve? <p>For the User: Sign-in with Solana allows any Web2 application to authenticate users with their Web3 identities thereby bringing the security and privacy of Web3 authentication to&nbsp;Web2.</p><p>Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms and thus naturally, there arises a need to have a standard specification for authentication with Web3 identities. This led to the birth of <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md">CAIP-74</a> which allows for creating a chain-agnostic Object Capability (CACAO), based on a signing message as an IPLD object. Sign-in with Solana endeavors to maintain compatibility with CAIP-74, thereby adhering to a chain agnostic standard.</p><p>For the Developer: Do <a href="https://www.docs.web3auth.io">check our documentation</a> for a step by step guide on how to build a Sign-in with Solana flow and how to navigate the authentication logic. You can find a clear end-to-end flow in our docs <a href="http://siws.web3auth.io">here</a>. Moreover, Web3Auth offers a dedicated suite of authentication tools for all Solana Developers. This includes support for OAuth and native biometric login using our <a href="https://www.docs.web3auth.io">plug and play SDK</a> and also the state of the art <a href="https://docs.tor.us/solana-wallet/what-is-wallet">Torus Solana Wallet</a> which has a range of exclusive features.</p> Coming Soon… <p>We are pleased to see how rapidly the entire Web3 ecosystem is developing with the launch of new protocols and dApps every day. We will continue to lead the way in servicing authentication needs for the ecosystem whilst upholding the self-custodial principles of blockchain technology.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/sign-in-with-solana-use-your-solana-account-for-web2-web3-d94def27485b">Sign-in with Solana — Use Your Solana Account for Web2 &amp; Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Osman Celik</a></p><p>The era we are living in has transformed the Internet and IT from being a convenience for people and organizations into a cyber liability. In an IT infrastructure, almost any system is now an integrated system that has internet connectivity. With assets, devices, resources, hardware, and software, being changed, patched, or updated continuously, it is critical to have an approach that continuously collects and classifies the inventory, discovers the risks, and monitors the organization’s IT infrastructure.<br><br>Classifying, protecting, and identifying digital assets have always been a key to mitigate cybersecurity risks. Attack Surface Management (ASM) is designed to automate these security measurements at a level of functional breadth and depth in coverage of systems that traditional solutions such as firewalls, SIEM solutions, or endpoint protection system have not been able to deliver before. ASM’s continuous and proactive approach to identifying and managing the attack surface allows organizations to be more confident about having comprehensive visibility into what an attacker could target, about knowing where known vulnerabilities still need to be fixed, and about being better protected from new vulnerabilities. The increase in remote work as well as the continuing adoption of cloud services have expanded organizations’ attack surfaces. ASM, as a group of solutions, aims to identify the attack surface and thus for managing and mitigating risks, and help organizations increase their cyber-attack resilience.<br><br>KuppingerCole Analysts predicts that ASM will become a widely deployed capability in the next decade. This is supported by recent evolutions in the market, such as the acquisition of <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/company/press-release/mgc">Mandiant</a> by Google for around $5.4bn. ASM specialists like Axonius, Censys, Cyberpion, and CyCognito recently announced new funding at a significant level, up to $200m. We expect to see large enterprises prioritizing ASM tools in their cybersecurity investment plans as well as further mergers and acquisitions in the ASM market.</p>
<p></p>
 Recommendations to reduce Attack Surface 
<p>ASM is an emerging solution for cybersecurity leaders who are looking to complement their existing monitoring and testing tools. It is also an opportunity for cybersecurity leaders to take proactive measures in response to increasing cyber threats and unidentified vulnerabilities.<br><br>Believe in Zero Trust: Zero Trust is a security paradigm based on the principle of “Don’t trust. Verify!”. According to Zero Trust concept, no device, user, workload, or system should be trusted by default. For further information, check out our Comprehensive Guide to Zero Trust Implementation insight.<br><br>Determine an ASM Strategy: Decide on which security leader will serve as the ASM manager. Inform all the stakeholders and make sure of participation of departments/functions pertaining to the attack surface within your organization.<br><br>Define Your Requirements: Understand your specific requirements for today’s and future use cases and prioritize them.<br><br>Analyze the Market for Potential Vendors: Understand the ASM market, and which vendors could serve your requirements.<br><br>Choose a Vendor: Request ASM related information and, if possible, a PoC to see their implementation capabilities from vendors. Define your use cases and compare results from each vendor. Select the one that matches the most with your use cases and answers your needs.<br><br>Stay Informed with KuppingerCole: Check out our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research">library</a> to discover up-to-date reports and articles in today’s cybersecurity landscape.

			<p>9th May, Luxembourg — The Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp (<a href="http://kmska.be/">KMSKA</a>) is the first European museum to tokenize a masterpiece to democratize art investment. In partnership with <a href="https://www.rubey.be/">Rubey</a> and <a href="http://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, KMSKA has leveraged the legal, marketing and technological expertise of both teams to launch its compliant ERC-3643 based security token offering on the Polygon blockchain, allowing fractional ownership of James Ensor (1860 – 1949)’s painting Carnaval de Binche, with investments starting at €150.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Traditionally, for investors, the art industry has been dominated by wealthy individuals with access to or the ability to purchase museum-quality art pieces. For museums, private investors have been the primary source of capital sought to help expand their collections. KMSKA aims to revolutionize the status quo by making masterpieces available to the masses.</p>
<p>By working with Rubey to tokenize the masterpiece on the blockchain, KMSKA lowers the investment barrier to entry, enabling everyone to become a “co-owner” of the masterpiece, while bringing together art lovers to become a new source of capital. The money raised in the Art Security Token Offering allows Carnaval de Binche to be purchased and ensures that the museum receives the piece on long-term loan. This means everyone finally gets to admire Ensor’s Carnaval de Binche – a painting that has spent years in private collections.</p>

		 
	 
   KMSKA will be more than a place that displays art. We are fully committed to engaging our visitors and token holders in our collection and operation. It is very special that anyone can become a ``co-owner`` of Carnaval de Binche by James Ensor. KMSKA already had the largest Ensor collection in the world. The addition of Carnaval de Binche puts our museum on the international map as an Ensor centre of excellence even more.  Luk LemmensKMSKA President       I am absolutely convinced that this is not a hype phenomenon, but the start of a revolution. Technologically, these Security Tokens are the ultimate innovation in the blockchain environment. However, the social element is just as important. Investing in Art Security Tokens is a true impact investment.  Peter HinssenRubey partner and Tech Entrepreneur    
	 
		 
			<p>KMSKA’s Art Security Tokens, unlike Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), are backed by debt instruments, which legally fall under securities regulation and must comply with the law throughout their life cycle. To ensure compliance, the Rubey platform has chosen to integrate Tokeny’s tokenization APIs for issuing and managing security tokens due to its unique onchain compliance approach through permissioned ERC-3643 tokens and digital identity system ONCHAINID. As a result, token transfers can only occur if eligibility conditions are met, moreover, ownership of tokens is guaranteed by holders’ ONCHAINIDs (e.g. token holders can recover their tokens if they lose their wallets).</p>

		 
	 
   There is confusion in the market about NFT and security tokens, and we are pleased to see that KMSKA, an innovative traditional museum, fully understands the differences between these two types of digital assets. We share the same vision as our partners KMSKA and Rubey that security tokens will have a real impact on the art industry by allowing smaller investors to invest and engage in artworks that already have existing value. We are excited to provide a compliance infrastructure and user-friendly interfaces for them to reach these audiences. A new chapter in art investment has begun, and this is just the beginning, we can't wait to see what happens next.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>The project uses <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> network, the Ethereum-scaling solution, to achieve cost-effective operations while preparing for cheap, fast and compliant peer-to-peer transfers post-issuance for all investors – both initial private investors and investors in public sales. The team plans to provide a secondary market solution Billboard on the Rubey platform starting in 2023 to improve the liquidity of the assets.</p>
<p>The project is now live. Go to <a href="http://rubey.be/">rubey.be</a> for more information.</p>

  <p>Over the past decade, and even more swiftly since the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital transformation of the workplace has primarily been <a href="https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/report/global-commentary-report-2020-apps-at-the-ready.pdf">driven by applications</a>. Apps have become an integral part of everyday life for many organizations.</p>

<p>Modern applications are complex. Their functionality frequently relies on APIs and third-party integrations, leading to an increased attack surface and more security vulnerabilities. A data breach or an attacker exploiting a security weakness can permanently damage your business. It’s crucial that you understand and secure your application’s infrastructure.</p>

<p>There are a number of actions you can take to keep attackers away. Following are some tips and best practices for a more secure application.</p>

 Understanding application security 

<p>Application security, or AppSec, as it’s commonly known, takes place throughout the development lifecycle. It’s the process of creating applications that are secure from both internal and external threats. Internal threats can range from simple human error to malicious acts. External threats, which include data breaches, malware, and phishing attacks, can be constant and costly. It’s estimated that distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks alone <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html">will grow to 15.4 million by 2023</a>.</p>

<p>As attackers target applications ever more aggressively, keeping them secure plays a vital role in a holistic cybersecurity strategy. Application security is necessary to avoid financial and legal repercussions, protect your organization’s reputation, and build trust with your customers and partners.</p>

 Application security concepts 

<p>There are a few concepts you should understand before you develop an application security strategy. Learning these will help you avoid common pitfalls or ineffective techniques that could compromise the security of your application.</p>

 OWASP Top 10 

<p>The <a href="https://owasp.org/">Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)</a> online community studies and reports on web application security. The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top 10</a> report lists the most critical security vulnerabilities an application can face.</p>

<p>The list—based on survey data from cybersecurity professionals—is determined by the frequency and likelihood of a vulnerability, how easy it is to detect, and the impact it can have on your organization.</p>

<p>OWASP’s report can help you assess areas of your application that present higher potential risk. It provides example attack scenarios to show how various vulnerabilities work, as well as guidelines for avoiding these attacks.</p>

<p>Below are the top ten security vulnerabilities as noted in the latest <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP report</a> from 2021:</p>

 
   Broken access control 
   Cryptographic failures 
   Injection 
   Insecure design 
   Security misconfiguration 
   Vulnerable and outdated components 
   Identification and authentication failures 
   Software and data integrity failures 
   Security logging and monitoring failures 
   Server-side request forgery 
 

 Authentication basics 

<p>Authentication is a necessary feature of modern applications because it prevents unauthorized users from accessing and misusing sensitive information.</p>

<p>When you start developing an application, you might be tempted to build your own authentication system to save costs or maintain full control. However, creating an effective authentication system is a challenging job with <a href="https://auth0.com/learn/build-or-buy-20-identity-management-questions/">many factors to consider</a>. If done poorly, it can cause severe consequences.</p>

<p>Instead, there are authentication solutions available to help you enhance the security of your application. Platforms like <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> or <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> provide you with powerful identity services tailored to your needs.</p>

<p>These services offer a high level of expertise and keep updating their technology to stay ahead of new cyberattack forms. Using third-party  software can help you avoid pitfalls and save money in the long run. When you rely on a platform, you can focus on building and running your applications.</p>

<p>For more about the advantages of a pre-built identity solution, check this <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper-pre-built-identity-solution/thankyou/">whitepaper on the advantages of a pre-built identity solution</a>.</p>

 External user management 

<p>A user management system is an  <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/01/user-management/">essential part of application security</a>. It allows you to collect, store, and manage user data for a smoother user registration process, enhanced authentication, and better password management. You can also use it to control who can access particular aspects of your infrastructure, including networks, devices, and applications.</p>

<p>As with authentication, you might want to build your own user management system. However, these are complex systems to create that generally require dedicated teams, especially for enterprise-level applications. You could run into issues such as failing to sanitize user input or being stuck with a frustrating registration process.</p>

<p>With an external user management system, you’ll get a robust, out-of-the-box solution that adjusts to your needs while handling tricky tasks like scaling or regulatory compliance. This can also help you reduce overall user management costs since you won’t need to pay in-house developers to do the work.</p>

 Up-to-date programs are a best practice 

<p>To achieve the highest level of security, you should ensure that your applications and their <a href="https://developerexperience.io/practices/updating-the-dependencies">dependencies</a> are always up to date. Updates contain <a href="https://www.hypr.com/patch/">patches</a> to fix security vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit.</p>

<p>Update the antivirus programs on your devices and your firewalls. You can also use <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-asset-management-software-5090064">asset management software</a> to detect outdated programs.</p>

 Secure communication protocols 

<p>Be sure your site or application uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</a>. It adds a security layer to traditional HTTP by encrypting the data exchanged between computers and servers over the internet. For example, if your user fills out a form with personal information, even if the data is stolen, it won’t have any value to the attacker because it cannot easily be decoded.</p>

<p>HTTPS is <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-your-static-website-needs-https/">so important</a> that it’s become the de facto industry standard. All major web browsers discourage users from visiting non-HTTPS websites, and search engines penalize those websites in search results.</p>

<p>HTTPS protects data with the <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/tls/basics/">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a> protocol, which uses a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/">public-key encryption system</a> to ensure that applications communicate and exchange data safely.</p>

<p>Learn more about how to get started with HTTPS <a href="https://httpsiseasy.com/">in this series</a>.</p>

 Security testing tools 

<p>Use security testing to detect vulnerabilities in your application. Testing can help you protect your applications from data breaches and avoid performance issues. You can also determine your application’s level of security stability and avoid future problems.</p>

<p>Testing can be a time-consuming ongoing process, but there are solutions to help you test efficiently. Two popular testing tools are vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/vulnerability-assessment-vulnerability-analysis">Vulnerability assessment</a> or scanner tools review your application to see if it’s vulnerable to security attacks. They identify, analyze, and help you solve security risks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/penetration-testing/">Penetration testing</a> (or pen testing)  is a white-hat hacking technique you can use to detect security flaws. You imitate the steps a cyber attacker would take in order to identify and fix vulnerabilities before real attackers can discover them.</p>

 Certifications in app security 

<p>You might be inspired to learn even more about application security. If that’s the case, consider pursuing <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3631530/8-top-cloud-security-certifications.html">certification</a>, so you can develop expertise in cloud security. This in-demand skill set will benefit you as well as your company or organization.</p>

 Use your knowledge 

<p>Application security needs to be a top priority for developers. Modern applications often run on multiple networks and connect to the cloud, increasing the number of potentially problematic access points for attackers.</p>

<p>Many organizations are familiar with security best practices but may not understand the concepts behind them. Using this knowledge, you can implement the solutions described above to achieve great results.</p>

<p>A whole lot of ecosystem players at the event were pleasantly surprised to discover Web3Auth’s Key Management Infrastructure (and also our funky&nbsp;swags)</p><p>About the Paris Blockchain Week ‘2022 (13th-14th April)</p><p>Paris Blockchain Week is one of the biggest Blockchain conferences &amp; Digital Assets events in Europe. Held in the City of Lights over two days, the event is graced every year by some of the most influential leaders and players in the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>This year, some of the speakers included CZ&nbsp;, the founder of Binance, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse&nbsp;, Raj Gokal, the co-founder of Solana and a galaxy of other speakers that also included our co-founder Zhen&nbsp;Yong.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/PBWSummit/status/1514555660951826436">@PBWSummit</a></p></blockquote><p>Web3Auth debuts at the Paris Blockchain Week Summit(PBWS)</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth/status/1514193425595256839">@web3auth</a></p></blockquote><p>The event marked Web3Auth’s first participation at the PBWS and the team including co-founder and CEO were present at the event showcasing the state of the art private key management infrastructure. The event was preceded by the announcement of the Auth Network a day prior. You can read the full announcement <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">here</a>.</p><p>And the Coolest Swag Award Goes&nbsp;to…</p><p>The team came up with an unusual way to demonstrate how its unique self-custodial key management infrastructure works — at the end of which the visitor received one of our cool swags which turned out to be a hit at the&nbsp;event</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptowifey1/status/1514536080523075593">@cryptowifey1</a></p></blockquote><p>If you are curious to know what this was all about, meet us at our next event to experience it yourself.</p><p>And Then Everyone Partied….</p><p>At the end of the first day, a special party was hosted at Pigalle’s iconic Elysée Montmartre. Not surprisingly, the members of the community got to see a completely different side of each other from what they had seen earlier from the event. The Web3Auth team got together with other members for a memorable night in Paris as everyone geared for day two of the&nbsp;event.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/pbwsummit/status/1514356636793593857">@pbwsummit</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/pbwsummit/status/1514347479780712457">@pbwsummit</a></p></blockquote><p>Day 2: We hosted a Pizza&nbsp;Party!</p><p>On the second day, we got a bunch of fresh hot pizzas from across the street and hosted a Pizza Party at our booth and as you would expect, we saw quite a crowd at the booth who may have come over for a slice or two but ended up learning a thing or two about our unique onboarding solution for dApps and&nbsp;wallets.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/pbwsummit/status/1514585465722134532">@pbwsummit</a></p></blockquote><p>Conclusion<br>A wide range of ecosystem players from DeFi, Gaming, Security, Infrastructure were present at the event and while some were aware and had already integrated our pluggable SDK with their dApp/wallet, a whole lot of players were acquainted with our Private Key Management infrastructure for the first time. And all of this happened over Pizza and cool&nbsp;swags!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-at-the-paris-blockchain-week-2022-2a26345c9c06">Web3Auth at the Paris Blockchain Week 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This presentation was made at the Cybersecurity &amp; Identity Summit (CIS2022) held from April 26 to 27, 2022.&nbsp; Mathieu Glaude presented ‘Are we really committed to protecting the rights of people and democratic societies?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>CIS2022 is an essential event for the technology industry, providing leading-edge insight on cyber risk prevention and Digital Identity management. Join us for Learning, Networking, and B2B Opportunities.&nbsp; The event is organized by In-Sec-M, a Canadian non-profit organization that brings together companies, learning and research institutions, and government actors to take concerted action to increase the cohesion and competitiveness of the Canadian cybersecurity industry, nationally and internationally. <a href="https://insecm.ca/en/">Learn more about In-Sec-M</a>.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>About the presentation</p>
<p>Is protecting both the rights of individuals and societies really a priority? Do we actually want to deliver on this promise?</p>
<p>To achieve it, both individuals and societies must be capable of expressing their choice without being manipulated. And if we don’t want to be manipulated, then our environments must be secure to allow us to express ourselves freely.</p>
<p>The way the digital world is architected today inherently places all of my data out of my control. When I live in the digital world, I’m dependent on someone else holding and securing data about myself. I really don’t have an alternative. This means that cybersecurity is about securing my world which is not under my control. The concept of hacking is exponentially grave because information about myself exists outside of my control.</p>
<p>Have we been able to deliver on the promise of cybersecurity? Will we ever be able to protect the rights of individuals and societies under the existing model? I’d say it’s not possible.</p>

 Summary   Using Anonymous Credentials, you can prove you own a credential without disclosing the information held within the credential.  But anonymity allows bad actors to hide, and regulators and law enforcement need a way to identify them if need be.  Traceability is an opt-in feature for the holder of a credential. When accessing a service, the verifier can request that the holder encrypts a specific attribute (like an ID number) so that a regulator can access it if need be. The verifier will not be able to decrypt the attribute. Only the regulator will.  <p>To understand traceable credentials, we first need to acknowledge <a href="https://blog.dock.io/anonymous-credentials/">anonymous credentials</a>. </p><p>Anonymous credentials are a way of proving you own a credential without disclosing the information held within the credential.</p><p>For context, an issuer can create a credential with 3 claims (attributes); an individual's name, DOB and Social Security Number. A holder can prove to the verifier, using zero-knowledge proof, that they own this credential without revealing any of the attributes. To be specific, the holder can prove the attributes exist and have been signed by the issuer, without disclosing the attributes themselves or the signature. </p><p>Anonymous credentials offer great privacy but sometimes, privacy can sometimes be crippling for regulators or law enforcement. Bad actors can hide behind anonymity for example and this becomes troubling for regulators and law enforcement. </p> Unraveling the Anonymous Credentials <p>Traceable credentials are a way of instilling that layer of privacy but allow the relevant authorities to ‘unwind’ that layer of privacy and identify those bad actors. We do this through verifiable encryption.</p><p>Verifiable encryption allows the holder to encrypt any attribute(s) of the credential specifically for the tracing authorities and regulators. When proving the possession of the anonymous credential, the holder also presents encryption of the relevant attributes. The verifier cannot decrypt the attribute but can verify that the holder did encrypt the requested attributes for the regulator and only the regulator will be able to decrypt it. Thus the verifier does not learn the attributes but can trust the credentials are legitimate and that regulators will be able to access them if need be.</p><blockquote>Traceability is an opt-in feature for the holder; the verifier cannot force the holder to provide verifiable encryption for a regulator to potentially decrypt. At most the verifier can deny the holder access to its services.</blockquote><p>Continuing with the above example, a holder will present a service provider (acting as a verifier) with the proof of possession of an anonymous credential containing 3 attributes. The holder will encrypt one attribute which is the SSN so that a regulator can decrypt it. </p><p>The verifier will be able to see if the holder has encrypted the attribute correctly for the regulator to decrypt, and can trust the anonymous credentials are legitimate. The verifier can authenticate that the holder has a valid SSN without knowing the number itself, or their name and DOB. </p><p>The holder is assured that the verifier cannot ‘unwind’ the anonymous credential and their data remains anonymous. Only the regulator can decrypt the credential.</p><p>What’s beneficial is that an issuer does not need to issue special kinds of credentials for it to be traceable, nor will the issuer know if and when the credential was used in a traceable scenario. The only requirement of the issuer to allow anonymous credentials and traceability is that the credential should contain some attributes that can be uniquely tied to the holder. Thus the anonymous credentials issued can be traced using our new feature of Traceable Credentials.</p><p>The verifiable encryption protocol is implemented in Rust <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/saver">here</a> and you can find the corresponding Typescript (using the WASM bindings to the Rust code) code <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/">here</a>. The docs <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/#verifiable-encryption-using-saver">here</a> explain how to use it with anonymous credentials.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Mike Small</a></p><p>Organizations are going through a digital journey to exploit the digital systems to create new services, get closer to their customers and to improve efficiency. This process has been accelerated by the COVID pandemic where survival depended upon being able to change. This has led to a fragmented IT environment using multiple cloud services as well as on premises and edge. The challenge is now how to manage the complexity this has created.<br><br>There are now many solutions on the market with acronyms like CSPM, CNAPP, CIEM, CWPP. What are these solutions, and do they really help?<br><br>Digital Transformation has exploited cloud services because of the flexibility they provide. When organizations depended upon physical IT resources, as well as having a high capital cost, it could take months to get hold of equipment and then it would quickly become obsolete. Virtual IT resources through cloud services provide a flexible solution. DevOps can use these to meet business needs in a way that is agile and flexible to feedback. You only pay for what you use and if the project is successful, you can easily upscale to meet demand.</p>
<p>However, this has led to real and tangible challenges. According to the <a href="https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud?lead_source=Website%20Visitor&amp;id=Flexera.com-PR">Cloud Migration Stats - 2022 Flexera State of the Cloud Report</a> the top challenges from today’s multi-cloud hybrid IT are:<br><br>· Security with 85% of organizations reporting this is an inhibitor<br>· Risk and Compliance – with 76% of organizations reporting this as a challenge<br>· Managing Cloud Cost – with 81% reporting this as a challenge<br><br>And worse than that this survey shows that year on year these challenges are growing not decreasing.<br><br>These are challenges of governance. Business-critical applications now depend upon multiple services from multiple providers. Service levels must be set by business needs - but mapping multiple SLAs across clouds is difficult. Furthermore, each cloud service provides <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80933/securing-your-iaas-cloud">their own different management capabilities and security tools</a>. This imposes an extra management burden for each cloud service. It also leads to ad hoc governance of today’s multi-cloud hybrid IT.<br><br>Not only that but the virtual resources are ephemeral – created just as they are needed and destroyed as soon as they are not. However, the risks are not transient, and a cyber threat needs only microseconds to create damage.<br><br>Organizations need the tools and capabilities to monitor and manage this complex multi cloud IT environment in a consistent way. These include<br><br>· An inventory of service components (physical, virtual and software)<br>· Protection for data – classification, encryption, and backup<br>· Vulnerability Management<br>· Network security controls<br>· Identity governance<br>· Management as well as monitoring<br><br>The major cloud services all provide tools to secure and manage their own environment. These are mostly different to the ones used by organizations for their on-premises IT. Organizations mostly don’t have enough people with skills in all the tools for all the environments and so are turning to managed cloud services.</p>
<p>In addition to differences between clouds there are also differences between environments. Managing IaaS starts with managing virtual machines, networks, and storage. Then DevOps is mainly based on microservices and containers, and this adds another layer to be managed and secured. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80746/iaas-tenant-security-controls">This introduces more management tools</a>. Some vendors suggest that the solution customers should adopt is to reengineer everything as microservices. This is hardly practical.<br><br>At the same time new tools have emerged which vendors claim will solve these problems by providing a single pane of glass. These are primarily focussed on cloud with <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/cloud-security-posture-management-tools">Cloud Security Posture Management</a> is being promoted as an answer to the hybrid cloud governance challenge. However, it only provides parts of the solution. Other tools include:<br><br>· CASB – covers SaaS providing an inventory of services and controls over access.<br>· SASE – convergence of SWG, VPN and DNS providing secure access and has absorbed CASB.<br>· CIEM – focus on infrastructure elements providing visibility and control.<br>· CWPP – CNAPP – protection container-based DevOps.<br><br>Business driven IT is no longer about managing static services in a single environment. It must support the challenges of the new dynamic and volatile services, workloads and resources that are delivered through DevOps and exploit multi-cloud and software defined resources.</p>
<p>Dynamic IT needs<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/access-entitlements-multi-cloud-hybrid"> Dynamic Security Management </a>that covers more than just infrastructure and that enforces just in time security and access controls such as least privilege with just in time monitoring, detection, and remediation.<br><br>KuppingerCole call this Dynamic Resource Entitlement and Access Management. This is based on policies rather than static controls; it automates enforcement based on these policies and hence enables governance of dynamic IT.<br><br>For more information on this check out EIC sessions</p>

<p>Yes, it’s been a while since last Dev Pulse. Right now, the sense I get is that everyone in the ecosystem is heads-down and focused on building. The Holochain core team is reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1325">initial draft</a> of the Stable Validation milestone, testing the new DHT syncing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1313">algorithm</a>, and integrating an interim <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tx3">networking layer</a> that uses simple TLS-encrypted TCP connections, either direct or through a relay server. Meanwhile, the Holo hosting team is testing and bugfixing Elemental Chat and the hosting infrastructure in preparation for the Longitudinal hApp Testing <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">milestone</a>. The Launcher is getting ready for a new release with a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas">very special hApp</a> for developers. And finally, many developers in the ecosystem are busy working on getting their products to a mature state.</p> Three latest releases: maintenance work <p>These releases are mostly about maintenance on build dependencies, automated tests, and continuous integration / release scripts.</p> Holochain 0.0.136 <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130</p> Holochain 0.0.137 <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130, 0.0.131</p><p>This release brings documentation edits, as well as an update to the Lair keystore that fixes an issue with spaces in paths (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1349">#1349</a>). (Note: another such <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/issues/90">issue</a> was found yesterday; the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/91">fix</a> will be in the next Lair release.) <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.137/CHANGELOG.md">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.138 <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130, 0.0.131</p><p>Note: the HDK didn’t get a version number bump in this release.</p> AKASHA Conversations: Intentional culture design for moderating <p>The AKASHA Foundation is a think tank dedicated to investigating and supporting what humane social media might look like. This year they’ve started a series of conversations exploring various topics, and in May they invited Neighbourhoods’ Emaline Friedman to share about what it takes to build a community culture that supports its own health. Emaline avoids buzzwords and speaks in pragmatic terms; it’s worth a listen if you’re designing any app with a social/community element! (I reckon that’s pretty much any app nowadays.)</p> Wednesday Workshop: Keyword index <p>This has been the first Wednesday Workshop in a while. It was an effort to address the immediate need of <a href="https://github.com/artbrock/clutter">Clutter</a>, a microblogging hApp: every good microblog, Clutter included, needs searchable hashtags! So this session worked on building a generic keyword indexing module with type-ahead search.</p><p>This module is, of course, something that almost every hApp needs (in the words of one workshop participant, “lots of things” he’s working on could use it).</p><p>The usage is simple: first, you think up a bunch of keyword types for your hApp (for example, `hashtag` or `cashtag` or `category`). Then, when you want to make a DHT entry discoverable, you give the entry’s hash, the keyword type, and a bunch of keywords to the `index_hash_by_keywords` function. And when you want to search, you pass the keyword type and as many keyword prefix characters as you like to the `search_by_keyword_prefix` function, which gives you back a bunch of DHT hashes along with the full matched keyword.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the indexes are built on `Paths` sharded by the keyword type and the first letter of the keyword. This makes it faster to search, and avoids DHT hotspots. If you think your hApp’s DHT is going to have a lot of keywords, you may want to fork the module to shard by the first two, three, or more characters.</p><p>You can find the initial source code in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/keyword-index">holochain-open-dev/keyword-index</a> GitHub repo, and watch the video here:</p> Demo video: Scaffold a hApp in 10 minutes <p>As you may know, Holochain <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-112-new-releases-everywhere/#fosdem-2022-recap">co-hosted</a> the Web3 <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/web3_infrastructure/">track</a> once again at this year’s FOSDEM open-source conference. A number of people presented on Holochain, but one of the videos I never shared — until today. My colleague just shared this video with me, called Scaffold a hApp in 10 minutes. In it, Guillem Cordoba, an active community member, educator, and hApp developer, demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding">Holochain scaffolding GUI</a> to build a basic CRUD app with a generic UI.</p><p>The video is on FOSDEM’s own video hosting platform; you can watch it by clicking on the still image below.</p><a href="https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fosdem/2022/D.web3/holochain_scaffolding.webm"></a><p>Cover photo courtesy of The U.S. National Archives via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15523362">Wikimedia</a></p>

New methods for simplifying their government regulation compliance efforts for their handling of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>.&nbsp;  



<p><br>As we’ve been discussing in this article series in recent weeks, the Sudo Platform lets enterprise developers integrate digital identities into their applications and build a deeper level of trust with their users by providing them with various digital identity-based capabilities. The platform offers extensive privacy capabilities, from communications to secure browsing to payments, all centered around digital identities. Indeed, the Sudo Platform delivers enterprises the solution they’re looking for through a range of identity, privacy, and cyber safety offerings.</p>



The Sudo Platform.



<p>The diagram above shows the Sudo Platform. At the foundation is a set of scalable hosted services that provide the capabilities to an enterprise developer. An enterprise can integrate these hosted services with its own systems to provide entitlement, federated single sign-on, and other integrations. The hosted services are also integrated into various third-party systems such as cloud providers, telephony carriers, banks, payment processors, blockchains and more. The hosted services are deployed individually for each of Anonyome’s enterprise customers, completely separating them from other enterprise customers’ data and services, and providing the ability to customize that environment for the enterprise.</p>



<p>Above the hosted services are a set of SDKs, documentation and sample apps distributed through GitHub that allow enterprises to quickly develop applications using the Sudo Platform services. All SDKs and sample app source code are open source so enterprise developers can quickly become productive using the Sudo Platform services.Some enterprises require a faster route to market or may lack the internal expertise to create and deploy applications to end users. For those companies, we also publish UI kits that enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications that can be quickly branded and delivered to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms. This allows us to provide a rapid white-label offering that is very attractive to enterprises who want the fastest time to market.</p>



Sudo Platform capabilities.



 The diagram above shows the current capabilities of the Sudo Platform. The digital identity underpins these capabilities, and they can be grouped like this: 



<p></p>



  Open Communication&nbsp;– Allows a user to interact with any third-party service or user they don’t know. Users can provision phone numbers and email addresses and use SMS/MMS, voice calling and email for communication.  Secure Communication&nbsp;– Delivers end-to-end encrypted messaging, voice calling, video and email. Used when both users in the communication have the same app.  Safe Browsing&nbsp;– A compartmentalized browser experience with ad/tracker blocker and site reputation. Supplemented with VPN capabilities.  Cyber Safety&nbsp;– Safe payments, password management, secure id verification and dark web monitoring.  



<p><br>Next week, in part 3, we’ll explore how we’re enhancing Sudo digital identities with decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Businesses and organizations use physical credentials like employee badges, driver’s licenses, passports, social security cards, and more to identify people.</p><p>These physical documents act as proof that authenticates who we are and our authority to do what we do — we’re old enough to go to a nightclub; be identified during international travel; apply for a new job after earning a degree.</p><p>However, with increasing digitization, people are required to interact with thousands of businesses online. </p><p>Providing proof of identity in a digital setting involves a slow and difficult verification process and increases the risk associated with data breaches and fraudulent credentials.</p> What Is the Problem? <p>The current system of recreating documents electronically involves creating a digital version of the credential (like a PDF or an XML document).</p><p>The process is pretty simple and can be implemented quite easily — at least in principle.</p><p>But verifying the origin and authenticity of documents presented in these formats is complex. You have to confirm that:</p>  The Issuer Organization effectively issued that credential and has the authority to do so.  The person submitting the credential is its rightful owner.  The credential is valid and not expired or revoked.  <p><br>In many cases, this involves manually contacting the issuing organization.<br><br>To make things worse, it has become very easy to fake or photoshop certificates and documents.</p><p>Over <a href="https://aaar.assembly.ca.gov/sites/aaar.assembly.ca.gov/files/reports/Intro%20to%20Degree%20Mills.pdf">half of all people claiming a new PhD</a> in the United States have a fake degree.</p><p>Also, these methods force organizations to store vast amounts of personal data from their users. And leave users without control over who has access to their personal information, where their documents are stored, and how they are being used.</p><p>This is where verifiable credentials come into the picture, along with data protection systems that help individuals create and share their identities reliably.</p> What Exactly Are Verifiable Credentials, and How Do They Help? <p>In simple terms, verifiable credentials are a digital version of paper-based credentials that people can present to third parties who need them for verification. However, unlike physical credentials or pdfs, verifiable credentials are tamper-proof and instantly verifiable.</p><p>Organizations can issue their degrees, IDs, licenses, etc., as verifiable digital credentials. </p><p>Just like physical documents, people have the ability to store their verifiable credentials within a digital wallet. </p><p>A digital wallet is a digital version of a traditional or physical wallet that people can carry around as a mobile application on their phone, computer, or even a cloud-based server.</p><p>Using verifiable credentials and digital wallets is a safe and convenient alternative to other identity management solutions in the market today. </p><p>The primary reason why verifiable credentials are becoming increasingly popular among people and businesses all over the world is that it checks a lot of boxes when it comes to user requirements and addresses several issues associated with the current identity management system. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials create immediate trust between parties. </p><p>Using Verifiable Credentials, an organization can immediately ascertain if a document is authentic and who issued it. And do so in seconds without contacting the issuer!</p><p>In addition to being inherently digital (something that has become more of a prerequisite today), verifiable credentials are a big step towards supporting data protection.</p><p>Here’s the thing. </p><p>When you share a physical credential or a pdf, you may be disclosing a lot more personal information than is strictly necessary. </p><p>Verifiable credentials enable people to verify their identity and only divulge information that is relevant to the context. </p><p>Physical credentials don’t offer this kind of flexibility.</p><p>Furthermore, it’s easy to forge paper-based credentials.</p> Why Is a Centralized Identity Management System Problematic? <p>Let’s explore this topic with an example — the recent COVID19 vaccination certificate. </p><p>Verifying a paper-based or pdf-based vaccination certificate in a fast-paced environment like at a cricket match or during flight travel is often time-consuming and prone to errors.</p><p>In a digital ecosystem, these vaccination certificates are stored in a centralized database, making them quicker and more convenient when they have to be verified in such scenarios. </p><p>However, a centralized database that stores personal information about millions of people is a <a href="https://cisomag.eccouncil.org/hackers-attack-database-of-indias-covid-19-patients-and-potential-suspects/">goldmine for hackers</a>.</p><p>Leveraging verifiable credentials and blockchain-based decentralized identity management allows people to store and manage their own data. </p><p>They reserve the right to decide how, when, and with whom they want to share their data. </p><p>To address these challenges, the <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/travel-pass/">IATA Travel Pass Initiative</a> adopted Verifiable Credentials</p> How Do Verifiable Credentials Work? <p>To understand how verifiable credentials work, you need to know about the key entities involved in the verifiable credentials ecosystem — issuer, holder, and verifier. </p><p>As the name suggests, the issuer is an entity that has the authority to issue verifiable credentials. This could be your college university issuing you a diploma after you finish the course, governmental organizations issuing you a national ID, etc. &nbsp;</p><p>The holder is someone who owns the credential. They store and share the verifiable credential from their digital wallet. </p><p>Lastly, the verifier is the one who validates or authenticates the credential. This could be a hiring company you’ve shared your diploma with. </p><p>But how is the identity verified?</p><p>The issuer issues the verifiable credential and digitally signs it with a cryptographic key that only the issuer can use. </p><p>When the verifier receives a credential, they will verify its authenticity through a blockchain, an immutable and decentralized database.</p><p>One thing to note is that the blockchain doesn’t actually store the users' verifiable credentials. It only stores information that the verifier would need to validate the authenticity of the credential — like the issuer's public cryptographic key that matches the one that signed the credential. </p><p>Using this information, the verifier will determine:</p>  If the issuer has the authority to issue that credential.  If the verifiable credential is still valid (not revoked or expired).  If the credential has been tampered with.   <p>This system is trustless. The verifier no longer has to contact the issuer to confirm the validity of the credential. And the best part is that everything happens in a matter of seconds!</p><p>Let’s understand this entire process with a simple example.</p><p>When you get your driver’s license, the DMV (the issuer) will share their public decentralized identifier (DID) — a globally unique identifier that only the DMV can use — on the blockchain along with a schema that shows what type of information is included in the verifiable credential. </p><p>In this case, the schema outline would look like — name, DL number, DOB, address, etc.</p><p>You will be able to store your driver’s license within your digital wallet and control precisely what you want the verifiers to see. </p><p>If you’re pulled over by a police officer who asks for your driver’s license, you can simply show them the digital signature of the DMV that verifies that you have the authority to drive.</p><p>You don’t have to share additional information like your name or address, a freedom you can’t enjoy with physical credentials. </p><p>Should your license expire, the DMV can either revoke the credential or include an expiration date in the verifiable credential, which will be visible to the policeman since it’s relevant to your right to drive (and that’s exactly what the policeman needs to verify).</p> Reasons to Use Verifiable Credentials.<br>  Verifiable Credentials are Interoperable Across Different Systems. <p>Interoperability is one of the most significant benefits of using verifiable credentials. Businesses can interop verifiable credentials across several different systems. </p><p>You have your vaccination certificate, date of birth proof, and passport as verifiable credentials in your digital wallet. Now, if the airport authority asks you for your credentials, you can collect these digital credentials, create a verifiable presentation with attributes from all of them, and share it.</p><p>The reason for interoperability is because Verifiable Credentials are an open standard by the W3C (the same organization that defined the URL as an open standard). Any system based on the same standard will be able to verify these credentials.</p> Privacy. <p>Lack of privacy is one of the major challenges with the current digital identity management systems. It’s not just hackers you have to worry about; even big tech corporations can monitor your activities online.</p><p>However, this isn’t an issue when you use Verifiable Credentials. The data is encrypted and is only entirely accessible to the holder because of the public-private key encryption system. </p><p>Furthermore, Verifiable Credentials use Selective Disclosure and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Using the first one, a user can decide only to share parts of a credential. With the second one, users can prove something about themselves without disclosing the data that supports the proof.</p> Meets compliance requirements. <p>Governments worldwide have started to realize the importance of digital security and privacy. Many have been encouraging the use of decentralized identity technologies.</p><p>One major example is the <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/suche/germany-and-spain-and-join-forces-on-the-development-of-a-cross-border-decentralised-digital-identity-ecosystem-1947302">decentralized digital identity ecosystem by Germany and Spain</a>.</p><p>As governments progress in this direction, it’s obvious that they need a system to meet these compliance requirements. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials perfectly fit the bill.</p> Standardization. <p>Verifiable Credentials have a standard that all issuers and verifiers adhere to, called the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard. </p><p>Let’s take an example. </p><p>You have your passport. All countries have agreed to a standard format to their passports.</p><p>It doesn’t matter who issues it; this credential is read and accepted internationally.</p><p>Furthermore, standardization also simplifies building applications and automations to support the credentials.</p> Easy to implement and use. <p>It’s easy for businesses to issue verifiable credentials without writing a single line of code by <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">leveraging platforms like Dock Certs</a>. </p><p>As for the end-user, it has never been easier to access and share their credentials. A friendly UX masks the complications that go on behind the curtain and makes it effortless for them to securely share their credentials with entities all over the world.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Verifiable credentials have a considerable potential to be an integral part of our future and are already being adopted by Govs, Universities, Healthcare, etc. </p><p>People don’t have to depend on centralized and federated identity systems like Facebook and Google that pose such a massive threat to their privacy. </p><p>Instead, they now have the ability to own and control their digital identity with Verifiable Credentials making it a much more secure experience. </p><p>When Verifiable Credentials are paired with tech like blockchain-based decentralized identity, its momentum has been explosive.</p><p>You can <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">sign up to Dock Certs today</a> and leverage the benefits of verifiable credentials and decentralized identities for your business.</p>

<p>Viel wurde geschrieben und berichtet über Self-Sovereign Identity. Kurz SSI, handelt es sich dabei um einen Ansatz, Individuen die Kontrolle über ihre digitalen Identitäten zurückzugeben. Doch so übersichtlich diese Erklärung auch klingen mag, eine Vielzahl von Methoden und Ansätzen im Netz kann auch zu Unübersichtlichkeiten und gar Falschaussagen führen. In diesem Artikel beleuchten wir Themen und einzelne Aussagen im Detail, die in der letzten Zeit in den Medien diskutiert wurden. Dabei untersuchen wir genauer, ob Self-sovereign Identity in bestimmten Fällen Risiken für Datenmissbrauch erhöhen oder reduzieren kann. Wir schließen mit der Kernthese, dass der Missbrauch von persönlichen Daten leider ganz unabhängig von der genutzten digitalen Identität möglich ist – und wie man sich dennoch durch SSI davor schützen kann.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jolocom steht hinter besseren Lösungen für digitale Identität.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Wichtigste zuerst: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) allein erhöht nicht das Risiko, dass Daten missbraucht werden. Aufgrund der Architektur eröffnet es Möglichkeiten, die Datensicherheit und Privacy zu erhöhen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das größte Risiko liegt darin, dass die Daten der User an einen Onlinedienst weitergegeben werden und diese dann dort gespeichert werden. Heute kennen wir das alle nur zu gut als Nutzerprofil oder Account. Ab dem Moment, in dem ich meine Daten eingegeben habe, muss ich darauf vertrauen, dass der Dienst seine Datenbank gut schützt und meine Daten sicher vor Angriffen durch Hacker und Identitätsdiebe schützt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Erfahrung zeigt uns leider, dass am Ende oft vor allem die Hacker Erfolg haben und täglich tausende Profile und Accounts in die Hände von Datendieben fallen. Dies kann für die Betroffene ein absoluter Albtraum werden und motiviert uns bei Jolocom, an besseren Lösungen für digitale Identität zu arbeiten.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir haben also zwei Möglichkeiten, entweder wir geben den Diensten keine Daten mehr oder wir zwingen sie dazu die Daten besser abzusichern. Am besten wäre es aber natürlich beides zu schaffen, sowohl weniger Daten zu übertragen, und gleichzeitig eine bessere Sicherung der Daten zu schaffen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Login – Kontinuierliches Onboarding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Um weniger Daten bei den Diensten zu speichern und trotzdem deren Angebot voll und ganz nutzen zu können gibt es im SSI Bereich eine großartige Möglichkeit, die dafür sorgt, dass ich meine Daten voll und ganz im Griff habe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Konzept nennt sich kontinuierliches Onboarding und bedeutet, dass bei jedem Login die Profildaten neu übertragen werden (im Fall von Car Sharing also z.B. meinen relevanten Führerscheindaten, meine IBAN und Rechnungsadresse). Sobald sich der Benutzer abmeldet (und das Auto wieder abgestellt habe) kann der Dienst dessen Daten löschen und behält für sich nur einen individuellen Code, mit dem er den Nutzer oder die Nutzerin beim nächsten Besuch wiedererkennt. Zugegebenermaßen ist man davon abhängig, dass der Dienst dies Daten wirklich löscht, dafür gibt es aber viele Anreize, denn das Risiko eines Hacking Angriffs mit sdchweren Folgen sinkt enorm. Und nicht zu vergessen, wenn sich bei meinem User etwas ändert (z.B. die Telefonnummer) bekomme ich es durch das Continuous Onboaridng in dem Moment mit in dem er das nächste Mal meinen Service nutzt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mit SSI können Daten mit einem Klick geteilt werden, ohne zusätzlichen Aufwand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heute wäre der oben beschriebene Prozess des kontinuierlichen Onboarding praktisch unmöglich, da die Daten bei jedem Besuch von Hand eintragen werden müssten oder sogar noch per Video der Führerschein oder Ausweis bestätigt werden müsste. Undenkbar aufwändig und für beide Seiten unattraktiv. Mit SSI können Daten mit einem Klick geteilt werden, ohne zusätzlichen Aufwand. Der Dienst spart durch dieses reduzierte Risiko zudem viel Geld, was noch ein weiterer Grund ist, mit SSI zu arbeiten.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Ganz ohne Regulierung wird es nicht gehen&nbsp;</p>



<p>So gut wir mit SSI dazu beitragen können, dass Dienste keine Daten mehr über uns speichern müssen, ist es keine Garantie, dass sie das nicht tun. Um sicher zu gehen, dass sie nicht mehr Daten als notwendig von uns abfragen, hilft nur Regulierung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Denn in der Situation in der wir als einzelner User mit den Diensten verhandeln, sitzen wir oft am kürzeren Hebel. Wir wollen den Dienst nutzen und der einzige Weg führt über die Akzeptanz ihrer Bedingungen, ob gerechtfertigt oder nicht. In einer digitalen Welt, in der wir auf viele Dienste praktisch nicht verzichten können, gleicht das einer Erpressung. So sind wir dem Datenmissbrauch oft ausgeliefert und müssen mit ansehen, wie wir entweder aus der Gesellschaft ausgeschlossen werden oder unsere Daten für eine Teilhabe am digitalen Leben in die Waagschale geworfen werden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom positioniert sich ausdrücklich gegen Datenhandel und Tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zum Glück gibt es in Europa schon eine sehr vielversprechende Gesetzeslage. Denn die DSGVO (Datenschutzgrundverordnung) setzt klare Grenzen, was ohne gewichtigen Grund von den Usern verlangt werden darf. Zuletzt wurde der Digital Markets Act verabschiedet, der die Rechte gegenüber Diensten nochmals gestärkt hat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es stimmt zwar, dass SSI aus einem liberalen Denken kommt, das heißt aber nicht, dass unsere europäische Version SSI komplett unreguliert sein soll.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Muss nur auf die Regulierung gewartet werden?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ganz konkret umsetzen lässt sich eine solche Regulierung für SSI aber auch schon bevor der Gesetzgeber handelt, indem sich die an einem SSI Ökosystem beteiligten Akteure gemeinsame Regeln geben und Mittel festlegen, um sie durchzusetzen. Das ganze nennt sich Trust Framework. In einem SSI Ökosystem kann so beschränkt werden, welche Daten beim User abgefragt werden dürfen und von wem. Der Verifier muss dann klar begründen, was mit diesen Daten geschieht, und ist an das Trust Framework gebunden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Auch wir bei Jolocom arbeiten an diesen Trust Frameworks im Rahmen der Schaufensterprojekte des BMWK und begleiten in Brüssel die Entwicklung von eIDAS 2.0, einer neuen Regulierung, in der ähnliche Fragen aufgegriffen werden. Tatsächlich kann man eIDAS als eine Art europäisches Trust Framework verstehen. Schon heute fällt der elektronische Personalausweis darunter. In Zukunft dann sehr wahrscheinlich auch Self-sovereign Identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Böse gesprochen könnte man sagen, dass man bei SSI nur entscheiden kann, wem man seine Daten auf welchem Wege gibt, nicht aber was mit ihnen passiert. Das ist allerdings schon sehr, sehr viel im Vergleich zum Status Quo. Was mit den Daten passiert, ist dann nochmal eine neue Frage und keine technische. Da geht es dann um den Trust Frameworks und die Umsetzung von Policies. Das Ganze muss letztendlich über Zertifizierung und Zulassung geregelt werden. Es stimmt zwar, dass SSI aus einem liberalen Denken kommt, das heißt aber nicht, dass unsere europäische Version SSI komplett unreguliert sein soll.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mittelfristig ist jedenfalls davon auszugehen, dass sich nur solche Wallets am Markt behaupten können, die auch in einem Trust Framework zugelassen/zertifiziert sind und entsprechend nur mit solchen Issuern und Verifiern sprechen, die ebenfalls entsprechend zugelassen sind. Das SSI System ist nicht für schlecht gesicherte Datenbanken verantwortlich.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bedeutet Self-sovereign Identity, dass ich alles selbst entscheiden kann?&nbsp; (-&gt; evt auch für den Q&amp;A Artikel geeignet)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Idee, dass ich als User bei SSI die komplette Hoheit über meine digitale Identität habe wird oft missverstanden. Bei SSI geht es im Kern darum, dass meine Digitalen Identität in meiner Kontrolle liegt, ich also entscheiden kann wem ich meine Daten wann zeige und wofür. Dieser wichtige Grundsatz ist schon im ersten Artikel zu SSI von Christopher Allen von 2016 enthalten. Zwar kann ich mit SSI auch Identitätsdaten über mich selbst anlegen und z.B. behaupten Astronaut zu sein. Spätestens in dem Moment, indem ich mit dieser Identität dann eine Raumfähre besteigen will, würde ich aber auffliegen. In der Realität ist es nämlich so, dass wir unsere Identität vor allem aus dem zusammenstellen, was andere über uns sagen. So ist unser Personalausweis nur deswegen so geschätzt, weil er vom Staat ausgestellt wurde und damit eine hoheitliche Autorität meine Identität bestätigt. Ähnlich ist es bei einem Studierendenausweis, der nur dann glaubwürdig ist, wenn er von der Universität ausgestellt wurde.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Make the front door as secure as possible, and you may as well never need a house key again. By implementing more complex passwords, organizations end up wasting time, money, and resources on password resets while reducing workforce productivity. Secure application login is important, however the initial authentication point for most of the workforce is the laptop, desktop or workstation itself. HYPR provides a simple yet secure login with its passwordless and phishing-resistant MFA solution, which identifies the user at the desktop and makes the front door as secure as possible. As a result, your desktop MFA can be used to seamlessly and safely log into your device, enabling access to applications in real time.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Machine Learning, Edge, and Decentralization to Drive Your Investment Decisions<br>Challenges to the business operating environment are mounting – a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/charting-the-path-to-the-next-normal/risk-abounds-how-ready-are-companies">survey of over 200 executives</a> conducted in 2021 revealed the resilience dimensions most important to their strategy and operations. Digital and technological resilience is rising to the top, just behind financial resilience and operational resilience as being most important to the business across a variety of sectors. Unfortunately, it is not just a matter of threats and vulnerabilities to enterprise systems – although these are many and in constant flux. The competitive and customer demands for flexible digital services contribute to the shifting corporate attention to achieving digital and technological resilience, and the innovation it requires to maintain it. <br><br>There are many paths forward when taking action to stay ahead in this digital and technological innovation race. Some find it helpful to orient their action around concepts like the Composable Enterprise, Privacy-by-Design, Zero Trust, and so on. Whatever your organization chooses to orient its future strategy and direction with, it must be accompanied by action – in other words, the direction your organization chooses to innovate in will have an influence on its investment decisions. <br><br>This post is not a guide, but a place to find inspiration. The technologies and concepts you find here may not directly fit your organization’s targets, but it may trigger the right conversation with your team on how to stay ahead of the curve in your industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine Learning <br>Machine Learning should be thought of as a concept rather than by use case – there are simply too many methods and inputs that could be utilized – classification tasks, regression tasks, focusing on images, words, speech, video, and so on. Therefore, take inspiration from the challenges that organizations are facing – the multiplying volume of data being generated and collected by organizations, the massive amounts of sensitive data that are spread across multiple clouds, the many points of interaction between employees and systems, employees and customers, and customers and systems. &nbsp;<br><br>Cybersecurity will be an important area that is influenced by machine learning. Read this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb70278/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity">Leadership Brief</a> for an analysis on the scope and challenges of machine learning in cybersecurity, or the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5032">CISO Panel on Securing the Composable Enterprise</a> in May at the EIC. <br><br>Data management and governance is a foundational element of machine learning, but also serves many other purposes in the organization. Data governance supports privacy programs, secures sensitive information and intellectual property during collaboration, and of course is the motor behind preparing and maintaining datasets of corporate data for business intelligence and machine learning projects. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80772/ai-service-clouds">AI Service Clouds</a> can play a role in facilitating good data governance and management throughout the development lifecycle, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80529/next-generation-business-intelligence-platforms">next-generation BI platforms</a> often contain elements of machine learning to deliver recommendations, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5097/1">this session at the EIC</a> considers how to secure the hyper-connected, data-driven world <br><br>Edge <br>The edge expands the horizon of opportunities. This can be device-driven, linked tightly with machine learning that delivers insights from streamed data from and at the edge, or emerge as a defining aspect of cybersecurity architectures. <br><br>IoT usage creates a need for, perhaps even a dependency on edge computing.&nbsp; For more ideas on how to manage this changing reality, check out the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/897">IoT and Hyperconnected Enterprise track at the EIC</a>.

SASE is an enabling concept, that can invite more usage of edge devices and locations while maintaining a secure environment. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an81203/implementing-sase">This Advisory Note</a> gives more context to implementing SASE in the organization. <br><br>Decentralized <br>Relax. Decentralized doesn’t always mean blockchain. The work that is being done on enterprise use of the blockchain is just the initial steps in building interoperability between distributed, independent services while still maintaining security and trust. It is a foundational concept in composable enterprises, the topic of the EIC’s opening keynote. Concepts like the<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5031"> Global Assured Identity Network</a> work on a decentralized concept – supporting assured identity providers utilizing the blockchain, but more importantly supporting many different methods of providing an assured identity for cross-border trust. <br><br>This collection of ideas just barely scratches the surface of innovative technologies being used in the enterprise. Whether your organization’s investment strategy focuses on digitalization, boosting cybersecurity, streamlining processes, or getting involved in industry networks, consider what’s happening on the cutting edge.

  <p>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to deploy a JHipster-based reactive microservice to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You’ll use Azure’s Cosmos DB as a persistent store for one of the services. For security, you’ll use Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. You’ll also securely encrypt all secrets in the project configuration files using Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code>. This tutorial focuses on deploying an already generated project to Azure AKS. It does not go into great detail about generating the project. To see how the project was generated using JHipster, take a look at <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>.</p>

<p>The project has a few different pieces:</p>

 
   JHipster Registry: a Eureka server for service discovery and a Spring Cloud Config server for centralized configuration management 
   Gateway: public Spring Cloud Gateway application using Vue 
   Store: Spring Boot microservice using Azure’s Cosmo DB API for MongoDB 
   Blog: Spring Boot microservice using a Neo4J database 
 

<p></p>

<p>This tutorial has a lot of different technologies in it. I’ve tried to make it as simple and as explicit as possible, but it’s probably helpful to have some basic knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes before you start.</p>

<p>If you’re already familiar with all the tech in this tutorial, you can skip ahead to the prerequisites section. If not, I’m going to explain them a little before we move on.</p>

 JHipster microservices architecture overview 

<p><a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">JHipster</a> is a development platform that streamlines the generation, development, and deployment of both monolithic and microservice applications. It supports a dizzying array of frontend (Angular, React, and Vue) and backend (Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, Node.js, and .NET) technologies. It’s designed to be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes, and can easily deploy to all the major cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure, Heroku, Cloud Foundry, Google Cloud Platform, and OpenShift.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The project in this tutorial uses Spring Boot with Java resource servers and a Vue frontend. It was built with the JHipster generator that quickly scaffolds a new application based on either an interactive shell or a DSL file. You can read more about generating microservices with JHipster <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-microservices/">in their docs</a>. One of the slick features of the JHipster generator is that you can generate data entities along with applications.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a> that is generated with the microservice includes two important functions: a Eureka server and a Spring Cloud Config server. The Eureka server allows the microservices to dynamically find each other without having to use hard-coded URIs. This means that the microservice can scale and services can be replaced without causing problems. It’s a bit like a phonebook or a DNS service for the microservice. The <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/">Spring Cloud Config</a> server allows project configuration to be centralized and distributed to all of the different services. In this tutorial you’ll use this feature to configure all of the services for Okta OAuth in one place.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/api-gateway/">JHipster API Gateway</a> is the public face of your microservice. All public traffic comes through this service, which also includes the Vue frontend. The gateway is one of three application types that can be created by the JHipster generator DSL. The other two are monolith and microservice. A monolith is a non-microservice application with a single service.</p>

<p>The store service and blog service are both examples of the microservice application type. This means that each service is a Spring Boot resources server with some type of SQL or NoSQL backend.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The generator creates four applications. They are designed to be built and run as docker containers, which makes it easy for them to be packaged in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> pods. Kubernetes is a container orchestrator specifically designed for managing microservice networks. It’s something like Docker Compose but designed for microservices with a lot of great features like service discovery, load balancing, automatic rollouts and restarts, resource management, and storage mounting.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>This tutorial has a lot of pieces. Install the required software below and sign up for an Azure Cloud account. You’ll need a free Okta account, but you can use the Okta CLI to sign up for it later in the tutorial.</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a>: you’ll need to have both Docker Engine and Docker Compose installed (If you install the Docker desktop, this will automatically install both. On Linux, if you install Docker Engine individually, you will have to also <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">install Docker Compose</a>) separately. 
   <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>: you’ll need a Docker Hub to host the docker images so that Azure can pull them. 
   <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11</a>: this tutorial requires Java 11. If you need to manage multiple Java versions, SDKMAN! is a good solution. Check out <a href="https://sdkman.io/installit">their docs to install it</a>. 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI</a>: you’ll use Okta to add security to the microservice network. You can register for a free account from the CLI. 
   <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">Azure Cloud account</a>: they offer a free-tier account with a $200 credit to start. 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">Azure CLI</a>: you’ll use the Azure CLI to manage the Kubernetes cluster. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a>: CLI to manage Kubernetes clusters. 
 

<p>If you have never had an Azure account before, you can create a new one that will allow free-tier access and has $200 credit allocated to it. This is more than enough to finish this tutorial. However, the credit does expire after 30 days. If you do not have credit left or your credit has expired, this tutorial should only cost a few dollars if you stop and start the AKS cluster when you are not working on it. You can keep an eye on your costs using the cost explorer in the Azure portal and set alerts if you are concerned about it. Upgrading to pay-as-you-go may also alleviate some resource throttling issues around testing the AKS clusters.</p>

 Spring Boot microservices for Azure and Cosmos DB 

<p>This project is based on two of Matt Raible’s tutorials: <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> and <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. In these tutorials, he builds a reactive Java microservice architecture and shows how to deploy it to Google Cloud (GCP). I have modified the project to work with Azure and Cosmos DB.</p>

<p>You will first run the project using Docker Compose. Once you have this working, you will run the project as a Kubernetes cluster on Azure. My modifications were relatively minor and involved removing the unnecessary MongoDB instances (from both the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and from the Kubernetes descriptors) as well as updating environment values to point the <code>store</code> service to the Cosmos DB instance instead of a MongoDB instance.</p>

<p>Listed briefly, the changes I made from Matt Raible’s posts to make this work with Azure and Cosmos DB are as follows. You can skip this list (and the next section) and go right to cloning the Git repository if you want, but since this documents how to update a JHipster-generated project to use Cosmos DB, I thought it was worth including.</p>

<p>In the <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>

 
   removed the MongoDB service 
   updated the <code>store</code> service property <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> to point to the Cosmos DB instance via a <code>.env</code> file 
   removed the Keycloak service and the environment variables that configured auth to use Keycloak from the remaining services (not strictly necessary but cleaned things up) 
 

<p>In the <code>k8s/store-k8s</code> directory:</p>

 
   removed the <code>store-mongodb.yml</code> file (This creates the MongoDB Kubernetes service that our project does not need.) 
   in <code>store-deployment.yml</code>:
     
       removed the <code>initContainers</code> (The init container waits for the MongoDB instance, which is removed.) 
       updated <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> env value of the <code>store-app</code> container to the Cosmos DB URI (This points the store to the Cosmos DB instance.) 
       properly secured the Cosmos DB connection string using Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code> 
     
   
 

 Setting the store app’s initial status for Eureka 

<p>Creating this tutorial, I ran into a problem with the store app getting stuck as <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>. When I inspected the logs, I found that the service started as <code>UP</code>, quickly went to <code>DOWN</code>, and then <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>. Later, it would go back to <code>UP</code> but the Eureka server never registered this change.</p>

<p>There’s an open issue documenting this problem on <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/3941">Spring Cloud Netflix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/issues/1398">Netflix Eureka</a>.</p>

<p>A temporary fix taken from the issue on GitHub is to override the health reporting implementation so that it returns <code>DOWN</code> instead of <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code> while the program is still starting. This blocks it from ever reporting <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>. You can see the fix in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-azure-kubernetes-cosmosdb-example/blob/main/store/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/store/EurekaFix.java"><code>EurekaFix.java</code></a> file in the store app.</p>

 Clone the microservices project from GitHub 

<p>Clone the modified JHipster reactive microservice project from GitHub and checkout the <code>start</code> tag.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-azure-kubernetes-cosmosdb-example.git \
  azure-k8s-cosmosdb
cd azure-k8s-cosmosdb
git fetch --all --tags
git checkout tags/start -b working
</code>   

 Create the Azure Cosmos DB with API for MongoDB 

<p>You need to create an Azure Cosmos DB instance. You can either use the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure Portal</a> or the CLI to create a new Cosmos DB instance. Make sure you create a one that is Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB (Cosmos DB supports various database types). If you use the portal, it’s pretty self-explanatory but don’t forget to enable the free tier and enable a public network.</p>

<p>Here are the instructions for using the CLI.</p>

<p>Log into the Azure CLI using a Bash shell. This will redirect you to a browser to log into the Azure portal.</p>

   <code>az login
</code>   

<p>This should show you the subscriptions for your account.</p>

   <code>[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "21c44b6d-a007-4d48-80cb-c45966ca1af9",
    "id": "90eb9f51-b4be-4a9f-a69f-11b7668a874d",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Azure subscription 1",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "21c44b6d-a007-4d48-80cb-c45966ca1af9",
    "user": {
      "name": "andrewcarterhughes@outlook.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
</code>   

<p>Set the subscription in the shell. Your subscription is probably <code>Azure subscription 1</code>, as that is the default. Make sure you use the subscription that was created when you registered for a free account (or whatever subscription you want if you already have an account).</p>

   <code>az account set --subscription &lt;you-subscription-name&gt;
</code>   

<p>Open a Bash shell. Create a resource group with the following command.</p>

   <code>az group create --name australia-east --location australiaeast
</code>   

<p>Create the Cosmos DB account in the resource group. Substitute your Azure subscription name in the command below (it’s probably <code>Azure subscription 1</code>, which is what mine defaulted to).</p>

   <code>az cosmosdb create --name jhipster-cosmosdb --resource-group australia-east \
  --kind MongoDB --subscription &lt;you-subscription-name&gt; --enable-free-tier true \
  --enable-public-network true
</code>   

<p>Once that command returns (it may take a few minutes), it should list a lot of JSON showing properties of the created Cosmos DB account.</p>

<p>If you get an error that says:</p>

   <code>(BadRequest) DNS record for cosmosdb under zone Document is already taken.
</code>   

<p>Then you need to change the <code>--name</code> parameter to something else. Since this is used to generate the public URI for the database it needs to be unique across Azure. Try adding your name or a few random numbers.</p>

<p>I’m using the Australia East location because that was the location that had free tier AKS nodes available when I wrote this tutorial. You can use any resource group you want as long as it allows you to create the AKS cluster later in the tutorial. Even if you can’t use the free tier or the free credits, if you stop and start the AKS cluster between working on the tutorial, the cost should be very small (mine was less than a few dollars). The application should still work if the Cosmos DB database is in a different resource group and region since the database URI is configured to be publicly accessible.</p>

<p>List the connection string for the Cosmos DB API for MongoDB endpoint using the following command. If you changed the database name above, you will need to update it in the command below.</p>

   <code>az cosmosdb keys list --type connection-strings --name jhipster-cosmosdb \
  --resource-group australia-east
</code>   

<p>This will list four connection strings. You need to save (copy and paste somewhere) the first, the primary connection string. (Ellipses have been used for brevity below.)</p>

   <code>{
  "connectionStrings": [
    {
      "connectionString": "mongodb://jhipster-cosmosdb:XBq5KZ81V8hM63KjCOezi1arq...",
      "description": "Primary MongoDB Connection String"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
</code>   

<p>Edit the <code>.env</code> file in the <code>docker-compose</code> subdirectory. Add the following variables to it, substituting your connection string for the placeholder. Make sure the connection string is enclosed in quotes. This value is referenced by the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and passed to the <code>store</code> service, pointing it to the Cosmos DB MongoDB database.</p>

<p>The <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> will be used as the key for encrypting sensitive values stored in the Spring Cloud Config and used by the JHipster registry. You can put whatever value you want in there. A UUID works well, but any string value will work. The longer, the better.</p>

<p><code>docker-compose/.env</code></p>

 <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGO_URI=&lt;your-connection-string&gt;
ENCRYPT_KEY=&lt;your-encryption-key&gt;
</code> 

 Configure identity with Okta 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Take note of the name because you will need to find the app in the Okta Admin Console and update the redirect URIs a little later. The <code>okta apps</code> command creates a config file named <code>.okta.env</code>. It will look something like the following. It helpfully lists the values you will need in the next step.</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="2989u928u383..."
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="09328uu098u4..."
</code>   

<p>Both the Docker Compose project and the Kubernetes project use Spring Cloud Config to centralize configuration. The JHipster registry service makes these config values available to all of the other services in the cluster.</p>

<p>Open <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code> and add the following to the end, filling in the <code>issuer-uri</code>, <code>client-id</code>, and <code>client-secret</code> taken from the <code>.okta.env</code> file. This is the Spring Cloud Config file for the Docker Compose project.</p>

<p><code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code></p>

   <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
            client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
</code>   

 Build the Docker images and run the app with Docker Compose 

<p>You’re all set to run the app locally using Docker and Docker Compose. You need to build the docker image for each of the projects: <code>gateway</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>blog</code> (you don’t have to build the <code>registry</code> because it uses an image).</p>

<p>In the three different app directories, run the following Gradle command.</p>

   <code>./gradlew -Pprod bootJar jibDockerBuild
</code>   

<p>The default Docker resource settings may not be enough to run this project. You may need to bump them. These settings worked for me.</p>
 
   CPUs: 8 
   Memory: 25 GB 
   Swap: 2 GB 
   Disk image size: 120 GB 
 

<p>Navigate to the <code>docker-compose</code> directory and run the app. You can use the <code>-d</code> param to run it as a daemon but for the moment I like seeing the logs. You’re just running this in Docker Compose as a warm-up for the Azure deployment anyway.</p>

   <code>docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Give that a minute or two to finish running all the services.</p>

<p>Open the gateway service at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>Go to Account and Sign in. You should be directed to the Okta sign-in form.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should be able to authenticate with your Okta credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure all parts of the application are working. First, test the store (which is using the Cosmos DB Mongo database) by going to Entities and Product. Make sure you can add a new product and see it in the list of products. Next, create a blog (Entities and Blog).</p>

<p>If that works, you can take a look at the Administration menu. There’s a lot of helpful info there.</p>

<p>You can also check the JHipster Registry at <code>http://localhost:8761</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 Encrypt the client secret 

<p>Leaving secrets in plain text in repositories is a security risk. There are two values in this app that are sensitive: the Cosmos DB connection string that includes the username and password and the Okta OIDC app client secret. You were able to avoid exposing the database credentials by using a <code>.env</code> file. However, the Okta client secret is exposed as plain text in the Spring Cloud Config file (<code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code>). This can be encrypted using the JHipster registry.</p>

<p>Open the registry (<code>http://localhost:8761</code>) and click on Configuration and Encryption.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Paste your client secret in the text box. Click Encrypt.</p>

<p>This, incidentally, is why you needed the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> property in the <code>.env</code> file.  That’s the key that JHipster registry uses to encrypt these values (so keep it secret!).</p>

<p>You can now copy the encrypted value and paste it back into the <code>application.yml</code> file. Make sure you include the <code>{cipher}</code> part. It should look similar to below. Don’t forget the quotes!</p>

<p><code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code></p>

   <code>...
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: 0oa6ycm987987uy98
            client-secret: "{cipher}88acb434dd088acb434dd088acb434dd0..."
</code>   

<p>Stop the app if you have not already using <code>control-c</code>. Restart it.</p>

   <code>docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Make sure you can still sign into the gateway at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>You may be wondering (like I did initially), why can’t I just put the client secret in the <code>.env</code> file? This doesn’t work because the <code>.env</code> file is processed by Spring Cloud Config and JHipster registry after the container is composed, not by Docker Compose during the container creation, which is when the <code>.env</code> file is processed.</p>

<p>You’re done with the Docker Compose implementation. To clean up, you can run the following command. This will stop and remove the containers, networks, volumes, and images created by <code>docker-compose up</code>.</p>

   <code>docker-compose down --remove-orphans
</code>   

 Create the Azure Kubernetes cluster 

<p>The app works locally. Now it’s time to deploy it to an Azure Kubernetes Cluster (AKS). The first step is to create an AKS cluster.</p>

<p>It’s super easy to use the CLI to create a cluster. I’ll show you the command below. However, there’s a wrinkle. The free tier cannot create a cluster in many of the regions because of resource quotas. At least, this was the case when I was working on this tutorial. Nor is there an easy way to quickly see what regions will allow you to create a free-tier cluster. This is why I used Australia East as the region–it allowed me to create a free cluster.</p>

<p>If the command below does not work, I suggest going to the Azure portal and creating a Kubernetes cluster there. Select Create a service and Kubernetes Service. You’ll have to select different regions and see what sizes are available (under Node size and Change size) until you find a region that will allow you to create something in the free tier. But hopefully the command will work and you won’t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>The size I’m using for this tutorial is <code>Standard B4ms</code> with two nodes. I found that I needed two nodes for the cluster to start properly.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create the AKS cluster.</p>

   <code>az aks create --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo \
  --node-count 2 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys --node-vm-size standard_b4ms
</code>   

<p>This will probably take a few minutes.</p>

<p>As a side note, you can stop the cluster at any point. This will pause billing on the cluster.</p>

   <code>az aks stop --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo 
</code>   

<p>And you can start it again.</p>

   <code>az aks start --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo 
</code>   

<p>You can stop and start the cluster from the Azure portal as well.</p>

<p>The next step is to get the credentials for the cluster and merge them into <code>.kube/config</code> so that <code>kubectl</code> can use them. Use the following command.</p>

   <code>az aks get-credentials --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo
</code>   

<p>You should see output that ends like the following.</p>

   <code>Merged "jhipster-demo" as current context in /home/andrewcarterhughes/.kube/config
</code>   

<p>You should be able to use <code>kubectl</code> to get the node on Azure.</p>

   <code>kubectl get nodes
</code>   

   <code>NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE    VERSION
aks-nodepool1-21657131-vmss000000   Ready    agent   105s   v1.22.6
aks-nodepool1-21657131-vmss000001   Ready    agent   108s   v1.22.6
</code>   

<p>You can also list a lot of information about the cluster in JSON format using:</p>

   <code>az aks list --resource-group australia-east
</code>   

 Configure Kubernetes for Okta and Cosmos DB 

<p>The Kubernetes files in the <code>k8s</code> directory were created with the JHipster Kubernetes sub-generator (<a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/kubernetes/">see the docs for info</a>). To see how the original project was generated, take a look at <a>Matt Raible’s JHipster and Kubernetes tutorial</a>. As outlined above, these files were modified to work with Azure Cosmos DB instead of MongoDB in a Kubernetes pod (which is what the sub-generator assumes).</p>

<p>Configure Spring OAuth in the Kubernetes pod by updating <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>. You can use the same values you used above in the Docker Compose section, in <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure you use the encrypted client secret enclosed in quotes with the <code>{cipher}</code> prefix. You’re going to copy both the encryption key and the encrypted client secret from the Docker Compose configuration to avoid having to re-encrypt the client secret with a new key.</p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: "{cipher}&lt;encrypted-client-secret&gt;"
</code>   

<p>To configure the JHipster Registry to use OIDC for authentication, you have to modify <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> to enable the <code>oauth2</code> profile. This has already been done for you in the example app in the project Git repository.</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

<p>Also in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, update the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> value to use the same encryption key you used above in the Docker Compose section in the <code>.env</code> file.</p>

   <code>- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  value: &lt;your-encryption-key&gt;
</code>   

<p>To configure the <code>store</code> service to use the Cosmo database, you need to put your connection string in <code>k8s/store-k8s/store-deployment.yml</code>.</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI
  value: "&lt;your-connection-string&gt;"
</code>   

<p>Both the encryption key and the database connection string are sensitive values that need to be encrypted. You’ll see how to do that just a little later in this tutorial.</p>

 Build Docker images and push to Docker Hub 

<p>Previously you built the docker images, but you left them in the local repository. Now you need to upload them to Docker Hub so that Azure AKS can find them. If you haven’t already <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">signed up for a Docker Hub account</a>, please do so now.</p>

<p>In each of the three directories (<code>blog</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>gateway</code>), run the following command. Save your Docker Hub username in a Bash variable as shown below and you can copy and paste the commands and run them in each service directory.</p>

   <code>DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME=&lt;docker-hub-username&gt;
# in blog
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/blog
# in store
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/store
# in gateway
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/gateway
</code>   

<p>To briefly explain what’s happening here, take a look at the blog service’s Kubernetes descriptor file. It defines a container named <code>blog-app</code> that uses the docker image <code>andrewcarterhughes/blog</code>, which is my Docker Hub username and the blog image.</p>

<p><code>k8s/blog-k8s/blog-deployment.yml</code></p>

   <code>containers:
  - name: blog-app
    image: andrewcarterhughes/blog
</code>   

<p>Thus in the <code>k8s</code> directory, each service (store, blog, gateway, and registry) defines a container and a docker image to be run in that container, along with a whole lot of configuration (which is really a lot of what JHipster is bootstrapping for you). The registry does not have a project folder because it uses a stock image that can be pulled directly from the JHipster Docker repository.</p>

<p>To use the images you just created with Kubernetes, do a find and replace in the <code>k8s</code> directory. Replace all instances of <code>andrewcarterhughes</code> with your Docker Hub username (<code>&lt;docker-hub-username&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>One nice feature of Kubernetes is the ability to define <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/">init containers</a>. These are containers that run before the main container and can be used to create or wait for necessary resources like databases. I noticed while I was debugging things in this app that a lot of the errors happened in the init containers. It’s helpful to know this because if you try and inspect the main container log nothing will be there because the container hasn’t even started yet. You have to check the log for the init container that failed. The Kubernetes management tools that I mention below really come in handy for this.</p>

 Deploy your microservices to Azure AKS 

<p>You can manage a Kubernetes service purely with <code>kubectl</code>. However, there are some pretty helpful tools for monitoring and logging. Both <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s">k9s</a> and <a href="https://k8slens.dev/">Kubernetes Lens</a> are great. I recommend installing one or both of these and using them to inspect and monitor your Kubernetes services. They are especially helpful when things go wrong (not that things ever go wrong, I wouldn’t know anything about that, I just heard about it from friends, I swear). Kubernetes Lens is a full-on desktop app that describes itself as a Kubernetes IDE. In comparison, k9s is a lighter-weight, text-based tool.</p>

<p>Open a Bash shell and navigate to the <code>k8s</code> subdirectory of the project.</p>

<p>Deploy your microservice architecture to Azure with:</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>If you open this file, you’ll see that it creates the namespace and applies the project files. If you do this manually, it’s important that the namespace is created first and that the registry is run before the other services.</p>

   <code>...
suffix=k8s
kubectl apply -f namespace.yml
kubectl apply -f registry-${suffix}/
kubectl apply -f blog-${suffix}/
kubectl apply -f gateway-${suffix}/
kubectl apply -f store-${suffix}/
...
</code>   

<p>You can check on your pods with the following command. If you’re on the free tier, this may take a few minutes. Using the pay-as-you-go plan, everything was up and running almost immediately for me.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n demo
</code>   

   <code>NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
blog-6896f6dd58-mbjkn                 1/1     Running   0          3m51s
blog-neo4j-0                          1/1     Running   0          3m48s
gateway-7f6d57765f-2fhfb              1/1     Running   0          3m46s
gateway-postgresql-647476b4d5-jdp5c   1/1     Running   0          3m44s
jhipster-registry-0                   1/1     Running   0          3m52s
store-7889695569-k4wkv                1/1     Running   0          3m41s
</code>   

<p>Here’s an example of what this looks like with Kubernetes Lens (the containers were still booting).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Another useful command is <code>describe</code>. I won’t replicate the output here, but if you want more detailed information for debugging, you can also run the following.</p>

   <code>kubectl describe pods -n demo
</code>   

<p>To tail logs, you can use the name of the pod.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt; --tail=-1 -n demo
</code>   

<p>Although, like I said, k9s and Lens are really the way to go for more detailed inspection.</p>

<p>Here’s a screenshot from k9s. You can dig down into the different pods to get more detailed information and inspect logs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can use port-forwarding to see the JHipster Registry.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8761</code>. You will be redirected to the Okta login screen, after which you will be taken to the registry.</p>

<p>Make sure everything is green. If you have an error, check the logs for the pod that caused the error. You can restart a specific deployment by deleting it and re-applying it. For example, to restart the store, you can use the commands below from the <code>k8s</code> directory.</p>

   <code>kubectl delete -f store-k8s/
kubectl apply -f store-k8s/
</code>   

<p>Once all is good, <code>control-c</code> to stop forwarding the registry. Expose the gateway and open it.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>Authenticate with Okta. Make sure you can add blogs, posts, tags, and products. Because the store service uses the same Cosmos DB instance that you were using with Docker Compose locally, any test products you created earlier will still be there.</p>

<p>In preparation for the next step, delete everything you just deployed to AKS in the <code>demo</code> namespace.</p>

   <code>kubectl delete all --all -n demo
</code>   

<p>The first <code>all</code> refers to all resource types. The second <code>--all</code> refers to every object in the resource types (as opposed to specifying an object name or ID). Thus by specifying the namespace you are deleting every object of every resource type in that namespace.</p>

<p>This is one of the benefits of using a namespace. You can do a delete like this. If you do this from the default namespace, you’ll risk deleting things you didn’t mean to delete or pods added by Kubernetes and Azure for infrastructure administration.</p>

<p>You can also just delete the entire namespace. It will be recreated if you use the Bash script to apply the deployments. This deletes absolutely everything from the namespace but is a little slower. If you do this, you need to make sure that you recreate the namespace later (I’ll remind you).</p>

   <code>kubectl delete namespace demo
</code>   

 Encrypt the sensitive configuration parameters 

<p>There are two really important config values that need to be encrypted: (1) the Cosmos DB connection string (which contains the database credentials) and (2) the OIDC client secret. Because these two values are processed differently, you’re going to use two slightly different methods for encrypting them.</p>

<p>There are three different layers of encryption happening here. I found this a little confusing so I’m going to explain it briefy.</p>

 
   JHipster registry encryption for Spring Cloud Config values (values in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>) 
   Kubernetes “encryption” (obfuscation, really) that moves secrets found in Kubernetes deployment files to base64-encoded secrets files 
   <code>kubeseal</code> which hardens Kubernetes secrets to properly encrypted values 
 

<p>The first above is only for Spring Cloud Config values. The latter two are used to encrypt values in the Kubernetes descriptor files (the other <code>yml</code> files in the <code>k8s</code> directory).</p>

<p>When you use JHipster registry encryption, you have to define an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> value that is used by JHipster to encrypt the secrets. However, because this value is stored in <code>yml</code> files that are going to be committed to a repository, this value must be properly encrypted to ensure the security of the Spring Cloud Config values.</p>

<p>The Cosmos DB connection string (the <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> env var) is a Kubernetes deployment value, same as the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>, not a Spring Cloud Config value.</p>

<p>Thus, to harden the OIDC client secret, you must (1) define an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> to enable JHipster registry encryption, (2) use JHipster registry to encrypt the client ID and place the encrypted value in the <code>application-configmap.yml</code>, and (3) use Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code> to properly encrypt the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>.</p>

<p>Securing the Cosmos DB connection string is the same as the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>: use Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code> to properly encrypt it.</p>

<p>Matt Raible did a great job of explaining secrets management in Kubernetes in his post, <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. He also linked to a lot of great resources. I’m not going to go into much more detail explaining it here. Check his post out for more info.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is install <code>kubeseal</code> into the AKS cluster. You can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">the <code>kubeseal</code> GitHub page</a> for more info.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.17.5/controller.yaml
</code>   

<p>Retrieve the certificate keypair that this controller generates.</p>

   <code>kubectl get secret -n kube-system -l sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key -o yaml
</code>   

<p>Copy the raw value of <code>tls.crt</code> and decode it. You can use the command line, or learn more about <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/#base64-encode-the-client-id-and-client-secret">base64 encoding/decoding</a> in our documentation.</p>

   <code>echo -n &lt;paste-value-here&gt; | base64 --decode
</code>   

<p>Put the raw value in a <code>tls.crt</code> file.</p>

<p>Next, install Kubeseal. On macOS, you can use Homebrew. For other platforms, see <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/tag/v0.17.5">the release notes</a>.</p>

   <code>brew install kubeseal
</code>   

<p>Encrypt <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> and <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> (the Cosmos DB connect string). Run the following command to do this, replacing the two values with your encryption key and your connection string.</p>

   <code>kubectl create secret generic project-secrets \
  --from-literal=ENCRYPT_KEY='&lt;your-encryption-key&gt;' \
  --from-literal=SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI='&lt;your-connection-string&gt;' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>If you deleted the namespace earlier, you need to create it again (it won’t hurt to run this if you didn’t delete the namespace).</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f namespace.yml
</code>   

<p>Now, use <code>kubeseal</code> to convert the secrets to encrypted secrets.</p>

   <code>kubeseal --cert tls.crt --format=yaml -n demo &lt; secrets.yml &gt; sealed-secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>Remove the original secrets file and deploy your sealed secrets.</p>

   <code>rm secrets.yml
kubectl apply -n demo -f sealed-secrets.yml &amp;&amp; kubectl get -n demo sealedsecret project-secrets
</code>   

<p>You need to update the <code>yml</code> files to refer to the encrypted values. Add the following env variable to the <code>jhister-registry</code> container in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> (if an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> already exists, replace it).</p>

   <code>env:
  ...
  - name: ENCRYPT_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: project-secrets
        key: ENCRYPT_KEY
</code>   

<p>In <code>k8s/store-k8s/store-deployment.yml</code>, change the <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> env variable to use the sealed secret.</p>

   <code>env:
  ...
  - name: SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: project-secrets
        key: SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI
</code>   

<p>Deploy the cluster.</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>Give the cluster a bit to start. Check it with one of the tools I mentioned or the following:</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n demo
</code>   

<p>Once everything is ready, port forward the registry to check the services.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Make sure you can log in and that all the services are green. You should either be automatically logged in and redirected back to the home page or directed to log in with the Okta login screen.</p>

<p>This is the happy dance.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Forward the gateway and test the app.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Log in. Make sure everything works. Kick the tires. Start a blog. Create some products. Influence some people. Restore democracy. Take over the world. Whatever you want.</p>

<p>Once you’re done with everything, you can delete the resource group. This will also delete all the resources in the resource group, including the Cosmos database and the AKS cluster. If you have multiple subscriptions, you may need to add a <code>--subscription</code> param.</p>

   <code>az group delete --name australia-east
</code>   

<p>Wait for this to finish. Once it is done, it’s probably a good idea to log into the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure Portal</a> and make sure that the AKS cluster, the Cosmos DB instance, and the resource group have been deleted.</p>

 Azure AKS, Kubernetes, and Spring Boot microservices deployed! 

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/juliendubois">Julien Dubois</a> for help getting this tutorial finished!</p>

<p>In this project you saw how to deploy a JHipster microservice to Azure AKS. You saw how you can use a managed Cosmos DB instance in place of a MongoDB pod in Kubernetes. You saw how to deploy the app first with Docker Compose and then later with <code>kubectl</code> and the Azure CLI. Finally, you properly encrypted all of the sensitive configuration values using a combination of JHipster registry encryption, Kubernetes secrets, and <code>kubeseal</code>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the top, this project is based on two of Matt Raible’s tutorials:</p>

 
   <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> 
   <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> 
 

<p>Deepu Sasidharan wrote a tutorial, <a href="https://deepu.tech/deploying-jhipster-microservices-on-azure-kubernetes-service-aks/">Deploying JHipster Microservices on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</a>, that was also a big help.</p>

				 <p>I’ve been reminded via my Facebook feed just how heavily influenced we are by our data. Facebook is exceptionally good at showing me what it thinks I want to see. I’m not going to lie, they get it right probably 70% of the time, but I don’t think that’s always a good thing; it brings a lot of negativity to my feed due to the nature of my online activity. Lately, it’s the conspiracy theories surrounding the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-id-ontario">implementation of digital ID</a> here in my home province of Ontario. Recently, a <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/governments-must-fight-misinformation-on-digital-id-say-provincial-experts/479608">petition submitted</a> to the Ontario legislature calling for the ban of digital ID garnered 21,000 signatures. I find this so bizarre because digital ID is already here. I’m left wondering if any of those 21,000 folks use Google or Apple pay?&nbsp;</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				 
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>I decided it would be an excellent time to address some of the misinformation head-on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The claims regarding digital ID are:&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 The government will have access to our personal information without our consent and centralize every citizen’s personal, financial, business, medical and social data and assign them an identification under this system. 
  Digital ID will expose your demons, no matter how small, everywhere you go, and abuse by governmental authority in terms of surveillance and compelled behaviour, using access to basic resources as a tool of coercion.&nbsp; 
  Lead to Identity theft. 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Digital Identity Conspiracies: Myth 1&nbsp; 
<p>The government will have access to our personal information without our consent and centralize every citizen’s personal, financial, business, medical and social data and assign them an identification under this system.</p>
<p>This is not true. The government will only be able to access our information if we provide it to them directly, for example, if we use our digital ID to access government services. Every citizen’s personal, financial, business, medical and social information is already centralized. Your Driver’s License and Passport are not your property, and your unique identifier is your social insurance number. The government issues those credentials, and they remain their property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations like Google and Facebook hold your information in a centralized manner and make money off of it. We allow them to claim our data as their asset and make money off of it. When we decentralize, we take back ownership of our credentials and identity. We will be able to choose what we share and with whom, and we will have the ability to monetize our identity, just like Facebook and Google currently do.</p>
<p>Canadians in the private sector, not the government, were instrumental in the early days of SSI development. At this point, the Canadian government has no choice but to jump in and build our governance framework and align us with other countries leading to protect their citizens’ rights. For example, they are working with the European Union Framework, <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Identity Conspiracies: Myth 2 
<p>Digital ID will expose your demons, no matter how small, everywhere you go. You name it; the ID will show it. Opens up abuse of governmental authority in terms of surveillance and compelled behaviour, using access to basic resources as a tool of coercion.</p>
<p>Again, this is not true. Digital ID will only expose your demons if you share them…</p>
<p>We are being abused by organizations like Google and Facebook, <a href="https://www.toronto.com/news/how-do-tech-giants-like-google-and-facebook-get-and-use-your-personal-data/article_73b7cfe5-4360-5123-8769-471460c9dc85.html">monetizing our identities</a>. Instagram, TikTok etc. it’s all there for everyone to see. When you pay with your phone’s wallet app, data is stored and collected on your spending habits. Police officers can look up your info with your driver’s license, and Google tracks your internet and location history, regardless of your settings. The list goes on and on. With a self-sovereign identity, you can control your data and what information you share with appropriate entities. SSI allows for seamless authentication and reduces the need for repeated submission of individual verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>The government will only be able to track our movements and activities if we provide them with this information ourselves, for example, by using our digital ID to access transportation services. Your verifiable credentials will not “talk” to each other. Only someone with the appropriate verifiable credential of their own can access your data (credentials) unless you choose to share your credentials with someone else.</p>
<p>So yes, your digital ID (wallet) can undoubtedly hold all of these credentials, but that’s all they are: individual verifiable credentials. They don’t “talk” to each other per se, and only someone with the authority credential, like a police officer, can see your driving infractions or criminal record.</p>
<p>If you are behind on child support, the Family Responsibility Office can get Canada Revenue Agency to garnish your tax account or the Ministry of Transportation to suspend your driver’s license. You’re already “punished” for lousy behaviour that likely won’t change. What will stay the same is only the person with the proper credentials can access your data. So while your “bad” behaviours will ultimately merge with your digital identity, a prospective employer or bank employee would not have the proper credentials to access those specific credentials within your digital wallet. SSI is our best defence against the possibility of a surveillance state as the credentials are shared without the Issuer knowing – and they can’t know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Identity Conspiracies: Myth 3 
<p>Digital ID will lead to identity theft.</p>
<p>Once again, this is a baseless claim that has no basis in reality. Digital ID will make identity theft far more complex as it provides a more secure and confidential identification method. The very nature of <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/156591609?dnt=1&amp;html5=1&amp;title=1&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;autoplay=0">Blockchain technology</a> makes them immune to cyber-crimes since all the copies stored across the network would need to be attacked simultaneously for the attack to be successful. This system will be much more secure than traditional authentication methods, such as username and password. Your personal information will be encrypted and only accessible to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Taking Back Your Rights 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are so many ways that adopting a self-sovereign identity can reduce costs, cut out waste and provide better security and control. Here are a few simple ways it could help you out:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 If you’re a small business, you can use the verifiable credentials to get validated and listed on directories like Google Maps or Yelp. People find your business more quickly, and it can also help you rank higher in search results. 
 If you’re looking for a job, you can use the verifiable credential to prove your identity and qualifications to potential employers. You make the hiring process easier and faster since the employer can verify your information without contacting third parties. 
 If you want to apply for a loan, you can share your credit history with the lender. They will be able to verify that the information is correct without having access to anything more personal information than they require. 
 If you’re a student, you can use verifiable credentials to prove that you’ve completed your education or training, helping you make it easier to get into college or find a job in your field. 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Self-sovereign identity is vital because it gives individuals control over their data; it is essential in an era where data breaches are becoming more common. Adopting a self-sovereign identity will allow users to take ownership and ensure that their data is safe and secure.</p>
<p>The only ones who will benefit from your digital ID are the Issuer (who gave you the credential), holder (you) and verifier (who you’re sharing it with). As the holder, you’ll have an opportunity to control, and perhaps even monetize your data with the verifier, say Facebook. You can choose to share as much or as little information as you want with the verifier, and you can also revoke access to your credentials at any time.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say what the future of SSI holds, but it’s important to remember that digital ID is all about taking back your rights, not surrendering them. It is about authentication, authorization and privacy. The trust economy of SSI is based on these foundations. As more and more people understand the value of SSI, its use will continue to grow. It’s imperative that people from diverse backgrounds and women, in particular, get involved.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a project that can help ensure the future of digital ID, consider supporting the development of SSI. You can help by joining groups like Women in Identity, spreading the word about this critical technology and advocating for its adoption.

<p>At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum</p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary. We recently posted a Sign-In with Ethereum-specific April recap that can be found here:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-digest-april/">  Sign-In with Ethereum Digest - April  Sign-In with Ethereum offers a new self-custodial option for users who wish to assume more control and responsibility over their own digital identity.  SpruceSpruce    </a> Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits.

				  Maturity and universality are now the goals  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:ken@indicio.tech">Ken Ebert</a></p>
<p>Since the launch of Indicio two years ago, we have focused on identifying and filling in the gaps in decentralized identity technology that limited its functionality. Launching an open-source <a href="https://indicio.tech/hyperledger-aries-sees-new-coordinated-effort-to-produce-complete-mobile-agent/">mobile agent</a> and developing <a href="https://indicio.tech/trust-registry-or-machine-readable-governance/">machine-readable governance</a> were critical to delivering real-world solutions. As we saw how these solutions worked to solve problems, we came to understand how these components worked in concert to deliver what we now call a Trusted Digital Ecosystem. A Trusted Digital Ecosystem is our shorthand for the simultaneous impact of decentralized identity technology on authentication, communication, governance, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>A Trusted Digital Ecosystem can be simple—indeed, as we advise our customers, it’s always better to start by solving the simplest use case first, see how the technology works, and then expand. Therefore, having a core set of interoperable components is essential. They can be arranged to manage increasingly complex interactions in any kind of informational ecosystem, and to facilitate interaction across ecosystems.</p>
<p>Technology stack: From basic to universal<br>Our <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/accesswire/technology-business-4dbf651613d76693bc479321f7b041f5">new</a><a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/accesswire/technology-business-4dbf651613d76693bc479321f7b041f5"> funding</a> will be used to refine the open-source, decentralized-identity technology stack. We have the basic technology for a functional ecosystem, now we improve that functionality by adding all the features, user interfaces, and management tools that make it easier to deploy, use, and monitor. We will add new <a href="https://indicio.tech/careers/">engineering team</a> members to help design, implement, and test this new software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These engineering efforts will synergize with Indicio’s future technology roadmap which will focus on expanding the adoption of Trusted Digital Ecosystems in the marketplace. Our goal is for Trusted Digital Ecosystems to serve as complete solutions in many vertical markets and to be as easy to deploy as they are easy to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing our open-source community support<br>The new funding will also enable us to continue and extend our work with the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-british-columbia-code-with-us-challenge-to-upgrade-hyperledger-indy/">open-source community</a> by providing leadership to working groups, code maintenance and review, and our own direct code contributions. We see open source as the key to both expanding decentralized identity and to continued innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, and following on our successful training workshops for the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-leads-hyperledger-foundation-community-training/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>, we believe that ongoing education is critical. We have created the most comprehensive, hands-on training available in decentralized identity, whether in the basics or in the more technical aspects of the stack, and we will continue to refine these offerings—as well as develop new courses focused on how to implement complete solutions.</p>
<p>Indicio has also pioneered <a href="https://indicio.tech/cardeas-second-interop-a-thon/">“interop-a-thon”</a> events, where companies and organizations come together to test their products and solutions for interoperability. With two interop-a-thons under our belt (hosted through the <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea Project </a>at Linux Foundation Public Health), we are more certain than ever of their importance to finding glitches, spurring adoption of standardized protocols, and fostering confidence in the technology.</p>
<p>Interop-a-thons also provide a chance to see the future potential of verifiable credential systems that are <a href="https://indicio.tech/when-it-comes-to-decentralized-identity-sell-solutions-not-rules/">interoperable</a>, where, for example, a credential issued by a government can be used in a wide variety of contexts and thereby gain in value to issuers, users, and verifiers alike. It’s one thing to claim this as a possibility; it’s another to see it happen.</p>
<p>We will devote more resources in the coming year to interop-a-thons because they are one of the clearest ways of visualizing the value of decentralized identity as a network of networks—and the clearest way to accelerate this happening.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>The Log4j vulnerability, was first detected in December 2021. Log4j is an open-source Java library that is widely used by developers to monitor apps and captures logs. Cybersecurity experts classified it as a <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html">critical severity</a> due to its vulnerability to remote code execution (RCE) attacks, local code execution (LCE) attacks, and information leakage. Millions of attack attempts exploiting this vulnerability were <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/12/13/the-numbers-behind-a-cyber-pandemic-detailed-dive/">reported</a>. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/">Microsoft</a> identified a group of attackers from China that used this weakness as a back door to inflict organizations with Nightsky ransomware. Due to being open-source and easy to use, Log4j is used in a wide range of software, and some organizations were initially unaware of its presence within their software infrastructure. This vulnerability usually comes in via third party software. Organizations commonly don’t monitor the libraries and external components (such as Log4j) used by third party software and thus were uncertain about the extent of cyber risk exposure for their organizations.<br><br>Patch releases<br>In the past 4 months, Apache has released a series of patches to counter this issue. Upgrading to the latest patch 2.17 is the straightforward measure to protect against this software vulnerability. Users without the latest patches are still exposed to getting attacked by cyber criminals. However, even after patching, an organization could have already been compromised by this attack. The good news is that, with Log4j being a logging library, there is a good chance of the attacker having left traces behind in the log. There are other measures that could be taken, such as restricting outgoing internet traffic, but this is rarely a viable and surely not a long-term solution.<br><br>Additional measures<br>Aside of installing patches, an important step is to monitor the activities of your software. Log4j is used only to log activity and events. There should be no further activities such as the Log4j process trying to access other systems. Monitoring changes in behavior of the software using the Log4j library is an option for identifying malicious behavior. For instance, Amazon Web Services (AWS) released patches to track and patch the vulnerable applications. These patches were found vulnerable to be manipulated by existing malicious containers on the system to elevate their privileges and take over the host or execute code remotely. This further emphasizes the need for monitoring after installing patches.<br><br>Additionally, Log4j scanners can be implemented to identify systems that are still vulnerable by the Log4j threat. However, it must not be the only solution, as some of these scanners have <a href="https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-news/log4j-vulnerability-scanners-and-detection-tools-list-for-mssps-and-threat-hunters/">reported</a> false positive results.<br><br>Conclusion<br>If there are systems which are unpatched, this threat will continue to exist. The solution is to patch and stay alert, but to also have a solid cyber security and cyber resilience plan in place which can identify and stop attacks ideally even before these occur.<br><br>European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference 2022<br>For a deeper dive into cybersecurity topics and to help your organizations to develop more resilient cybersecurity and identity management architectures, KuppingerCole offers content in a variety of formats, including live events such as the 2022 KuppingerCole <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference</a> taking place in Berlin and online in May.<br> The agenda for the conference includes keynote presentations on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5036">dynamic authorization on zero trust architecture, promoting cyber resilience through identity and zero trust</a> and many panel discussions and presentations from experts on latest cyber security, identity management and digital transformation topics.<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/blog/prepare-prevent-and-protect">Related research Blog Post: Prepare, Prevent and Protect</a><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80801/responding-to-critical-software-vulnerabilities">Leadership Brief: Responding to Critical Software Vulnerabilities </a><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80802/prepare-and-protect-against-software-vulnerabilities">Leadership Brief: Prepare and Protect against Software Vulnerabilities </a></p>

			  Radka Tocikova is Human Resource Manager at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Radka, I’m from Slovakia where I studied International Relations at the Economic University of Bratislava. After my Erasmus studies in Paris, I lived abroad in Belgium, Luxembourg, and Monaco where I am now. At Tokeny I do what I love and I’m aware it’s a big chance. Taking care of people, challenging&nbsp;them, finding ways to push some of them out of their comfort zone, listening to them, trying to improve the collaboration &amp; the use of the collective intelligence (to name a few of my responsibilities). Interviewing new candidates and assessing who would be the best fit is another very challenging part of the job and a huge responsibility. A CV and a 30 min chat is never enough to really appreciate someone’s potential. I met some amazing talents and I would like to thank everyone who applied.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I knew the project from its very beginning, I was a close follower and a fan. However, I must admit that when I spoke with Luc, our CEO, about help with administration, partnership agreements and recruitments, I thought it was for a few months. It’s been almost 4 years now, I fell in love with the team, I have great colleagues, my work matters, our project is so innovative and disruptive, and we still have so much to achieve and build together. I am delighted with all these challenges ahead of us.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>We learn, we try, we fail, we argue, we discuss, we laugh, we adapt, we do, we celebrate, and then repeat. I really enjoy working in such an international environment. The remote and the hybrid are here to stay, something we’ve embraced since the very beginning. Being flexible and being able to adapt to the needs of our team members is also a plus. What’s really common about Tokeny is that everyone is friendly and open-minded. And you can say what you have to say. We’ve weathered the storms, the sea isn’t always flat, but everyone on board knows we’re heading in the right direction and I hope we continue to have fun on our way!</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I am passionate about life itself, its purpose, its meaning, even its futility. I love Contemporary Art because it not only reflects but also questions life. I’m an epicurean, with a slight preference for fusion cuisine with umami in it. I’ve traveled a lot, which has helped me understand myself better. And books..I like to read books. Music, cultural events, exhibitions, theater, innovation technologies, blockchain potential, AI, neuroscience, personal development are all topics that trigger my interest. My passion peaks especially when I have a mix of the above, like immersive art or a VR team building escape room.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Hakuna Matata! And never stop dreaming…</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>War, global warming, poverty, abuse, discrimination, disease. There are too many injustices in this world I would like to change, not easy to pick one of them. If I could, I would erase the suffering of children.</p>
<p>For me, changing the world means changing myself at first. Therefore, that is my main objective, and at the same time that is what I can do. Being the best possible version of myself and having a positive impact around me. (Ok, ok, work in progress ;-))</p>

				 <p>Christine and Darrell would like to thank everyone who participated in the Exploring Digital ID webinar on April 27th, 2022. This was an excellent opportunity to learn more about how Self-sovereign identity (digital id) will affect our lives. Here is a breakdown of what happened and some key takeaways for attendees and those who couldn’t make it.</p>

<p>Christine started the webinar by talking about a real-world travel scenario where we can easily envision moving from a physical to a digital wallet with a digital id. In her scenario, Christine walked us through each step of the trip. From booking and boarding to networking, she explains how a widely adopted digital id system can make the travel process more secure, saving time and hassle, making the entire experience more seamless. Darrell finished it off by sharing his hopes to one day see a wallet agent that will be able to assemble and organize records/receipts for you based on your activity.</p>

<p>For our second part of the webinar [8:45], we wanted to debunk some of the myths about digital id. There has been a lot of misinformation, and we wanted to clear up a few things that we thought were important. We talked about centralization vs. decentralization, SSI exposing your demons, surveillance, and compelled behaviour.</p>

In the meantime, new testnet features are on the horizon that will enable more powerful decentralized usecases.</p>  Simplified and improved ID privacy by adding “source of funds” address to registration, enabling a specific ID or z-address to be used for the funds to prepare and register an identity.  Advanced sub-ID registration for decentralized identities with new business models, semi-centralized identities for voting and other purposes, and centralized identities that can be issued and sold via centralized currencies.  Decentralized fractional currencies can issue identities, depending on their parameters, and the person getting such an ID pays the blockchain identity import fee in native currency as well as the specified fee in the currency issuing the ID. The issuing currency fee is burned, benefitting all holders of the issuing currency by reducing supply by the fee amount and leaving the same reserves, raising conversion rates. Centralized currencies, whether fractional, token, or even native, issue identities and the fees are paid to the controlling ID of the currency, not&nbsp;burned.  New “requires permission” and “referral required” issuance is supported. If this is specified as an option in an ID issuing currency definition, which may still be a decentralized issuer, the identity registration transaction must be counter-signed by either the ID of the issuing currency (“requires permission”) or a valid referrer (“referral required”) which either is the issuing currency ID or an unrevoked ID with the same parent as the new identity. The identity registration command and API will enforce this and create transactions that must be signed in this&nbsp;manner.  Separate pricing, referral namespaces, and referral levels for all identity namespaces are supported (ie. only *.fanclub@ can refer for name.fanclub@).  Pricing of sub-IDs for a fractional currency can be either in the currency itself or denominated in any of its reserves (eg. USD, VRSC, EUR, etc.) to enable compatibility with ID-based rights licensing or royalty streams priced in any currency.

<p>The advancement of technology in the digital space has had a significant impact on the way people interact with businesses. Several aspects of people’s everyday lives are now conducted digitally, from shopping to managing finances.</p><p>Therefore, it’s no surprise that digital identity has become a critical topic of discussion.</p><p>Identity management has been a major concern since the internet was invented. Billions of dollars have been spent on providing a private and secure space for digital transactions. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/417602/global-market-forecast-identity-and-access-management/">Statista</a>, the global identity and access management market had risen to nearly $13.92 billion by 2021. </p><p>However, even with this level of investment, managing digital identities has been complicated, challenging, and expensive. </p><p>But what is digital identity, and how can organizations leverage it to scale their business? And where does blockchain come into the picture?</p><p>In this blog, our team of decentralized identity experts will answer all these questions (and some more). So let’s get started!</p> What Is Digital Identity? <p>The concept of digital identity might sound complicated, but it’s pretty easy to understand. </p><p>In a broad aspect, your digital identity is a combination of any personal information online that can be traced back to you — from the pictures on your social media to your online bank account.</p><p>By definition, a digital identity is an identity that is claimed or adopted by individuals, organizations, or electric devices in the digital space. </p><p>Digital identity can be regarded as an extension of physical identity documents like passports and driver’s license. </p><p>Digital identity is a powerful solution to overcome several obstacles related to remote onboarding. </p><p>Creating an account to access a service, entering personal information, and waiting for someone to manually authenticate our identity is taxing, especially if it’s to be done on a global level.</p><p>Deploying digital identity solutions effectively eradicated a lot of these time-consuming processes for individuals and businesses.</p><p>Let’s understand the importance of digital identity in a bit more detail.</p> Why Is Digital Identity Important?  Global Operation <p>MSMEs can tap into a global client base, and businesses in rural regions can take up distant business opportunities. </p><p>In the past, businesses simply hired employees who stayed within 10 miles of their office. The recruitment process of MSMEs heavily relied on reference checks and interviews. Companies built the association with clients and vendors via personal relationships. </p><p>Digital transformation has flipped this system on its head. </p><p>MSMEs now have access to a global pool of talent, and they can build professional relationships with clients and vendors based in international regions. </p><p>Digital identity verification is vital for businesses to function in this era of technology.</p><p>Operating globally meant companies had to have elaborate systems in place to ensure that no fraudulent activities were conducted.</p><p>Digital identity has made this system simpler and increased the security associated with onboarding international partners, employees, and even customers. </p><p>Companies can swiftly expand into new markets, improve the strength of their internal operations by hiring employees solely based on their skill, reducing the production cost, and gaining new customers.</p> Enhance User Experience <p>Digital identity and management is critical for growing and scaling micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). <br><br>Here’s the thing. </p><p>Identity management was primarily focused on internal business users like employees, partners, vendors, contractors, and others associated with the supply chain. </p><p>It was about ensuring that the right people had the right level of access to the information needed to get their job done. </p><p>That’s not the case anymore.</p><p>The power of leveraging digital identity is crucial for success in the digital era. </p><p>The primary purpose is to boost engagement rate, offer easy and secure sign-up and log-in services, provide personalized content, increase revenue, and enhance user experience. </p><p>Digital identity provides MSMEs with the ability to develop accurate customer personas and make better-informed decisions.</p><p>On the flip side, a strong digital identity system also allows customers to receive improved and more personalized services from their service providers.</p> Financial Inclusion <p>Digital identity empowers MSMEs to gain easier access to credit and effectively undertake digital transactions. </p><p>A <a href="https://www.smefinanceforum.org/post/msme-finance-gap-report">study conducted by International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the SME Finance Forum</a> has estimated that nearly 65 million firms, or 40% of formal MSMEs, in developing economies don’t have access to full credit. These MSMEs have an unmet financial need of about $5.6 trillion each year. </p><p>A robust digital identity management system can enhance financial inclusion and allow MSMEs to access cheaper credit to function more efficiently.</p><p>Third, MSMEs can tap into the global client base and businesses in rural regions can take up distant business opportunities. </p><p>Now that we have an understanding of digital identity and why it is important, let’s take a look at how digital identities can be verified to ensure they’re legit.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p>Verifiable credentials may sound like an overwhelming technical concept at first glance. However, it’s easier to understand than you think. </p><p>Let’s break it down.</p><p>The word credential typically refers to documents, certificates, cards, etc., that contain data about something. Driver’s licenses, insurance cards, passports, medical test results, college degrees, and employee badges are some examples of credentials we use every day. </p><p>One thing they have in common is that these credentials have a physical form.</p><p>There are several problems associated with paper-based credentials.</p>  They can easily be lost or damaged.  Sharing them is a slow, complicated, and inefficient process.  They can be easily faked.  There is no concept of automation.  They’re not easy to update.  They’re not future-proof.  <p>On the other hand, when you attach the term verifiable, it refers to credentials that can be authenticated in a digital setting. </p><p>Here’s the thing. </p><p>Businesses all over the world are ready to go global and shift their focus towards digital operations and services. </p><p>However, this shift comes with a fundamental need for individuals or organizations — like customers, vendors, employers, citizens, partners, and more — to be identified to interact digitally. &nbsp;</p><p>Several attempts have been made to deliver digital identity solutions — creating centralized accounts, federated systems, CIAM solutions, etc. </p><p>However, these solutions make verification a very slow and tedious process. </p><p>Verification helps establish trust that the individual claiming the digital identity or credential is the same person.</p><p>It prevents people from carrying out transactions on someone’s behalf without their permission, creating false identities, buying fake diplomas/degrees, or committing fraudulent activities. </p><p>The digital solutions mentioned above are siloed. </p><p>In most cases a verifier needs to contact the issuer to request a verification and make sure the credential is authentic. This involves manual processes. </p><p>It involves calling previous employers, calling academic institutions, accrediting bodies, etc.</p><p>This is where verifiable credentials come into the picture. </p><p>To define the term, Verifiable Credential is a solution that allows people to issue digital credentials and sign them cryptographically. This digital signature can be verified with blockchain. </p><p>Using a digital ledger like blockchain makes the credential instantly verifiable.</p><p>No matter where the person stores it, no matter if the issuer keeps a copy of it, these credentials will be verifiable. A verifier will be able to know that the credential is authentic in seconds without the need to contact the issuer.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials are not limited to representing physical documents; they also reflect aspects that don’t have a physical equivalent, like NFT ownership. </p><p>There are three primary roles associated with verifiable credentials.</p>  Issuer. The issuer refers to an individual or an organization that creates or issues the verifiable credential.  Holder. The holder is the individual or organization to whom the credential is issued to. The verifiable credential can be stored on a digital wallet - a mobile app on the holder's phone - or anywhere the holder wants to. A cloud drive, their computer, etc.  Verifier. The verifier is the entity that verifies the claim about the specific subject. The information is shared with them and they check the authenticity of the data they’ve received.  <p>Let’s understand these roles with a simple example.</p><p>Let’s say there is a hospital looking to verify the authenticity of a doctor’s degree. </p><p>Here, the institution that certifies that the doctor has completed his medical degree is the Issuer, the doctor is the Holder, and the hospital that checks the authenticity is the Verifier. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials make it easy to share information online in a secure and instantly verifiable way.</p><p>Here is how it works.</p><p>When the issuer creates a document, they digitally sign it and share it with the holder. The holder prepares a verifiable presentation and sends it to the verifier to be authenticated. </p><p>Note: A verifiable presentation is a collection of credentials or attributes that the holder wants to share with the verifier. </p><p>For example — if an employer requests information like university degree, date of birth, and drug test results, there are different entities who have issued these credentials. The owner can collect all these in his digital wallet and put them together to create a verifiable presentation and share it with the verifier (employer).</p><p>Now, back to the topic at hand.</p><p>After the holder shares the verifiable presentation, the verifier checks the cryptographic signature and the blockchain and assesses the credential against three factors.</p>  Competent authority: &nbsp;Do I trust the organization who issued this credential?  Validity: Is the credential valid?  Tamper-proofing: Was the credential tampered with?   <p>If these conditions are met, the credentials are declared verified.</p><p>For businesses, Verifiable Credentials have the potential to drastically improve and boost the customer and employee onboarding process, thereby reducing the cost and turnaround time associated with it.</p> Decentralized Identity <p>Verifiable Credentials and blockchain are two of the most important elements of decentralized identity technology.<br><br>Before we understand decentralized identities, we need to talk about centralized identity and access management systems (IAMs) and the issues that arise with centralized identities. </p><p>In a centralized identity management system, users' data/credentials are stored in centralized and siloed databases. A lot of users' data. A hacker can get to millions of people's credentials at the same time.</p><p>Platforms like Facebook come under centralized and federated identity systems. A federated system allows other networks to use their ID system (eg: Facebook login).</p><p>In centralized IAMs, a single entity (like Facebook) owns and controls the users’ digital identities and personal data.</p><p>How many times have we heard of Facebook data breaches where the privacy of millions of users was compromised? </p><p>Now you understand the risk associated with centralized, federated, and digital identity management systems. </p><p>But what is decentralized identity management and how does it help mitigate the issues raised by centralized digital management systems?</p><p>Decentralized identity systems allow users to gain control, store and manage their own identities and data. </p><p>This form of identity management lets users store and manage their own data. Users decide how and when they share their data and with whom. Instead of siloed in one place, data is decentralized to each user. </p><p>A well-implemented and verifiable decentralized identity eliminates a lot of threats that come with physical and digital documents. They offer entities more privacy and control over the data that is used and shared.</p><p>Let’s understand how decentralized identity allows users to store their data, how verifiable credentials are always available for authentication, and the role blockchain plays in it.</p> What Can Blockchain Do for Digital Identity? <p>In simple terms, a blockchain is a digital and immutable database of information. Everyone can see what is written on a public blockchain</p><p>It can act as a backbone for a decentralized identity system.</p><p>But how does it work?</p><p>Every issuer has a Public Decentralized Identifier (DID) stored on a blockchain. This Public DID is a globally unique identifier — example: did:dock:da8dasd...12 — containing a cryptographic key. </p><p>When the issuer creates a Verifiable Credential, they use their DID to put a cryptographic signature on the credential. This signature makes the credential become tamper-proof.</p><p>Whenever a verifier needs to check the authenticity of a credential, they just need to check the blockchain to confirm what was the Public DID that signed that credential and if they trust that organization.</p><p>The blockchain is like a phone book where everyone can check the Public DID of the issuer for different credentials. </p><p>Before this tech came along, the verifier had to get in touch with the issuer to verify the authenticity of a document. </p><p>Now, once an issuer signs a credential, they are always available for authentication without the verifier pinging the issuer each time. They can simply check the blockchain to see who has signed the credential. The decentralized and immutable nature of the blockchain ensures that Verifiable Credentials are always available for authentication.</p><p>Even if the issuer is offline or doesn’t exist anymore, the system isn’t affected.</p> How Blockchain Impacts Digital Identity Management <p>There are generally five pillars of Blockchain-based digital identity management solutions.</p> Trust. <p>The blockchain and cryptography enable trust between parties that are not connected between them and have never met.</p><p>The blockchain is immutable, so each party knows that the Public DID stored on the blockchain can never be deleted.</p><p>Each Verifiable Credential has a cryptographic signature that guarantees that the credential wasn't tampered with.</p><p>When a verifier needs to confirm that a credential is valid, they don't need to contact the issuing party. They just need to check the blockchain to see what was the DID that signed the credential and who that DID belongs to.</p> Security. <p>Another notable benefit of using blockchain for digital identity management is security. Since users can now store and manage their data, their sensitive personal information is not stored in "honey pots" with millions of other users' credentials. Making it harder for hackers to acquire large quantities of credentials at once.</p><p>This decentralized mechanism where multiple users store their own credentials effectively reduces the risk of data breaches.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials also use cryptographic digital signatures to ensure they are tamper-proof.</p> Simplicity. <p>Using a blockchain framework for digital identity management simplifies the process for everyone involved.</p>  Digital identity issuers. The issuer simply has to sign the Verifiable Credential and send it to the user. They don’t need to store them or be involved in the verification process when the user shares the credential.  Digital identity verifiers. Blockchain identity management makes it simple and cost-effective to onboard and verify customer and user data.  Digital identity holders. Blockchain offers users an alternative to centralized data management and gives them complete control of their digital identity. This concept of identity is called Self-Sovereign Identity.   Integrity. <p>One key benefit of using blockchain-based identity systems is the ability to maintain the integrity of the issuer’s identity across different nodes within a network. </p><p>Since the issuer’s public DID is on the blockchain, it enables the user’s credentials to always be verifiable without the need to contact the issuer. </p><p>Furthermore, unlike a centralized system, blockchain technology lacks a single point of failure. </p><p>Therefore, it makes it extremely difficult for hackers to disrupt the integrity of a particular data set.</p> Privacy. <p>The final pillar of Blockchain-based digital identity management solutions is privacy. Regulators all over the world are demanding privacy for people’s sensitive and personal information. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials use Selective Disclosure and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The first method allows a user to only share a specific part of a credential without disclosing the entire credential. </p><p>The second method enables users to prove something about themselves without even revealing the data that supports that proof. For example, a user can prove that they live in a specific city without showing their address.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials ensure privacy by design.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity empowers businesses to swiftly and efficiently onboard global customers and employees with secure data exchange and digital transactions.</p><p>It breaks down the barriers associated with sharing information across company boundaries. It builds customer trust and aids businesses with adhering to data protection regulations and avoiding financial losses.</p><p>You can leverage Dock Certs today to create, issue, and share verifiable credentials and decentralized identities for your business without writing a single line of code!</p><p><a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Sign up to Dock Certs today</a>.</p>

 ONT ID Framework Upgraded: Ontology’s Verifiable Credentials SDKs Now Open Source for All Go and Java Developers  In making the code widely accessible, Ontology is accelerating the adoption of decentralized identity (DID) in the blockchain sphere <p>As the project that has focused on the Decentralized Identity (DID) field for over 4 years, Ontology’s goal is to build the infrastructure to provide trusted access to Web3, allowing individuals and enterprises to rest assured that through robust digital identity solutions, users and their privacy come first, industry wide. To achieve this mission, the full set of ONT ID frameworks have been comprehensively upgraded.</p><p>The integration of digital identity solutions is core to the creation of a Web3 that is secure and trusted. That’s why today, we are announcing that our bespoke <a href="https://github.com/ont-id">Verifiable Credentials Software Development Kits</a> (VC SDKs) are now open source and accessible to all Go and Java developers on GitHub. This includes the VC-SDKs as well as the VC-With-ONTID-SDKs, of which you can find more information below.</p><p>We are proud to invite developers to join the Ontology community and create new use cases for digital identity solutions. This news comes alongside the extension of our Dorahacks hackathon to the end of May, which aims to promote privacy and digital identity, offering a prize pool of up to $100K&nbsp;USD.</p> Applicable in both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems <p>Most importantly, developers do not have to be building on Ontology; the SDKs are available for use in all circumstances, and we encourage the developer community to glean the benefits of doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>VC-SDKs should be applied in any blockchain ecosystem, making it easy for dApp developers to implement verifiable-credential-related Web3 applications or embed verifiable credential functionalities into existing Web2 applications. Via GitHub, developers can edit content and code inline, make pull requests, file issues and send content suggestions to the documentation and SDK teams in question.</p> Understanding VC-Go and VC-Java&nbsp;SDKs <p>The SDKs are for verifiable credentials written in the Golang and Java languages. It conforms to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C recommendation for Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>, a specification endorsed by W3C and its&nbsp;members.</p><p>This SDK is identifier-agnostic. It supports a variety of identifiers, such as the decentralized identifier (DID) methods defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">W3C DID Specification Registries</a>, as well as identifiers from the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) or other domain naming systems. In terms of proof methods, this SDK supports common cryptographic signature algorithms and will support zero-knowledge proofs in the future. It will also support range proofs and existence proofs that will allow for selective disclosure in a sequence.</p><p>This SDK does not deal with the revocation of verifiable credentials. Because the information in a VC needs to be adjustable for security reasons, the statuses of a verifiable credential include, as a minimum, “normal” and “revoked”. This presents a use case opportunity for application developers.</p><p>VCs can be used in many business scenarios. When applying for a job, job-seekers can provide a verifiable presentation, which has necessary information and the signature generated by the job-seekers, derived from their VCs issued by a university, for example. The employer can cryptographically verify that the individual’s presentation is not fraudulent by checking both the verifiable presentation itself (such as checking the signature and the period of validity), as well as the university’s revocation services.</p> Understanding VC-With-ONTID-SDKs for Go and&nbsp;Java <p>Using the VC-With-ONTID-SDKS over VC-SDKs has the added advantage of allowing anyone that does not have access to their own DID protocols to apply the SDK and access the ONT ID protocols, opening up a realm of new possibilities.</p><p>This is an SDK for using ONT ID in a VC system. ONT ID is decentralized, self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, and easy to use, enabling users to fully control their own data and identities.</p><p>These SDKs should be used with the VC-SDKs which implement the main functionalities of a verifiable credential system. Besides using ONT ID to identify the various parties in a VC system, this SDK also supports rerecording the VC status in the Ontology blockchain.</p><p>With the help of these SDKs, issuers can change the verifiable credentials from “normal” to “revoked” if the issued credentials need to be revoked. It is worth noting that trying the opposite direction will not work due to security concerns. Holders can also revoke their credentials on their&nbsp;own.</p><p>For example, ABC is a vocational training institution that issues VCs, which can be used as vocational training certificates, to trainees. ABC records the status of these VCs on the Ontology blockchain using this SDK. Let’s say a trainee at ABC obtains a VC from ABC and its status is “normal”. However, following this, the trainee suspects their private key has been compromised. At this point, the individual can then update the status of their VC and label it as “revoked”. As a result, verifiers that received verifiable presentations derived from the compromised VCs will be notified that the verifiable presentations are&nbsp;invalid.</p><p>Developers can download the SDKs directly <a href="https://github.com/ont-id">here</a>. We are proud to be sharing our code with developers all over the world and we look forward to seeing greater integration of digital identity globally across all business cases, be it with end users or within enterprise use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

			 Are regulated stablecoins the future of payments? 
<p>Global regulators have been busy over the past few months announcing new or draft regulations around digital assets. Stablecoins seem to be one of the priorities for lawmakers. Since October 2021, stablecoins have grown approximately 500%, according to the Biden Administration.</p>
<p>US’s Senate Banking Committee member Sen. Patrick Toomey said: “Stablecoins have the potential, among other things, to speed up payments and automate transactions.”, however, it comes with risks and uncertainty (e.g., unclear pegged assets, money laundering, terrorist financing or circumvention of sanctions). Unsurprisingly, stablecoins have become the prime target of regulators, as you can see below:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/europe-draft-crypto-regulation-mica-limits-use-of-stablecoins-like-dai/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">EU</a>: 25 March 2022, the MiCA Bill moved forward, in the current draft of the Bill, stablecoins can be classified as e-money tokens (single fiat backed) or asset-referenced tokens (multiple asset pegged). E-money tokens could be issued by banks or EMIs, while asset-referenced tokens could be issued by banks or authorized entities under MiCA, as summarized&nbsp;<a href="https://www.allenovery.com/global/-/media/allenovery/2_documents/news_and_insights/publications/2021/01/mica_webinar_slides.pdf?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">by Allen &amp; Overy</a>, however it is still subject to changes. 
 
 
 <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-government-moves-forward-with-regulatory-framework-on-stablecoins-for-payments?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">UK</a>: 4 April 2022, the Government confirms plans to bring stablecoins used as a means of payment, the regulator FCA will set out the detailed requirement in rulebooks. 
 <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/06/top-us-lawmaker-proposes-sweeping-stablecoin-regulation-framework/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">US</a>: 6 April 2022, the US lawmaker proposed The Stablecoin TRUST Act to give stablecoin issuers the choice between obtaining (1) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) license, (2) a state money transmitter or similar license or (3) a traditional bank charter. 
 
<p>One way or another, a stablecoin issuer will likely have to apply for a license under the new legislative proposals, or become a bank. Banks and pioneers are already moving as we speak. Last month, Australian bank&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/24/fireblocks-and-anz-create-aud-stablecoin/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">ANZ</a>&nbsp;teamed up with Fireblocks to issue Australian dollar-backed stablecoins, 30 million has been minted by March.</p>
<p>Last week,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/video/recent-videos/stripe-to-add-usdc-stablecoin-payments-via-polygon/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">Stripe</a>&nbsp;has chosen to use our partner Polygon’s networks to offer stablecoin USDC as payments, and Twitter will use its service to pay content creators in USDC, making payments faster and cheaper while allowing unbanked users to monetize their content.</p>
<p>As a technology infrastructure provider, our token management solutions are already used by several stablecoin projects in the EU, the UK and in the USA. For example, as early as 2020, we announced an interbank settlement coin&nbsp;<a href="https://csqny04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VVRwzp6M9J_7W5-K53t3pqHcYW8yJSQm4Jk6WnN1vWRsS3q90JV1-WJV7CgD5XW3GW0XM3MbkZWW7jvtl66G5LnQW4q61-66fZqWLW9klSGF64G5R6W8Fdkh277xL9lW239NH11xnZfkW2FB9QJ7PsxksW6XyKrT3fg7s8W2KNvqx57_-L-TMQ0x6zKdmXW5NP7gZ2Dwm78W5_8YYW10QXSHW60H2T94-JFPtW98fwKW7yJ2X3N12BmYr4N3hFW4R2MTw4YKjWVW3nyNwv2wsdc3V4BNvC4yZDRSW2TYj_L93HvDdN4-gqzkPV8BZVLCwVP4Yb76FW3_9BSR1wZ3sJW53TSJv8TdtnnW2tbbRx7fG5wxW1-lWg36SqLkNW4Ms9T92sGzgkW6QQMqW7wtdXwW8lKyy65T_8cs3qk91?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">project with a consortium of French banks</a>&nbsp;(BNP Paribas, CACIB and Caisse des Dépôts).</p>
<p>We are prepared to provide technology with a 4-year track record to enable entities to issue compliant stablecoins via the ERC-3643 standard, filling the gap between regulation and blockchain by ensuring that issuers have full control over stablecoins as required by regulators.</p>
<p>The era of regulated stablecoins is coming, we are excited to see it evolving quickly, and we will share some exciting news soon, stay tuned!</p>

<p>Mydex CIC has just <a href="https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/helping-data-trusts-manage-personal-data">published a blog</a> for Cambridge University’s Data Trust Initiative on ‘Helping Data Trusts Manage Personal&nbsp;Data’.</p><p>In it, we address the challenges that arise as the Data Trust movement begins to scale. In a world where many different Data Trusts want to access individuals’ data for a range of different purposes and services, two questions arise:</p>  How can many different Data Trusts collect/access the data they need from the same individuals without creating far-reaching duplication of cost and&nbsp;effort?  How can individuals keep track of, and assert control over, the data they are sharing with many different Data&nbsp;Trusts?  <p>One answer, we suggest, is to use individuals’ personal data stores as infrastructure for Data Trusts.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>As the world becomes more digital, and the right to privacy becomes enshrined in a growing number of laws and regulations around the world, organizations increasingly have to pay attention to protecting the privacy of individuals in all their data handling and processing.</p>
<p>In the digital era, privacy guarantees need to be taken into account when designing any interactions with individuals that involve personal information, not only to avoid the risk of sanctions for failing to comply with privacy regulations, but also to gain consumer loyalty through winning their trust.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy has become very closely associated with data protection, and while there is no real privacy without effective data protection, privacy and data protection are often separate areas that modern businesses need to focus on to remain competitive.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that organizations constantly need to keep up to date on privacy and data protection regulations to ensure that their business operations remain in compliance, while at the same time they need to keep an eye on the cyber threat landscape to ensure they can protect personal and other business critical data from cyber attackers.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity, therefore, is an important part of privacy and data protection, but as remote working becomes more common, and organizations continue to adopt cloud-based services, the attack surface is changing and expanding.</p>
<p>This means that organizations need to adapt to this change and ensure that they adopt modern approaches that combine privacy, data protection and data governance. It is only through this convergence that today’s security and privacy requirements will be met.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real question is why many organizations have not yet started actively building a trusted relationship with their users/customers/consumers/employees. The awareness is rising, so that security and privacy are moving increasingly into the focus of not only tech-savvy users but also that of everyday customers.</p>
<p>— Matthias Reinwarth, IAM Practice Director, KuppingerCole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because we understand the important relationship between privacy and data protection, and because we are committed to helping your business succeed, KuppingerCole has a great deal of content available in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>This includes live events such the 2022 KuppingerCole <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference</a> taking place in Berlin and online from May 10-13, where the topics of privacy and identity will be covered comprehensively.</p>
<p>Highlights include an exploration of the relationship between privacy and data protection in this keynote presentation entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5040">Privacy and Data Protection. What is this Thing Called Privacy?</a>, and an analysis of the effectiveness and future of the EU’s GDPR in this keynote presentation by privacy advocate Max Schrems entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5134">I'm None of your Business</a>.</p>

  <p>As the internet has grown, so has the need to protect users from privacy invasions, fraud, or other types of abuse by attackers. The European Union’s solution is the General Data Protection Regulation, or <a href="https://gdpr.eu/">GDPR</a>. First put into effect in 2018, the policy applies not only to the organizations in the EU but to any organization that uses or collects data from people in the EU.</p>

<p>If your organization is subject to GDPR, you’ll need to know how to stay in compliance. This article will break down the details of this policy so that you understand its potential effects on your application.</p>

 What to know about GDPR 

<p>GDPR, which officially took effect on May 25, 2018, primarily encourages organizations to properly handle user data and privacy. Those not in compliance can face fines, in some cases <a href="https://gdpr.eu/the-gdpr-meets-its-first-challenge-facebook/">large ones like Facebook</a>.</p>

 GDPR requirements 

<p>GDPR compliance imposes multiple requirements on your organization. Here is what you must include in your application:</p>

 
   Enhanced application security. For example, end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and so on. 
   Facilities for users to exercise their data privacy rights. 
   Quick data purge at a user’s request. 
   Users given access to data collected from or about them. 
   Consent from users about what data is obtained and how it’s used. 
   Processing of user data in a way that doesn’t compromise the user. 
 

 GDPR penalties 

<p>The penalties for breaching GDPR are capped at whichever sum is higher: <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">$22.8 million USD or four percent of global revenue</a>. In the past three years, this has resulted in more than <a href="https://www.tessian.com/blog/biggest-gdpr-fines-2020/">$1.4 billion USD</a> in fines levied against tech giants, hotels, governmental agencies, and violators in other sectors.</p>

 How GDPR affects application security 

<p>If you’re responsible for managing your application’s security, GDPR can feel like a threat. There is a lot of work involved, and mistakes can lead to costly fines. If you use it properly, though, following GDPR can help your application. Here are some of the benefits it can offer:</p>

 Bigger security budget 

<p>Prior to GDPR, many organizations viewed cybersecurity as an expense rather than an investment. This attitude was reflected in understaffing and decreased purchasing power for critical cybersecurity features. The result was easily exploited digital infrastructure.</p>

<p>Because GDPR demands that organizations increase data security and backs up those demands with fines, managers of organizations would rather devote more of their budget to cybersecurity than risk losing profit to a security breach.</p>

 More security integrations 

<p>Products and services that help with <a href="https://www.globalapptesting.com/blog/what-is-automation-testing">automation testing</a>, <a href="https://www.xmcyber.com/what-is-breach-and-attack-simulation/">automated breach and attack simulation</a>, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-vpn">virtual private networks (VPNs)</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/vpc">virtual private clouds (VPCs)</a> are more likely to be added to an organization’s security strategy. Such additions can shore up the defenses of digital infrastructure; VPCs and VPNs also offer a sandbox environment for employees to experiment with security features.</p>

 Faster response to security incidents 

<p>Previously, user data theft wasn’t always handled as promptly as it should have been. GDPR enforcement requires organizations to communicate quickly about security breaches, which helps protect affected users and keeps other stakeholders well-informed. This can reduce the fallout of data theft.</p>

 How to comply with GDPR 

<p>The <a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist/">GDPR checklist</a> provides a snapshot of actions you and your organization need to take to be compliant. They include:</p>

 
   Employ a <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/employment-law/pages/global-gdpr-data-protection-officer.aspx">data protection officer</a>. 
   Invest in <a href="https://seersco.com/articles/gdpr-training-for-staff/">staff training</a>. 
   Ensure that third-party organizations you <a href="https://gdpr.eu/article-44-transfer-of-personal-data/">transfer data</a> to are compliant as well. 
   Stay updated on <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/third-countries/#:~:text=The%20third%20countries%20which%20ensure,these%20countries%20is%20expressly%20permitted.">which countries</a> are cleared for data transfers. 
 

 GDPR in your application 

<p>The following are questions you need to answer in order to keep your application in GDPR compliance:</p>

<p>Data collection</p>

 
   Is there a good reason for collecting this data? 
   Has the collection of non-necessary data been minimized? 
   Does the user consent to the collection of this data? 
 

<p>Data accuracy</p>

 
   Have you taken reasonable steps to keep data accurate? 
   Can users edit and update potentially inaccurate information? 
 

<p>Data breach</p>

 
   If a data breach has occurred, have you informed supervisors within seventy-two hours of the breach? 
   Have you carried out a data protection impact assessment before adopting new technology that interacts with user data? 
 

<p>Data protection</p>

 
   Have you taken adequate measures to prevent the compromise of user data? 
   Are your cybersecurity policies and measures up to date? 
   Is personally identifiable information (PII) of users properly encrypted to prevent abuse by malignant actors? 
 

<p>Data rights</p>

 
   Do users have the ability to request copies of their data? 
   Do users have the ability to object to certain uses of their data? 
   Can you delete a user’s data immediately if they request it? Does this include removing their data from your backups? 
 

<p>Data transfer</p>

 
   Is the data transfer process handled in a way that doesn’t compromise data? 
   Does the receiver have enough security installations in place to protect data? 
   Does the receiver comply with the human rights charter? 
   Is the receiver allowed to obtain data from entities bound by GDPR laws? 
 

 Common GDPR features 

<p>Here are examples of features that you can implement in your application to ensure GDPR compliance:</p>

 Frontend cookie consent 

<p>Users must be able to choose whether or not to accept cookies. GDPR emphasizes that users should be able to reject cookies easily. Some organizations make it <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cookie-consent-most-websites-break-law-by-making-it-hard-to-reject-all-tracking/">difficult to do this</a>, but such underhanded tactics can result in heavy fines.</p>

<p>A rule of thumb is to display the Decline button right next to the Accept button (and in the same font size) rather than offering a “Settings” or “Manage Cookies” link that makes it harder for users to refuse cookies and subtly bullies them into accepting the cookies on your platform. There are a ton of <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/implement-a-cookie-consent-notification-within-5-minutes-82c845c55487">resources</a> online that can help you implement GDPR-friendly frontend cookies. Compare your options so that you can adopt one that suits your organization best.</p>

 Data mapping 

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapping">Data mapping</a>, or connecting information from multiple data sets, requires a top-down analysis of all of an organization’s databases and what information they hold. This can be a big task, but it ensures transparency and accountability. Data mapping is required for the next steps.</p>

<p>Data mapping can be manual, semi-automated, or automated. You should determine which approach works best for you, depending on the size of your company, your budget, the quality of your data management team, and the amount of data you work with. Deciding how to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-mapping">implement data mapping</a> will require some understanding of your databases, as well as knowing which duplicated columns can be optimized to reduce redundancy.</p>

 Data purge functionality 

<p>Previously, even after users requested that their data be deleted, organizations could remove it from public access and keep it somewhere hidden; however, the GDPR mandates that “officially” deleted data must be deleted everywhere. Organizations must ensure that they monitor data to delete it properly from all resources as needed.</p>

<p>Implementing <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Best_Practices/Architecture/Data_Purging">data purge functionality</a> will likely require some modification to your database schema so that you can identify data to mark for deletion, per user requests, and data to purge due to staleness. Using <code>last_updated_date</code> and <code>is_deleted</code> columns in your data table can be useful in identifying either type of data.</p>

 Refactoring database schemas 

<p>Data purge functionality may involve refactoring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema">database (DB) schemas</a> to add columns noting when a resource was created or whether it was deleted. These columns can be used to automate data purges based on whether the data has been held longer than needed, for instance.</p>

<p>Further DB schema analysis may also be required to ensure that more data isn’t being collected than absolutely necessary.</p>

 Compliance is worth the work 

<p>GDPR rules can be long and esoteric, but it’s important for your organization to understand how to stay in compliance with the policy. Not only will you avoid fines for violations, but users will be more willing to trust your application. Ensuring better data privacy helps all stakeholders.</p>

<p>If necessary, remember you can seek help from a GDPR officer to ensure compliance. Doing this work upfront can save your organization from more costly consequences later on.</p>

<p>Whether it comes to buying homes and automobiles, seeking a personal or small business loan, or even approval to rent an apartment, there can be one daunting step of the loan process: income verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can take a long time. It involves a lot of paperwork—if the borrower has devoted the file cabinet space to store it. And without transparency or the right information, the process can feel arbitrary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://finicity.com/open-banking">Open banking</a> can help. Let’s start at the beginning.</p>
 
 Which Documents Usually Provide Verification of Income? 
<p>Paystubs, which are one of the most basic data sources, can provide proof of income as well as employment verification at the same time. With a paycheck traceable to an employer or a client, a lender can determine what kind of income the check represents and can follow up with its issuer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other income documents include proof-of-income letters, the standard W-2 annual tax statement and other tax forms that may be more fragmented. These documents aren’t always readily available. While they can be obtained from payroll providers and tax filing software, that involves even more digging and delays for what should be a simple process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Processing that kind of paperwork, following up with employers and verifying the details is time-intensive—and thus, money-intensive.&nbsp;</p>
 
 How Does Finicity’s Income Verification Make a Difference? 
<p>Open banking gives lenders a way to verify income quickly and securely, by verifying income where income is deposited in bank accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity’s income verification allows borrowers to connect their financial accounts to the lenders or services they’re interacting with. This lets borrowers quickly and securely skip much of the manual paperwork, while lenders can make informed decisions with comprehensive transaction and income data, ranging from 24 months of deposit transactions to estimated annual income and average monthly income. All of the information is categorized and ranked with confidence streams using artificial intelligence and machine learning as part of Finicity’s data analytics solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do we mean by “comprehensive data?” With open banking, the process of verifying income can go beyond paychecks, tax forms and phone calls. With more consumer-permissioned data sources comes a fuller picture of a borrower’s financial health and more accurate income verification.</p>
 
 Where Does Open Banking Fit into Mortgage Lending? 
<p>Mortgages are one of the most significant loans that many consumers will take out in their lifetimes, and the mortgage application process can be complex—to an intimidating degree. According to <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">a recent Finicity survey of homebuyers</a>, the top reason that people hesitate to refinance their home is because of the prospect of going through the income and employment verification and qualification processes all over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mortgage credit decisioning hinges on the borrower’s ability to make their mortgage payments on time. Most mortgage lenders require borrowers to provide at least two years of employment and income history via tax documents, paystubs and asset statements. The same goes for self-employed borrowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard’s open banking platform (provided by Mastercard’s wholly-owned subsidiary, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/">Finicity</a>), is able to leverage open banking data to satisfy the most stringent guidelines for the highest-value loans. We’re one of the only data providers approved to verify assets and income digitally by <a href="https://www.duvalidationcenter.com/vendors/">Fannie Mae</a> and <a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">Freddie Mac</a>. This data also makes it easy to refresh employment verifications right before close to make sure nothing has changed simply by checking whether they received their last paycheck. When you’re working with something as consequential as someone’s home loan, trust is key.</p>
 
 How Can Renters Benefit from Open Banking? 
<p>Homeownership isn’t for everyone, and open banking also helps renters navigating the apartment application process. Landlords screening potential tenants can use the same data to make decisions based on the applicant’s income and their historical rental payments. It can also help give context to low credit scores or other potential red flags on the application, resulting in a fairer decisioning process.</p>
 
 When do Auto Loans Require an Income Check? 
<p>Auto loans don’t typically require income verification, but the process may come into play when the prospective borrower has a thin credit file, smaller down payment or a lower credit score. The same goes for credit cards, personal loans and growing payment segments like buy-now-pay-later (BNPL).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For thin-file borrowers such as young people and recent immigrants, checking a credit score doesn’t tell their whole financial story. It can lead to frustrating denials, even though they have evidence of qualifying income and that they pay their bills on time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By incorporating income and other data—like transactions from connected bank accounts, debt-to-income ratio and more, open finance opens up a world of possibility. Borrowers can be approved for their car loan and qualify for lower interest rates. Lenders, meanwhile, won’t miss out on opportunities to bring new customers on board with a <a href="http://finicity.com/auto-demo">simple process</a> that they can get through while their buyer is still at the dealership.</p>
 
 How can Income Data be Incorporated into Decisioning for Personal Lending? 
<p>For many personal lenders, checking income after the fact may not be the most efficient way to approve loans. With open finance, the income, transaction data and analytics can be just as easily incorporated into their lending algorithms as in mortgage and auto lending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal lenders of all types look at hundreds of different pieces of data, depending on how much they’re lending and what it’s for. Open banking provides highly actionable data, direct from the applicant’s bank accounts. It slides seamlessly into their decisioning models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They no longer have to be satisfied with borrower-submitted income figures or delays in providing supporting documentation when a loan approval is up in the air. Using consumer-permissioned data, lenders receive a nearly real-time view of the applicant’s income and bank account data for a clearer credit decision.</p>
 
 How Does This Help the Consumer? 
<p>Verifying income with transaction data permissioned by consumers allows lenders and fintech innovators to simplify the customer experience with a more flexible underwriting process. It provides more choice to consumers, who can still use their paystubs or bank statements while also speeding up the decisioning process by permissioning their financial data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open banking adds the data necessary to easily verify income quickly, securely and without manual processes. Whether you’re lending, renting or leasing, Finicity’s income data can simplify the process and provide valuable insights. More data, more time saved, more satisfied borrowers and tenants—open banking helps everyone out.</p>

<p>When signing in to popular services today, users will typically use identity providers (IdPs) that are centralized entities with ultimate control over users' identifiers--or "Big Login." Sign-In with Ethereum offers a new self-custodial option for users who wish to assume more control and responsibility over their own digital identity. </p><p>Here are the latest updates from our work on Sign-In with Ethereum:</p> Recently Completed and Announced   All SIWE Core Packages (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/67">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-rs/pull/31">Rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-go/pull/15">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-ex/pull/22">Elixir</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-ruby/pull/16">Ruby</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py/pull/27">Python</a>) have been streamlined to support unified handling of SIWE message creation, parsing, and verification. We will have a new major release of SIWE Core Packages in the next week where those changes will be available. We've also added additional test vectors.  We've added tests for EIP-1271 in order to have test vectors for Argent and Loopring Smart Contract Wallets:   <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/69">  Add tests for EIP-1271 by w4ll3 · Pull Request #69 · spruceid/siwe  Add tests vectors for Argent and Loopring Smart Contract Wallets . Do not merge before #67 .  GitHubspruceid    </a>  We've added the option to configure your own JSON RPC provider for the SIWE Discourse plugin as an alternative to being locked into Infura:   <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth/pull/14">  Add JSON RPC config Option by theosirian · Pull Request #14 · spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth  Adds a JSON RPC option to WalletConnect as discussed in #13.  GitHubspruceid    </a>  We've released a demo that shows the functionality around our Auth0 integration. It demonstrates an example app where a user connects via the Auth0 Sign-In with Ethereum workflow, and is able to view a gallery of the NFTs they own via the OpenSea API. The demo can be found <a href="https://auth0-demo.login.xyz/#/">here</a>.  <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-on-auth0/">  Sign-In with Ethereum to Your Auth0-Powered Application  In our pursuit of best serving web2 and web3 organizations, we’ve partnered with Auth0 to offer a Sign-In with Ethereum option in their marketplace.  SpruceSpruce    </a>  We're continuing to work with wallets on the UX and UI around Sign-In with Ethereum flows. The details on a number of these collaborations will be made public shortly.    Exploration Phase   As mentioned in our previous update, we are exploring creating templates for commonly used development frameworks such as React and Vue. We wish to make it easy for any developer using these frameworks to have a quick way to get started using Sign-In with Ethereum for their next application.   We are planning to release our <a href="https://www.passportjs.org/">passport.js</a> authentication strategy for Sign-In with Ethereum and have it documented this coming month. Passport is authentication middleware used by thousands of applications.  We'll be continuing our work with additional wallets that may require custom UX and UI flows.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The Digital Services Act (DSA), along with the Digital Market Act (DMA) are initiatives from the European Union Commission, proposed in December 2020 and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_1978">agreed upon in April 2022</a>. The main goal is to provide and ensure an accountable online environment in the EU, and regulate the “gatekeepers” on online interactions.</p>
<p>This is a wide-reaching act that will differentiate “gatekeepers” from other online services, and apply obligations to them to create a more fair, competitive, and safe online market. These acts are not in full force yet – they are subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and European Council, and will apply six months after adoption.</p>
 Which Organizations Are Impacted? 
<p>The DSA makes a clear demarcation between small and medium-sized organizations and large online intermediaries and platforms: The large intermediaries and platforms will carry more responsibility and accountability to both allow freer competition and access to information, and to be transparent in their content moderation decisions. SMEs that provide digital services in the EU (regardless of where they are based) will also be subject to the DSA, but with “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2545">obligations proportionate to size, impact, and risk</a>”, as stated by the Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton.</p>
 Algorithm Transparency 
<p>One of the most labor-intensive actions that online platforms, particularly those that reach 10% of consumers in the EU and subject to the strictest obligations, will need to take is to provide transparency into the algorithms used for content moderation choices, recommendations, and many other functions. However, this could have some of the largest impacts on several fronts:</p>
 
 In beginning to engage with the societal influence of machine learning algorithms – not addressing harms done to individuals, but influences shaping the way large populations of people perceive the world 
 In enforcing accountability on proprietary algorithms, the handling of which will set a precedent for transparency of other proprietary algorithms used in other areas of business 
 In stimulating more investment in explainability for machine learning models, which impacts the transparency of models, the ability for human administrators and those impacted by model recommendations to understand those recommendations, and boosting security of models by making it more human-understandable if a recommendation has been maliciously influenced. 
 
<p>This could be a turning point in our ethics debate on machine learning, moving from the theoretical to the practical and enforceable. This will be closely followed by analysts at KuppingerCole Analysts, as well as the numerous other impacts including the way that businesses can connect and communicate with their consumers or future customers. We will continue to assess and prepare you for those ongoing transitions.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Osman Celik</a></p><p>Widespread use of cloud services, the rising number of integrated solutions and the collaboration between organizations increase the concerns over data privacy and security. Today, we know that many data protection regulations (e.g., FIPS, GDPR, CCPA) require data to be encrypted while it is at rest and in motion. Even though we are not yet able to encrypt the data in all its states, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) performs encryption while the data is in use state and might become one of the holy grails of encryption methods available. While it is one of the technologies available in the privacy-enhancing technologies (PET) market, FHE offers an encryption technology which allows organizations to remain protected from cybersecurity threats by enabling computations on encrypted data without decrypting it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The state of data denotes the different modes where computing systems are using the data. In this principle, data can be in one of three states. These are data at rest, data in motion, and data in use. Although most encryption methods deal with data at rest and data in transit, homomorphic encryption (HE), as an umbrella term, aims to allow making computations on encrypted data in use while it is being processed, analyzed, or manipulated without first decrypting it with a key. KuppingerCole Analysts predicts that HE technologies pave the way for keeping the data encrypted not only in the data in use state but also throughout the whole data lifecycle.</p>
<p></p>
 Types of HE 
<p>There are three types of HE. In general, the difference between them stems from the types and frequency of mathematical operations that they can perform on the ciphertext.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE): PHE algorithms only allow an infinite number of certain types of mathematical operations (e.g., only addition or multiplication) to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it.</p>
<p>2. Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE): Despite being a step up from PHE, SHE algorithms only allow a finite number of any kind of operation rather than an infinite number of a particular operation.</p>
<p>3. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): FHE algorithms allow all mathematical operations available to be performed unlimited times and up to high level of complexity without decrypting the data. That is why encryption experts consider it as the holy grail of homomorphic encryption.</p>
<p></p>
 How does FHE work? 
<p>1.) The owner of the data wants another party to perform mathematical operations on certain data. The owner also wants to protect the sensitive data in it without revealing it to the other party.</p>
<p>2.) The owner encrypts the data with a public key and sends it to the other party.</p>
<p>3.) The other party receives the encrypted data, performs the necessary operations on it, and sends the encrypted results to the owner. At this stage, FHE eliminates the need for decryption of the data before making operations and while sending the results.</p>
<p>4.) The owner of the data receives the results and decrypts the data with a private key. The owner manages to get results without revealing any data to the other parties.</p>
<p></p>
 Benefits of FHE 
<p>Mitigating Sensitive Data Privacy Risk:</p>
<p>FHE allows organizations to collaborate with each other in a safer environment. By making computations on encrypted data possible, FHE prevents organizations from revealing their sensitive data, such as PCI, PHI, and PII and the results of those computations to the other parties. Also, securing data in untrusted environments, such as public clouds and external parties, strengthens organizations’ cyber resilience. KuppingerCole Analysts predict that FHE can contribute to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Zero-Trust approach</a> once the limitations of FHE are overcome.</p>
<p>Secure Use of Cloud:</p>
<p>By providing additional security measures, FHE can help organizations leverage their cloud use. FHE technologies can already perform computations on encrypted data among integrated cloud services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Complying with Regulations:</p>
<p>Organizations are expected to comply with international and/or regional data protection regulations. Today, many of those regulations, such as <a href="https://gdpr.eu/working-remotely-data-security/">GDPR</a>, require organizations to encrypt their sensitive data. By taking existing encryption methods to a next level, FHE can be a strategic cybersecurity investment for the future.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Security:</p>
<p>Outsourced service providers, 3rd parties, such as contractors and vendors, might have access to organizations’ sensitive data in order to do their jobs. Today’s threat landscape demonstrates how attackers target insecure supply chains among the organizations. By reducing the risk of revealing sensitive data to other parties and enabling those parties to make computations over encrypted data, FHE helps organizations reduce their supply chain risks.</p>
<p>Quantum-Safe:</p>
<p>Existing encryption methods lack capabilities against quantum attacks. However, some companies already offer FHE solutions that are quantum-safe. Organizations which suffer from quantum attacks can consider adopting those solutions as an alternative method to increase their cyber resilience.</p>
<p></p>
 Limitations of FHE 
<p>Performance Issues:</p>
<p>Slow computation speed, accuracy problems while operating, and remarkably high storage requirements are known issues for organizations which rely on compute-intensive applications. Researchers believe that FHE has still some years to overcome performance related challenges.</p>
<p>Still an Emerging Technology:</p>
<p>HE’s roots date back to the 70s, yet FHE is a relatively new encryption method. Considering the fact that FHE, in its current form, yielded its first successful results in<a href="https://ibm-research.medium.com/the-future-of-crypto-ibm-makes-a-new-leap-with-fully-homomorphic-encryption-68e98f35af14"> 2009</a>, we might still have to wait some years to see more effective FHE schemes and solutions. Today’s FHE solutions give the best results when used with supporting solutions and best practices. While vendors are developing their</p>
<p>FHE solutions, there are scientists and engineers working on specific FHE projects and also some universities which are currently researching and developing FHE algorithms.</p>
<p>Narrow Market Size:</p>
<p>As of today, there are limited number of vendors in FHE market. This makes finding and choosing a vendor difficult. Nevertheless, companies like<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-launches-experimental-homomorphic-data-encryption-environment-for-the-enterprise/"> IBM</a> launched experimental FHE services in late 2020.</p>
<p></p>
 Use Cases 
<p>FHE has already been used by various organizations for different purposes. Social media companies can benefit from it for private data analytics. Governmental organizations can deploy it during the electronic voting process. Organizations like e-commerce companies, hospitals, banks, and other financial institutions in which personal, health, and financial data is stored, used, and shared with 3rd parties can also secure themselves from data breaches and increase their cyber resilience with FHE. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/fully-homomorphic-encryption-on-ibm-cloud-hyper-protect-virtual-servers">Cybersecurity experts</a> state that FHE already provides an effective workload protection in financial institutions against fraud intelligence.</p>
<p></p>
 Alternative Solutions 
<p>Since FHE has not yet reached its potential capabilities, organizations might also look for alternative solutions in encryption and PET market. Data Masking, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) could be alternative solutions for organizations depending on their needs and requirements. Recently, many experts compared FHE with Functional Encryption (FE) which is also an encryption technology that is in the preliminary stages of development.</p>
<p></p>
 Recommendations 
<p>Clarify Your Needs and Requirements: When considering any solution, organizations should first determine their requirements. Consider the limitations of FHE solutions and look for alternative solutions if needed. A SWOT analysis might be helpful to create at this stage.</p>
<p>Analyze the FHE Market: Understand each solution’s strengths and weaknesses. Since FHE is an emerging solution, try to find out what further developments that vendors are planning.</p>
<p>Conduct a PoC: Determine the best use case scenarios for your organization, create a well-defined checklist and ask initially selected vendors to prepare a PoC.</p>
<p>Choose a Vendor: Make sure that the vendor you select demonstrates the desired capabilities during the PoC. Finally, choose the vendor that best meets your requirements and has the fewest limitations for your organization.</p>

<p>After months of hard work on this project, we are proud to announce the launch of ShareRing eKYC at Barbados Teachers Co-Operative Credit Union Limited (TCU). The launch of eKYC with TCU signifies both entity’s forward thinking position on user data ownership and privacy, whilst ensuring anti-money laundering requirements are adhered to stringently.</p>



<p>The philosophy behind TCU is ‘people helping people’, and ShareRing’s purpose of “frictionless access with digital identities”&nbsp; is a symbiotic partner to the greater vision behind both entities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the launch, customers of TCU are now able to use the ShareRing App to upload, verify, and submit their eKYC documents. After downloading the app, the customer must first set up their ShareRing ID, a digital twin representation of their physical self, before proceeding with their eKYC process.</p>







<p>For user instructions on setting up your ShareRing ID, <a href="https://sharering.network/user-manual-guide/">visit this page here</a>.</p>



<p>For user instructions on submitting your eKYC application, <a href="https://sharering.network/sharering-ekyc-user-instructions-barbados-teachers-cooperative-credit-union-limited/">visit this page here.</a></p>



<p>eKYC with ShareRing and TCU brings a flurry of advantages that are backed by the underlying blockchain technology. A faster and more efficient KYC process is supported by immutability of data hashed on the blockchain. This correlates to time saved by both the individual and institution. On top of that, confidence levels that data is not fraudulent and tampered-with are significantly high.</p>



<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to our customer support team. If you are an institution and are interested in adopting eKYC into your organization, please reach out to Stewart Smith, Head of Sales and Marketing, at stewart.s@sharering.network</p>



<p>—- —- —- —- —-</p>



<p>ShareRing is a digital identity blockchain ecosystem with a suite of ID driven solutions that enable individuals, and institutions an easier pathway to navigate services across the digital landscape.</p>



<p>Teachers Credit Union has been in existence for over 50 years and is one of the most stable Credit Unions in the Caribbean. Their mission is to provide financial and other related services in a manner that anticipates and satisfies the financial needs of members in the areas of saving and borrowing.</p>

  The benefits of owning and storing your own credentials are unmatched by today’s standards.

<p>On a mission to enable organizations and individuals to create and share verifiable data, Dock has invited its trusted community members to test new features and upgrades on Dock’s Mobile Wallet App. One of these new features allows users to store and manage verifiable credentials directly on their mobile devices. We are committed to delivering a service made entirely for the community and are entrusting our community members to test the wallet app feature. This will ensure the feature is customer-focused and fulfills community needs.</p> Verifiable Credentials Explained<br> <p>Verifiable credentials (VCs) are tamper-proof credentials that can be cryptographically verified. VCs can represent things found in physical forms such as a driving license or passport, and things that have no physical equivalent such as ownership of a bank account or NFT. </p><p>The difference verifiable credentials bring is that they can be instantly verified and cannot be tampered with. &nbsp;</p><p>An issuing body, such as an educational or training institution can create and issue verifiable credentials. These credentials have been cryptographically signed by the issuing authority and cannot be tampered with. The individual receiving this credential now owns the data and can prove the credentials are legitimate without contacting the issuer. </p> The Old-Fashioned Way<br> <p>Let’s take Dave for example. Dave moves around different construction sites each week for work. He has taken several online courses legalizing him to drive a forklift, operate diggers, and more. Dave must carry prints of these certificates or a laptop to display the PDF certificates. Being a construction worker, a laptop isn’t the safest option as it can get damaged easily, therefore Dave usually opts for paper certificates. He prints off the certificates and takes them to each construction site he works at. </p><p>According to COSAC, the average construction worker holds between 8 and 10 certificates. Dave has to carry all these physical certificates to each site he attends and prove his qualifications to work there. </p> The Ease Of Verifiable Credentials<br> <p>If Dave is issued verifiable credentials by the training body, he has complete control over them. The verifying body can validate the credentials are legitimate without the need to contact the issuing body. </p><p>The benefits of owning and storing your own credentials are unmatched by today’s standards. Dock’s Wallet App will allow users to store and manage their verifiable credentials from their mobile devices. This feature will soon be released but we want to ensure we’ve worked out the kinks and that it’s fit for customer use. </p> On With The Beta Testing<br> <p>From Monday, our selected beta testers will be knighted with a unique credential from Dock and have the ability to import this credential into their Mobile Wallet App. They’ll have 7 days to explore the credentials management flow we’ve designed and expose any bugs they find. These bugs will be detailed back to our development team and addressed before launch.</p><p>To ensure the feature fulfills customer needs, the beta testing will continue for another week once all bugs and issues have been reported and resolved. We’re doing this as we want to ensure we are releasing a customer-focused, customer-centric, user-friendly credentials management flow. </p><p>Dock wants to guarantee an intuitive user experience, assuring a seamless and simple import and credential management flow. We believe this feature will serve great importance to the community and will overcome various risks associated with paper and PDF credentials.</p><p>12,500 DOCK tokens are up for grabs for our beta testers who report the best and most in-depth feedback on our credentials management feature. The token rewards are split between 2 scopes - security and user experience of our wallet app feature. If you’re interested in being a part of our future beta testing programs, keep an eye on our <a href="https://linktr.ee/DockNetwork">social media</a> and be the first to trial Dock’s upcoming features and products. </p><p>Late last year, we announced a collaboration with Transak opening the doors for the wider community to buy DOCK tokens via card payments and bank transfers. To on-board as many as we can, Dock has enabled this ability on our Mobile Wallet App. App users can buy tokens from fiat to crypto using local payment methods in a few simple clicks. Our beta testers will have the opportunity to test this feature and ensure the process is as smooth as it can be. </p><p></p><p>Terms and Conditions:</p>  All data should be kept private and they can’t share any link with any other person. Everything in strict confidence and no disclosure of any information.  Only disclose errors and bugs to the company and no one else  Rewards will be given to the best feedback provider and not to everyone participating. However, team can consider rewarding participants that uncover a unique or severe security related bug that brings substantial improvement to the app  Testers should provide feedback only using the google form provided and nothing else

Typically, most traditional web2 services already support OpenID Connect, and were open to adding a new Identity Provider that supported the Sign-In with Ethereum workflow. </p><p>By meeting these services where they are today, we can provide a pragmatic stepping stone towards true decentralization, with an upgrade path to direct authentication. In our pursuit of best serving these organizations, we've partnered with Auth0 to offer a Sign-In with Ethereum option in their marketplace:</p><blockquote><p>Signing in with Ethereum wallets is now an available option for all Auth0 clients! A big thanks to our friends (frens?) at <a href="https://twitter.com/SpruceID?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpruceID</a>.<br><br>We're excited to see how the Web3 world continues to unlock new tools for identity, privacy, and security: <a href="https://t.co/McdjVI7wwy">https://t.co/McdjVI7wwy</a></p>— The Auth0 Lab (@Auth0Lab) <a href="https://twitter.com/Auth0Lab/status/1513553660034355201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>Auth0 is the leading platform for authentication and authorization for web2 applications and services in retail, publishing, B2B SaaS, and more. We are grateful to have worked with Auth0 and the Auth0 Lab team to bring this integration to life and drive web3-based authentication forward. </p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-oidc">  GitHub - spruceid/siwe-oidc: OpenID Connect Identity Provider for Sign-In with Ethereum.

 Problem <p>Recently we took on a challenge to create a solution for our Analysts who needed to perform a manual action as part of a traceability process. They needed to verify a user-submitted security code against a UK government database to prove a person’s right to work. Then, they needed to take a screenshot to keep a record of it. Considering our requirements we needed to control and automate the screenshot functionality in our application.</p> Solution <p>Browser screenshot tool.</p><p>The answer to the problem was to build a simple tool to take screenshots within the browser. But how? MediaStream API to the&nbsp;rescue!</p><p>What we did consisted of streaming one tab content to another tab video element and capturing one frame of the stream, turning it into an image, and sending the image to the&nbsp;server.</p><p>Let us first take a look at what the MediaStream API is and which parts we needed to build our solution.</p> MediaStream API <p>MediaStream API provides the interfaces and methods for working with streams and their tracks. It is related to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</a> which provides support for streaming audio and video&nbsp;data.</p><p>Of all the interfaces that make up the MediaStream API we used the MediaDevices and MediaStream interfaces.</p> MediaDevices <p>From MDN Web&nbsp;Docs:</p><blockquote>The MediaDevices interface provides access to connected media input devices like cameras and microphones, as well as screen sharing. In essence, it lets you obtain access to any hardware source of media&nbsp;data.</blockquote><p>The media input we are interested in the screenshot tool is the screen sharing one, so we can obtain its media content and get an image from it. This interface has several methods that we can call to prompt the user to select a display, portion of a display (such as a window or tab), or turn on the camera and/or microphone providing a MediaStream object containing the media&nbsp;data.</p> MediaStream <p>From MDN Web&nbsp;Docs:</p><blockquote>The MediaStream interface represents a stream of media content. A stream consists of several tracks, such as video or audio tracks. Each track is specified as an instance of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack">MediaStreamTrack</a>.</blockquote><p>The MediaStream will contain the content of the stream, we will use it to feed the video element, get a frame, and convert it to the final image we&nbsp;want.</p> Tool Example <p>The simple sample tool we built has three main pieces, the react screenshot tool component and two main methods, one to set up the preview of the image and one to capture an image from the&nbsp;preview.</p> ScreenshotTool <p>The main component ScreenshotTool is fairly small, it has two buttons, one to start the image preview and one to capture the image in the preview element. To show the streaming content we have a video HTML element and to show the image captured we have an img&nbsp;element.</p> ImagePreview <p>ImagePreview is one of the two main functions. It is called when the user clicks on the Preview&nbsp;button.</p><p>It takes as an argument a reference to the video element that is used to set its source object with the MediaStream object that we get from calling the getDisplayMedia() and after selecting the tab or window we want to stream. By doing this the video HTML element starts to show the content of the stream, which in our case will be the content of one of the browser’s tabs.</p> ImageCapture <p>ImageCapture is the function responsible for taking the screenshot we want. In short, it takes a look at the stream content in the video HTML element, grabs a frame, and converts it to a png&nbsp;image.</p><p>We use the getVideoTracks function to get the stream frame, and then we use the frame to generate a png image using a canvas element. Instead of using a canvas element, we tried to use the ImageCapture class and takePhoto function, but it didn’t work because we can’t take photos of muted tracks. For more details take a look <a href="https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-screen-share/issues/141">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/master/third_party/blink/renderer/modules/imagecapture/image_capture.cc">here</a>.</p> Demo <p><a href="https://screenshot-browser-demo.netlify.app">Demo App</a></p> Conclusion <p>We can use these amazing interfaces to easily build solutions to our problems that initially may sound a bit complicated but most of the complicated parts are very well implemented and documented. This article shows a very specific problem and solution but I think it is a good, simple, and creative example of what you can build with the MediaStream API.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/browser-screenshot-tool-with-mediastream-api-97ae79d23afe">Browser screenshot tool with MediaStream API</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Dr. Angelika Steinacker</a></p><p>Women in Identity (WID) is a global organization with a vision to develop identity solutions for everyone by everyone. It was founded in 2018 by a handful of women and has grown to more than 2000 members in 32 countries. We believe that diverse teams create better solutions, and each of us works with the identity industry to achieve this.</p>
<p>Thanks to the KuppingerCole team who has supported WID from the beginning, we are able to host a WID Get-Together at EIC 2022 on May 12 from 16:30-17:30 followed by a track. The local WID DACH team has been working hard to put together an interesting program for everyone which shows the diversity of our work. Angelika, Silvia, and Irene will (re-)present the results.</p>
<p>Angelika joined WID in 2018 and is WID ambassador for DACH. She has worked in security and identity all her professional life and is still passionate about it.</p>
<p>Based on various studies and research, as well as her own experiences, she will talk about the challenges women face in the security and identity industry. When she started in the IT industry in the Mid-1980s, there were not many women. It was the early days of the commercial security industry, and the situation there was no better. One might have expected the situation to improve over the last 30 years. But it doesn't look that way. Currently, about 20% - 25% of IT workers are women, a steady decline since the late 1980s. What are the main reasons for this? Are there differences between countries and regions that we can learn from to address these reasons? And/or are there differences in education, work environment, recognition, and perception of women in society that attract more - or less - women to the IT and security industry? That's what we want to talk about in this session.</p>
<p>Silvia is a WID member since 2018 and started her career as an Identity engineer. Her topic will be the misbehavior of your digital twin and what you can do if your digital twin misbehaves.</p>
<p>Originating from a virtual model reflecting a physical object, the term “digital twin” also has its application in the cyber security industry. Social media giants and the advertisement industry have a huge interest in modeling your behavior, feelings, and thoughts to tailor advertising to you.</p>
<p>This does not only pose a serious data security threat, but this data mass in the wrong hands can also be very critical. Casting an eye on threats from digital twins, we will look at challenges and opportunities from a cyber security perspective. Which other company assets can be modeled as digital twins and how can enterprises capitalize on this information? How can a digital twin contribute to the future of offensive and defensive security? These questions will be addressed in this presentation.</p>
<p>Irene recently joined the WID DACH team. She is part of the Berlin pioneer start-up Jolocom, which she joined in late 2019. At Jolocom the focus is on building Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions for end-users and organizations alike. Her background is in law, linguistics, and economics.</p>
<p>During her session, Irene will give an overview of the state of play of SSI. Where is it at currently? Where is it not (yet)? While both governments and regulators have started to support the idea of handling digital identities in a decentralized manner and are funding a series of pilot projects worldwide, this implementation and deployment phase we are in also shows us what is still to be done and where the next challenges are arising - in governance models, standards development, and interoperability, as well as stakeholder communication. So, quo vadis SSI? Join this session to find out and learn about the most recent developments and challenges of implementing SSI in Europe.</p>

				   Indicio’s Trusted Digital Ecosystems answer President Biden’s call for “trust in the global digital ecosystem”   
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By James Schulte </p>
<p>The Biden administration, in coordination with 60 other countries, on Thursday unveiled a “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/28/fact-sheet-united-states-and-60-global-partners-launch-declaration-for-the-future-of-the-internet/">Declaration for the Future of the Internet</a>” that “reclaims the promise of the Internet in the face of the global opportunities and challenges presented by the 21st century.”</p>
<p>The declaration outlines principles and commitments to, among other things, “Promote trust in the global digital ecosystem, including through protection of privacy,” and it goes on to say the “United States and partners will work together to promote this vision and its principles globally, while respecting each other’s regulatory autonomy within our own jurisdictions and in accordance with our respective domestic laws and international legal obligations.”</p>
<p>President Biden’s request for a global digital ecosystem to reinforce safety as the world increasingly relies on an “open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet” isn’t far-fetched. It’s ready and accessible today through using decentralized identity and verifiable digital credentials to build Trusted Digital Ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Trusted Digital Ecosystem is a complete system for proving the authenticity of digital information in a privacy-preserving way; it can interoperate between countries, organizations, companies, people, and machines; and it is lightweight enough to slide over and sit on top of existing digital identity and access systems to add the verification, privacy, and security elements that are needed to interact with each other online in a trusted way.</p>
<p>Solving for Trust<br>The fundamental question Indicio has been working to answer for the past two years is: how can we trust digital data?</p>
<p>As the declaration notes, the problem of digital trust is now endemic to life because all our information is digital and we are (almost) all and always online. The very efficiency of digital communication has created an expensive, existential crisis—one costing us a fortune in mitigation, poor user experience, fraud, theft, and missed opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These problems have four dimensions:</p>
<p>One, Verification: How do you encode digital information with authenticity? Information must be able to show, definitively, that it came from the source it says it came from and that it hasn’t been altered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two, Regulation:&nbsp; Compliance and privacy laws have expanded to meet public and political concerns. They’re not going away. Digital identity and access systems must mitigate these risks to minimize their complexity and cost to business and organizations.</p>
<p>Three, Security: One trillion dollars. That’s the estimated cost of cyber insecurity. “Never trust, always verify” now defines the dominant paradigm in cybersecurity: zero-trust. Digital information must be continuously verified as authentic and unaltered.</p>
<p>Four, Resilience: A technology that solves all these problems cannot manifest in a single point of failure whether that is a single database or a single company.</p>
<p>Trusted Digital Ecosystems using decentralized identity technology solve all four problems.</p>
<p>One, Verification: Verifiable credentials anchored to a distributed ledger are able to definitively prove the source of information and that the information hasn’t been altered. They make data immediately actionable.</p>
<p>Two, Regulation: Verifiable credentials allow information to be held by the owner of the information and shared by consent and without the need for third party storage or management. Communications protocols are peer-to-peer. No more GDPR headaches.</p>
<p>Three, Security: Verifiable credentials make the continuous verification needed by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">zero trust</a> security frictionless. Say goodbye to personal accounts, passwords, logins—all the broken machinery of centralized identity management.</p>
<p>Four, Resilience: Decentralized identifiers and distributed ledgers mean resilient systems. If centralized and federated identity systems go down, it’s like someone shut off the access equivalent to the power grid. Plus, all this technology is open source—it means constant reliability testing and constant, sustainable innovation. It’s also easy to integrate into existing systems and it’s easy to use because resilience also means making adoption and daily use as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Build Trust Now<br>We built out decentralized identity technology into Trusted Digital Ecosystems to meet customer needs. We specialize in solutions for finance, health, IoT, and travel. And, we’ve just closed an <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/accesswire/technology-business-4dbf651613d76693bc479321f7b041f5">oversubscribed seed round</a>. We’ve moved from solving the four problems to implementing solutions to scale.</p>
<p>The White House statement on the future of the internet isn’t a lofty goal for us; it’s what we’re building every day for companies and organizations.</p>
<p>The future is being made now—so why not <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">tell us</a> how we can make it work for you?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kelsie Nabben, Researcher, <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/">RMIT</a> on Data Trusts, DAOs and use cases of the Data Economy in&nbsp;DAOs</p><p>In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we spoke to<a href="https://twitter.com/kelsiemvn"> Kelsie Nabben.</a> She is a researcher in decentralized technology communities. Kelsie is interested in the human outcomes of digital infrastructure, blockchain community culture, and algorithmic governance. She has written various research papers on this topic, the recent one being Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) as data&nbsp;trusts.</p><p>Kelsie is a recipient of a PhD scholarship at the RMIT University Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making &amp; Society and a researcher in the Digital Ethnography Research Centre and Blockchain Innovation Hub. In this chat, we spoke about how principles of data trusts might apply to DAOs as a data governance structure. We also questioned decentralized data ownership, storage, and utilization.</p><p>Here are edited excerpts of the podcast interview:</p><p>How do algorithms work in&nbsp;DAOs?</p><p>In this podcast, we have discussed the non-transparent ways in which <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-the-data-economy-safiya-noble-search-engines-b3729568807c">Algorithms operate primarily in Web2.</a> How do they operate in Web3 or peer-to-peer open-source, decentralized, encrypted technologies? Web3 is here to make the rules of governance or the algorithms involved in governance processes semi-transparent or rather fully transparent. Open-source software in the decentralized technology space, such as public blockchains, means that anyone can go and read the smart contracts that have rules encoded in them. However, not everyone is literate in that and not everyone is a software coder. You have digital economies as more and more interactions are mediated by digital technologies. Writing code is synonymous with making policies or setting rules of governance. This makes the role of engineers in these systems, even more, important and responsible. <a href="https://kelsienabben.substack.com/p/algorithms-as-policy?s=r">Read this article on Algorithms as policy for a detailed overview.</a></p><p>Blockchain communities have been influenced by the ideologies of early cypherpunks. The idea in Bitcoin, which is the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency, was that software code is immutable i.e, it should be designed so it can’t be co-opted by a monopoly or dictator. This has influenced how blockchain communities approach algorithms. There was strong debate, for example, on whether the algorithm could be questioned, and the rules of the system could be&nbsp;changed.</p><p>However, algorithms save us from Sybil attacks where people pretend to create multiple fake identities in a DAO as they try to game the system. Such attacks can be avoided by algorithms that are used for quadratic funding.</p><p>Data trusts used as a governance tool for&nbsp;DAOs</p><p>We have discussed d<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-data-economy-anouk-ruhaak-data-trusts-8240426c2ecf">ata trusts in Episode 3</a> of Voices of the Data Economy earlier. Data trusts are a relatively new concept, predicated on participatory, democratic, cooperative governance structures whereby a legal entity acts as an independent fiduciary steward of data. Data trusts are data governance and utilization structures that allow individuals to state their aspirations for data use and mandate a trustee to represent those interests through the legal mechanism of&nbsp;trusts.</p><blockquote>“A data trust aims to return power to individuals regarding the use of their data through collective pooling and then appointment and stewardship of that data. Data trusts can continue to steward, maintain, and manage how data is used and shared, including access, who gets to define those terms, and penalties for misbehaviour. Scholars envision an “ecosystem” of data trusts with different rules and risk profiles so that individuals can choose and change how their data is utilized for public good purposes or financial returns”</blockquote><p>A drawback of data trusts as a legal structure is that there are no strong guarantees about enforceability. So when you rely on the law and you entrust your data to a person if that person then goes and sells it to third parties that you didn’t authorize, or the data gets hacked, or it gets duplicated, you could maybe sue that person but that data is gone or replicated or shared or mined&nbsp;forever.</p><blockquote>“That is why I connected this concept to DAOs. The code is law in the DAO; in the blockchain ethos. So what does it mean to have enforceability around how data is governed through smart contracts and DAO governance rather than relying on traditional nation-state legal systems for&nbsp;that?”</blockquote><p>It’s an open field in terms of how people are going to use these composable modules and how they’re going to combine DAOs with storage or streams of data or data marketplaces.</p><blockquote>“I think they can play together to try to create opportunities for data to work for people. Another train of thought is that data should just never be monetized — but that’s maybe a challenging stretch from where we are in terms of the digital economy.”</blockquote><p>Uses cases of Data trusts&nbsp;DAOs</p><p>Think of DAOs as data trusts, as an infrastructure; one of the most interesting components will be around that arbitration and enforcement mechanism.</p><blockquote>“As I mentioned earlier, if you don’t need to rely on the law but rely on the code-based system, what does that actually look like? I think decentralized codes are still in their early days in and it’s fascinating to see communities either implement them or develop their&nbsp;own.”</blockquote><p>DAOs as data trusts hold data that can be applied to short and long-term use cases. They might also donate to medical research, monetize creative expressions, or solve complicated problems in a crisis. Some projects are already exploring this idea, referring to the possible governance structure of these models as data coops or data&nbsp;unions.</p><p>Kelsie also refers to the use case of Ocean Protocol in detail in her paper. She mentioned that Ocean is pioneering the idea of “Compute-to-Data”, whereby algorithms and compute jobs are matched in a marketplace to buy and sell data without exposing the content of that data to preserve privacy. Computation occurs without the data leaving the premises of the data holder, for privacy-preserving analytics, AI modelling, and&nbsp;more.</p><blockquote>“Just as data trusts are one component of governance, which is interdependent on policies, politics, rights, other infrastructure, economics, and more, data DAOs are one approach to structuring data governance through DAO infrastructure. This paper presents generous scope for further research into the contexts in which DAOs are a suitable governance framework for data, DeFi for data, novel cryptography and privacy preservation mechanisms, and development of the technical architecture for real-world sandboxes for functional decentralized data governance ecosystems,” says Kelsie regarding her views on the&nbsp;paper.</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p>  1.46- 6.40: What got Kelsie interested in DAOs and digital economies?  6.40- 9.42: How do algorithms work in&nbsp;DAOs?  9.42- 14.11: What are data trusts and what is the legal structure of data&nbsp;trusts?  14.11- 17.55: Drawbacks of data trust&nbsp;DAOs  17.55–20.44: Views on data monetization and data&nbsp;economy  20.44- 24.34: Use cases of data trust&nbsp;DAOs  24.34- 30.43: Why DAOs could survive? Why DAOs could&nbsp;fail?  30.43- 41.11: The level playing field in&nbsp;DAOs  41.11- 46.50: Research methods used by&nbsp;Kelsie  46.50- end: Conclusion and what’s next with&nbsp;DAOs?   <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/demystifying-data-trusts-as-daos-in-the-data-economy-a9386b57ae86">Demystifying Data Trusts as DAOs in the Data Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>30th April might not seem a particularly significant day but, for Ubisecure, 30th April 2002 marked the start of our journey. It was the day that the brainchild of Charles Sederholm and Petteri Stenius took shape. Our name is derived from a concatenation of “Ubiquitous Security”, and that ubiquitous approach and early vision has stood us in good stead.</p>
<p>Today, 20 years later, we have grown far beyond those early beginnings to become a leading European digital identity expert and the world #1 organisation identity provider. We’ve been involved in a number of ground-breaking projects over that time, and certainly there are many more to come.</p>
 Key projects from Ubisecure’s journey so far 
<p>In 2008, we delivered the core Identity and Access Management (IAM) system that powered the Finnish <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="Katso platform">Katso platform</a>, providing national level authorisation through delegation between individuals and organisations. Tied to strong individual and organisation identities, the Katso platform revolutionised B2B and B2G interactions, and enabled phenomenal savings for those involved. You can <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="read our case study here">read our case study here</a> to learn the breadth of capability and depth of saving.</p>
<p>In 2014, we took the next generation of that platform to DNA Telecom and revolutionised its B2B identity management, providing delegated administration for their business customers. The deployment was recognised internationally and awarded ‘Best B2B Identity Project’ at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/staehler/european-identity-cloud-awards-2015">2015 European Identity and Cloud Awards</a>. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ubisecure_DNA_case_study.pdf" title="Read the case study here">Read the case study here</a>.</p>
<p>2018 contained a number of significant events for Ubisecure, having been taken private the previous year. Doubling down on our commitment to organisation identity, we became accredited by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) as a ‘Local Operating Unit’ – more commonly known as an LEI issuer. Our experience with Katso had confirmed the value of combining strong individual identity with strong organisation identity and the LEI provides the required global steppingstone to ubiquitous strong organisation identity.</p>
<p>2018 was also the year we secured Series A funding from Octopus Investments to expand our capabilities across the Nordics and beyond. Octopus have been a great partner in our growth journey, bringing a strong corporate development drive and effective corporate governance models.</p>
<p>2019 saw growing success with Telia Company winning the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/stories/eic-award-telia-company/" title="Best Consumer Identity Project">Best Consumer Identity Project</a> award for their use of our platform at the core of their Identity Broker Service. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Telia-Identification-Broker-Service-Ubisecure-Case-Study.pdf" title="Read the case study here.">Read the case study here.</a></p>
<p>2020 saw Ubisecure taking the global #1 position as issuer of new LEIs, passing Bloomberg and then GMEI in early 2020. We have maintained this #1 consistently since, and in March 2022 issued 1 in 4 new validated LEIs globally. Today we are helping global organisations manage their customer bases, enhance their KYC processes, and access the $4B annual saving potential identified by <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/mckinsey-company-and-gleif-leis-and-client-lifecycle-management-in-banking-a-u-s-4-billion-beginning">McKinsey</a>. 2020 was also the year we launched IDaaS (Identity-as-a-Service) – our IAM as a managed service solution for organisations needing to deploy IAM capabilities quickly via a cloud or hybrid approach.</p>
<p>2021 saw us announce support for vLEI, a verifiable credential based on the LEI. We expect the vLEI to be at the centre of next generation organisation identity attribute solutions.</p>
<p>2022 is shaping up to be an interesting year. We are adding significant new capabilities to our IAM solution to improve how IAM supports risk-based authentication and online fraud prevention. We will also be presenting next month at the Gartner IAM Summit in London, where I will be on stage with Telia Company to talk about “How Reusable Digital Identity Will Drive Your Business &amp; Delight Customers”. If you are attending the event, come and <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/gartner-iam-summit-2022/" title="join us">join us</a>.</p>
 
<p></p>
 Where do we go from here? 
<p>Looking forward we see a continued growth plan, commercially and technically. The Katso platform proved the value of combining organisation and individual identity; now with LEIs we have the ability to deliver those proven savings globally. We see growing usage of Verifiable Credentials (VC) and we are working hard to ensure all the knowledge and business benefits we have realised in the classical identity domain can be transitioned to the upcoming VC based identity world.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this would be possible without the fantastic Ubisecure team. All aspects of our business are blessed with dedicated, hardworking individuals who together have shaped where we are today, and where we will be tomorrow.</p>
<p>We are in the midst of an exciting journey. It’s hard to predict what the next 20 years will hold instore for us, but we are looking to grow our teams.

<p>BEP2, BEP20, ERC20. These are what we call token standards, that is, a set of rules that a token must follow in order to be issued with the corresponding blockchain. For the 3 token standards mentioned:</p>



<p>BEP2 tokens are issued on the Binance Beacon Chain.</p>



<p>BEP20 tokens are issued on the BNB Chain.</p>



<p>ERC20 tokens are issued on the Ethereum Chain.</p>



<p>ShareToken exists across multiple blockchains, namely ShareLedger, Ethereum, and the Binance Beacon Chain. This has over the years given us and our users more flexibility, and to continue this trajectory we have decided to issue BEP20-SHR.</p>



<p><a href="https://sharering.network/shr-bep2-to-bep20-cross-chain-swap/">See article: $SHR – BEP2 to BEP20 Cross Chain Swap LIVE NOW!</a></p>



<p>Why BEP20 and BNB Chain?</p>



<p>BNB Chain was designed to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and as such BEP20 tokens would have increased versatility when interacting with the growing number of DApps across the chain.</p>



<p>Another key benefit of BEP20 is the gas fees, which is significantly cheaper in comparison to Ethereum. An average transaction using BEP20 tokens would likely cost no more than a few cents. In comparison, the average ERC20 token transfer gas fee was slightly over $100USD at the start of 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BEP20 transactions are also much faster when compared to ERC20 transactions. Though individual transaction speeds may vary depending on various factors, the average block verification times on BSC are 3 seconds, and close to 15 seconds for Ethereum (1.0).</p>



<p>What does this mean for ShareToken?</p>



<p>For one, those who hold BEP2 tokens are now able to swap their $SHR holdings into BEP20 via Binance Wallet. Once you obtain your BEP20, you have the option of going onto PancakeSwap to add liquidity into the SHR-BNB pool.</p>



<p>We are planning a cross chain swap direct between BEP20-SHR and SLP3-SHR. In the meantime we are waiting for the cross chain bridge approval for BEP20-SHR into ERC20-SHR. Once this bridge is live, users can then follow the <a href="https://sharering.network/sharering-swap-user-manual/">Swapping Manual instructions</a> to swap their ERC20-SHR into SLP3-SHR, and stake inside the ShareRing App.</p>

				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>It was a race toward the next big thing—except it felt like everyone was jogging in circles. All of the&nbsp; talk was about decentralized identity solving all the big online problems—verification, privacy, security—but where were the solutions? We had been talking and jogging for years and the finish line for the technology wasn’t getting closer.</p>
<p>It was time to up the pace, to lead a group of talented, like-minded individuals—and to get the technology to a stage where enterprises and organizations could start implementing working solutions. That was the sense of opportunity and need that drove the creation of Indicio two years ago.</p>
<p>There was a lot to do. It would have been overwhelming if we hadn’t broken it down into a roadmap of small steps, each building on the other, each extending the technology, each adding a community of builders, each bringing more customers and collaborators into the mix, and all feeding a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth.</p>
<p>The initial investment was conservative; but customer revenue was instant and scale was rapid. We focused on building solutions, starting with our customers’ simplest problems and use cases. And when those solutions worked, and our customers saw what the technology could deliver, they asked for more and to deliver new features; they began to think of new applications and opportunities.</p>
<p>The success of decentralized identity technology lay in each of our customers being successful. Each successful customer deployment was a victory, each advanced the technology, and each created new opportunities.</p>
<p>This was our strategy: the more we built solutions, the more customers we’d have, and the more they’d ask us to do. It worked; indeed, the investment community liked this strategy so much, our seed round ended up oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Actionable data now</p>
<p>Normally, a startup would use a seed round to launch a business; but we were already up and running: we had customers, products, and services. That’s what excited our investors: if we had come so far on so little, how much faster would we go with more?</p>
<p>Well, we’re excited too. We’ve completed what we set out to do two years ago: finish the technology’s foundation and create a full, open source ecosystem around it. You can issue, share, and verify data through verifiable digital credentials today. You can layer this on top of your existing identity and access management systems now.</p>
<p>We’ve also developed machine-readable governance to simplify managing complex information flows and governance processes offline and in ways that meet the needs of regulatory authorities. Governance for decentralized identity has often been a sticking point in the marketplace because it reads like a bigger problem than the problem decentralized identity is supposed to solve. Not any more.</p>
<p>Even the language around this technology has shifted to resonate with what the market understands and needs. It’s not just about engineers talking to engineers anymore; it’s about the value we create in trusted digital interaction, the efficiencies that come with verification, and the protean capacity of the communication protocols to manage this interaction in new, secure ways; it’s about actionable data and digital relationships.</p>
<p>In short, we’ve made it easy and cost-effective to begin a powerful process of digital transformation that creates trust. These flexible, customizable “Trusted Digital Ecosystems” can be deployed rapidly by being layered on top of your existing identity systems. This means creating digital transformation in weeks rather than years. They are easy—surprisingly easy—to use. They deliver value fast and set you up to manage the wider digital change of coming with web 3 and the spatial web.</p>
<p>Creating magic</p>
<p>In many ways, closing this seed round is the end of the beginning, we’ve warmed up for the real race and we’re going to run it fast. Because we now have the foundational interoperable framework to drive use and adoption of verifiable credentials and decentralized identity, we can start demonstrating the real power behind this technology to businesses, governments, and organizations.</p>
<p>History&nbsp; has shown that with a small set of robust, interoperable components, you can create magic. And that’s what we’re going to do with this seed investment.</p>
<p>Finally, none of this would be possible without a stellar team all pulling together.&nbsp; Our architects and engineers are at the top of their game because the business side is at the top of its game. It means our passion and expertise are in sync. It means we approach problems and build solutions holistically.</p>
<p>The result is that people like working with us. We make their needs ours, we give them everything, and together we get things done.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>Everybody wants the benefits of biometric authentication but nobody wants to pay the potential privacy price. What is the risk for individuals and society at large? To address these challenges Mike Kiser, Director, Strategy and Standards at SailPoint, is giving a keynote speech <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5044">New Face, Who Dis? Privacy vs Authentication in a World of Surveillance</a> on Tuesday, May 10, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Mike some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 Your talk describes a tension in how facial recognition is used: authentication vs privacy concerns. Can you give a high-level description of this split? 
<p>Sure. Facial recognition technology is like a lot of technology. It's neither moral nor immoral in and of itself, right? But it depends on how it's used. Really, there are two sides to this kind of technology that often depends on machine learning underpinning. It could provide a means of authentication, preferably on a locked-down secure device, maybe in a secure enclave. In that case, it gives kind of a one-to-one match of a person, to an identity and a pretty great form of biometric authentication and opens up new opportunities, new markets. And I'll talk about that in my session. The flip side is the one to end matching, and by that I mean more what people think of maybe when they think of facial recognition, picking an individual out of a crowd or identifying you if you're walking through a shopping center or an airport or some other kind of surveillance type of scenario, especially with some of the technology and the flaws underlying it, these can be problematic. And so there is tension between like a lot of technologies making things easier for us to use and more secure, and then having a side that, if it's misused or abused, can be dangerous, particularly for particular populations.</p>
 Various providers have halted or abandoned facial recognition research and products over the past few years. Does that mean that research into this technology is too problematic from an ethical perspective?&nbsp; 
<p>Like I said, technology is not necessarily moral or immoral, but it's how we use it. And like a lot of these new burgeoning rapidly developing ideas, we're kind of outstripping the thoughts about how it could be used. And so part of this is, you know, needing an IRB (Institutional review board) to oversight some of these projects. Another interesting split is a solution versus a toolset development. What I mean is if you are a vendor developing a solution for a particular use case like authentication, for instance, it can be somewhat... have some boundaries around it to make sure it's only doing what you intended it to do. If, however, you're providing technology, that's a different thing entirely because you're not really sure how that componentry will be embedded in other systems. And so there's an interesting usage and deployment ethics that are involved here as well. So I don't know if it's too problematic in and of itself, but like just about anything from facial recognition all the way back to say fire can be used for a good purpose or an evil purpose.</p>
 Do you believe that the public at large – particularly the younger generation – is actually concerned about their biometric privacy?&nbsp; 
<p>I think that yes, I think that a lot of people are concerned with their biometric privacy, including younger generations, who are much more accustomed to having their faces out there, their biometric information out there. I've done some research, I have a mobile app I've developed to kind of demonstrate some of the ways to potentially get around some of this with some adversarial research. And no one says, I don't want that. No, they all say, Yes, I expect to have a right to privacy independent almost of their actions. And so everyone wants it. But the question is, what's the cost and how are you going to define harm for individuals and for society at large? So those are kind of open-ended, huge questions that are worth discussing.</p>
 Is it "too late" for securing biometrics – particularly in a generation of "selfies" (aren't most people's photos and faces already out there?)&nbsp; 
<p>Yes and no. Oddly, in my research, I discovered that if you really want to hide yourself, the best way to do that is to actually put yourself in stock photography, because then you're everywhere and nowhere at the same time. People have a hard time figuring out who the real you is. That said, there are lots of photos out there with people tagged in it, and so there may be problems in hiding your facial biometric. But that said, there are still use cases that some of this adversarial research can address. Think about it. If you can identify someone and you can identify their location, that's also a dangerous use case. So if you think of stalkerware or people pursuing other people, it's not about foolproof prevention. Even if you didn't have any photos out there at all, some of these techniques you shouldn't rely on to always protect your biometrics, it's always a defensive depth chart approach. But the idea is more to keep the discussion going, show the path forward and advance the good uses of this technology and a community approach.</p>
 What is the one thing you would like people to take away from EIC? 
<p>The one thing I would like people to take away from EIC is that there's always something more to learn. Always some boundary to push, always some new tool, new approach that we haven't thought of. And the way to do that is in community because we learn from each other. And that gives us boundary checks on new ideas and new technology to make sure that we haven't forgotten some of the boundary cases or potential side effects that we wouldn't have thought of if we were acting on our own. So learn new things together.</p>

<p>AERGO is proud to announce the launch of the AERGO Venture Fund: a fund dedicated to dApp development!</p><p>“Start Together, Scale Together” is a fundamental ethos of the AERGO hybrid blockchain ecosystem. AERGO is proud to announce the AERGO Venture Fund whose vision and ambition is to fund projects which will directly build on&nbsp;AERGO!</p><p>Why Build On AERGO: The Opportunities For Developers</p><p>Developing on AERGO is both economically and developmentally practical. Developers enjoy the benefits of security, efficient scalability and a developer-friendly environment.</p><p>Developers are able to code more efficiently with the AERGO LUA Smart Contract Language. AERGO provides an optimized smart contract engine that enables lightning fast execution. Flexibility and performance is incumbent for the foundation and development of practical decentralized applications. AERGO’s multi-chain paradigm embodies this notion (AERGO is extremely scalable boasting 10,000 TPS at a miniscule cost of approximately $.001 per transaction) and as a result of its hybrid model, AERGO aims to scale private and public blockchains for projects of all sizes. AERGO also ensures maximum security for dApp development - boasting full access control, application security &amp; performance, data compliance and QoS, all of which are incumbent for dApp IT and enterprise solutions.</p><p>Through the launch of the $10M AERGO Venture Fund, the AERGO Foundation has solidified a comprehensive program that enables developers and entrepreneurs to acquire funding through the Foundation to develop their applications directly within the AERGO Ecosystem. This new fund absorbs the previously announced Defi Incubation Funding program, enabling us to expand our scope of investments to include GameFi, SocialFi, EduFi and other web3 opportunities.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.aergo.io/individual"> application process</a> is seamless. By submitting an application, developers seeking dApp funding can easily convey their desire for resources from the AERGO Foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-labs-funding-the-future-4d195c79858c">AERGO Labs: Funding The Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Many tasks and services are becoming digital these days. Across industries, more and more happens online, and automation continues to replace manual processes. This has special relevance in financial services. Automation of KYC through eKYC is not only making processes faster and safer, it is also improving the customer experience. As regulators trust more eKYC methods and permit further use, its potential continues to grow.</p>



 What is KYC? 



<p>A quick recap on KYC is helpful before we look at eKYC. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">“Know your Customer,“ or KYC</a>, is the process of verifying the identity of customers. It is about knowing and trusting the identity of a customer and their financial transactions. KYC protects the financial institution, its customers and wider markets from fraud, money laundering or other financial crime.</p>



<p>KYC takes place whilst onboarding a new customer, but it also has an important ongoing element throughout the customer relationship.</p>



 What is eKYC? 



<p>There has been a rapid increase in digitalization in most industries over recent years. <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/unpaywall/global-banking-transformation-innovation-competition-m1DYXcG1Qi">Banking and financial services have been at the forefront of this</a>, with more customer interaction and other processes moving online.</p>



<p>In general, eKYC refers to the digitalization and automated conception of KYC processes. It is the digital and remote transposition of traditional KYC processes – automated, online and paperless.</p>



 Transitioning to a digital KYC process 



<p>Many areas of banking and finance have become digitalized in recent years. More customers open accounts online, and more services are offered digitally. There is less need than ever before for customers to visit physical bank branches. The COVID pandemic has accelerated a transformation that was already well underway. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">study by McKinsey</a> suggests that companies are now seven years ahead in digital transformation post-pandemic.</p>



<p>This digitization of services applies to many different areas. Many of these seemed difficult to digitize not that long ago. Improvements in technology, artificial intelligence and connections have made so much more possible.</p>



<p>KYC is a leading one of these areas. Previously, to onboard a new customer and open an account, the customer would need to present physical identity documents and other evidence at a branch location. The first stages of eKYC saw this process move online.</p>



<p>Digitalization has gone even further since then. eKYC now refers to the full digitization of the KYC process. This includes not just paperless customer onboarding and checking of identity, but ongoing KYC and AML monitoring, and more advanced techniques such as digital signatures.</p>



<p>Regulation has been key to the expansion of eKYC. KYC is a highly regulated area, and financial institutions are limited by law and regulations in what process they can use. Techniques such as video and biometric verification, and the use of electronic signatures, are increasingly being accepted by regulators. Moreover, the acceptance shows the increased trust placed in eKYC and its ability to deliver more secure KYC.</p>



 The benefits of eKYC 



<p>Faster processes. Anything that becomes automated and digital usually becomes faster. This is a key benefit of KYC – onboarding and verification of customers with eKYC can take place in minutes rather than days or even weeks when handled manually.</p>



<p>Improved customer experience. Verifying customers in real-time <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ekyc-europe-regulation-customer-experience/">is great for the customer experience</a>. Financial institutions want customers to be able to access products and services as quickly as possible, and the customer wants an easy and friction-free experience, but still robust and secure. A <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2016/may/thomson-reuters-2016-know-your-customer-surveys.html">Thomas Reuters survey</a> found that 89% of corporate customers had a bad experience with KYC processes – to the point that 13% changed banks.</p>



<p>Improved conversion rates. Ultimately, faster and improved experiences lead to an increase in the conversion rate of customers – a vital measure for any financial institution.</p>



<p>More secure KYC. As well as fast, eKYC is also secure. It meets or exceeds the security of traditional manual processes and follows all relevant regulations, including AMLD and eIDAS. The increasing acceptance of eKYC by regulators is evidence of this.</p>



<p>Flexible and adaptable processes. As regulations change or technology improves, eKYC processes and workflows can be easily adapted. Many eKYC platforms are modular, allowing the simple integration of additional functionality.</p>



 What does an eKYC process look like? 



<p>The eKYC process is the digital transposition of the traditional manual KYC process. It is fast – with verification taking minutes rather than days or weeks. It is also seamless for the customer, with verification taking place in real-time. This keeps customers engaged and leads to a much-improved conversion rate.</p>



<p>Processes make use of several different technologies and verification methods. These will appear seamless to the customer, but be automated and well-built into the process. Techniques used include video-based identification, biometrics, and the reading of NFC cards.</p>



 What are the use cases of eKYC? 



<p>eKYC replaces standard KYC and can be used throughout the KYC process and the customer relationship. It is used to onboard customers, conduct due diligence, and carry out continued monitoring. This includes the following main use cases or eKYC methods:</p>



<p>Video KYC. This was one of the first eKYC methods to be developed and remains key. Customers can be verified by comparing live video with identity documents, with automatic verification now possible. Where likeness is unclear or regulators require it, manual video-based verification can be used.</p>



<p>Document verification. Capturing and verifying images of identity documents is another use case of eKYC. AI techniques are used to verify the authenticity of several different types of documents.</p>



<p>Digital due diligence. KYC procedures require a risk assessment to be carried out to determine the likelihood of a customer (both individual and corporate) being involved in financial crime or money laundering. While such checks would require lengthy manual searches and document checking in the past, much of this can now be automated through eKYC.</p>



<p>Fraud detection and ongoing monitoring. A final consideration for eKYC is its ongoing involvement in customer monitoring. The “three pillars of KYC” remind us that effective KYC requires not just an initial assessment of a customer, but ongoing monitoring throughout the relationship. With eKYC much of this can be automated. Accounts can be checked, and customers can be regularly monitored against watchlists, PEP and sanction lists.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we asked ourselves: does our design and style of imagery reflect what we do? The answer was no.</p><p>Dock is a pioneer in the revolutionary Web3 space. Since 2018, we've been building cutting-edge Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Credentials technology. We've been helping organizations innovate by making their documents, certificates, and credentials become digital, tamper-proof and instantly verifiable. Individuals can now truly own their most important documents and regain control over their data using our technology.</p><p>This didn't show in our design.</p><p>While Dock's development team prepared for a future of decentralization, our design and marketing team embarked on the journey of updating the company's brand.</p><p>The main challenge? Being in the futuristic Web3 space and needing to differentiate ourselves from other blockchain and crypto projects, but keeping in mind that most of our clients are SMEs and large organizations.</p> Imagery That Shouts Trust and Security <p><br>Dock’s primary colors are blue (#0063F7), white (#FFFFFF), and black (#000000).</p><p>Blue is primarily seen and used in corporate logos, making its business connection and more specifically, the technology industry. Blue is seen to reflect loyalty, trust, and stability making it the perfect addition to our primary color pallet. Blue reinforces the trust that people have in technologies linked to Web3 and decentralized identifiers. Unlike Web2 where trust is established solely with central organizations and DIDs built by them, Web3 is open-source where anyone can create their DIDs. Web3 creates an environment where people trust each other because of the code embedded in the protocol, the environment becomes trustless because users with their DIDs trust the protocol. Dock has built that protocol which anyone can trust. Blue stands for the unmatched loyalty to our community and users, and is reflected in the numerous platform updates we have to Dock Certs and the Dock Wallet App, and new feature releases. Taking on board feedback from our users, we ensure to update and maintain Dock Certs to the highest standard.</p><p>All logos hovering on our channels are comprised of black and white. The color black represents sophistication, security, and power. It’s a color that will never go out of style. White, in the business world, signifies a fresh new beginning. The two put together, make the perfect duo to represent Dock. Dock serves organizations into a new beginning in the Web3 world of decentralization and verifiable credentials. We aim to strengthen and future-proof the flow of credentials and data, empowering the individual with control of their own data.</p> A Designer’s Mind in Web3 <p><br>Our new imagery and website scream futuristic technologies - Web3 and Blockchain. The use of blue gradients, 3D styling, and textured backgrounds gives us a unique, vibrant, and suave appearance required for a Web3 pioneer. The new graphics give Dock a trendy new look and conveys creativity and innovation in our technology, which is exactly what Dock has set out to do.</p><p>Just as the Dock Certs product suite and Dock’s Wallet App were built with the community in mind, our new branding now demonstrates the expertise that lies within our team. </p><p>The world is rapidly changing and the old-fashioned transfer of data doesn’t fit the bill anymore. We’ve seen our technology advance organizations' data flows and now our branding will depict these advancements. This strategic redesign will reflect our position as leaders in the Web3, decentralized identities, and verifiable credentials space as we strive to cater Dock Certs and upcoming DID solutions to business and individual needs. </p><p>Our products are already capable of serving the largest of organizations to instantly issue verifiable credentials and we are preparing to complete the full circle where individuals can hold and manage these verifiable credentials on a secure wallet app, and finally providing the tools for individuals and organizations to verify these credentials. </p><p>With a strong product suite, we hope our new brand style encompasses the visual elements of leadership, loyalty, stability, and a company you can trust. Check out Dock’s new website and admire the new graphics.</p>

<p>As you’d be aware, the initial enthusiasm for the internet has been replaced with the sweeping realization that it has evolved in a way that is negative for its users. Big Data analytics technology is being used to commercialize knowledge about user behaviors, and influence and shape those behaviors. Big Tech companies use sophisticated analytic technology to analyze, predict, and manipulate user behavior while profiting at each step.&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/02/another-reason-to-use-mysudo-data-breaches-hit-record-high-in-2021/">Data breaches</a>&nbsp;disclose our personal information at a scale never seen before. We say it often: we are in the midst of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">privacy crisis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Big Tech companies can leverage many sources of information, but perhaps the most important is&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>. This is user-generated data harvested from users’ daily interactions with online sites and services. These interactions include every action users take – Facebook likes, Google searches, tweets, emails, text messages, photos, songs, videos, location and movement, and purchases. What’s more, this digital exhaust spans all aspects of a person’s life – family, community, professional and the deeply personal, such as medical and health – reducing privacy and anonymity right when a person might want them most. Interactions are captured, abstracted, aggregated, packaged, analyzed and sold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users are unwittingly even helping Big Tech to correlate their digital exhaust by providing unique personal identifiers every time they give their email address, phone number, or credit card details.</p>



 But there is a solution. 



 The Sudo is a privacy-protecting digital identity 



<p></p>



<p>Anonyome Labs envisions a world where personal data is secure and under the exclusive control of the individual; where people have the tools to create personalized identities that match the context and content they wish to share in particular environments. We believe being private doesn’t mean opting out of online services or hiding from the world. We empower people to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help protect personal information, Anonyome Labs created the concept of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, a digital identity that users can take into the world and use in place of their&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal information</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users have found it simple to use digital identities for many scenarios in their daily physical and digital lives. Some digital identities are long lived, while some are short lived. Some users have one digital identity, while others have many digital identities.</p>



Figure 1: The Sudo digital identity.



<p>Digital identities make it easy to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalize</a>&nbsp;activities that a user may engage in with different people, services, or applications under a specific identity. This puts the user’s information in their control because it cannot be easily correlated to either their personal identity or their other digital identities.</p>



<p>Digital identities are suitable across a vast array of online and offline scenarios such as dating, shopping, classifieds selling, social networking, and web searching.&nbsp;</p>



 Creating a privacy-protecting digital identity has some very important fundamental characteristics: 



<p></p>



  User Control (Always): Digital identities should be under the user’s control. The user should be able to create them, decide when to use them, and know when they have been used.  Situational Personas: A user should be able to have more than one digital identity. The user can decide at any time which digital identity they want to use.  Secure: Digital identities should be secure, not forgeable, and prevent impersonation by another user.  Easy Device Synchronization: Digital identities should be available to a user on multiple devices and be able to be backed up and restored.  Selectable Disclosure: A user should be able to control what data about their digital identity they disclose to a service.  Deletable: A user should be able to delete their digital identity at any time, including any information on its use and any information associated with it.&nbsp;  



 Through the&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo app</a>, and other partner apps, Anonyome Labs provides digital identities to everyday users so they can go out into the world with enhanced privacy and safety.&nbsp; 



<p><br><br>Next week, in part 2, we’ll explain how to use the Sudo Platform to deliver customer privacy solutions.</p>

 Case study: Gravity digital ID solution enables vulnerable migrants in Kenya to receive consistent healthcare services <p>Since 2019, Gravity has been providing decentralized identity solutions for the Dignified Identities for Cash assistance project (DIGID). The first phase was implemented by KRCS to meet the needs of the vulnerable populations without official IDs to receive cash assistance during covid-19. Over KES 2.1 million (19,000 dollars) were distributed to more than 300 households to address their essential needs.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/case-study-gravity-digital-id-solution-propels-dignified-identities-in-cash-programing-digid-e527bc55ae43">read more about&nbsp;DIGID</a></p><p>Starting this year, the second phase of the project (DIGID 2) is planned until July to apply the learnings on Digital IDs so far to the migration context in Uganda and Kenya. The aim is to further test the DIGID Platform within a new setting — that of enabling vulnerable migrants to receive healthcare services with the help of verifiable health credentials.</p> Digital ID solutions for healthcare services <p>Digital Identities have been increasingly used in the healthcare sector to record and share patients’ medical and treatment history and ensure consistent care. Inspired by <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Initiative</a>, Gravity’s digital ID solution empowers patients to securely store and share their medical data while providing reliable means for healthcare providers to identify and authenticate patients.</p><p>Gravity’s digital ID solution is based on decentralized identity and blockchain technology, it provides user-centric platforms for data sharing and identity verification, and multiple interfaces for various types of users(smartphone, feature phone, no phone) to achieve an inclusive digital ID ecosystem.</p><p>In the context of healthcare services, Gravity enables patients to create their digital wallets and health service providers to issue verifiable medical credentials to patients’ digital wallets. When the patients go to healthcare service points, their credentials, which contain medical data like treatment history, prescription, and disease records will be verified. The data that has been shared between patients and health service providers are verifiable, accurate, and streamlined.</p>technology structure<p>With Gravity, DIGID 2 is designed to promote dignity for migrants, balancing their needs to reveal critical information about themselves (due to fears or concerns about being identified) and also facilitate their access to healthcare services.</p> Medical credentials for migrants in Kenya: challenges and solutions <p>The digital ID solution for healthcare will be piloted in the Kakuma refugee camp and Kalobeyei integrated settlement. The Kakuma refugee camp is located in north-western Kenya, in the Turkana West sub-county, and was created in 1992 following the arrival of the “Lost Boys of Sudan”. Kalobeyei integrated settlement was created in 2015 to decongest the Kakuma refugee camp and promote self-resilience among the refugees and encourage integration between the host community and the refugees.</p><p>Health care services in Kakuma camp and Kalobeyei integrated settlement are free for both refugees and the host community. However, refugees face unique barriers to accessing free health care such as requirements for documentation before service, continuity of health care, the threat of harassment, and language barriers.</p><p>Currently, the KRCS in Kakuma and Kalobeyei manually processes the health records of patients making it difficult to keep the records of people and track their disease progress. Furthermore, no digital records are issued to patients as they move around even across borders, which affects their continuation of medical&nbsp;plans.</p><p>To overcome the obstacles, Gravity’s digital ID solution helps the KRCS to create digital medical credentials for patients, and enables healthcare providers to track and share their medical&nbsp;records.</p><p>To create a medical credential, KRCS will issue a digital wallet containing the patient’s medical data based on the manually-processed medical card that has been currently used. For patients who have a smartphone, they can directly view and manage their medical credentials on their wallet application; for patients who are equipped with feature phones, they can interact with their credentials via a dedicated USSD menu; for those who don’t have a phone, the medical credentials will be stored in a printed QR&nbsp;code.</p>manually-issued patient&nbsp;card<p>After receiving the medical credential, when the patient goes to a designated health facility operated by the KRCS, their medical credential will be verified. The verifier can check when testing was done, by whom, what medication was prescribed, and what steps for follow-up were recommended.</p><p>Each time when the medical testing or treatment was done, the information will be stored in the same digital wallet. In the future, more issuers and verifiers will be onboarded, for example, the International Rescue Committee, Kakuma Mission Hospital, Ministry of Health, and&nbsp;UNHCR.</p><p>Gravity’s digital ID solution for healthcare will change how patients fundamentally interact with health systems, clinics, pharmacies, medicine delivery networks, and public health organizations.</p><p>The benefits of digital medical credentials are:</p>  For patients: the quality of healthcare and experience will be dramatically improved, and the transferability of care regardless of physical location is also possible. More importantly, patients are able to control personal information data sharing with healthcare providers.  For healthcare providers: the efficiency in care planning and management will be improved, and patients’ data can be easier shared between different hospitals and clinics to keep medical&nbsp;records.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>How can organizations prepare to maintain data privacy while using a multi-tenant cloud, managed service providers, and distributed data center environments?&nbsp;Anil Bhandari from Arcon will elaborate on this challenge in his Keynote<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5034">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5035">Digital Identity and Privacy: Stories from the Frontline</a> on Tuesday, May 10, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Anil some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p></p>
 What can we expect to learn from your session on Digital Identity and Privacy: Stories from the Frontline? 
<p>Well, I think digital identities have.... let's just take a step back and look at identities which were in the sense like we used to use a passport or we used to use a driving license in the past. And then we had several other ways to identify a person and it could be you and sometimes your credentials, which is a user ID and passwords and you know what to access your applications. I think currently and in the very near future, this is all going to take the shape of a digital identity and probably you may have even different authors when you kind of get yourself on the online platforms, for example, be it Facebook's or be it Google's or be it LinkedIn's. And you may even completely show a different emotion when you're online, considering the fact that you're doing something there. But you may be a completely different person when you're offline or whatever. So what I'm trying to say is that it's a very... I guess the world will have to look at identity very differently in the very near future. And I think just for the sake of calling them, let's call them digital identities, and these digital identities are, of course, connected to something that you're doing, something that you are writing, something that you exposing, something's an emotion, some things are news or you're creating something or you're logging on and you're doing something for your organization, right? So it could be privacy, it could be confidentiality and so many other things put together, right? So I think it's important for us to identify and understand the linkages between a digital author that a person has, whether they exist within an organization, outside an organization, to the content or the data that you create eventually, which would lead to the next question of, you know, what do you do in terms of privacy? Where do you put those controls if at all required? We don't even know if those controls are required in today's world. So what the session would essentially try and cover is some fundamentals and ideas around how do you link them and some stories around, what kind of digital identities and what kind of content could be created, and what has happened to this going forward or what you're seeing today in the market right? So it could be, well, fake news, for example, a very important element in today's time when you see the world being chaotic and especially in Europe, when so many things are happening around, you know, like what is happening around the world. So I think a very important conference. I think EIC continues to be one of the mainstays in Europe when we discuss identities. And I've had the pleasure of being there in the conference for several years now, three or four at least. So I think this topic would be very interesting in terms of some stories that we'll bring to the table and how do you connect and what do you do and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How is the rapid digitization of businesses and utilization of cloud capabilities relevant to digital identities and privacy? 
<p>Well, so all that you did in this physical world before is now shifted to digital assets, which are digital identities, which do not have a home, unfortunately, right? You have got a nice window behind you and a nice house that you're in. Literally, we're all in the cloud today. In fact, almost all critical assets that you have even today is in the cloud. So, for example, I'm not sure if you hold any investments, but if you do, they all happen to be stored somewhere in the cloud or a provider is storing it somewhere, that you have no idea about. Equity shares are in demat form, so they are in digital format. Currencies are likely to be more and more in digital formats. Now, with every piece of technology that you use people are trying to understand and see whether they could use it in the cloud because nobody wants to own assets today. Access versus ownership is one of the most important models, which has come upon the world, right? So everybody wants to access something. They don't want to own it. And with that reality in mind, the cloud is kind of become all-pervasive and likely to see more and more, which means data is likely to be all across different locations, which sometimes you may not even know where it's located. So a connection between identity, privacy, and confidentiality of, I don't know, data is something like water, right? It just keeps flowing and it creates a new set of data. Right. And it takes a different shape and then it breaks itself into multiple pieces. And it's all across the world, which is in the cloud. How do you even reconstruct it, how do you make a sense of it? Forget about protecting it, right? So I think data and cloud become one very critical element for one to look at. And I have no idea how the world is going to look at it in the future. But I think these thoughts are really interesting to discuss and maybe some ideas around what can one do.</p>
<p></p>
 What is the interaction between digital identities and privacy issues and why is it important? 
<p>Well, like I was trying to establish the fact that digital identities are all-pervasive, our data kind of moves with your thoughts and what you construct and how you break them. These storages are all across the world. So the final question would be, and with the GDPR and the like and the compliance is coming up where the government wants to protect your data. At the same time, the government wants all your data, right? So there is this huge governance that somebody puts up where they kind of literally take every piece of data that you have at the same time that is this government wanting to protect. And every government in the world wants to protect the data and make sure that the data does not go out. And they put huge compliances and fines around organizations wanting to do that. And we have this huge set of people trying to innovate tools and technologies and solutions, are trying to protect your machines, trying to protect data on your machines. If one is not able to appropriately link what you have and what meaning does that data have to you. I don't know how to put this, but let's put it this way. I think data security is likely to be contextual in the near future. So for example, you have my telephone number, you have my email ID and you have my address because I happen to be your client, for example, right? Because you've reached out and you happen to be a client and we happen to have a business relationship. Or somebody else has my data, which is the same, which is an email address, telephone number, but the context in which he holds the data and the context in which you hold the data are completely different. Your organization or yourself or your need to protect the data, but some other organization or person may not need to protect the data, right? because he holds it in a different context. So what I'm saying is, while I don't know whether this example would be the best, what I'm saying is that security in the future is no longer to protect a person. It's no longer to protect a machine. It would all be trying to protect the data in the context that which you hold the data, right? So data security is likely to be contextual data security in the future. And I think as we progress further, I'm sure all tools and technologies would start to deep dive and try and reconstruct what you're doing, how you're doing, where to protect, how to protect. And also you're spending millions and billions of dollars trying to protect because you tried to put controls everywhere, identity controls, standard controls for everybody. Machine controls. You've got a standard antivirus, everybody. You've got malware, everybody. All right. But I don't think this is how it's likely to be in the near future, which means one would need to now start understanding the formats, the frameworks, and understand digital assets in the context in which excoriate and finally understand the data and the context in which it's created. So I think contextual data security would become one mainstay in the future.</p>

 What is Elasticsearch? 

<p>At its core, Elasticsearch is a NoSQL analytics database with an extensive JSON-centric REST API used for querying and indexing data. It’s built in Java, on top of <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a>, providing a scalable and performant search experience.</p>

<p>Over time, Elasticsearch and its ecosystem have evolved dramatically, turning into a set of software components called the Elastic Stack (also known as ELK Stack). This stack includes the Elasticsearch service as the core, Kibana for data visualization and management, and Logstash for processing and indexing data into Elasticsearch.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch and the accompanying Elastic Stack provide solutions for a growing number of use cases, such as the following:</p>
 
   Search services: Whether it’s inside an app or website or across an enterprise’s internal data sets, Elasticsearch can power all kinds of search experiences. 
   Data analytics: Because of its near-real-time data querying and easy data injection, Elasticsearch is suitable for analyzing data from system logs or business operations. 
   Monitoring: Apart from analytics, Elasticsearch is also suitable for all kinds of monitoring, serving as a central hub for different data sources. 
 

 Integrating Elasticsearch with Express 

<p>Before getting started with the app, you’ll first want to ensure you have the following software installed:</p>
 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> together with NPM (v12.2.0 or newer) 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> 
 

 Backend setup 

<p>Next, create a new directory for the projects and two folders inside it: frontend and backend. Inside the backend folder, set up a new Express app with the following commands:</p>

   <code>npm init -y
npm install express body-parser express-async-errors express-openid-connect dotenv @elastic/elasticsearch
</code>   

<p>Installed dependencies are as follows:</p>
 
   <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>: The Node.js framework 
   <a href="http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser.html">Body parser</a>: Express middleware for parsing incoming request’s bodies 
   <a href="https://github.com/davidbanham/express-async-errors">Express async errors</a>: Module for improved handling of <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> errors in Express routes 
   <a href="https://github.com/auth0/express-openid-connect">Express OpenID Connect</a>: Express middleware wrapper around <a href="https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client">openid-client</a> 
   <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv">Dotenv</a>: Module for loading <code>.env</code> files 
   Elasticsearch Node.js client: Simplifies the use of the Elasticsearch REST API in Node.js 
 

 Elastic Cloud setup 

<p>When it comes to the setup, Elasticsearch provides two primary options: self-managed or Elastic Cloud. This tutorial will guide you through the setup process for the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/cloud/">Elastic Cloud trial</a>.</p>

<p>Remember that you can always switch to a self-hosted Elasticsearch instance without much effort. For reference, here’s the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html">official guide to installing Elasticsearch on Docker</a>.</p>

<p>To get started, create a new Elastic Cloud account or log in to an existing one.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Inside the dashboard, click Start your free trial and configure a new deployment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the resulting deployment credentials and put them inside the .elastic.env file inside the backend folder:</p>

   <code>ELASTIC_USERNAME="your-username"
ELASTIC_PASSWORD="your-password"
</code>   

<p>The last detail you need is your deployment’s Cloud ID. To get that, return to your dashboard and go to the deployment settings. You can access the settings by clicking on the cog next to the deployment name under the Elasticsearch Service section.</p>

<p></p>

<p>From there, copy the Cloud ID and paste it into the .elastic.env file as <code>ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID</code>:</p>

   <code>ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID="your-cloud-id"
ELASTIC_USERNAME="your-username"
ELASTIC_PASSWORD="your-password"
</code>   

 Creating the Elasticsearch index 

<p>With the Elastic Cloud credentials in place, create an elastic-client.js file where you’ll initialize the Elasticsearch Node.js client:</p>

   <code>// backend/elastic-client.js
const { Client } = require("@elastic/elasticsearch");

require("dotenv").config({ path: ".elastic.env" });

const elasticClient = new Client({
  cloud: {
    id: process.env.ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID,
  },
  auth: {
    username: process.env.ELASTIC_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.ELASTIC_PASSWORD,
  },
});

module.exports = elasticClient;
</code>   

<p>The script loads the environment variables with <code>dotenv</code> and initializes the client through dedicated <code>cloud</code> and <code>auth</code> properties in its config object.</p>

<p>The initiated client is then exported for use in other files. This includes create-index.js, in which a new posts index for storing sample blog post data is created:</p>

   <code>// backend/create-index.js
const elasticClient = require("./elastic-client");

const createIndex = async (indexName) =&gt; {
  await elasticClient.indices.create({ index: indexName });
  console.log("Index created");
};

createIndex("posts");
</code>   

<p>Running the script with node create-index.js will initiate the index and prepare Elasticsearch for the next steps.</p>

 Creating Express routes 

<p>Start integrating Elasticsearch with Express by creating an index.js file, where you’ll initialize a new Express app:</p>

   <code>// backend/index.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const elasticClient = require("./elastic-client");
require("express-async-errors");

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Express routes

app.listen(8080);
</code>   

<p>The JSON body-parser parses incoming JSON request bodies, while <code>express-async-errors</code> patches Express v4 to automatically handle errors in async code.</p>

<p>The routes themselves will serve as a controlled proxy for the calls to the Elasticsearch REST API. The methods from the Elasticsearch client used here are <code>index()</code>, <code>delete()</code> and <code>search()</code>:</p>

   <code>// ...
app.get("/", (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.redirect("http://localhost:3000/");
});
app.post("/create-post", async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await elasticClient.index({
    index: "posts",
    document: {
      title: req.body.title,
      author: req.body.author,
      content: req.body.content,
    },
  });

  res.send(result);
});
app.delete("/remove-post", async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await elasticClient.delete({
    index: "posts",
    id: req.query.id,
  });

  res.json(result);
});
app.get("/search", async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await elasticClient.search({
    index: "posts",
    query: { fuzzy: { title: req.query.query } },
  });

  res.json(result);
});
app.get("/posts", async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await elasticClient.search({
    index: "posts",
    query: { match_all: {} },
  });

  res.send(result);
});
// ...
</code>   

<p>To operate on the index’s data, the <code>index()</code> method can be used to insert documents, while <code>delete()</code> can remove a document matching a provided ID. Finally, <code>search()</code> is one of the most important and versatile methods of the client, providing tons of options for querying the data.</p>

<p>For this example, only <code>fuzzy</code> matching (matching the term closely rather than exactly to the query) and <code>match_all</code> query parameters are used to search for blog posts by their titles and return all blog posts from the index.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that the root route (<code>/</code>) redirects to port <code>3000</code>—that’s where the frontend will be located.</p>

 Frontend setup 

<p>To see how this backend setup integrates with a modern frontend, let’s create a new React app powered by <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>.</p>

<p>To set up a new Vite project from a template, install necessary dependencies and start the development server. Use the following commands to do so in the project root folder:</p>

   <code>npm create vite frontend -- --template react
cd frontend
npm install
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @faker-js/faker @mui/icons-material @mui/x-data-grid axios
npm run dev
</code>   

<p>The dependencies include the following:</p>
 
   <a href="https://mui.com/">MUI</a>: React component framework with accompanying libraries and submodules like icons and data-grid component 
   <a href="https://fakerjs.dev/">Faker</a>: Library to quickly generate fake data for development and testing purposes 
   <a href="https://axios-http.com">Axios</a>: Isomorphic (can run in both Node.js and browsers with the same codebase) HTTP client 
 

<p>To complete the setup, make sure to link the Roboto font inside the index.html file, <a href="https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/#roboto-font">as recommended by MUI</a>:</p>

   <code>&lt;link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&amp;display=swap"
/&gt;
</code>   

<p>Additionally, to make the development and integration with the backend smooth (without unnecessary <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a> issues), make sure to set up Vite proxy from the vite.config.js file:</p>

   <code>import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: "http://localhost:8080",
        rewrite: (path) =&gt; path.replace(/^\/api/, ""),
      },
    },
  },
});
</code>   

<p>With the above configuration, all requests to the Vite development server’s <code>/api</code> route will be redirected to the back-end server, allowing access to both from the same host.</p>

 Building the UI 

<p>While not the primary focus of this tutorial, thanks to MUI, it’s easy to make a good-looking frontend without much effort.</p>

<p>The whole UI will fit into the src/App.jsx file, with only a few changes required to the src/main.jsx file:</p>

   <code>// src/main.jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
    &lt;App /&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
</code>   

<p>The added <code>&lt;CssBaseline/&gt;</code> component will apply an MUI-specific CSS reset stylesheet.</p>

<p>Inside App.jsx, the <code>&lt;App/&gt;</code> component will be at the center of the whole UI, managing the state and core components. This component sets up the state for holding the search query, current selection, and all the posts, while also building the UI with help of MUI components.</p>

   <code>import {
  AppBar,
  Box,
  Container,
  Button,
  IconButton,
  InputAdornment,
  TextField,
  Toolbar,
} from "@mui/material";
import { useState } from "react";
import { DataGrid } from "@mui/x-data-grid";
import { Add, Search, Delete } from "@mui/icons-material";
import axios from "axios";
import faker from "@faker-js/faker";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const api = {
    // ...
};
const columns = [
  {
    field: "title",
    headerName: "Title",
    flex: 2,
    minWidth: 150,
  },
  {
    field: "author",
    headerName: "Author",
    flex: 1,
    minWidth: 150,
  },
  {
    field: "content",
    headerName: "Content",
    flex: 1,
    minWidth: 150,
  },
];
const TopMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  // ...
};
const EditMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  // ...
};
const App = () =&gt; {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState([]);
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const addPost = async () =&gt; {
    // ...
  };
  const removePosts = async (removedIds) =&gt; {
    // ...
  };
  const search = async () =&gt; {
    //...
  };

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // ...
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;TopMenu /&gt;
      &lt;Container maxWidth="md"&gt;
        &lt;TextField
          placeholder="Search"
          fullWidth
          value={query}
          onInput={(event) =&gt; setQuery(event.target.value)}
          InputProps={{
            startAdornment: (
              &lt;InputAdornment sx={{ pr: 1.5 }} position="start"&gt;
                &lt;IconButton onClick={search}&gt;
                  &lt;Search /&gt;
                &lt;/IconButton&gt;
              &lt;/InputAdornment&gt;
            ),
          }}
        &gt;&lt;/TextField&gt;
        &lt;EditMenu
          selection={selection}
          addPost={addPost}
          removePosts={removePosts}
        /&gt;
        &lt;div style={{ width: "100%" }}&gt;
          &lt;DataGrid
            autoHeight
            rows={posts}
            columns={columns}
            pageSize={100}
            checkboxSelection
            onSelectionModelChange={(model) =&gt; setSelection(model)}
            selectionModel={selection}
          /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
};

export default App;
</code>   

<p>The app consists of a search bar, editing menu, and a table to display and manage the data. You can see the structure for API integration in the form of the <code>api</code> object, table configuration for the incoming data in the <code>columns</code>, and multiple state management functions right inside the <code>&lt;App/&gt;</code> component.</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;TopMenu/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;EditMenu/&gt;</code> components will serve as the app bar and data-edit controls, respectively. Where necessary, they’ll use the state and control methods provided through props to control the state.</p>

   <code>// ...
const TopMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1, mb: 1 }}&gt;
      &lt;AppBar position="static"&gt;
        &lt;Toolbar /&gt;
      &lt;/AppBar&gt;
    &lt;/Box&gt;
  );
};
const EditMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Button
        startIcon={&lt;Add /&gt;}
        variant="contained"
        sx={{ my: 1, mr: 1 }}
        onClick={props.addPost}
      &gt;
        Add
      &lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;Button
        startIcon={&lt;Delete /&gt;}
        variant="contained"
        disabled={!props.selection.length}
        sx={{ my: 1, mr: 1 }}
        onClick={() =&gt; props.removePosts(props.selection)}
      &gt;
        Remove
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
// ...
</code>   

<p>With this setup, the app will look like this:</p>

<p></p>

 Integrating the frontend with the backend 

<p>To integrate the app with the backend, wrap the Axios API requests into reusable methods:</p>

   <code>// ...
const api = {
  async addPost(post) {
    const response = await axios.post("/api/create-post", post);

    return response.data;
  },
  async removePost(id) {
    const response = await axios.delete(`/api/remove-post?id=${id}`);

    return response.data;
  },
  async search(query) {
    const response = await axios.get(`/api/search?query=${query}`);

    return response.data;
  },
  async getAllPosts() {
    const response = await axios.get("/api/posts");

    return response.data;
  },
  async isAuthenticated() {
    const response = await axios.get("/api/is-authenticated");

    return response.data;
  },
};
// ...
</code>   

<p>Now, inside the main <code>&lt;App/&gt;</code> component, create the functions to connect the API with the state:</p>

   <code>// ...
const addPost = async () =&gt; {
  const post = {
    title: faker.lorem.lines(1),
    content: faker.lorem.paragraphs(3),
    author: faker.name.findName(),
  };
  const response = await api.addPost(post);
  setPosts([...posts, { ...post, id: response._id }]);
};
const removePosts = async (removedIds) =&gt; {
  setPosts(posts.filter((post) =&gt; !removedIds.includes(post.id)));
  await Promise.all(removedIds.map((id) =&gt; api.removePost(id)));
};
const search = async () =&gt; {
  const response = await api.search(query);

  setSelection(
    response.hits.hits.map((hit) =&gt; {
      return hit._id;
    })
  );
};
// ...
</code>   

<p>Here, the <code>addPost()</code> function creates a new post using the data from Faker.js and updates it both on the frontend and the backend. A similar process happens in <code>removePosts()</code>, which, given an array of post IDs, removes the related data on both ends. Finally, <code>search()</code> sends a query to the backend and selects the matching results in the table.</p>

<p>To load the initial data on the component mount, you’ll have to use the <code>useEffect()</code> hook, which will fetch the posts and update the view accordingly:</p>

   <code>// ...
useEffect(() =&gt; {
  loadUser().then((authenticated) =&gt; {
    if (authenticated) {
      api.getAllPosts().then((response) =&gt; {
        setPosts(
          response.hits.hits.map((hit) =&gt; ({
            id: hit._id,
            ...hit._source,
          }))
        );
      });
    }
  });
}, []);
// ...

<p>Now, ensure both your backend and frontend servers are running, and check out all the features of your app!</p>

<p></p>

 Securing data access with Okta 

<p>While the app is working, it’s completely exposed to unauthorized access, which can be harmful to your data, code, and infrastructure as a whole. To fix that, you can use <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta</a>.</p>

<p>The entire process is quite simple and requires only a few changes on both ends of the app.</p>

 Securing the backend 

<p>Inside the backend folder, use the Okta CLI to create an .okta.env file with all required credentials.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Other. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080/callback</code> and use <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>With that done, load the env file inside index.js and initiate <code>express-openid-connect</code> middleware:</p>

   <code>const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const elasticClient = require("./elastic-client");
const { auth, requiresAuth } = require("express-openid-connect");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".okta.env" });
require("express-async-errors");

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(
  auth({
    issuerBaseURL: process.env.OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER,
    clientID: process.env.OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET,
    secret: process.env.OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET,
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8080",
    idpLogout: true,
    authRequired: false,
    authorizationParams: {
      scope: "openid profile",
      response_type: "code",
    },
  })
);
// ...
</code>   

<p>The middleware not only secures the endpoints but also handles the callback and creates new <code>/login</code> and <code>/logout</code> routes for the configured 
 OpenID provider — we’re using Okta.</p>

<p>By setting <code>authRequired</code> to <code>false</code>, you get to selectively choose which endpoints to secure. In this case, this will include all endpoints related to Elasticsearch:</p>

   <code>// ...
const securedRouter = express.Router();

securedRouter.use(requiresAuth());
securedRouter.post("/create-post", async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await elasticClient.index({
    index: "posts",
    document: {
      title: req.body.title,
      author: req.body.author,
      content: req.body.content,
    },
  });

  res.send(result);
});

// Other routes

app.use(securedRouter);
// ...
</code>   

<p>For simplicity, a separate, secured router is used. All you have to do is move the routes you want to secure to that router.</p>

<p>Lastly, you should create an unsecured <code>/is-authenticated</code> route for the frontend to contact when making initial requests:</p>

   <code>// ...
app.get("/is-authenticated", (req, res) =&gt; {
  const authenticated = req.oidc.isAuthenticated();
  if (authenticated) {
    res.json({
      authenticated,
      username: req.oidc.user.name,
    });
  } else {
    res.json({ authenticated: false });
  }
});
// ...
</code>   

<p>Additionally, the endpoint returns the username of the authorized user.</p>

 Integrating the frontend 

<p>Inside the src/App.jsx file on the frontend, add the <code>isAuthenticated()</code> method to the <code>api</code> object:</p>

   <code>// ...
const api = {
  // ...
  async isAuthenticated() {
    const response = await axios.get("/api/is-authenticated");

    return response.data;
  },
};
// ...
</code>   

<p>Then, inside the <code>&lt;App/&gt;</code> component, check if the user is authenticated and, if so, load his username:</p>

   <code>// ...
const App = () =&gt; {
  // ...
  const [username, setUsername] = useState("");
  // ...
  const loadUser = async () =&gt; {
    const response = await api.isAuthenticated();

    console.log(response);
    if (response.authenticated) {
      setUsername(response.username);
      return true;
    }

    return false;
  };

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    loadUser().then((authenticated) =&gt; {
      if (authenticated) {
        api.getAllPosts().then((response) =&gt; {
          setPosts(
            response.hits.hits.map((hit) =&gt; ({
              id: hit._id,
              ...hit._source,
            }))
          );
        });
      }
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;TopMenu username={username} /&gt;
      &lt;Container maxWidth="md"&gt;
        {/* ... */}
        &lt;EditMenu
          username={username}
          selection={selection}
          addPost={addPost}
          removePosts={removePosts}
        /&gt;
        {/* ... */}
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
};
// ...
</code>   

<p>Finally, in the menus, disable editing and show the LOGIN button in the app bar. If the user is logged in, show the LOGOUT button instead alongside his username:</p>

   <code>const TopMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1, mb: 1 }}&gt;
      &lt;AppBar position="static"&gt;
        &lt;Toolbar&gt;
          &lt;div style={{ flex: 1 }}&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          {props.username ? (
            &lt;&gt;
              &lt;span&gt;{props.username}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;Button color="inherit" href="/api/logout"&gt;
                LOGOUT
              &lt;/Button&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
          ) : (
            &lt;Button color="inherit" href="/api/login"&gt;
              Login
            &lt;/Button&gt;
          )}
        &lt;/Toolbar&gt;
      &lt;/AppBar&gt;
    &lt;/Box&gt;
  );
};
const EditMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Button
        startIcon={&lt;Add /&gt;}
        variant="contained"
        sx={{ my: 1, mr: 1 }}
        onClick={props.addPost}
        disabled={!props.username}
      &gt;
        ADD
      &lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;Button
        startIcon={&lt;Delete /&gt;}
        variant="contained"
        disabled={!props.username || !props.selection.length}
        sx={{ my: 1, mr: 1 }}
        onClick={() =&gt; props.removePosts(props.selection)}
      &gt;
        REMOVE
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
</code>   

<p>With this done, the app is now fully secured with Okta, both on the frontend and the backend!</p>

<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>The internet is evolving as rapidly as technology develops, leading to a lot of talk lately about Web3 and the Metaverse. These developments are not just about a better quality of immersive gaming, they also point to a bigger shift in the way we all live and do business. While it may take years for this new era to reach maturity, now is the time to consider how it is developing and what kind of a future we want to be part of creating.</p> Web3 <p>Web3 has been described as the next generation of the internet — a fairer, decentralized version where big corporations lose their monopolistic hold on our data. Blockchain technology is a major contribution to this development, due to its ability to facilitate decentralization and enable the transfer of data and crypto tokens safely without having to trust in an individual or centralized organization.</p><p>While Web3 has been criticized in some quarters as a shift away from the free internet, it should rather be seen as a shift away from our current internet model where users are the product, with their data collected and monetized by service providers.</p> The Metaverse <p>The Metaverse has many definitions. In its simplest form a Metaverse can be understood as a digital universe running alongside our physical universe. While often associated with gaming and 3D technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), a Metaverse can also be in 2D, like our internet or platforms that offer a way to create a second life in a digital world. These Metaverses have many of the features of our physical world. We can exist, we can interact and communicate with others, we can create objects of value, and we can own and trade things there. Therefore, these digital worlds can become a kind of&nbsp;reality.</p> Making the Connection <p>But as the number of Metaverses grow, so do the challenges. How do you connect your individual identity, your “me”, in the physical universe with your identity in the Metaverse? How can you move and take things with you from one Metaverse – platform, game, or service – to another? When a user connects their real-life personality and bank account to their avatar, participates in a game, and buys or wins land or accessories, how do they manage their ownership of these goods? How can digital identity and continuation of ownership extend across Metaverses?</p> Identity in the Metaverse <p>Solutions to these challenges can be found using blockchain technology. Identity in the Metaverse needs to be linked to the real-life person using it. A game in the Metaverse is more than a game. It also involves in-game purchases, so as a user, you need money, and you need to store your purchases somewhere. As a player you can build a reputation and want to bring that reputation with you to other games and platforms. You may not need to know your opponent’s real name or address, but you do need to be able to identify and trust who you’re talking to, playing against, or paying for a&nbsp;service.</p><p>Practically, there’s also a need to provide a way for the people who build the software to earn money. And virtual things in the virtual world connect to the real world. Already, the technology exists for brands in the real world to advertise in the Metaverse. Virtual billboards are owned by real people who have part-ownership of this virtual billboard, can vote on what brands get to advertise, and can receive part of the profits from this advertising. This level of complexity requires new solutions.</p> Blockchain Solutions <p>This is the point we are at now, and Web3 infrastructure makes this possible safely. While the current version of the internet runs on advertising, in the Metaverse, work and time are valued. The principles and structures of the real world apply: If I can create something that someone wants to own, I can create a business. Anyone can start producing digital goods and data, and getting paid for it. Work, even on a small scale, is valued and rewarded.</p><p>On a larger scale, blockchain technology also provides the ability to create Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), online organizations or companies in a virtual world that can connect to the real world. In a DAO, no one person takes responsibility or ownership, but there are rules that need to be followed. Although early DAOs failed with very public consequences – the most famous example lost the equivalent of around US$50 million worth of funding in a hack – with subsequent improvements in the technology, DAOs of the future can be created to be truly decentralized and secure, creating a whole new way of working. Anyone can work anywhere, and be paid in digital tokens that can be easily converted into their local currency.</p><p>But how do we avoid the mistakes made in Web2, where a few big corporations often have the monopoly on business and hold the data of many? Although blockchain has the potential for decentralization, it does not inherently give a guarantee of decentralization, as it can also be used to create private&nbsp;systems.</p><p>All technology is as good or bad as its users. Although blockchain has often been criticized by mainstream sources as something that is used by criminals to hide their ill-gotten gains, the reality is that changes to a blockchain are generally very transparent, leaving a trail that is easy to follow once the initial address is&nbsp;known.</p><p>Equally, while data recorded on the blockchain can be changed, the fact that a change was made is evident. Data can be stored privately or publicly on the blockchain. Data can be distributed and stored in the cloud across several locations using services such as IPFS (the Interplanetary File System) or Filecoin. Data may be simply attested on the blockchain to say it exists or belongs to the specified owner, with only a record of the data or its owner rather than the data itself being recorded. Like everything else in life, the blockchain and its services are not black and white, and the need to do your own research (DYOR) and establish the decentralization of services you use is highly recommended.</p><p>Identity in the Metaverse is too important to be left to centralized companies. That’s where protocols like KILT come&nbsp;in.</p> KILT Protocol <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> was built to counter monopolies and their poor handling of user data, specifically addressing the challenges of digital identity in Web3. Run using online transparent governance by the community of token holders, KILT is a decentralized network that uses blockchain.</p><p>In the real world, identity is made up of an identifier – for example, your name – that is linked to credentials, such as your passport, driving license, diploma, skills, etc. All these things together make up who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>KILT replicates this in the digital world. Digital identity is built around a decentralized identifier – unique string of numbers and letters specific to you – and any credentials you choose to add to this identity. Credentials in the physical world can be recreated in digital form and remain with you, not with an external company, until you choose to show&nbsp;them.</p><p>Nothing is stored on the blockchain except a proof that the credentials are still valid. Using this method means that companies can, for example, do KYC (Know Your Customer) checks without needing to store data, rather than creating centralized silos that are a honeypot for hackers. Your identity belongs to you, and no external service can deny you access to your credentials.</p><p>This is the kind of decentralized identity service that is essential for the Metaverse.</p> The Way&nbsp;Forward <p>The changes the Metaverse brings could have as big an impact on our lives as the development of the smartphone. While these changes can have many benefits, they also come with the risk of repeating the mistakes of the past, handing control of our data and digital freedom to large corporations. These corporations potentially end up having even more power over us than our government does. Thanks to blockchain technology, we now have the tools to avoid recreating these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Decentralization is essential for the Metaverse and has the ability to return the power to us, the users of the internet. As we move into this new era, it would serve us well to make informed choices, starting&nbsp;now.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/moving-through-the-metaverse-the-path-of-decentralization-6a3e7df739a">Moving Through the Metaverse: The Path of Decentralization</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A happy customer is a repeat customer. You might have heard that phrase a lot and for a good reason. An eCommerce business cannot survive without clients who are willing to pay frequently.</p><p>While new customers are hard to acquire and often lead to increased marketing costs, current customers can significantly boost your sales process and optimize your marketing strategy. What is customer retention and how does it affect your finances? Let’s find&nbsp;out.</p> What is Customer Retention? <p>Customer retention is an important part of customer relationship management, and achieving it requires more than just keeping customers happy. It is key to any business, but it can be especially important for eCommerce businesses. As customer retention goes up, so does the lifetime value of your customer — but this only happens when you have excellent customer service. So, how can you retain customers and what are the benefits of their loyalty? Let’s&nbsp;see.</p> Why is Customer Retention Important? <p>If you want to lay your success on customer loyalty and build a thriving brand, then it’s critical to keep your customers happy. The best way for businesses to get better results is by listening to their feedback and addressing their concerns as soon as possible. Customer retention isn’t just about retaining your customers — it’s about knowing what they want and anticipating their&nbsp;needs.</p> 1. Reduced Marketing Costs <p>Without a doubt, keeping your existing customers will bring a lot of value to the company. Instead of spending a fortune to acquire new customers, which isn’t guaranteed, you can decrease your marketing spending and allocate finances to other departments.</p><p>Retaining your existing clients is not just about saving a critical budget. And it also contributes to a company’s growth and raises its credibility in the eyes of other consumers.</p> 2. Word of Mouth Marketing <p>We’ve all heard about the most legacy way to attract more customers — by word of mouth marketing. Customers make up your best advocates or your harshest critics, and you can decide who they will be by how you treat&nbsp;them.</p><p>When you take care of customers, they’ll want to tell everyone about your service. If you take advantage of this power and use this capability to maintain a positive brand image, you’re set up for&nbsp;success.</p> 3. Increased Revenue <p>You’ve heard about the Pareto principle. 80% of the revenue comes from 20% of your clients. While it’s not 100% right, it’s very close to the truth, believe me. Loyal customers tend to spend a lot more than new customers, and the customer lifetime value can reach up to tenfold the first&nbsp;order.</p><p>Of course, to lift your revenue, you need to have all hands on deck — from the delivery guy to the customer service team, marketing department, and everyone in the&nbsp;chain.</p> How to Choose the Best Customer Retention Tool <p>There are many customer retention tools on the market. But there should be a way to differentiate the best from the good&nbsp;ones.</p> Find your customers’ needs <p>In the early stages of your business, the one thing you need to keep working on is understanding what your customers want. I know you want to charge ahead and create new products, but unless your customers want them, they won’t&nbsp;sell.</p><p>Keep listening and learning from your feedback loop — aim to gather information on how your customers prefer to pay, engage with your brand, or give feedback — because this will help you provide more personalized experiences.</p> Look for the right&nbsp;solution <p>To grow a business, you need to keep customers loyal. Luckily for you, there’s no shortage of customer retention tools to choose from — while a few are reasonably priced and effective, others fall under the premium segment. Experiment with different features, look at your budget and choose the best option that fits your&nbsp;needs.</p> The 15 Best Customer Retention Tools on the&nbsp;Market <p>Let’s see which customer retention tools top our list&nbsp;today.</p> 1. Zendesk — The King of Customer&nbsp;Service <p>Zendesk is a help desk software utilizing integrations and automation to enable customers to fix different problems — saving you time and increasing customer loyalty. Zendesk builds each of its products to solve specific pain points in customer experience.</p><p>Optimized for large organizations, it has become a widespread tool for managing customer problems and facilitating communication between businesses and customers.</p><p>Prices start at $49/month on an annual plan, but you will get a lot of features — like an industry-leading ticketing system, over 1,000 apps and integrations, a smooth user interface, and up to 500 automated answers.</p> 2. Hubspot — The Gatling Gun of&nbsp;CRMs <p>While many tools are available to help marketers improve their outreach, Hubspot can be considered the best of its kind. And no, it’s not just hype: the software has dozens of features, including dynamic personalization, custom data analysis, customer satisfaction surveys, omnichannel automation, A/B testing, and predictive lead&nbsp;scoring.</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t come cheap. The starter plan costs $45/month, but it is nowhere as good as the advanced ones. Businesses with lots of customer data and contacts may pay thousands of dollars to get hold of the platform. While it’s a great customer engagement platform, it’s not a solution targeted at everyday small businesses.</p> 3. Optimizely — test, test, test,&nbsp;repeat <p>Optimizely helps businesses transform their digital products through the power of experimentation from startups to large enterprises. By leveraging the platform’s top-notch web, mobile, and API testing solutions, businesses can easily create personalized experiences for their audience and make data-driven decisions with confidence.</p><p>Optimizely empowers marketers to generate leads, increase conversions, and boost sales through personalized marketing campaigns.</p><p>If you can afford to spend between $50,000 and $200,000 per year on software, you can gain more loyal customers, reward returning customers, and identify repeat customers and new prospects.</p> 4. Qualaroo <p>Qualaroo provides a simple, straightforward way of collecting real-time feedback from your customers — whether you’re looking to improve the customer experience on your website or you want to understand what’s working and what&nbsp;isn’t.</p><p>Qualaroo is ideal for both. Its easy-to-use surveys and insightful data help businesses collect intelligence and make better decisions.</p><p>To be fair, this is one of the more budget solutions on the list. It starts at $80 per month, but for $160/month, you can get more than decent features — like integrations, branding, advanced targeting, and exit&nbsp;surveys.</p> 5. Zoho&nbsp;CRM <p>Zoho is a business software suite that businesses can use to make their lives easier. With over 50 online apps such as Zoho Docs, Zoho Books, and Zoho Expense, it can help keep track of everything you need, from inventory and projects to employee expenses and customer&nbsp;orders.</p><p>Zoho provides affordable customer retention business software for SMBs to manage time, projects, and client relations without the overhead cost of dedicated enterprise solutions.</p><p>The Indian platform has a free plan for up to 3 users, but the other plans are reasonably priced. For SMBs who want to elevate their customer retention rate, a Standard plan costs $14/month, and the Professional plan costs $23/month.</p><p>But even the most premium one (the Ultimate) is not expensive — $52/month. Bear in mind these prices are at an annual&nbsp;rate.</p> 6. LoyalZoo <p>The LoyalZoo software lets businesses of all shapes and sizes create customer loyalty programs that appeal to their customers’ unique needs. LoyalZoo is easy to set up and use to avoid having much trouble with the platform.</p><p>Businesses can then share the reward system online and on mobile with their customers — orchestrating a seamless customer experience that’s both efficient and highly rewarding.</p><p>The platform is relatively cheap, and it charges per store rather than per user, which is a massive boost. $47 is the base plan. If you want to create SMS marketing campaigns, you will have to pay $30 extra, but it is totally worth&nbsp;it.</p> 7. Thanx <p>Thanx has taken digital and brick-and-mortar loyalty programs to the next level. Businesses can reach out to their best customers and deliver a personalized experience without the inconveniences of old-fashioned, manually updated&nbsp;details.</p><p>By streamlining the system and creating an algorithm that automatically rewards regular customers, Thanx helps businesses crank over the wheel of their most profitable customers.</p><p>Considering some previous options, the prices start from $99 per month, which isn’t cheap. Nonetheless, not many apps allow you to interact with guests, so the app is worth a shot. Let me try it,&nbsp;Thanx!</p> 8. Yotpo <p>Yotpo helps businesses build relationships with current and potential customers. Their eCommerce marketing software allows users to leverage customer feedback to improve lead generation and sales. The platform features a centralized location where users can publish content, conduct polls, and collect&nbsp;reviews.</p><p>The system stores all the data related to the customer and their purchase history. It helps businesses grow by being sure that they are offering a satisfactory shopping experience to their customers.</p><p>Yotpo starts at $19/month (the Growth plan). However, as your needs grow, so does the pricing. The Prime plan costs $59/month, but you should have deeper pockets if you want to access AI-powered predictive segmentation and unlimited A/B testing. That’s what you pay for using a legacy name in the industry.</p> 9. Mailchimp <p>Seriously, is there a chart where Mailchimp doesn’t participate? Jokes aside, Mailchimp is an all-in-one marketing tool that can help you increase your reach while reducing your costs. Its built-in eCommerce features, landing pages, and digital ads have helped a lot of businesses in their growth&nbsp;journey.</p><p>And due to its powerful integrations with Zapier, Slack, Canva, and WordPress, it is set up for success. So, yes, it is on our list for a&nbsp;reason!</p><p>The software is also very balanced in terms of pricing. It has a generous free plan, and the starting plan is only $11/month. Of course, it can reach more than $1,300 for 200k+ contact in your email list, but still — it has something for everyone.</p> 10. Heap Analytics <p>Heap Analytics is so much more than a client retention tool. From understanding customer behavior to improving personalized experiences, Heap can be used to enrich your business. The best part? They’ve got an intuitive interface that even people who aren’t tech-savvy can&nbsp;use.</p><p>The platform is refined and very detailed. Well, you price the price for it is steep — the Growth plan starts at $3,600 per year, but it can get tenfold the&nbsp;amount.</p> 11. Litmus <p>Using Litmus’ robust tools, you can create beautiful and effective emails that will engage your customers. With these email templates and drag-and-drop elements, and Litmus’ expertise, you can make sure most campaigns resonate with your potential and current customers.</p><p>It’s all about making your customers feel in control of their experience with your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Litmus Basic starts at $79/month, but if you have a small team, you can jump to Litmus Plus — it costs $159/month, but it gives you five user seats, as well as spam testing, QA testing, code editor, and productivity integrations all at the same&nbsp;place.</p> 12. Amplitude <p>Amplitude gives you all the tools to analyze user behavior to know what’s working and what isn’t. With features like grouping users based on their activities and recording information down to the session level, Amplitude helps your business understand which parts keep customers engaged.</p><p>It’s a leading platform, but you can’t see any pricing when you go to the website. You can find sources online that indicate you have to pay between $5,000 and $100,000 per year, so you’ll spend a&nbsp;lot.</p> 13. Crazy&nbsp;Egg <p>Crazy Egg’s heatmaps allow users to see where their visitors are clicking and what webpages are, resulting in qualified leads. The tool automatically creates A/B tests for essential landing pages so that brands can increase conversion from visitors to leads, sales, and more loyal customers.</p><p>There are no free plans, but Crazy Egg doesn’t charge a fortune either. Its pricing plan starts from $24 per month up to $249 per month, and it’s worth the cost of the product. With over 300,000 users, it’s on the list of best tools to generate heat maps and simple click-tracking data.</p> 14. Woorise <p>Woorise is a one-stop-shop for all of your marketing needs. This customer retention tool provides the features to create engaging contests, landing pages, and giveaways. Build your email list and drive new sales by offering a fabulous prize and incentivizing people to&nbsp;enter.</p><p>Make your brand fantastic!

 DM Note #8: On Art, Imagination Infrastructures, and Shared Memories of the&nbsp;Future <p>This is the 8th in a series of DM notes, which share information and insights from DM Downloads — our regular internal learning sessions. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>DM Note #8 is an opportunity to reflect together on the role of art: in making the future present; in expressing our ideas in ways that are more tangible and visceral at early stages; in building imagination as a civic-infrastructure for tomorrow’s societies; in valourizing “softer” and often neglected ways of knowing and exploring; and a lot&nbsp;more.</p><p>DM might have started with a design and architecture focus, but it’s become increasingly transdisciplinary, including expertise in: financial structuring, governance innovation, international law, real estate, policy and regulatory design, and full stack development. In this DM Note, we reflect on the role that art plays (or could play) in our practice.</p>Our Free House initiative, whose various parts are being developed with different partners in various locations, had its first material incarnation at the <a href="https://museumofthefuture.ae/en">Museum of the Future</a> in Dubai recently, as a small model with augmented reality. Building Imagination Infrastructures <p>We work on various novel, entangled, tangible and intangible types of civic infrastructure (<a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/#/">Trees As Infrastructure</a> being one of the most advanced examples), and recently we have started exploring imagination infrastructure, which falls within intangible infrastructure. Here’s our current working definition for intangible infrastructuring, which Linnéa, Mihai and Anjeline have been working on within&nbsp;DM:</p><blockquote>the shared recipes, relationships, and abilities that underpin society’s social, ecological, and economic&nbsp;systems.</blockquote><blockquote>It refers to the process of using and creating these to scaffold functionings and values at a societal&nbsp;scale.</blockquote><blockquote>They emerge through interactive processes between diverse actors and tangible structures in a given context, relative to each actor’s conversion factor.</blockquote><blockquote>Intangibles enable the reduction of fundamental uncertainty, prevention of damage, and most importantly fulfill conditions for societal thriving.</blockquote><p>At an event in June 2021 organized by the <a href="https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/">Community Fund</a>, Indy from Dark Matter Labs was on a panel discussing how we define infrastructure, and unpicking what it means to use the term in the context of something as intangible as imagination.</p><p>When we think of infrastructure, we might think of roads or telephone lines, durable built environments, technologies that encode relationships and political ideas, and structures that drive how we interact with each other. Infrastructures are collective and cooperative ways of supporting our individual and shared agency and our ability to live our lives according to certain values. The juxtaposition between infrastructure and imagination is useful because it reminds us that imagination doesn’t happen as stroke of genius, it requires scaffolding, especially when thinking about collective imagining.</p><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, our challenge was somehow to collaborate globally to return to the normal we knew, while the climate breakdown requires us to collaborate at various scales around transitioning into a new normal. How can we build a deeper democracy of the imagination, so as to better be able to see and feel the kind of futures we want and need? How to do so in a way that is intrinsically motivated, and contextually enabled? How to liberate other ways of sensing and knowing that allows our minds to help each other travel to places unknown, in new expressions of our shared humanity? And how to do that in a context where uncertainty and complexity seems to be increasing?</p><p>This won’t happen all by itself; it will also require significant care and investment. It can easily be dismissed by governments and policy makers as a simple nice-to-have that can’t be a priority right now, but it is increasingly fundamental if we are to organize into bigger and bigger groups of humans and transition towards more regenerative futures that we can’t yet see or feel. Repeating facts about climate change is part of the work of changing how we understand our roles and impact in this world, but it is insufficient by&nbsp;itself.</p> Experiencing Possibilities Now: Economic Art as a&nbsp;Practice <p>From early childhood we are trained to believe that a good amount of money corresponds to a safe life, a happy life. In some senses that is true, but it has created a snowball effect where there is no clear idea on how much capital one single person actually needs to be, and feel, safe and&nbsp;happy.</p><p>For people and organizations attempting to thrive in this tumultuous time, fixed mindsets and stagnated approaches no longer work. To create a better future where everyone can flourish, leaders and organizations need to find brave ways to engage and encourage emotions more fully, but also truly comprehend how they connect us to the economic systems we have&nbsp;created.</p><p>How can we make more concrete and palpable new economic systems with experiences that guide us through deeper exploration in soft values, vulnerability, culture, dark matter, unknowns, emotions, radical innovation, gender, politics, economy, storytelling.</p><p>This is what Jenny from DM has been exploring from Sweden, in partnership with SVID. Within Economic Spaces, we have started working on public art installations and exhibitions. We share our thoughts and what has come out of learning, studying and discussing with partners, organizations and citizens with both shared and oppositional mindsets. The purpose of these installations is to create real world tangible experiences of future economic possibilities whilst prototyping the dark matter innovations necessary for this&nbsp;future.</p><p>Through art we can emotionally introduce ourselves to a whole new set of experiences and ideas that we may have never witnessed before. Rather than only discussing climate change, economic powers and human behaviours through distant science and hard-to-grasp technological language we can provide space to emotionally connect our experience of the world through current realities.</p><p>“Economy” encompasses more than money and finance; in the recent DM Download Jenny framed economy as the larger, more holistic space in which we interact and share, care (or not), perform acts of generosity and create mindsets for a sustainable future. In this sense, an economy can be softer, more emotional and filled with innovation. Economic Spaces is an exploration in having new dialogues about all of these types of economies. It is an invitation to be remarkably creative in finding new ways to explore an economy with a comprehensive understanding that we are&nbsp;free.</p><p>The Use of Participatory Futuring <br>to Craft Shared Memories of the&nbsp;Future</p><p>Hollywood blockbusters and Netflix series made countless films imagining the end of the planet as we know it, from alien invasions to fertility decline, yet none that shows a plausible end and desirable alternative to the problematic aspects of our current economic systems.&nbsp;Why?</p><p>Partly because we live in an age of communicative capitalism where our attention span is being fought over by multinational corporations, where short-termism is the norm across sectors, <a href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2015/05/the-science-of-scarcity">where inequalities and scarcity steals mental capacity beyond more urgent needs</a>, and where the most visible long term visions are those of billionaire space explorers, authoritative governments and private tech companies. Furthermore, our collective imagination is constrained by inherited 19th-century world economic models that have become second nature; like water to a fish. As a consequence, our future is colonized by our past and the few, and our imagination is constrained to the point of feeling almost&nbsp;broken.</p><p>But it is not broken; we just need better imagination infrastructure which, unlike state-led top-down propaganda of the past world wars, will provide us with more legitimate and collectively-led narratives towards socio-ecological transition. It might be easy to dismiss powerful stories and narratives in the necessary social transformations to come, but it would be underestimating how essential it has always been in enabling large-scale numbers of humans to cooperate effectively in history. Unlike other animals that evolve only through their DNA alone, humans can bypass their genome through cultural evolution.</p><p>As Jonathan from DM in Montreal pointed out in his presentation, the army and large corporations have already been hiring science fiction writers to better anticipate and predict the future, but where are similar resources for society’s shared transitions? Humans are not as rational as the age of enlightenment might have made us believe. As we are entering the age of entanglement, we will need to not only plan for better futures but also to imagine and experience them today in a manner that is so visceral that we start building memories of these futures and start caring about the generations that will inherit them. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23846418/">According to neuroscience research, going through an immersive experiment of futuring activates the regions of the brain associated with memory</a>. We are literally creating memories of the future, which can help keep ideas viscerally alive in a community passed short-term political cycles.</p><p>Call it cathedral thinking, but for our economic&nbsp;systems.</p>A preview of the workshop on the future of rights of nature — Biosphère, Montréal<p>In 2019 DM organized a workshop at the Biosphere in Montreal on natural ecosystems, as part of the preliminary reflection with <a href="https://radicle.studio/">Radicle</a> and ExpoLive leading to the Dubai World Expo and with the McConnell Foundation. We invited various Indigenous leaders, scientists, environmental activists and legal experts to reflect on the future of rights of nature in Canada. We started with a preliminary scenario of five rivers being granted rights of nature in 2040, and the challenges and possibilities that would emerge from that. We then invited the participants to speak in the present tense about life around them in 2040. The first person to speak began: “Since I became the first Indigenous Prime Minister of Canada last year, I decided to…”. and instantly, a higher level of creativity and freedom flew through the conversation. Instead of bumping against each other’s current positions, people were weaving their imaginations together to embody the full complexity they represented into a future scenario.</p><p>Two years later, <a href="https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/environnement/596053/la-riviere-magpie-obtient-le-statut-de-personnalite-juridique">when the first river was granted rights of nature in Québec</a>, Jonathan from DM shared that the first thought that came to mind was “Oh, I remember that”. Because it “happened” in that workshop, without any sophisticated immersive media or technology; just through the power of shared projection and imagination. What could we achieve if we brought that to a whole new collective level, using all the power of the most recent advances in media, art and technologies?</p>Some case studies of the role of art, culture and digital technologies, in participatory futuring (In&nbsp;French) From Strategic Foresight to Participatory Futuring <p>As the growing uncertainty of the world is recognized, methods such as predictive forecasting that pretend to predict the future have become almost antiquated, while strategic foresight has become increasingly used by various levels of government and institutions as a way not to predict the future, but to prepare strategies that are robust across a range of plausible futures.</p><p>However, as explained by Nesta in this<a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/our-futures-people-people/"> report on participatory futures</a> (which we inspired ourselves from for this work): rarely are the strategic foresight exercises moving beyond a few actors (small groups of academics, corporations, and government teams) or beyond certain mediums (written reports with a few diagrams). Participatory Futuring aims at creating a democratized body of collective intelligence on exploring and shaping the future using some of the most engaging, visceral, and tangible cultural, mediatic, and artistic tools out&nbsp;there.</p><p>Engaging groups in this process has the promise of creating better policy-making, more effective socialization of emerging technologies, and greater legitimacy for hard decisions, as well as creating the constituencies for long-term change that can survive political cycles, through the creation of shared memories of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>This process involves working together&nbsp;to:</p>Inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nesta.org.uk%2Freport%2Four-futures-people-people%2F">Nesta’s Report</a> — Our Futures: By the people, for the&nbsp;people<p>Participatory Futures set out to bring people together to think about the future and inform collective actions in the present. The involvement of, for example, artists in the process invites people to engage in the process without defaulting to the limits of traditional problem framing, or the rational, linguistic categories that may constrain the full range of possibility and&nbsp;desire.</p><p>The design of a participatory futures exercise depends on the strategic impact desired, the scale of engagement, and the way the future or alternative futures are going to be used. Through many case studies we looked into, it’s increasingly clear that art and culture are crucial to cultivating long-term attitudes and behaviours. They are foundational in shaping our collective direction of travel, from the kinds of laws we make, to the technology we develop, to the way we think about our role in shaping the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Over the past few years, Dark Matter Labs explored this emergent practice thanks to the support of the<a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/fr/accueil/"> McConnell Foundation</a>, and worked on various exploratory pieces of research relevant to the topic, including the<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/futures-in-long-termism-16c1745c361c"> Futures in Longtermism series</a> and the Future Generation Desk at the Office of Rules and Norms, initially hosted at the Art Faculty of Concordia University in Montreal. For this last one, we worked with two researchers, Joelle and Maddy, to answer the following question: How can we invite future generations in present negotiations to influence current decision-making processes? The<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vuuo-VF17ooPyPnJKmTVVzyeCPUXHpUN/view"> final report</a> explores the diverse possibilities of theatrical, interpersonal experimentations and creative bureaucratic practices for long-term decision-making.<a href="https://www.orn.studio/research-projects/inviting-future-generations"> Read more about it&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>We are also looking to explore how art could be channelled into the development of Radicle Civics — looking at how art as a social practice could expand the comprehension of now and allow us to see the world differently, and shift the Overton window. <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">Please do stay in touch here if you’re interested.</a></p>Summary Slide from <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle&nbsp;Civics</a> Art as the Next Frontier of our Transdisciplinarity: <br>Political Legitimacy and Movement&nbsp;Building <p>In January 2020, at the dawn of the coronavirus crisis that would soon shake global society to its core, Quebec’s TVA network began airing a series titled <a href="https://www.qub.ca/tvaplus/tva/epidemie">Épidémie</a> (Epidemic) about the outbreak of… a coronavirus</p><p>The parallels between the fictional show and reality are astounding: the same type of virus (Coronavirus) with a similar name (Cova instead of Covid), challenges in getting people to take the virus seriously, racism linked to the origin of the outbreak (in the show, people call it the “Inuit virus”), shortages in vital supplies such as masks,&nbsp;etc…</p><p>How did that happen? The screenwriters based their scenario on scientific papers and predictions from health organizations, but brought it to a much wider audience than traditional reports could ever dream&nbsp;of.</p><p>Uncanny to say the least, this eerie parallel between fiction and reality-to-come is indicative of the ways in which creative speculations on the future can illuminate pitfalls of current ways of thinking and living and accurately depict catastrophes to come and ways to address them — the same way fire emergency and evacuation rehearsals have become mainstream in many buildings.</p><p>What if that TV show had been done years ago, not only as entertainment, but as a way to better anticipate known risks to come and better prepare for it together?</p><p>Traditional policy making as usual simply hasn’t had all the answers. Can the Arts sector — under pressure with increasing reduced or restricted funding streams and the impact of Covid-19 — be empowered and more importantly equipped with the resources to provide some new policy tools? Can the Arts sector help civil society to mobilize and find solutions and tools to address the wicked problems of our society in new ways? Zehra argued in her presentation that the civic movement to address certain wicked problems such as climate change is already there — at least in the UK, and that DML and many other organizations looking at using Art and imagination infrastructure can help provide the tools and direction for the right interventions. One example of that is our recent involvement with UNDP North Macedonia, where we did some very preliminary work on how to think of imagination Infrastructure as scaffolding for distributed collaborative capabilities at a national&nbsp;level.</p>Here’s a preliminary process that we are working on of how participatory futuring could work at a societal scale (in&nbsp;French)<p>Indeed, to mobilize systems change, the state has to enable and provide the scaffolding for distributed collaborative capabilities across society. In this age of complexity, top down government is neither sustainable given the scope and scale of interventions required, nor effective given the range of actors involved in an interconnected nation system. Moreover, the increased risks faced by the nation system need bold interventions that require building legitimacy across society for such&nbsp;actions.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.mackinac.org/7504"> Overton Window</a> is a model for understanding how ideas in society change over time and influence politics. The core concept is that politicians are limited in what policy ideas they can support — they generally only pursue policies that are widely accepted across society as legitimate policy options. This window of politically acceptable options is primarily defined not by what politicians prefer, but rather by what they believe they can support and still win re-election or secure election. However, the Overton Window can shift and expand to include different policy options when ideas change in the society that elects&nbsp;them.</p><p>We have to build the imagination infrastructure of society as whole because currently the limitation is not what politicians can say or do, but rather our collective sense-making as to the future — that can then become a reinforcement for political action. Without investing in societal sense-making of the future, we cannot create pathways for transition as the Overton window is currently too small to deal with the scale of the challenge presented by this age of uncertainty.</p><p>Imagination infrastructure constructs the space for the organizational transformation that Governments require to meet the challenge of transition. This learning process also allows the public to recognize that there are no linear futures. It fundamentally transforms the relationship between citizens and the state to a new societal contract. The question becomes not what can a Government do but how will it do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Imagination infrastructure provides a simple structure to shift the Overton window from politicians to communities. Civic duty is moved far beyond merely exercising a right to vote to becoming part of a more inclusive, deliberative democracy that can hold our interdependencies. This is about democratizing the future, enabling citizens to dream and contribute to shaping our collective futures. It builds trust and a new language of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Furthermore, the reality has been that too much of Government policy has been based on the imagination of a few policy makers or legislators, and that can create blindspots. Imagination infrastructure serves to break down the silos in the machinery of the state. It democratizes the ability to create the shared worlds that further unlock hallmarks of humanity (such as creativity and care). It builds the societal capacity to deliver the NDS with a whole of society approach, and new societal sense making capabilities for the&nbsp;future.</p>Governance as system transition challenge — From our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-39ccc3a6c9f8">#NextGenGov (the Big Boring Bureaucratic Revolution) blog</a> in November&nbsp;2018 Strategic considerations to build political momentum around imagination infrastructures:   Increasingly difficult + vital — We live in an age of disinformation, increased polarization and distractions, and difficult living conditions, yet this work has never been more important. Furthermore, given that many political and government actors are dealing with scarce resources, it might be difficult to convince public authorities that this kind of imaginative and futuristic take on governance and planning is worth spending time or money on. How to reconcile these tensions?  Lack of evidence / The challenge of the first mover — Often governments won’t be able to justify investing in that kind of practices until it proves effective. Evidence based reductionist / analytical thinking is currently the dominant style, and proving that other forms of knowing could provide serious insights for decision makers might be a challenge, especially since there isn’t yet clear impact measurements for participatory futuring mechanisms, as Nesta justly points out in its report. Yet if every actor waits for that evidence, we will never move forward. Where do we even create authorizing spaces for that kind of work with governments, and who will be willing to be the first movers and investors on&nbsp;this?  Long term and expensive — Much of this work cannot be done on a tight budget or short term, which goes against many current constraints. How do we build that in? How do we create, restructure or reorient current funding opportunities to be open to that kind of work, whether it comes from the art and media sectors, public participation offices, or others? One example is<a href="https://canadacouncil.ca/funding/strategic-funds/strategic-innovation-fund"> the new strategic innovation fund</a> from the Canada Council for the Art, which we have contributed to the reflection of in the past few&nbsp;years.  Communities of practice and impact — One pathway to success is to build a coalition of collaborators — that each have a value system that is truly open and about citizen engagement. Of course a lot of this work is very contextual, but there can still be shared resources on some levels. How do we learn across experiments in a way that informs everyone? What strategies for network development help scale ﬁndings in ways that are accessible and deployable beyond the limits of each&nbsp;project?  Becoming legitimate / Being taken seriously — There can be a gender and race dynamic with this work. Women (and qualities that have been reduced to femininity) and ethnic minority practitioners (and their deeply culturally rooted alternative worldviews) will say this sort of work is hard enough to do, but you also struggle to be taken seriously doing “softer work” as a woman, ethnic minority person, etc. Can we build concrete utility and social legitimacy around these conceptual and practical approaches to knowledge production, for the benefit of&nbsp;all?  Building shared language across practices — This work requires interdisciplinary working;rtists, policy and finance specialists, etc.. Language tailored to our audience matters, but many practitioners needed aren’t used to do this work either. How do we train both artists and non-artists in engaging with participatory futuring methods, for instance? How do we connect the right artists and arts practices with the right opportunity or challenge?  Impact measurement / Evaluation — What methods can we use to frame explicit, anticipated goals, and take meaningful measurement of impact? <br>What methods of data collection and interpretation ensure results are transferable? How does measurement and evaluation feedback into framing methodology?   The potential roles of art in our practice:   Art for internal sense-making — How to walk the talk with how we design the organization and our initiatives?  Art as a strategy for engagement — How can art help us organize communities of practice around complex&nbsp;topics?  Art as change-making and subversive agent — How can art accelerate the materialization of our ideas by intervening in grey areas of regulation  Art as pedagogy — How to make public various forces and forms of influence that are often invisible  Art as decision-making — How to reorient modes of knowing and deliberating so that they take into consideration more&nbsp;aspects  Art as shared joy — How can working and living with art make our lives more meaningful and&nbsp;joyful.   The role of the art&nbsp;sector <p>As we wrote about with<a href="https://massculture.ca/"> Mass Culture</a> and<a href="https://metcalffoundation.com/publication/art-and-the-world-after-this/"> David Maggs</a> in Canada, the relationship between art and society has always been in flux, the past few years has been unprecedented thanks to four distinct disruptions: The disruption of activity, stemming from COVID-19; the disruption of society, emerging from rising social unrest; the disruption of industry, based on the digital revolution; and the disruption of world, rooted in the sustainability crisis. Here, the arts sector finds its business model on life support, its purchase on the public imagination in decline, and its relationship to social issues insufficient. As we try to reinvigorate the relationship between art and society, two linked capacities may be helpful: 1) identify an explicit grasp of its unique value proposition — what does art do better than anything else?; 2) couple that recognition with an increased capacity to understand social challenges in terms of the capacity we offer — what are the arts-shaped holes in our worlds right&nbsp;now?</p><p>Happily, the answer is, many. An increasing number of challenges have reached the limits of rational, analytical problem-solving and are searching for ways to transform traditional thinking, shift collective practice, and reimagine underlying assumptions. As a result, arts-shaped holes are emerging everywhere. Consider climate change. Here, the science and technology of the crisis are largely resolved. We know enough about the problem and have the solutions needed to fix it. And yet our imaginative horizons balk at a post-carbon existence. So just when many countries’ arts sector is on the ropes, the capacities of creative practices are emerging as critical to some of our most urgent needs. Here we arrive at the relationship between art and social transformation.</p><p>How do the arts contribute meaningfully to challenges in socio-ecological transformations without simply defaulting to communication exercises? How do we bring the elusive agency of the aesthetic to concrete social problems? And how do we measure the effects of having done so? The art space has the potential to expand the boundaries of the current legitimate conversation — vital to making the transition — by asking key structural questions, questions outside the current orthodoxy of thinking, acting and doing; and yet critical from our perspective.</p> A shift in our hearts, bodies and&nbsp;minds <p>This work might require an important shift, because we have been trained to value forms of sensing and knowledge that can be more easily demonstrable and measured in a certain way, and to repress others as invalid, illegitimate, impertinent, not very serious, or too soft. The kind of work we are discussing in this DM Note can’t be done via the analytical brain alone, and requires us to be more vulnerable, by jumping into the unknown with others, with no assurance of what exactly will come out of it, yet hoping for the needed visceral and exciting shared memories of futures we want to work towards together.</p><p>And if it’s true that experiencing effective participatory futuring exercises can create shared “memories” of the future, how can we build from what we understand about the brain and memory functions to build a more collective imagination infrastructure?</p><p>We end this DM Note with some inspiration from Pixar’s movie Inside Out.&nbsp;;-)</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you enjoyed this 8th DM Note, you can clap the article to show appreciation,<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-4-2aa2636e581e"> read all of our previous notes here</a>, and follow us on Medium for more.

“Pairwise Trust” now available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdxkDzQOsFI&amp;t=48s">MetaMUI&nbsp;SSID</a><p>In the ever-evolving digital society, one of the most important thing is to control one’s digital identity and digital property. Since the invention of the internet, it has brought great advantages for people to send, receive and exchange information, data, and even money through the web in real time. The internet has given us an exciting space and boundless possibilities. However, at the same time, it brings great risks and responsibilities to users, although many people have not noticed it&nbsp;yet.</p><p>There are many risks while using the internet, and one of the critical issues for all the internet users is that the users can get damages by accessing a wrong website by putting wrong address, or entering a phishing website with exposing personal data. Some people might say that it won’t happen to them, but in reality, it actually happens and can happen to all the internet users. It causes lots of property damage, and personal information leakage.</p><p>In 2019, the FBI(Federal Bureau of Investigation) documented a record $3.5 billion in losses due to internet crimes (<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2019-internet-crime-report-released-021120">2019 Internet Crime Report Released</a>) and in 2021, the losses became almost doubled($6.9 billion). (<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf">2021 Internet Crime&nbsp;Report</a>)</p>Internet Crime Statistics for last 5 Years <br>(<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf">“2021 Internet Crime&nbsp;Report”</a>)<p>As mentioned earlier, these internet crimes usually happen to the users who registered their personal information to a wrong website or provide personal data to a web service provider which sells the data to unknown third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>To prevent these billions of losses and crimes, and make the internet a safe and reliable place, MetaMUI team has developed an ultimate blockchain-based identification solution called “Pairwise Trust”. Pairwise Trust is a security protocol that verifies the identities of both parties in a transaction simultaneously, powered by Two-Way Cryptographic Binding.</p><p>Pairwise Trust runs on MetaMUI, the world’s first identity-based blockchain, and 4th generation blockchain which provide the Identity Blockchain. In MetaMUI, users can create their own DID by submitting their personal information(KYC) to one of the Sidechain Operators, and the operator will decide whether approving or denying the request depending on the status of the submitted data. Once the request is approved, the user’s personal data get hashed, and the hashed data is safely stored in the user’s device. In the case of Public DIDs, a KYC provider is exclusively operated by MetaMUI, so operators such as all other stores, banks, and public institutions can have their own public DIDs with the approval of&nbsp;MetaMUI.</p><p>Non-individual companies and institutions will be issued a Public DID rather than a Personal DID, and the issued Public DID will be disclosed as a Public DID on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdxkDzQOsFI&amp;t=2s">MetaMUI SSID</a>. Users can access the correct website by searching and clicking on the Public DID in the MetaMUI SSID. Furthermore, MetaMUI SSID supports an integrated DID log in solution. It enables the users to log in any websites without registering a new ID and password but only with DID. Once a user log in through MetaMUI SSID app with his/her DID and connect to online stores by searching it on the Public DID list, the user can safely buy goods, groceries and products without exposing personal data. There is no risk to enter wrong websites.</p><p>In addition, MetaMUI users can check their personal transaction records and check their balance using the Pairwise Trust after accessing MetaMUI Blockchain Explorer(<a href="https://scan.metamui.id/dashboard">https://scan.metamui.id/dashboard</a>). While most public blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are disclosing the user’s transaction data on its explorers, MetaMUI prevents personal information leakage and ensure safe transactions by allowing only the owners to view their transaction records.</p><p>Pairwise Trust is a strong safeguard to protect user’s personal information not to be leaked by accessing wrong websites, and users don’t need to provide personal data to use any website or app but just use their DID. Pairwise Trust is a safe bridge between the real world and the Metaverse world, and will position as one of the important roles for Web3 infrastructures.</p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>The perfect password doesn't exist, just like the password you wrote down on that post it that uses your mother's maiden name with your daughter's birth date. We explain why a password manager can help you.</p> The most used passwords in France‌‌ <p>In 2021, the most common passwords are weak. As the top 10 most used passwords in France show, all of them are decipherable in less than 1 second by malicious people. Since 2018, the number sequence 123456 remains number 1 in the ranking. In 2021, this password has been used more than 103 million times.‌‌France appears among the countries with a high risk index, with more than 406 million disclosed passwords, or 6 on average per capita, in 2021.‌‌</p><p>Here are the top 10 most used passwords in France:‌‌123456‌‌123456789‌‌azerty‌‌12345‌‌000000‌‌tiffany‌‌qwerty‌‌1234561‌‌loulou‌‌marseille‌‌</p><p>The weak link in computing is most of the time not the software but the human.‌‌</p> The recommendations of the ANSSI <p>‌‌The ANSSI (National Agency for the Security of Information Systems) has published recommendations for the creation of secure passwords. We share them with you.‌‌</p>  Use a unique password for each service. In particular, the use of the same password for both your professional and personal email accounts should be avoided. You can use a password manager like Cozy Pass to have your passwords with you at all times without having to remember them. We had written a comparison of the different password managers available on the market.  Choose a password that is not related to you (password made up of a company name, date of birth, etc.);  Never ask a third party to generate a password for you;  Always change default passwords as soon as possible when systems contain them;  Renew your passwords with a reasonable frequency. Every 90 days is a good compromise for systems containing sensitive data;  Do not store passwords in a file on a computer that is particularly exposed to risk (e.g., online on the Internet), let alone on an easily accessible paper;  Do not send your own passwords to your personal email;  Configure software, including your web browser, so that it does not "remember" chosen passwords.  <p>Data theft is a reality. Forgetting passwords is a daily occurrence.</p><p>Two methods to choose your passwords:‌‌- The phonetic method: "I bought eight CDs for a hundred euros this afternoon" will become ght8CD%E7am ;‌‌- The first letters method: the quote "one yours is better than two you'll get" will yield 1yibttu'lg.</p><p>‌‌💡 You can also calculate the strength of a password with the ANSSI tool. This will allow you to know the strength of your password: <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/precautions-elementaires/calculer-la-force-dun-mot-de-passe/">Calculate the "strength" of a password</a></p>  A capital letter (see +)  A minimum of 8 characters  One or more special characters  One or more numbers  Does not contain your first or last name  Does not contain your date of birth  Does not contain your nickname‌‌   A password manager to get rid of 123456 <p>As far as the password is concerned, you should know that a hacker will not look for your password at random, he will look for information about you:‌‌</p>  Your first and last name‌‌   The first names of your relatives‌‌  The name of your pet‌‌  Your habits (if you are a sportsman, there is a big chance that your password is something related to sports)‌‌  Your date of birth.  <p>A password manager is a very simple tool that holds your passwords for you, automatically enters them as you browse the internet, and makes it easier for you to shop online.‌‌The latest barometer on digital practices and personal data control published at the end of 2019 (before the health crisis) shows a four-point increase in the use of a password manager among men and 25-34 year olds. With the health crisis, this usage must have increased further.</p><p>At <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">the launch of Cozy Pass</a>, some Cozy users told us that they were already using the Apple Keychain or Chrome, and that they didn't see the need for a password manager.</p><p>‌‌Many users save their passwords in Chrome or Firefox without even realizing it. When you're surfing the Web, a pop-up window appears asking you to save the password, and you click yes or no. When you come back to this page later, your password may be saved.</p><p>‌‌But you'll run into a problem when you try to log into an account from your iPhone while browsing the web with Safari. The passwords you saved on Chrome are then not available. Even worse, the passwords saved in Keychain may be different! You might even find yourself in a situation where you reset a password because you can't access a certain account, rendering the password saved in Chrome invalid.‌‌This situation can drive you crazy and is not sustainable over time.‌‌Maybe you use Chrome at home, but if your company's network only allows Internet Explorer or Firefox, your passwords stay "at home.</p><p>Cozy Pass users can easily access all of their passwords on all platforms, whether they use a PC for work, a Mac at home, an Android device or an iPhone. Cozy Pass works on all devices and all browsers even from their Cozy web interface. So your passwords follow you wherever you go. No black boxes. No duplicates. Only you have control.‌‌</p><p>The bottom line: as our personal and professional lives become increasingly digital and the vast majority of people use multiple devices in different ecosystems, an effective password management solution must work everywhere and when asked "how do I make a perfect password?", a password manager can help you get rid of post-it notes and other "password woes".‌‌</p><p>But keep in mind that the weakest link in computing is most of the time not the software but the human being.‌‌</p><p>To learn more about the Cozy personal cloud and its password manager, Cozy Pass, go to our page.‌‌</p><p>For those who want to install an extension on their favorite browser‌‌</p>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cozy-personal-cloud/jplochopoaajoochpoccajmgelpfbbic??id=io.cozy.pass&amp;hl=en&amp;pk_campaign=nouveautesnovembre&amp;pk_kwd=passchrome">Chrome‌‌</a>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cozy-personal-cloud/?id=io.cozy.pass&amp;hl=fr&amp;pk_campaign=blog&amp;pk_kwd=passfirefox">Firefox‌‌</a>  Safari‌‌  <p>For those on the go, Cozy Pass is also available on mobile</p><p>🐙 <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.cozy.pass&amp;hl=en&amp;pk_campaign=sitecozy&amp;pk_kwd=passandroid">Android</a></p><p>🍏 <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cozy-pass/id1502262449?platform=iphone">iOS</a></p><p>Thank you for reading this article 🙌.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>Digital systems have become very complex, 95% of admins have too many permissions, and 76% of IT decision-makers are facing a skills gap. This is a recipe for disaster, so how do you fix it? Patrick Parker from EmpowerID will elaborate on this challenge in his Keynote<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5034">&nbsp;Model, Measure, Manage - The Journey to Autonomous Security in a Hybrid Multi-Cloud World</a> on Tuesday, May 10, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Patrick some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p></p>
 Why is there a need for Autonomous Security in a Hybrid Multi-Cloud World? 
<p>That's a good question. So there are four major cloud platforms in use right now today by most enterprise organizations and these cloud platforms have a depth of functionality that also is increasing the complexity of their security models, producing about 40,000 unique permissions across the four platforms. So what you end up with are very complex systems for which 95% of admins in these systems are over permissioned because most people do not understand how you would get to a least privilege model and how to manage those complex systems with that many permissions. So from the technology side, from the business side currently 76% of IT decision-makers are facing a skills gap. We've had a great turnover right now where most people have left their jobs in IT, they're looking for something new. We also have a major skills gap. The skills gap in cybersecurity alone has increased by 39%. So you have more complex systems, you have the struggle to find properly skilled or trained people. And then that all is going to produce by next year, which is predicted to be 99% of cloud security failures will be the customer's fault due to misconfiguration. So it's all coming together that really we can't keep up with it just from a human manual effort perspective.</p>
<p></p>
 How can organizations define their ‘desired state’ for identity and access management? 
<p>So you really need a desired state because you need to know where you're headed to align your resources and your people and your technology toward a mission. A clear goal. There are different metrics you can use. One overarching principle is zero standing privilege, the idea that on weekends and at night you shouldn't have identities that are privileged, lying around waiting to be compromised by hackers, that you should convert your organization or optimize it into more of a just in time infrastructure. So privileged access is granted just in time just enough and just for the purpose that it's needed. And then it's also monitored. That's one key principle, is measuring your organization's progress from standing privilege. Where people have it permanently all the time to where it's just in time so that when people go home at night, there aren't these privileged identities. There are also many other measures. One other goal would be to move toward zero trust, which means that you're always proxying, never giving direct unmonitored access which you could measure that using tools like privileged access management. And then other statistics like the number and percentage of your user accounts that are orphans that do not belong to a specific person, so they're kind of unmanaged and they represent a risk. The average age for your passwords, for users and privileged users, the percentage option for multi-factor authentication, the average age of risky access from the time it was last recertified and then all of this you can produce an overall risk maturity score to track your organization's progress to how they're getting better and more secure. And what's really needed is some industry benchmarks maybe to be produced by an organization like IDPro that we could all share this knowledge in agree on a set metric to help gauge or compare one organization's progress towards another.</p>
<p></p>
 How can modeling and abstraction lead to a more secure automated identity infrastructure? 
<p>So abstraction and computer science especially has always been our savior, managing things at the machine code level was early days and it was not very productive. Really, the abstraction has allowed us with very little effort to have levers that are more powerful, that can move more things. So really the same applies to security and permissions across all these complex systems. Right now every system has its own security model and you really need to be an expert in each system and there's no way for the different domains of expertise like business intelligence, IGA, SIEM, and AI to talk to each other and know that we're speaking the same language or that we're actually talking about the same thing because we're managing at the technical level. The real abstraction and the use of a semantic language or modeling language where we're bubbling up these fine-grained permissions and activities across systems into one common language that's understandable by business people and can be gauged and assessed for risk will allow those different domains to tie together processes, IGA to understanding access you're allowed to have based on what you should be able to do from a business perspective, SIEM to let you know what you are doing, and is it appropriate in the same language and then AI to use that same language to automate toward a mission or a goal, to reduce standing privileges, to monitor for risky activities. And again, if we all get on the same page, then it'll increase our awareness. We'll get the benefit of a multi-disciplinary approach and we'll have a better overall security perspective across the enterprise. And one more thing, just with that standard language or that modeling or a defined end state, then people work best with a mission and so does AI. If you're going to throw AI to beat against the problem, if it has clearly defined mission parameters or a goal that it's working towards, then you can apply AI principles and AI technologies to help you continuously get to that goal. That's the autonomous part. We are enforcing least privilege optimizing permissions from permanent standing permissions to just in time permissions and just hacking away or banging away at our attack surface to reduce it and make the organization better overall, which again, that's the part that the humans can't really do because we don't have enough skilled people and just too many systems, too many permissions these days.<br><br></p>
 What can attendees expect from your talk at EIC? 
<p>I hope a little bit of fun. I hope it's not dry. I hope we have a good time. I hope that after the talk we will come up and we can really chat about it and continue the conversation in the social media world as well as maybe at the next upcoming conferences. And really, I guess the goal would be to help them plot a course and leverage the best technologies available to accelerate their journey toward a more secure and mature organization to deal with this multi-cloud complexity.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://webauthn.io/">Web Authentication (WebAuthn)</a> specification, given <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/03/pressrelease-webauthn-rec.html">official approval</a> by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the FIDO Alliance in 2019, aims to strengthen online security by allowing users to sign in to sites with elements like biometrics and FIDO security keys.

<p>WebAuthn is supported by default in Firefox and Chrome browsers and can be used in Edge browsers on recent Windows systems. As support for the new standard is built into more devices, more websites will offer this easier, more secure method of authentication.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll explain what WebAuthn is, how it works, and we’ll build a Java web application that allows a user to register and log in with a supported WebAuthn device.</p>

   <a>Why WebAuthn is the future</a> 
 

 How WebAuthn works 

<p>WebAuthn authenticator generates a public-private key pair, using public-key cryptography, scoped to a specific URI to be used for authentication. The service provider must identify the application based on this key. The private key used to generate the credentials is also kept hidden by the authenticator, so the authenticating software and service provider are less susceptible to malicious actors.</p>

<p>There are two distinct steps for using WebAuthn: credential registration and credential authentication. Registration is the process of generating, scoping, and storing a public key for authentication. Both the authenticator and server will store some information about the other party. Authentication is the process of requesting a credential from an authenticator, then verifying its validity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this application, the user hits a Register button and the server responds with information about the origin of the registration (hostname and origin), a byte-based user handle for identification, a randomly generated challenge nonce, and other optional information about the type of registration the server will accept.</p>

<p>The browser receives this information. A JavaScript function on the client re-encodes and formats the data for the WebAuthn API, and the generated JavaScript object is passed to the browser’s <code>navigator.credentials.create()</code> function.</p>

<p>The WebAuthn API passes the request to a connected authenticator, which normally requests some form of user verification (such as a PIN number or fingerprint), then generates a key pair for future verification and a credential ID to scope the relying party. The public key, credential ID, and challenge nonce, along with optional additional information, are passed back to the service provider; the provider checks the challenge nonce for tampering and then stores the public key and credential ID for future use.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Authentication functions similarly, though the content of the data passed around is slightly different. The user hits a Sign-in button and the service provider sends identifying information (credential ID and a challenge nonce). JavaScript on the client passes that request to the authenticator using the WebAuthn API, then the authenticator verifies the credential and returns a key, which is passed back to the service provider. The service provider verifies the key and performs any steps necessary to grant the user access to appropriate resources, like setting authentication cookies.</p>

 How to authenticate using WebAuthn in Java 

<p>In this article, you’re going to build a Java application that authenticates users using WebAuthn. To bootstrap a Java web framework that can create and store user sessions, you’ll use <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a> to implement the web application, then implement the WebAuthn server, built by the hardware authentication manufacturer <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubico</a>, to create the necessary JSON for the client to create and use credentials.</p>

<p>The final version of the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/webauthn-java-example">here</a>. The demo application uses Java 17 and Apache Maven for dependency management.</p>

 Get started with WebAuthn and Spring Boot 

<p>First, go to the <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=17&amp;groupId=com.webauthn&amp;artifactId=app&amp;name=app&amp;description=Demo%20Java%20project%20for%20WebAuthN%20Authentication&amp;packageName=com.webauthn.app&amp;dependencies=lombok,data-jpa,h2,web,thymeleaf">Spring Initializr page</a> and add your dependencies:</p>

 
   Lombok: A library used to speed up development by automatically generating constructors, getters and setters. 
   Spring Data JPA: An ORM (Object-relational mapping) tool to persist data and map Java classes to data objects. 
   H2 Database: An in-memory database for simple data persistence. No saved data will exist after application shutdown. For a production-ready application, replace this with a traditional database and edit the <code>spring.datasource.driver-class-name</code> property. 
   Spring Web: To handle web requests. 
   Thymeleaf: For HTML templating. 
 

<p>After creating and downloading this project, add the <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server">Yubico WebAuthn server dependency</a>. The application also needs some server-side caching, used to verify a challenge token that’s generated by the server and then provided by the client after a successful authenticator ceremony. This application uses <code>HttpSession</code> to track challenge tokens.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.yubico&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;webauthn-server-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.12.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

 Spring JPA data layer overview 

<p>The application stores two data object classes: users and credentials. Users are people using the system, and they can have multiple credentials. Credentials contain the information needed to identify and verify a device implementing Client to Authenticator (CTAP2) protocol. CTAP2 is a spec that describes communication between a roaming authenticator and another client/platform at the application layer, as well as bindings to a variety of transport protocols that use different physical media.</p>

 User data 

<p>There are two goals for the user data: track the existence and uniqueness of the user and their credentials, and enable the creation of two JavaScript objects for the browser to make WebAuthn API requests: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create"><code>PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</code></a> for registration and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions"><code>PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions</code></a> for authentication.</p>

<p>Using Spring JPA, the <code>AppUser</code> data class starts with traditional fields for organizing users in a system, an <code>id</code> for database lookup, and a unique <code>username</code> to enable user self-identification.</p>

<p>The <code>displayName</code> and <code>handle</code> fields are used by the server to create WebAuthn requests:</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Lob;

@Entity
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
public class AppUser {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    @Column(nullable = false, unique = true)
    private String username;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String displayName;

    @Lob
    @Column(nullable = false, length = 64)
    private ByteArray handle;
}
</code>   

<p>The username field is set by the user. It is intended to be displayed by UI elements on the client as part of the registration and authentication process, but it’s also entirely optional in the WebAuthn process. According to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-1/#sctn-user-handle-privacy">WebAuthn Specification</a>, a nickname string like <code>username</code> is not suitable for identification, so WebAuthn identity requests are made using a user handle, a byte sequence with a maximum length of 64.</p>

<p>Byte data (like the user handle) is stored in the database as a binary large object (BLOB). To convert these data fields to the <code>ByteArray</code> object the application uses, the application implements a JPA <code>AttributeConverter</code> class with the <code>Converter</code> annotation.</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import javax.persistence.AttributeConverter;
import javax.persistence.Converter;

@Converter(autoApply = true)
public class ByteArrayAttributeConverter implements AttributeConverter&lt;ByteArray, byte[]&gt; {

    @Override
    public byte[] convertToDatabaseColumn(ByteArray attribute) {
        return attribute.getBytes();
    }

    @Override
    public ByteArray convertToEntityAttribute(byte[] dbData) {
        return new ByteArray(dbData);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The application converts data classes into Java objects provided by the Yubico library that can produce JSON-formatted strings the client will pass to the WebAuthn API. The <code>toUserIdentity()</code> function converts a <code>AuthUser</code> data class to a <code>UserIdentity</code> object that can access the username, the screen name, and the all-important user handle. Traditional property getters are created with the Lombok <code>@Getter</code> annotation.</p>

   <code>public AppUser(UserIdentity user) {
    this.handle = user.getId();
    this.username = user.getName();
    this.displayName = user.getDisplayName();
}

public UserIdentity toUserIdentity() {
    return UserIdentity.builder()
        .name(getUsername())
        .displayName(getDisplayName())
        .id(getHandle())
        .build();
}
</code>   

<p>Create a Spring Data <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html"><code>CrudRepository</code></a> to manage the <code>AppUser</code> objects:</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;AppUser, Long&gt; {
    AppUser findByUsername(String name);
    AppUser findByHandle(ByteArray handle);
}
</code>   

 Credential data 

<p>The server also stores information about the user’s credentials. There is a standard <code>id</code> and a <code>name</code> field used to identify the authenticator on the server side.</p>

<p>To authenticate a credential, the server constructs an <code>AssertionRequest</code> Java object that contains the server-side information about any credential. The <code>AssertionRequest</code> is converted into JSON and sent to the browser, which it turns into <code>PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions</code> during the WebAuthn authentication ceremony. The required fields are a <code>credentialId</code>, a random byte array created by the authenticator that identifies the scope of a credential. A <code>publicKey</code> is also required, which is another array of bytes. This is generated by the authenticator’s cryptographic algorithm and is used to check the authenticity of a credential signature provided during authentication.</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.RegistrationResult;
import com.yubico.webauthn.data.AttestedCredentialData;
import com.yubico.webauthn.data.AuthenticatorAttestationResponse;
import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Lob;
import javax.persistence.ManyToOne;
import java.util.Optional;

@Entity
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Authenticator {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Lob
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private ByteArray credentialId;

    @Lob
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private ByteArray publicKey;

    @ManyToOne
    private AppUser user;

    /* The authenticator potentially provides a range of additional information. This 
     * application stores some of it to enable functionality that could be useful for
     * a production-quality web authentication project.
    */

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private Long count;

    @Lob
    @Column(nullable = true)
    private ByteArray aaguid;
}
</code>   

<p>The W3 recommendation strongly encourages authenticators to implement a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-sign-counter">signature count field</a> that increments each time the authenticator is used. By storing the 32-bit <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#signcount">signCount integer</a> provided by the authenticator, the server can verify how many times the authenticator has been used. Increasing counts are expected; if the authenticator reports a decreasing count, it should raise a red flag.</p>

<p>The <code>aaguid</code> field is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#aaguid">an identifier</a> that should be provided by authenticators (but isn’t always), which identifies the type of credential used. This can be used to verify the authenticator’s make and model. Also, it can be useful for denying access for outdated authenticators with known security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The credential data class has one constructor that uses the Yubico <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/java-webauthn-server/JavaDoc/webauthn-server-core-minimal/latest/com/yubico/webauthn/RegistrationResult.html"><code>RegistrationResult</code></a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#iface-authenticatorattestationresponse"><code>AuthenticatorAttestationResponse</code></a> object (converted from JavaScript to Java), along with a username and name for the credential.</p>

   <code>public Authenticator(RegistrationResult result, 
                     AuthenticatorAttestationResponse response, 
                     AppUser user, 
                     String name) {
    Optional&lt;AttestedCredentialData&gt; attestationData = response.getAttestation()
        .getAuthenticatorData()
        .getAttestedCredentialData();
    this.credentialId = result.getKeyId().getId();
    this.publicKey = result.getPublicKeyCose();
    this.aaguid = attestationData.get().getAaguid();
    this.count = result.getSignatureCount();
    this.name = name;
    this.user = user;
}
</code>   

<p>Create another <code>CrudRepository</code> to mange the <code>Authenticator</code> objects.</p>

   <code>import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface AuthenticatorRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Authenticator, Long&gt; {
    Optional&lt;Authenticator&gt; findByCredentialId(ByteArray credentialId);
    List&lt;Authenticator&gt; findAllByUser (AppUser user);
    List&lt;Authenticator&gt; findAllByCredentialId(ByteArray credentialId);
}
</code>   

 Application properties 

<p>Create a configuration bean to hold the application’s properties:</p>

   <code>import java.util.Set;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Configuration
@Getter
@Setter
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "authn")
public class WebAuthProperties {
    private String hostName;
    private String display;
    private Set&lt;String&gt; origin;
}
</code>   

<p>Add configuration for localhost in your <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>

   <code>authn.hostname=localhost
authn.display=Spring Boot WebAuthn Sample Application
authn.origin=http://localhost:8080
</code>   

 Implementing the WebAuthn server library 

<p>Now that the data classes exist, the next step is building classes that retrieve and store data from the WebAuthn API. Yubico provides the <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/blob/master/webauthn-server-core/src/main/java/com/yubico/webauthn/CredentialRepository.java"><code>CredentialRepository</code></a> interface to handle credential storage and lookup. The demo application’s <code>RegistrationService</code> class overrides the five functions needed for the interface to function.</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.CredentialRepository;
import com.yubico.webauthn.RegisteredCredential;
import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import com.yubico.webauthn.data.PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import lombok.Getter;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

@Getter
@Repository
public class RegistrationService implements CredentialRepository {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepo;

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticatorRepository authRepository;

    // methods added in next section    
}
</code>   

 Data interface 

<p>The <code>getCredentialIdsForUsername()</code> function is used during credential registration. Any associated credential IDs stored in the database are returned as a set of <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/java-webauthn-server/JavaDoc/webauthn-server-core/1.5.0/com/yubico/webauthn/data/PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor.html"><code>PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor</code></a> objects. This list of existing credential IDs is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#dom-publickeycredentialcreationoptions-excludecredentials">passed to the WebAuthn API</a> as a list of excluded credentials to prevent the same credential from being registered twice.</p>

   <code>@Override
public Set&lt;PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor&gt; getCredentialIdsForUsername(String username) {
    AppUser user = userRepo.findByUsername(username);
    List&lt;Authenticator&gt; auth = authRepository.findAllByUser(user);
    return auth.stream()
            .map(credential -&gt;
                PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor.builder()
                    .id(credential.getCredentialId())
                    .build())
            .collect(Collectors.toSet());
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>getUserHandleForUsername()</code> function is called during credential authentication when the user provides a username. The authenticator looks up generated credentials with the help of the user handle byte array, which the server needs to store for this purpose. The demo application uses this function to look up the user handle that’s passed into the <code>navigator.credential.get()</code> function in the browser.</p>

   <code>@Override
public Optional&lt;ByteArray&gt; getUserHandleForUsername(String username) {
    AppUser user = userRepo.findByUsername(username);
    return Optional.of(user.getHandle());
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>getUsernameForUserHandle()</code> function lets applications handle logins without usernames. The server organizes and recognizes users by means of usernames, but only user handles are necessary for the WebAuthn API to function. <code>getUsernameForUserHandle</code> can be used in login flows that don’t require usernames upfront. Hypothetically, an application could entirely dispense with usernames and identify users exclusively by unique byte array identifiers, though this application does not explore that possibility.</p>

   <code>@Override
public Optional&lt;String&gt; getUsernameForUserHandle(ByteArray userHandle) {
    AppUser user = userRepo.findByHandle(userHandle);
    return Optional.of(user.getUsername());
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>lookup()</code> function is active during the final step of credential verification. A registered authenticator provides an assertion signature and a credential ID to the browser’s WebAuthn API, which is sent to the server. The server looks up a stored credential using the credential ID and user handle provided by the authenticator. At this point, the server will use the object returned by this lookup function to validate the assertion signature (and optionally the signature count) from the authenticator.</p>

   <code>@Override
public Optional&lt;RegisteredCredential&gt; lookup(ByteArray credentialId, ByteArray userHandle) {
    Optional&lt;Authenticator&gt; auth = authRepository.findByCredentialId(credentialId);
    return auth.map(credential -&gt;
        RegisteredCredential.builder()
            .credentialId(credential.getCredentialId())
            .userHandle(credential.getUser().getHandle())
            .publicKeyCose(credential.getPublicKey())
            .signatureCount(credential.getCount())
            .build()
    );
}
</code>   

<p>In a similar way, the <code>lookupAll()</code> function returns a set of <code>RegisteredCredential</code> objects. Instead of validating the authenticator’s signature, this function ensures that there aren’t multiple credentials registered with the same credential ID.</p>

   <code>@Override
public Set&lt;RegisteredCredential&gt; lookupAll(ByteArray credentialId) {
    List&lt;Authenticator&gt; auth = authRepository.findAllByCredentialId(credentialId);
    return auth.stream()
            .map(credential -&gt;
                RegisteredCredential.builder()
                    .credentialId(credential.getCredentialId())
                    .userHandle(credential.getUser().getHandle())
                    .publicKeyCose(credential.getPublicKey())
                    .signatureCount(credential.getCount())
                    .build())
            .collect(Collectors.toSet());
}
</code>   

<p>Yubico provides a <code>RelyingParty</code> object that’s responsible for handling all authentication requests on the server, so the application constructs and provides that object to all controllers. Because WebAuthn credentials are scoped to only one website, the hostname, origin, and a display name for the website are all provided by the relying party.</p>

<p>In the <code>AppApplication</code> class define the <code>RelyingParty</code> bean:</p>

   <code>@Bean
public RelyingParty relyingParty(RegistrationRepository registrationRepository, 
                                 WebAuthProperties properties) {
    RelyingPartyIdentity rpIdentity = RelyingPartyIdentity.builder()
        .id(properties.getHostName())
        .name(properties.getDisplay())
        .build();

    return RelyingParty.builder()
        .identity(rpIdentity)
        .credentialRepository(registrationRepository)
        .origins(properties.getOrigin())
        .build();
}
</code>   
 Authentication controllers 

<p>The web controller for the application creates routes and constructs the data needed for the client to make WebAuthn API requests by:</p>

 
   Constructing JSON strings used in the registration and authentication ceremonies. 
   Caching intermediary information necessary for the secure execution of a ceremony (the challenge nonce). 
   Passing information from the browser’s credential creation ceremony to the data storage classes. 
 

<p>Create an <code>AuthController</code> class:</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.RelyingParty;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;

@Controller
public class AuthController {

    private RelyingParty relyingParty;
    private RegistrationService service;

    AuthController(RegistrationService service, RelyingParty relyingPary) {
        this.relyingParty = relyingPary;
        this.service = service;
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String welcome() {
        return "index";
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/login")
    public String loginPage() {
        return "login";
    }

    @GetMapping("/register")
    public String registerUser(Model model) {
        return "register";
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Both registration and authentication ceremonies happen in two steps. The client makes an initial request to the server with some identifier. The code below uses the username, but the user handle works as well. After prompting the user for a unique username, the server constructs a <code>PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</code> for registration, which contains the user handle, the domain of the key, and a challenge token.</p>

<p>Registration endpoints:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: These requests require server state to work properly. The authentication request includes a challenge nonce generated as part of the <code>StartRegistrationOptions</code> and <code>AssertionRequest</code> objects. The reply from the client must include this nonce, so the server uses the session to cache the short-lived challenge by caching the full registration (or assertion) request object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Information is sent to the browser, where it’s encoded and passed to the WebAuthn API as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredential"><code>PublicKeyCredential</code> object</a>. The response containing all the data needed for verification is sent to the server and used to create or verify a credential.</p>

 Start the registration ceremony 

<p>To kick off the registration ceremony, the client submits a uniquely identifying piece of information using a <code>fetch</code> request—in this case, a username. The server verifies that the username is unique and then creates and saves a 16-byte user handle. Configuration information about the server (like hostname and origin) was included in the <code>RelyingParty</code> bean when the server was created. This bean takes a <code>PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions</code> object to collect the user information, and generates a challenge field, a random buffer of at least 16 bytes long. This object is cached on the server to preserve the challenge field, then turned into a JSON string and sent to the client.</p>

<p>Once the information is received by the client, it’s parsed into a JavaScript <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#dictionary-makecredentialoptions"><code>PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</code></a> object. Then it is passed into the <code>navigator.credentials.create()</code> function as a <code>publicKey</code> option.</p>

   <code>.then(credentialCreateJson =&gt; ({
    publicKey: {
        ...credentialCreateJson.publicKey,
        challenge: base64urlToUint8array(credentialCreateJson.publicKey.challenge),
    user: {
        ...credentialCreateJson.publicKey.user,
        id: base64urlToUint8array(credentialCreateJson.publicKey.user.id),
    },
    excludeCredentials: credentialCreateJson.publicKey.excludeCredentials.map(credential =&gt; ({
        ...credential,
        id: base64urlToUint8array(credential.id),
    })),
    extensions: credentialCreateJson.publicKey.extensions,
    },
}))
.then(credentialCreateOptions =&gt;
    navigator.credentials.create(credentialCreateOptions))
</code>   

<p>The browser checks with whatever source of authentication is available to it using the “Client to Authenticator Protocol version two” (CTAP2). This check can be implemented by the operating system, browser, or by a standalone authentication device connected by USB or Bluetooth. This device generates a series of fields—the most important are <code>credentialId</code> and <code>publicKey</code> (generated from a private key the authenticator should never share). Next, the browser collates this information into a <code>PublicKeyCredential</code>, which is turned into a JSON object, stringified, and sent back to the server.</p>

   <code>.then(publicKeyCredential =&gt; ({
    type: publicKeyCredential.type,
    id: publicKeyCredential.id,
    response: {
    attestationObject: uint8arrayToBase64url(publicKeyCredential.response.attestationObject),
    clientDataJSON: uint8arrayToBase64url(publicKeyCredential.response.clientDataJSON),
    transports: publicKeyCredential.response.getTransports &amp;&amp; publicKeyCredential.response.getTransports() || [],
    },
    clientExtensionResults: publicKeyCredential.getClientExtensionResults(),
}))
.then((encodedResult) =&gt; {
    const form = document.getElementById("form");
    const formData = new FormData(form);
    formData.append("credential", JSON.stringify(encodedResult));
    return fetch("/finishauth", {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    })
})
</code>   

<p>The server receives the <code>PublicKeyCredential</code> object and verifies the challenge field against the cached <code>PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</code> object. It checks the origin of the response, then creates a new credential data object by saving the <code>PublicKey</code> and <code>credentialId</code>. The server also saves some helpful information like a user-friendly name, the associated <code>user_id</code> for username and user handle lookup, and the AAGUID field associated with the authenticator. In addition, it creates a count field for tracking the number of times the credential has been used. A simple application would probably only need to store <code>publicKey</code> and <code>credentialId</code> for the credential.</p>

<p></p>

 Client JavaScript overview 

<p>The client is generating JavaScript objects containing byte fields that are Base64Url encoded. Don’t confuse this with regular base64 encoding. Base64Url is mostly the same, but it encodes <code>-</code> and <code>_</code>, whereas the more familiar base64 encodes <code>+</code> and <code>\</code>. This enables Base64Url to safely encode filenames and URLs. When encoding and decoding strings, be sure that the application is using the correct data encoding.</p>

<p>Also, be aware that the registration and authentication ceremonies performed by the client produce and consume byte fields in the form of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array">Uint8Array</a>. The demo application uses the <a href="https://github.com/beatgammit/base64-js"><code>base64js</code></a> library to handle the encoding of these fields to and from Base64Url encoding to Uint8Array objects.</p>

   <code>function base64urlToUint8array(base64Bytes) {
    const padding = '===='.substring(0, (4 - (base64Bytes.length % 4)) % 4);
    return base64js.toByteArray((base64Bytes + padding).replace(/\//g, "_").replace(/\+/g, "-"));
}

function uint8arrayToBase64url(bytes) {
    if (bytes instanceof Uint8Array) {
        return base64js.fromByteArray(bytes).replace(/\+/g, "-").replace(/\//g, "_").replace(/=/g, "");
    } else {
        return uint8arrayToBase64url(new Uint8Array(bytes));
    }
}
</code>   

 Authentication ceremony 

<p>Registering a credential is the first step in the authentication ceremony. Using a credential is similar, but the JSON objects provided to and produced by the client are slightly different. Additionally, the function the client calls is <code>navigator.credentials.get()</code> instead of <code>create()</code>.</p>

<p>The client provides a username, which is sent to the server using a <code>fetch</code> request. This triggers the creation of an <code>AssertionRequest</code> request object, which includes an associated <code>publicKey</code>, a list of allowed <code>credentialIds</code>, and a generated <code>challenge</code> (creating the requirement that the <code>AssertionRequest</code> is cached server-side for security).</p>

<p>This <code>AssertionRequest</code> is passed to the client in a JSON response body. Any byte fields are again converted into Uint8Array objects, and the object is passed into <code>navigator.credentials.get()</code>. The resulting <code>AuthenticatorAssertionResponse</code> is Base64Url encoded and sent to the server as a JSON string. <code>clientDataJson</code>, like the server origin and challenge, are checked for tampering against the cached <code>AssertionRequest</code>; <code>authenticatorData</code> like <code>signatureCount</code> is updated and saved; and, most importantly, the <code>signature</code> field is checked against the stored <code>publicKey</code> generated during the creation ceremony. If all of these checks pass, the user is assigned a session, successfully signed in, and granted access to the application.</p>

<p></p>

 Testing the application 

<p>To test this application, pull out any <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">CTAP2-compliant authentication device</a>. The easiest is activating WebAuthn emulation in <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/webauthn/">Chrome</a>. Using one of these devices, open the network inspector and watch the network requests to get a sense of the data passed back and forth between the client and server.</p>

<p>There are other devices that can be used for WebAuthn. For a complete list, you can do a search for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">FIDO-certified products</a>:</p>

 
   Chromebook PIN 
   Windows Hello 
   YubiKey 
   Apple Touch ID 
 

<p>Start the application using your favorite IDE or run:</p>

   <code>mvn spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Then open your browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 An easier way to WebAuthn 

<p>Walking through this sample is a great way to learn how WebAuthn works in Java, but it’s still only part of an overall login experience. Your application needs a way to deal with other user scenarios, such as what to do when someone loses their YubiKey or drops their phone in a pool. Both <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/mfa-webauthn.htm">Okta</a> and <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-webauthn-passwordless-with-device-biometrics-is-now-available/">Auth0</a> make it easy to add WebAuthn factor support to your application without applying any of the code above.</p>

 Why WebAuthn is the future 

<p>Associating devices with sign-ins provides a powerful tool to make many of the challenges, failures, and abuses of passwords a thing of the past. Once initial development is complete, user registration is simpler, more secure, and more sustainable. Using the WebAuthn specification, developers can create passwordless applications with an increasingly broad and accessible range of hardware authenticators.</p>

We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Graham Williamson</a></p><p>One of the deplorable components of the Russian aggression toward Ukraine has been resumption of cyber-attacks on the electrical grid. This has highlighted the vulnerability of the electrical distribution network to this kind of attack. The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine disclosed that a Russian hacking group has recently attacked the grid’s industrial control systems.</p>
<p>The attack methodology is commonly called CrashOverRide or Industroyer. It is targeted at industrial control systems, specifically electrical grids. It is configured to use fieldbus protocols for communication with controllers and devices.</p>
 How the CrashOverRide works 
<p>The attack on the Ukraine used a multi-stage process commencing with an account takeover to gain administrative access to control systems. It has not been revealed how this was achieved, possibly by credential-stuffing with commonly used passwords or with insider assistance. It was revealed that the electricity grid management operation still uses antiquated systems, incapable of supporting modern networking and security technology.</p>
<p>Once access to a networked device has been achieved, the hacker installs a CrashOverRide module on a system capable of communicating directly with a PLCs or HMI device to change settings, operate actuators, or stop the controller altogether.</p>
 The chronic problem of OT infrastructure 
<p>The lesson is clear: the electrical grid continues to be vulnerable. This is a chronic problem with OT infrastructure where an ‘if-it’s-not-broken-don’t-fix-it’ approach is often the corporate strategy. Change is more difficult in the electrical generation and distribution sector where critical infrastructure regulation restricts the options available to management.</p>
<p>For instance, regulation maintains a strategy of IT/OT isolation by prohibiting direct network interconnection. If the need for a file transfer warrants it, staff must resort to manual transfer via secure storage media.</p>
 What can be done? 
<p>But, while change is not for the faint-hearted, it is eminently possible and the briefest of cost/benefit analysis supports increasing cyber-protection:</p>
 
 The plan for retirement of legacy systems should be accelerated. There is no excuse for the continued use of Solaris. While choosing an upgrade path is complex it must be done. 
 Communication between control systems and devices should be secured. A basic PKI installation can avoid communication compromise. 
 Monitoring solutions to detect communication anomalies on OT networks are available and effective. Once a baseline of normal communications has been achieved any change or interactive communication on the network is readily detectable. 
 Detection of a change of status for a controller, which might indicate a firmware update, is basic and should be implemented. 
 Uni-directional gateways are a promising technology that can securely support near real-time monitoring of OT infrastructure via corporate SOC and SIEM tools. 
 
<p>The war has served to highlight the problem; can it provide the motivation to fix it?</p>

<p>ECommerce business owners know that retaining loyal customers is more challenging than acquiring new&nbsp;ones.</p><p>Repeat customers are responsible for ushering in a significant amount of the revenue. According to <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/the-economics-of-e-loyalty">research</a>, improving the customer retention rate by almost 5 percent can increase profits by 25 to 95&nbsp;percent.</p><p>Additionally, repeat purchases amount to more than 40 percent of the net revenue for an eCommerce site.</p><p>Repeat purchases are an excellent parameter for judging why your store is preferred over your competitors. It shows the rate of your current customer base who frequently come back to purchase again. This is not only a metric of loyalty but also defines the business’ reputation in the retail industry.</p><p>For eCommerce businesses, it is imperative to encourage customers to keep visiting and purchasing from their platform, which will ensure the company’s sustainable growth over time. Thus, in today’s blog, we will discuss how businesses can boost their repeat purchase&nbsp;rate.</p> WHAT IS A REPEAT PURCHASE? <p>Repeat purchase refer to those made by customers who have shopped more than once. These are existing customers familiar with your brand and trust your store, so they keep returning to&nbsp;it.</p><p>The need for convenience primarily drives repeat purchases. A store’s repeat purchase rate (RPR) can range from 0 percent to 100 percent, and the higher the number, the better it is. If your business’s RPR is zero, none of your customers are coming back, and you must make improvements.</p><p><a href="https://www.verfacto.com/blog/behavioral-data/tracking-ecommerce/">Customer behavior</a> is different for repeat customers and first-time customers. In the case of eCommerce websites, repeat customers always know what they are looking for and go straight to purchase the desired product, leading to zero shopping cart abandonment.</p><p>Whereas first-time customers may take time to explore the site, find what they are looking for, explore prices, and even bounce or abandon their&nbsp;carts.</p><p>RPR is a metric that helps measuring brand&nbsp;loyalty.</p> WHY IS REPEAT PURCHASE RATE IMPORTANT? <p>The majority of eCommerce businesses tend to spend a large chunk of their marketing budget on trying to acquire new customers. However, only 41 percent of an eCommerce store’s net revenue is created by only 8 percent of its new customers.</p><p>When repeat customers frequent the same eCommerce store, it creates a halo effect. The ‘halo effect’ is a term that describes the process of consumer favoritism towards a line of products sold by a store. This is influenced by the customer’s positive experience while navigating the store. The halo effect is often correlated with repeat purchase rate and brand&nbsp;loyalty.</p><p>The opposite of the halo effect is the ‘horn effect,’ where consumers have an unfavorable experience on the store’s website. This may account for a higher bounce rate or frequent shopping cart abandonment.</p><p>There are several reasons why repeat purchases are better than first-time ones. Here are six&nbsp;reasons:</p> 1. THEY GENERATE MORE&nbsp;REVENUE <p>According to a survey conducted by BIA/Kelsey, more than 50 percent of a business’s annual revenue is generated from repeat purchases. RJMetrics also reported that repeat customers spend 300 percent more than first-time buyers.</p><p>The more times a business can convince customers to buy from its portal, its potential lifetime value is greater. The more repeat customers convert, the higher their average order value becomes compared to new customers. This is because repeat purchases are made based on a brand’s trust and&nbsp;loyalty.</p> 2. REPEAT CUSTOMERS ARE EASIER TO SELL&nbsp;TO <p>Gaining new customers is an important goal of eCommerce businesses. But when a brand has limited time and resources, it shouldn’t be wasted on acquiring new customers who may never buy anything. In fact, there is only a mere 13 percent chance of converting a prospect into a buying customer.</p><p>Things are entirely different when marketing to existing customers. By paying attention to customer service and striving to improve user experience, a brand can make existing customers want to purchase again. There is a 60 to 70 percent chance of repeat purchases, which happens because there’s already an established relationship.</p><p>For repeat customers, marketing efforts can be targeted toward customer retention.</p> 3. NEW CUSTOMERS COST THE BRAND&nbsp;MORE <p>Businesses need to be financially savvy and save money wherever they can. Keeping existing customers involves far less hassle and resources than trying to gain new ones. Studies show that attracting a potential customer can cost 5 times more than retaining existing customers.</p><p>Since most brands operate on limited money, it is wiser to focus on ensuring customer retention.</p> 4. REPEAT CUSTOMERS PROMOTE BUSINESSES <p>The best marketing tactic is through word-of-mouth of a loyal customer. Marketing is highly expensive, and getting influencers or ambassadors to endorse your brand can be&nbsp;costly.</p><p>However, by focusing on repeat business, brands can create a band of loyal customers who will willingly promote the business and market its products and services. The power of word-of-mouth referrals is unrivaled when it comes to eCommerce stores.</p><p>A study conducted by Bain &amp; Company showed that repeat customers could refer 50 percent more prospective buyers than one-time customers. In most industries, the more a customer returns to the store to make a purchase, the more they will promote the&nbsp;brand.</p> 5. THESE PURCHASES ARE INCREDIBLY PROFITABLE DURING THE HOLIDAY&nbsp;RUSH <p>During the peak season, like Christmas or wedding season, first-time customers spend only 17 percent more per transaction, but repeat customers can spend up to 25 percent more per transaction. Studies have also shown that the percentage of revenue from repeat purchases increases steadily even during a recession period.</p> 6. MOST BUSINESSES ARE BUILT ON REPEAT PURCHASES AND CUSTOMER RETENTION <p>Businesses shouldn’t be a revolving door for customers. Research shows that 64 percent of businesses with decent customer loyalty make more money. The average customer is always on the hunt for the best deals and will more likely engage with a brand that offers loyalty&nbsp;points.</p><p>Implementing loyalty and rewards programs can greatly impact the business’ growth. More than 80 percent of future profits come from 20 percent of repeat purchases.</p> HOW TO CALCULATE REPEAT PURCHASE&nbsp;RATE? <p>Calculating an eCommerce business’ RPR involves a simple mathematical formula, which considers the purchases from repeat customers divided by total purchases on the site within a given date&nbsp;range.</p><p>The formula can be expressed in the following calculation:</p><blockquote>Repeat Rate = number of customers who have shopped more than once / Number of customers</blockquote><p>For example, if your brand has 100 customers, 46 have made repeat purchases, the RPR would be 46&nbsp;percent.</p><p>Brands should track RPR daily, weekly, and monthly. This can be an important indicator of whether your efforts at boosting customer loyalty are paying&nbsp;off.</p> WHAT’S A GOOD RPR FOR ECOMMERCE? <p>Benchmarks for a good repeat purchase rate for eCommerce vary from brand to brand. Most eCommerce businesses have an average RPR of between 20 to 40&nbsp;percent.</p><p>According to former VP of Growth at Facebook, Alex Schultz, if businesses can get 20 to 30 percent of their customers coming back and making a purchase every month, it is a good sign that the brand is doing&nbsp;well.</p><p>If your brand has accumulated close to 50 percent of repeat customers, it should re-focus marketing efforts on expanding the customer base. And, if you have less than 25 percent of repeat customers, it’s time to incentivize purchases from your store and actively encourage one-time customers to buy&nbsp;again.</p><p>So, how can businesses increase their RPR? Let’s find out the&nbsp;answer!</p> 10 WAYS TO INCREASE YOUR REPEAT PURCHASE&nbsp;RATE <p>To increase the RPR, you have to deploy customer retention strategies, and these strategies help the business to acquire post-purchase value.</p><p>We have listed 10 practical strategies that can be used to increase the RPR of an eCommerce business.</p> 1. SENDING TARGETED POST-PURCHASE MESSAGES <p>One of the worst mistakes a brand can make is not following up after the customer makes the purchase. Sending targeted and personalized post-purchase messages can create a lasting impression in the customer’s mind, and this will keep your brand’s name on top when they need to re-purchase.</p><p>Targeted post-purchase messages can be sent in many creative ways. For instance, customers can receive relevant tips or a guide on using the product. Messages about similar or recommended products that the customer will enjoy can also be&nbsp;sent.</p><p>These messages can be sent via a marketing automation platform that delivers content across all channels, including email, push notifications, Whatsapp, etc.</p> 2. BUILDING AN EMAIL&nbsp;LIST <p>Sending regular and targeted emails to existing customers is a standard marketing technique to encourage repeat purchases. Sometimes, customers need to be reminded of the brand and its offerings. And to do this, building an email list is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>However, make sure that you use “send frequency optimization” and lower the frequency of your emails for customers who show declining interest.</p> 3. INCENTIVIZING THE SECOND&nbsp;PURCHASE <p>Incentivizing the second purchase is a good way to improve your RPR. Discounts, promo codes, or referral links can be effective but only if used correctly. Especially for first-time buyers, this is an excellent way of luring them back in for a second purchase.</p><p>Brands can also use AI to identify customers who haven’t purchased in a while but are browsing. This way they can engage with offers to drive your numbers&nbsp;up.</p> 4. SHOWING OFF REVIEWS AND TESTIMONIALS ON THE&nbsp;WEBSITE <p>The best way to convert a first-time buyer into a repeat customer is by leveraging other people’s opinions and reviews about the products on your website. Customers are more likely to trust brands when there is evidence that other shoppers like the&nbsp;brand.</p><p>A 2019 survey by BrightLocal proved that positive reviews could make 91 percent of customers more likely to purchase from a store. Similarly, 82 percent of customers can be discouraged by negative reviews. This framework is known as social&nbsp;proof.</p><p>Brands should highlight the positive reviews on their website by including them in landing pages, product pages, or even email campaigns. Posting pictures of happy customers is an excellent way of supporting these testimonials.</p> 5. SENDING CART ABANDONMENT EMAILS <p>More than 70 percent of customers add items to their shopping cart only to leave without completing the purchase. Every 7 out of 10 people who visit your website abandon their shopping carts. This is a missed opportunity for every eCommerce business, and a significant portion of potential revenue goes down the&nbsp;drain.</p><p>An easy solution to this problem would be sending shopping cart abandonment emails. An automated email triggered when someone leaves their cart behind can act as a provocation, encouraging some customers to go ahead with their purchases.</p> 6. IMPLEMENTING A REWARDS OR LOYALTY&nbsp;PROGRAM <p>Another effective way of improving your RPR is through rewards or loyalty programs. A strong rapport with the customer is the true driver of repeat purchases and brand&nbsp;loyalty.</p><p>Brands need to show their customers that they are valued, and this is a simple way of thanking the customer and increasing RPR. Points and rewards can be offered for every purchase the customer makes in the store, encouraging them to buy from you&nbsp;more.</p><p>For instance, H&amp;M runs one of the most robust loyalty programs where customers are rewarded with points every time they shop, and these points can be later redeemed for discounts and vouchers.</p> 7. UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION THROUGH&nbsp;SURVEYS <p>Customer feedback can help improve RPR and customer retention. If you want your customers to keep buying from you, you must determine what they think about your business.</p><p>If customers are unhappy with your business, it can result in a poor conversion rate. Through customer surveys, brands can listen to their customers, give them what they are looking for, and rebuild trust. When brands are able to solve issues by analyzing customer surveys quickly, customers are likely to stay loyal to the&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Brands need to ask the right questions during customer surveys. A few examples of customer feedback questions are:</p>  On a scale of 1–10, how likely are you to buy our products&nbsp;again?  How likely are you to recommend our business to a&nbsp;friend?  Rate your browsing experience of our app/&nbsp;website.  How satisfied are you with our product/services?  How did you learn about our&nbsp;website?   8. MAKE ORDERING FROM YOUR WEBSITE A SEAMLESS&nbsp;PROCESS <p>Customers like hassle-free websites that provide them with a seamless ordering experience, encouraging them to revisit the platform. For instance, Amazon has millions of loyal fans because ordering from its website is seamless.</p><p>One way of doing this is by letting customers create accounts on your website. They can save their billing and payment option, address, and checkout quickly whenever required, streamlining the buying&nbsp;process.</p> 9. SENDING PERSONALIZED PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS <p>Personalization has a special place in marketing. Studies show that more than 33 percent of customers are likely to abandon a business if they don’t feel a personal connection to it. When brands interact with their customers, they have data on their preferences, which can be used wisely to tailor messages.</p><p>By analyzing the customer’s previous activity on the site, brands can send personalized product recommendations. This makes customers feel heard and increases their chances of purchasing again.</p><p>Also, brands should note a customer’s birthdays and anniversaries and send special discounts and referrals on these special occasions.</p> 10. ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ON THE&nbsp;WEBSITE <p>Last but not least, superior customer service is the key to increasing repeat purchases. Although 80 percent of businesses believe they offer exceptional customer service, only 8 percent of customers feel that they are receiving adequate customer&nbsp;service.</p><p>Being responsive to customers should be a given when running an eCommerce business. If you want to build a band of loyal customers, you have to engage with them and answer their queries across social media channels. Companies that actively interact with their customers have a higher ROI than those that&nbsp;don’t.</p><p>A happy customer is a loyal customer. Therefore, eCommerce businesses should prioritize strengthening customer relationships.</p><p>Several aspects of the post-purchase experience get neglected, leading to a low repeat purchase rate. Businesses should feel prepared to take on the challenge and focus on customer retention strategies.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/repeat-purchase/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Nowadays, a lot of companies are investing in customer retention efforts. They say it’s what literally any business needs. But what exactly are these benefits? Let’s find&nbsp;out!</p> WHAT IS CUSTOMER RETENTION? <p>Before discussing the list of benefits of customer retention, let’s make it clear what it is all about. So, what is customer retention?</p><p>Customer retention refers to activities and actions that businesses take to decrease customer defection rates. Its main goal is to help businesses retain as many customers as possible through various initiatives. Examples of such initiatives are loyalty programs or reward&nbsp;systems.</p> 11 CUSTOMER RETENTION BENEFITS <p>Here are 11 top benefits of customer retention:</p> 1. IT MAKES YOUR BRAND STAND OUT FROM COMPETITION <p>From the perspective of customers, brands that make an effort to interact with them show how much they value their patronage. Unfortunately, there are only a few who genuinely do this which is why it’s a great opportunity to make your brand stand&nbsp;out.</p><p>Moreover, a lot of brands are more focused on acquiring new customers instead of retaining their old ones. This makes businesses that are retention-centric even more noticeable in the competition.</p> 2. YOU CAN EARN MORE WITH LOYAL CUSTOMERS <p>Research reveals that engaged customers spend 60% more per transaction and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170815005733/en/Prices-Raise-Customer-Loyalty">buy 90% more</a> than new customers. In contrast, disengaged customers can cost brands to lose some of their revenues. These customers refer to those that are actively spreading opposing options against the&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In addition, loyal customers also tend to be more accepting of price increases. However, you should just increase your prices needless with the confidence that they will stick around because they are loyal to your brand. Remember, the end goal is lifetime revenue so think of long-term outcomes.</p> 3. CUSTOMER RETENTION IS MORE COST-EFFECTIVE THAN ACQUISITION <p>If you do the math, it is more expensive to invest in efforts to acquire new customers compared to the investment you need to make for customer retention. This is because you have to invest in the following to attract a new customer&nbsp;base:</p>  Social media marketing  Email campaigns  SEO  PPC  Retargeting ads  Web banners  Prospecting leads  Outbound sales  <p>Each of these customer acquisition approaches has a hard cost. Besides that, they are labor-intensive and time-consuming. When you look at the result, you’ll realize that customer retention efforts often can yield higher numbers across various&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>There have been several pieces of research proving this claim. However, although retention is much more cost-effective than acquisition, there’s no denying that it is not an easy feat to accomplish.</p> 4. IT ALLOWS YOU TO UPSELL AND CROSS-SELL <p>Another major benefit of customer retention is that it allows you to upsell and cross-sell your products and services.</p><p>One of the most common mistakes many sales teams make is that they assume that once they sell something to a particular customer, then that is the end of it all. However, they don’t realize that by using customer retention, they are in the perfect position to know the needs and pains of their customers, allowing them to upsell and cross-sell their products and services.</p> 5. IT’S BETTER FOR THE EMPLOYEES’ WELL-BEING <p>Customer retention is very similar to relationship building and a good relationship is much healthier for everyone involved since it’s mutually beneficial. On the other hand, sales are always transactional. They are price sensitive and affected by various&nbsp;factors.</p><p>Because of the nature of sales, a lot of employees struggle with meeting their regular quota because it’s not easy to convert strangers into paying customers. This is where focusing on being relational through customer retention can help. There’s less chance for engaged customers to switch brands when there are signs of trouble, protecting your revenue and making your employees’ lives a lot&nbsp;easier.</p><p>Sure, customers are important for all businesses. However, employees are equally as important because they make the day-to-day operation run. This is why you should also pay attention to their well-being, instead of being solely customer-centric.</p> 6. YOU CAN HAVE ROOM TO EXPERIMENT <p>Being able to establish a solid customer base allows you to expand the boundaries of your brand and explore new things. Whether this may be a new product line or messaging, a loyal customer base will still be there for&nbsp;you.</p><p>The important thing is, you should maintain the main reasons why they are loyal to you in the first place and they will stay with you no matter what new things you introduce.</p> 7. CUSTOMERS WILL WELCOME YOUR MARKETING EFFORT <p>A lot of people easily get annoyed with marketing efforts, especially when there is a disconnect between them and the brand. This is exactly why email marketing campaigns fail mostly because a lot of customers unsubscribe, making it ineffective.</p><p>However, that is not the case for loyal customers. Loyal customers love to hear about new promotions and discounts that their brands have to offer. In some cases, even if they initially did not have the intention to buy, seeing the marketing effort can push them into making purchases almost immediately after.</p> 8. LOYAL CUSTOMERS ARE MORE UNDERSTANDING <p>Poor customer service can be very detrimental to a business. In fact, a study shows that <a href="https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/customer-experience-statistics">$1.6 trillion</a> is lost yearly because customers switch to other brands after experiencing bad customer service. It’s safe to say that it’s one of the main reasons why customers switch to another&nbsp;brand.</p><p>However, loyal customers tend to have more tolerance for customer service shortcomings. Of course, this does not mean that it should be turned into a norm since the goal should be to consistently provide high-quality and consistent customer&nbsp;care.</p> 9. MORE CUSTOMERS WILL EXPLORE YOUR&nbsp;BRAND <p>A brand that has proven itself with its flagship product or service has a higher chance of encouraging its customers to check their other products and services. These customers are also more likely to consider the newly launched products and services from this&nbsp;brand.</p><p>The simple act of exploring what are the other things your brand has to offer can be very valuable for sales revenues. At the same time, these customers can also provide vital feedback regarding the honest quality of the product and services and how they could be further improved later&nbsp;on.</p> 10. LOYAL CUSTOMERS PROVIDE MORE&nbsp;FEEDBACK <p>Customer feedback plays a vital role in the success of a business. It can serve as a guide on essential business decisions regarding your products and services. It also provides you with a clear direction on which aspects you have to improve. Unfortunately, it’s rare to see customers who take time out of their busy lives and provide businesses with feedback unless they are loyal to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Whether it’s positive or negative, receiving feedback from customers is a good thing. Bad feedback is an opportunity to show them that you genuinely care about their satisfaction. Plus, the fact that you make an effort to improve based on negative feedback will make you stand out since most businesses out there just leave them unresolved.</p> 11. WORD OF THE MOUTH REFERRALS ALLOWS YOU TO EARN&nbsp;MORE <p>You also get acquisition benefits from doing customer retention efforts. This is because your loyal customers will be the ones who will be bringing new business.</p><p>Loyal customers who are confident with your products and service won’t hesitate to recommend you to their brands and services. This is a very prominent trend, especially among millennials who are not shy about sharing their brand preferences online.</p> TIPS ON HOW TO INCREASE CUSTOMER RETENTION <p>There’s no denying that the benefits of customer retention can help a business soar to greater heights. With this in mind, here are some customer retention tips that you might want to consider applying to your business.</p> KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER RETENTION RATE <p>The first thing that you have to do to increase your customer retention rate is to know what your current rate is in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>You can compute your customer retention rate for a specific period by subtracting the newly acquired customers and dividing it by the number of customers that you originally had at the start of the period. The result of this will then be multiplied by 100 to get your total retention rate.</p><p>Your retention rate will show you how happy customers are and how they value the products and services that you are providing. It will also reveal if your source of revenue is reliable or if you have to make some improvements.</p> INCREASE YOUR ENGAGEMENT <p>Increasing your retention rates means that you should also up your customer engagement efforts. Convincing customers to become repeat buyers requires target effort to help earn their trust. The best approach to doing this is by actively engaging with&nbsp;them.</p><p>There are several ways for you to increase your engagement with your customers. Some examples include the following:</p>  Personalize content  Make it easy for customers to reach out to&nbsp;you  Take advantage of social&nbsp;media  Make your brand meaningful and relatable   BUILD TRUST <p>Trust is the foundation of a good relationship between a company and its customers. However, establishing this is easier said than done. But, there are basically 2 main things that you should always remember:</p>  Building trust takes&nbsp;time  Don’t assume that just because customers trust you then they will automatically buy from&nbsp;you.  <p>There is no one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to building trust. However, one of the main things that you should focus on if this is your goal is making sure that you are reliable and you consistently deliver value to customers. It would also help if you follow through with your brand promises and&nbsp;claims.</p> USE VARIOUS COMMUNICATION CHANNELS <p>In this day and age, there are various communication options available at a person’s disposal. If you want to increase your customer retention, you should take advantage of&nbsp;it.</p><p>When reaching out to customers, it’s also highly recommended to maintain a communication calendar. Don’t just send them a message or email on holidays and special occasions. You should also make an effort to re-establish your relationship by asking customers how they are doing from time to&nbsp;time.</p><p>However, make sure to be strategic when reaching out to customers. Your approach must still follow the essence of your brand tone and messaging.</p><p>Conversely, it should also be easy for customers to reach out to you if they have concerns or questions. You should make it more accessible for them to leave comments and reviews regarding the products and services that you have to offer. The best way of doing that is by opening various communication channels other than the traditional emails and phone&nbsp;numbers.</p> FINAL WORDS <p>When done right, customer retention can significantly help make your business successful. However, it does have a learning curve and you need to invest time, money, and effort into the process. But, given the list of benefits mentioned above, those efforts will eventually pay&nbsp;off.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/retention-benefits/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

 Time to Have YOUR&nbsp;Say. <blockquote>Time: 5am, April 25th, 2022–5am May 2nd, 2022&nbsp;(UTC)</blockquote><p>At the start of April, Ontology announced the launch of their <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-promotes-web3-and-privacy-innovation-through-dorahacks-hackathon-and-100k-usd-developer-be8b5cea4f54">$100,000 global virtual hackathon with DoraHacks</a>, to help BUIDL the future of Web3. The Ontology grants program is running between the 1st-30th April, and offers Web3 developers the opportunity to showcase their ideas, particularly around privacy and decentralized identity.</p><p>Projects are being submitted at the official DoraHacks <a href="https://dorahacks.io/grant/ontology/">portal</a>, and developers are encouraged to keep submitting their projects, with more details available in the handy Dorahacks <a href="https://dorahacks.io/blog/guides/ontology-grant-hackathon-voting-guide/">guide</a>.</p><p>Of course, with all of these great ideas being submitted, we’re going to need some help voting for the winners. This is where you can help to vote for the projects you like, and increase the prize pool available to them. All of your votes will count towards the prize pool for developers, providing even greater incentives for them to build the Web3 we want to experience.</p><p>To thank you for taking the time to vote, we have over 1500 ONG to give away to people who take the time to vote for their favorite projects. Taking part couldn’t be easier, simply follow the official <a href="https://publicdocs.gitbook.io/onto-web-help-center/guides/interact-with-dapps/ontology-x-dorahacks-hackathon-voting-guide">VOTING&nbsp;GUIDE</a>.</p> Rules:  1. First-Come-First-Served (900&nbsp;ONG) <p>The first 300 participants voting for candidate projects in the Ontology Grant Hackathon, will each earn 3&nbsp;ONG.</p> 2. Top Voters (390&nbsp;ONG) <p>The 10 participants with the highest vote total will share the ONG reward&nbsp;pool</p><blockquote>Top 1: 100&nbsp;ONG</blockquote><blockquote>Top 2: 70&nbsp;ONG</blockquote><blockquote>Top 3: 50&nbsp;ONG</blockquote><blockquote>Top 4–6: 30 ONG&nbsp;each</blockquote><blockquote>Top 7–10: 20 ONG&nbsp;each</blockquote><p>* If there are winners with the same number of votes, the corresponding rewards will be shared&nbsp;equally.</p> 3. Lucky Draw (300&nbsp;ONG) <p>Every vote you make equals one lucky draw ticket. 10 winners will each win 30 ONG in the&nbsp;draw.</p><p>Note that according to the <a href="https://dorahacks.io/blog/guides/ontology-grant-hackathon-voting-guide/">voting rules</a>, “The Nth vote towards the same project will cost N*1 ONG, so if you’re going to give 3 votes to the same project, you need to pay 1+2+3=6 ONG”. If you give 3 votes to 3 different projects, you need to pay 1+1+1=3&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>* Each participant can be rewarded only once. (The highest reward will be&nbsp;taken.)</p><p>ONG used for voting will not be returned to the voter, but will go to the project they voted for (minus a 5% protocol&nbsp;fee).</p><p>The Ontology team will reserve the final rights of interpretation of this&nbsp;event.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

Tether를 대체하는 Stablecoin(USD $1 등 pegging, 고정된 가치를 유지하는)의 비전을 제시했고, 은행과 유사한 자산관리의 가능성을 Compound가, 그리고 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX)의 개념을 Uniswap 같은 곳에서 제시하기&nbsp;시작했다.</p><p>이에 더해 2020년과 작년 DeFi 2.0 시대를 이야기하면서 Protocol to control liquidity, 자산의 유동성에 대한 개념들이 나타나면서 Yield farming 같은 이자 농사나 기존 금융과 유사한 파생상품, 합성자산 등 다양한 시도들이 이루어졌다. 최근 들어서 아예 DeFi 3.0을 언급하면서 Money Lego(레고 조립하듯이 맞다)라는 용어들도 등장하면서, 내부 DeFi 팀에서 실험적으로 진행했던 프로젝트들이 어느 정도 구체화되는 단계가 드디어 된 것 같다. 이는 최근 코인플러그가 전문 파트너사와 JV(합자법인)으로 출범한 <a href="https://uupfi.com/">Uupfi</a>나 <a href="https://deltafinance.io/">DeltaFinance</a> 같은 DeFi 사업들의 출발점에&nbsp;해당한다.</p><p>메타디움의 첫 DApp 제품이었던 <a href="https://metadium.com/products#keepin-application">Keepin</a>과 코인플러그의 보다 한국형(?) 서비스인 <a href="https://www.mykeepin.com">MYKEEPiN(마이키핀)</a>은 모두 DID(Decentralized ID, 탈중앙화 신원증명) 기반 서비스들인데, 이는 다른 말로 ‘신원인증 지갑'이라고도 불린다. NFT 소유뿐만 아니라 인증 정보들이 각종 기술로서 구현되어 있는데, 이는 이러한 DeFi 생태계에 있어서 극도로 단순화하여 보통 강의에서 설명하는 ‘지갑과 노드와의 연결'이라는 블록체인 내에서 토큰 정보뿐만 아니라 각종 투표와 승인 과정에 있어서 이용자를 연결하는 이정표 역할을 하게&nbsp;된다.</p>각종 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX, Decentralized Exchanges)들이 이러한 DeFi 2.0 시장을 견인해왔다. © <a href="https://medium.com/@keplerswap_dex/whats-the-difference-between-defi-2-0-vs-defi-1-0-3be77ea02004">Keplerswap</a> Web3라고 불리는 User-owned Internet에서도 DID와 지갑(Wallet)은 모든 것의 시작점이&nbsp;된다 <p>최근 가장 많이 사용되고 있는 지갑인 MetaMask를 비롯해, 코인플러그도 한국 법제에 맞춰 마이키핀월렛(MYKEEPiN Wallet)의 <a href="https://news.naver.com/main/read.naver?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=101&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0010905389">가상자산사업자 인증</a>(VASP, Virtual Asset Service Provider) 등을 통해 관련 사업들을 진행하고 있는데, 메타디움의 DID도 역시 이런 근간을 통해 관련 사업들이 추진된다. 보다 리워드 생태계를 투명하고 공정하게 관리하기 위해 메타디움 기반으로 <a href="https://news.naver.com/main/read.naver?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=105&amp;oid=421&amp;aid=0006036026">신규 토큰 발행을 진행 예정인 THEPOL</a>이나, 앞으로 공개할 신규 프로젝트들이 모두 이런 시작점으로서 DID가 활용되는&nbsp;구조이다.</p><p>특히 대표적으로 mirror.xyz나 DEX를 비롯한 각종 탈중앙화 커뮤니티, Web3 서비스들은 기존 SSO(Single sign-on, 통합로그인) 사업자인 Google, Facebook, Naver 같은 대형 중앙화된 사업자의 계정이 아닌, 내가 소유한 탈중앙화된 지갑주소, DID 계정으로 로그인하는 것이 당연하게 Web3 환경에서 공통적으로 구현되고 있다. 가장 유명한 MetaMask를 개발한 Consensys가 <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-surpasses-21-million-maus-as-consensys-raises-200-million-to-make-web3-universally-easy-to-use-access-and-build-on/">작년 11월 21M MAU</a>(월간 이용자 2,100만명) 돌파, 지난 라운드 대비 최근 2배 이상의 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/15/metamask-parent-company-consensys-raises-series-d-at-7b-valuation/">기업가치 $7B(3월, 8.4조 규모) 평가, 투자유치</a>를 받은 것을 볼 때, 이 분야는 매우 빠른 성장 속도를 보여주고&nbsp;있다.</p><p>벤처캐피탈(VC) 등 투자업계도 마찬가지여서 다들 인터넷을 편하게 우리가 지금처럼 쓸 수 있도록 만들어준 Mosaic 브라우저와 최초의 상용화된 브라우저인 Netscape를 만든 Marc Andreessen과, 지금은 우리가 쓰는 메신저나 슬랙(Slack) 같은 협업 도구 — SaaS (Software as a Service)라는 개념과 DevOps 개념을 제시했던 Opsware의 Ben Horowitz가 만든 A16Z (Andreessen Horowitz)가 가장 이 분야에 적극적인 투자를 보여주는데, 이들 투자 포트폴리오 상위 3개 카테고리는 다름 아닌 DeFi, NFT / Digital Ownership, Security / Privacy&nbsp;분야이다.</p><a href="https://medium.com/@nick.5montana/a16z-crypto-portfolio-breakdown-89836229def7">https://medium.com/@nick.5montana/a16z-crypto-portfolio-breakdown-89836229def7</a> Metadium 팀과 함께 먼저 선보인 NFT 마켓에 이어 DeFi 로드맵이 드디어 곧 공개될&nbsp;예정이다 <p>격변하는 시장 분위기 탓인지, 작년부터 부쩍 관련 문의들을 코인플러그는 물론 Metadium Team도 동일하게 요청받고 있어서, 지금까지 진행해온 경험적 자산을 바탕으로 향후 새로운 로드맵을 함께 정비 중에 있다. 최근 ReFi(Re-imagined Finance)를 표방한 곳이나 DeFi 3.0이라 언급하고 있는 다양한 자산들을 다루는 기술들을 종합하고, 코인플러그 역시 IRL(In Real Life) 현실 세계와 연결된 DID 기술과 경험으로서 보다 적극적으로 메타디움 팀과 협력하고자&nbsp;한다.</p><p>최근 발표한 관광이나 배달, 물류 등에서 친환경 전기차를 통해 추진하는 EMC(Energy/Mobility Cluster) 컨소시엄 역시 주로 코인플러그에서 그동안 쌓아온 전통적 IT 서비스 기술 영역의 대표 사례들 — 부산 블록체인 특구사업에서 보여준 DID의 지방정부 활용 사례, 경기도 퓨처쇼에서 보여준 실제 방문 현장에서의 신원인증과 관련된 사례, 그리고 주문배송 O2O 사업에서 보여준 운전면허 인증이나 대표적인 실생활 사례에서 오는 각종 Legacy 비즈니스와 맞닿을 경우 파급력 높게 이 시장이 성장할 수 있을 것으로&nbsp;기대한다.</p><p>앞으로 공시 외에도 양사 간 메타디움(Medium) 공식 채널 등을 통해 보다 더 자세하게 로드맵과 연관된 프로젝트들의 의미, 추진 상황 등을 지속적으로 공유할 계획이다. 한국 기업 중 협력하실 분들은 언제든지 <a href="https://mykeepin.org">마이키핀얼라이언스</a> 통해서 가입/연락 주시면 관련된 네트워킹을 비롯해 신규 프로젝트 중 적합한 사례들을 연결하여, 지금까지 다소 진입장벽이 높았던 DeFi 프로젝트들의 실제 생활에서의 사례를 만드는 과정에 함께할&nbsp;예정이다.</p><p>Stay tuned!</p><p>코인플러그 &amp; 메타디움&nbsp;팀</p><p><a href="https://mykeepin.org">마이키핀 얼라이언스</a></p><p>최근 업데이트된 코인플러그 웹사이트도 한 번 방문하시면 그동안에 쌓여있는 경험 자산들을 확인해 보실 수 있다.

<p>Blocko Signs An MOU With Bespin Global To Promote Blockchain MSP (Managed Service Provider)Business</p>Blocko Has Just Signed The Largest MOU In Its History: Bespin Global Has 2000 Enterprise Customers!<p>Introduction: The Great Cooperation: Blocko And&nbsp;Bespin</p>Bespin Global and Blocko signed a business agreement to promote the blockchain MSP business. (Left) Han-Joo Lee, CEO of Bespin Global, and Jae Shin, Executive Vice President of Blocko&nbsp;(Right)<p>It is evident that Blocko has made massive strides to become one of the largest service providers for enterprise blockchains, not only in Korea, but globally. Today, Blocko is proud to announce that Bespin Global and Blocko have signed an MOU to establish a cooperative system to promote the blockchain MSP (Managed Service Provider) business. These two enterprise grade behemoths compliment one another through mutually related industries. Bespin Global, whose aim is to be the world’s most automated management company meets blockchain specialization through the enterprise grade reliability and expertise of Blocko. This dynamic paradigm will emphasize and promote blockchain and cloud technology support through technological collaboration and specific know-how and solution models. This business agreement was made with the primary goal of providing blockchain technology conveniently and safely to corporate customers.</p><p>The Close Cooperation Model: The Compliments Of Enterprise Business Agreements</p>Bespin Global: Helping You Adopt Cloud Through Bespin And Blockchain Through&nbsp;Blocko<p>There is always a reason, a goal and a vision behind business collaborations; they’re never made haphazardly without a defined goal. These two companies plan to establish a close cooperation system for the successful initiation and implementation of the blockchain-specialized MSP project to cooperate with each other. Blocko will provide its technological know-how and related solutions as a blockchain specialized company, and Bespin Global will also support cloud technology know-how, networks and solutions. Blocko is a blockchain-specialized MSP (Managed Service Provider) that helps anyone easily use the often times complex blockchain systems that enterprises are still attempting how to utilize to their benefit, simultaneously it reduces the troubles of companies adopting blockchain through the Aergo mainnet-based blockchain technology.</p><p>Bespin Global is a cloud delivery platform company that provides comprehensive cloud services such as migration to the cloud environment, construction, operation, management, DevOps, big data, and security. Hanju Lee, CEO of Bespin Global, said, “Through this MOU, Bespin Global’s experience of operating cloud-based services for over 2,000 customers and Blocko’s unrivaled blockchain technology are combined. I am confident that the partnership between the two companies will be a new leap forward in the blockchain management and operation industry. We will collaborate with Jonghwan Kim.” Jonghwan Kim, CEO of Blocko emphasized “blockchain is a technological innovation with infinite potential for future development. Through this agreement, Bespin Global will be able to receive support for cloud operation management know-how. We hope that the mutual cooperation between the two companies will serve as an opportunity to easily provide blockchain-based services to more customers, such as the STO (Security Token Disclosure) service, which has recently been in rapid demand.” Now I know AERGO token holders are wondering “how does this benefit me as a token holder”, well, the possibilities are numerous.</p><p>The Bespin And Blocko Collaboration: AERGO Possibilities: Endless: 2000 Enterprise Customers</p>2000 Enterprise Customers From Bespin Global Will Be Introduced To AERGO: Its Time To Show You&nbsp;How<p>Bespin Global, specializing in cloud IT software, aims to utilize the AERGO mainnet through a variety of ways, adding to the utility of the platform on an immense scale. Bespin Global has expressed interest in converting their enterprise customers with a point system to an STO based platform that is, you heard it here first, on the AERGO mainnet! Jae Shin has begun to train the Bespin salesforce as well as the engineers to turn this vision into a concrete reality of utility for the AERGO mainnet. Not only will an STO based platform be utilized on the AERGO mainnet in association with Bespin Global, but increased utility will occur with GEMPAY, as it will play a massive role in this brand new paradigm; PlusFi will also be a major role in accordance to Bespin&nbsp;Global.</p><p>Through the utilization of GEMPAY, the net result of accelerated adoption of the AERGO token has the potential to be massive. GEMPAY will be the wallet that will hold all the various new tokens onboarded by enterprise clients as well as AERGO mainnet tokens; now why is this important, because it introduces enterprise customers to the AERGO platform and the AERGO mainnet tokens. The successful amalgamation of an STO platform as a service, built on the AERGO platform for new enterprise customers and the Bespin salesforce introducing this platform to their two-thousand enterprise clients cannot be overstated. PlusFi will also play a major role in these new inductions into the AERGO ecosystem. If you aren’t aware of the intricacies of PlusFi, think of it as the KlaySwap Service for the AERGO platform: PlusFi is the AERGO Swap Service. The AERGO Gem will be the stable token pegged to the Korean Won. As more tokens within the ecosystem are successfully issued and launched, there will be a necessary hub for swaps, this is where PlusFi comes in! Our expectation is that new token issuers will provide liquidity for their swaps, adding more liquidity into the AERGO sphere. The opportunities for AERGO’s expansion, with this brand new collaboration, are&nbsp;endless!</p><p>Conclusion: The Blocko Expansion: Fueling The Accelerated Adoption Of&nbsp;AERGO</p>As Blocko Expands, AERGO Adoption&nbsp;Expands<p>It is evident that the MOU between Blocko and Bespin Global will onboard numerous enterprise grade clients into the AERGO ecosystem through the expertise delivered by both of these companies. This is a massive feat for Blocko and Bespin Global alike; successfully amalgamating their mutual expertise’s to develop solutions for one another, while simultaneously enabling over two-thousand clients to interact with the AERGO mainnet, it is a complete win for every enterprise involved. This fostering of relationships are what propel businesses forward, and in this case, Blocko, Bespin Global and&nbsp;AERGO.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing involves substantial risk.

 build-in “Dynamic Analysis”, or risk-based authentication, in alignment with Zero Trust 
 perform access reconciliations 
 harden systems and servers

 use file integrity monitoring 
 deploy and integrate Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) 
 utilize strong data and transport layer encryption 
 use key management. 
 
<p>All of the items on the list above are good generic recommendations for any organization. Though PCI-DSS 4.0 was only recently published and will not fully take effect for up to three years, it’s never too early to suggest improvements. What follows is an examination of some of the provisions in PCI-DSS 4.0. <br><br>Section 1.4.4: “System components that store cardholder data are not directly accessible from untrusted networks.” The notion of trusted and untrusted networks is outdated and ineffective today. The <a href="https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=930420">principles of Zero Trust Architecture</a> mandate proper authentication and authorization for each resource access attempt, regardless of source network or IP address. This is necessary, but not necessarily easy, to reduce risks of attacks that originate from what may have once been considered the trusted network. PCI-DSS 4.0 does refer to the NIST SP 800-207 but should have been more prescriptive about using Zero Trust as a basis for all aspects of implementation. <br><br><br>Figure 1: How Zero Trust Spans Multiple Areas of IT <br><br>Section 2.2.2 provides guidance for how to manage and use vendor default accounts. These accounts are defined as “…accounts and passwords, including, but not limited to, those used by operating systems, software that provides security services, application and system accounts, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, payment applications, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) defaults” (p.64). PCI-DSS 4.0 states that such passwords be changed in accordance with requirement 8.3.6, or to have inactive accounts disabled.&nbsp; Ideally, passwords should be eliminated with passwordless, risk-analysis-based, multi-factor authentication methods. For situations where service accounts with passwords still exist, PCI-DSS 4.0 should have mandated the use of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80200/privileged-access-management">Privileged Access Management solutions</a>. The related technology of password vaults is mentioned in sections 8.2.3 and 8.6.2-3. <br><br>Section 4.2.1 mentions that exploits are available for old SSL and “early TLS” crypto. TLS 1.3 is the current version and should be at least recommended. Given the context around Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, we understand that full scale replacement of so many devices in the field will take some time. &nbsp;<br><br>Section 5.2.1-3 requires the use of anti-malware solutions on all systems that are at risk from malware. This leaves an out for systems that cannot run anti-malware agents or are not thought to be at risk: “Certain systems, at a given point in time, may not currently be commonly targeted or affected by malware. However, industry trends for malware can change quickly, so it is important for organizations to be aware of new malware that might affect their systems” (p. 115). KuppingerCole encourages the use of full Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR) solutions wherever possible. If for some reason components of your architecture don’t support EPDR agents, then use other controls and monitoring tools such as Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR). <br><br>Section 8 pertains to “Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components” (p. 163).&nbsp; This section applies to employees, contractors, consultants, and other 3rd-parties, but intentionally does not address accounts held by consumers or cardholders. It loosely differentiates between identification and authentication. US NIST SP 800-63 is mentioned, but no clear processes for identity proofing or provisioning are defined. Group accounts are discouraged but not disallowed. Identity de-provisioning is required for terminated users, and user accounts must be at least disabled after 90 days of inactivity. Sessions should timeout after 15 minutes. &nbsp;<br><br>Section 8.3.3 says that a user identity must be verified before allowing modification to authentication factors. This is a good recommendation, but it is followed with an example of using Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) or using “security questions”. KBA is an extremely weak form of authentication and/or identification and should be avoided if possible. &nbsp;<br><br>Section 11.4 states that internal and external penetration testing should be performed every 12 months. Annual pen testing is insufficient. Organizations in this industry should instead use more state-of-the-art Attack Surface Management tools. &nbsp;<br><br>Section 11.5 calls for Intrusion Detection Systems to be used in critical areas. Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) tools are the more modern and effective alternatives. <br><br>PCI-DSS 4.0 does make some headway in prescribing security posture enhancements. Identity management components, though, are not as well defined as they should be. However, the reality is that the organizations that make up the payment services and broader financial services ecosystems are motivated to go beyond PCI-DSS <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research?q=Fraud+Reduction">to reduce the ever-present and seemingly ever-increasing risks of fraud</a>. Moreover, members of the payment services and financial services industries have specifications from other industry consortia and differing regulations in various jurisdictions to consider when building and upgrading their infrastructure. Mappings and/or harmonizations between these specifications and regulations would be useful. Explicit references to governmental standards such as EU PSD2 (Strong Customer Authentication) and US NIST SP 800-63 (Authentication Assurance Levels) would be helpful as well. <br><br>Building compliant systems and then demonstrating compliance with specifications such as PCI-DSS requires effort and expense but are necessary to reduce fraud.
