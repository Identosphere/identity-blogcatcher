<p>As we near the end of another year it seems like a great point to reflect on what has come to pass. In today’s fast-paced world, the emphasis tends to be focusing on future plans; what deliverables are in our roadmap, what partnerships are on the horizon, and how we can best structure our team for future success. However, finding time to reflect is also essential as it helps us to understand and analyze what worked well, what didn’t, and our general direction and velocity of travel. With that in mind, this post will look back at what 2021 had in store while offering a brief glimpse into our plans for 2022.</p><p>Rather than give a blow by blow account of each month as it happened, because that would be very boring and tedious, we’ve identified some broad themes that developed throughout the year, these were:</p>  Tech delivery  Shift from engineering to adoption and partnerships  Team scaling  <p>Tech Delivery</p><p>To use a soccer commentator's cliche, 2021 was a “game of two halves”. The first 6 or so months represented a heavy focus on feature development and several upgrades for the Dock Blockchain. The start of the year saw Dock finish what it started in late 2020 with the completion of the token migration, we even <a href="https://blog.dock.io/migration-extension-announcement/">extended</a> this to ensure we brought as many token holders with us from the Ethereum Network over to Dock’s new chain. Approximately, 97.2% or all tokens were migrated (circa 972M) and those that migrated within the first 5 weeks were awarded a token bonus by the Dock treasury. Looking back, we’re delighted with this result. Migrations are highly complex and involve multiple third parties (security auditors, exchanges, legal, etc...), and completing this securely while also keeping other aspects of the roadmap on track is a testament to the dedication and commitment of the team and the support of our amazing community. And the result is certainly worth it, as we describe later in this post the utility the Dock ecosystem derives from our native token is evident in several areas.</p><p>Network upgrades</p><p>Network upgrades continued just as the migration was drawing to a close, and at the end of March, we integrated our mainnet with Parity’s <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier">Frontier project</a> making it possible to deploy smart contracts written in Solidity on Dock. Our specific requirement for this addition was to enable us to integrate Dock’s mainnet with Chainlink’s price feed, enabling network services to be provided to issuers in USD. However, in addition to our initial use case, the integration significantly increases what can be created on Dock, such as; the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which we created a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/eth/tutorials/src/tutorial_evm.md#dao">tutorial</a> for, the issuance of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and decentralized application development.</p><p>Around this time we also released a feature that had come up several times in calls with organizations that were considering using Verifiable Credential platforms, and that is the ability to make Dock’s credentials <a href="https://blog.dock.io/delegatable-credentials-now-available/">delegatable</a>. For example, a government may want to allow private test centers to manage issuance of certain licenses on its behalf. Or a professional organization may delegate the credentialing authority to online learning platforms, so that the members who complete courses on the platforms can receive verifiable credentials that are officially recognized by the organization. This feature was extended a few months later by enabling delegators to publicly attest delegations by adding details of delegation to their Decentralized Identity documents on the Dock blockchain while also enabling credential Verifiers to search for delegation details publicly posted on-chain. Delegatable Credentials is a feature that continues to come up in our partnership discussions and is utilized in pilots, a worthy addition to Dock’s product suite.</p><p>As summer descended on western Europe, Dock released arguably the biggest milestone of our year when we moved from our Proof of Authority network to Proof of Stake. This achievement took many months of planning and execution from the entire team. While Dock engineers worked with security auditors to ensure the upgrade was being carried out securely and successfully launched a testnet before the mainnet upgrade, the operations team recruited and worked with more validator teams as our validator count rose from 11 to 50 during the transition. Quality was certainly the focus and the Dock ecosystem is fortunate to be supported by a number of validating partners including; Ovrhd, Everstake, Stakin, MyCointainer, Ryabina along with a host of independents.</p><p>We also worked with exchange partners to ensure they had updated their wallets to run on our upgraded chain, which is in essence an entirely different network to what we had before. It was not possible to keep the previous chain state and roll it into the new network and we, therefore, had our block explorer, Subscan, host both our <a href="https://dock-poa.subscan.io/">PoA chain</a>, frozen after 7.6M blocks, and our new <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/">PoS chain</a>. &nbsp;At the time of writing the new chain has been running for 160 days uninterrupted and has produced over 4.5M blocks at the time of writing, while 12.4% of circulating supply is currently staked.</p><p>The upgrade to PoS was so important for the network as it further decentralized control by not only increasing the number of validators, as mentioned previously, but also it meant that the Dock Association no longer had any control over deciding who the validators were. Under PoS, Network algorithms now determine who becomes one of the 50 active validators based on the amount of stake they hold. The validator elections take place continually and are held every 12 hours. In addition, we now also have community governance features in place as a result of this upgrade, and recently our first referenda was <a href="https://blog.dock.io/referenda-1-approved-network-rewards-split-to-adjust-to-50-50/">successfully passed</a> increasing the rewards received by the validators and stakers.</p><p>Adoption, growth, and partnerships</p><p>The second theme that emerged through 2021 was adoption and growth. Essentially, now that we have a network in place, how do we maximize its use? The approach we have taken is two-fold, first, what technical things can we build to make the consumption of our network as easy and efficient as possible. The second aspect is operational, what relationships can we build and what processes can we put in place for technical teams to start to build on Dock. In fact, 2021 was a busy year for partnerships, we concluded the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-awarded-contract-to-advise-german-development-agency-on-professional-profile-data-wallet-for-global-learners/">work we had started</a> with German development agency Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), assisting them with the technical architecture and features for a professional profile data wallet for their learning platform. As a slight aside, those who follow Dock closely will know that we released our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/launch-of-the-dock-wallet-app/">mobile wallet</a> into the app stores this month. Not only can community members now store, send, receive, and manage Dock tokens from their mobile device, it will serve as an important gateway to several planned Dock innovations.</p><p>We also <a href="https://blog.dock.io/hackathon-winners-ovrhd-build-solution-on-dock/">worked with Ovrhd</a>, a startup that was using Dock to not only win a Hackathon, but also work with the Dutch Government in the Hague to use Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity to create a tokenized urban ecosystem, in which tokens are used to manage crowds and enable voting procedures within the community.</p><p>Ease of use</p><p>As the year progressed, and the basic features were in place, we started to think about how we can make the network easier to use and the tools we could provide to encourage adoption within this very new yet exciting world of verifiable credentials and decentralized identity. &nbsp;This thinking was developed in conjunction with companies like international identity verification provider, Credenxia, who are <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-leaps-into-the-future-with-docks-api/">collaborating</a> with Dock to build a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials. Our answer was to <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-to-release-verifiable-credentials-api/">build an API</a> (Application Programming Interface) that simplified the development process by taking care of key management and hiding the requirement for Dock tokens to process network transactions (this is managed by Dock) enabling payment for API usage to be made in $USD. Essentially, the API enables less complex and faster integrations and is certainly desirable with almost all companies we have spoken with. This includes <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-partners-with-digital-credentialing-platform-xertify/">Xertify</a> who is integrating with Dock’s blockchain infrastructure and tools to facilitate issuance of their healthcare credentials. At present, Dock has had around 2,500 signups to our API with around half of these identifying themselves as developers, product, and business owners. So demand certainly seems to be strong and as we prepare to enter 2022 we’re very optimistic the volume of issuer partners will grow rapidly.</p><p>It is important to note that the partnerships formed during the year were not just issuers of Dock, growing adoption can take many forms, and late in November, we co-sponsored the world’s <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-co-sponsor-dao-hackathon/">biggest Hackathon</a> focussed on utilizing decentralized tech stacks. At the time of writing over 2,500 participants have signed up and we\re all looking forward to seeing the outcome of the event with Dock’s challenge to participants focussing on; Self-Sovereign Identity, Workforce Training, Know Your Customer (KYC), Learning &amp; Academia, and Health &amp; Safety. &nbsp;We also recently <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-collaborates-with-transak/">completed an integration</a> with leading fiat on/off ramp, Transak, whose service enables the purchase of DOCK via bank transfer and/or card payments in multiple international currencies in over 60 countries.</p><p>Team growth</p><p>It was clear at the start of 2021 that in order to support our aggressive roadmap and ambition we had to increase the number of team members, as well as acquire some additional skills. During the course of the year, the team has grown by around 42% up to our current complement of 14. We have already hired another blockchain engineer who will start in January but we’ll introduce him when the time comes.</p><p>This year we have added a Mobile (React) Developer, Head of Business Development, Solution Architect, Content Marketer, QA and Test Automation Specialist, Project Manager, and a Cryptographic Advisor. Moving forward, we will be looking to add to our mobile development team to increase our development velocity. We have a lot of plans here and we want to bring them to market as quickly as possible, while we will also be increasing our marketing team.</p><p>It is worth noting that on the whole recruitment has been very challenging this year and certainly it is a seller's market. Any blockchain experience in development roles certainly carries a significant cost premium and with many projects with large treasuries and funding pools to draw from the market is very fast-moving and highly competitive. As a result, it took longer than anticipated to recruit for certain roles, even working with professional recruiters. There is no indication that 2022 will be any different.</p><p>Looking forward</p><p>While this is a reflective post, it would also be remiss not to consider what can be expected for 2022. We will continue our drive to keep making Dock easier to use, for issuers but also for the token holder and staking community. We know that the user experience of staking through our <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/explorer">front-end app</a> certainly has room for improvement and we’re going to be improving this in several ways. Our integration with the hardware wallet, Ledger, is at the final stage, and certainly staking through Ledger reduces some of the complexity and the number of steps involved. We’re also going to be integrating staking into our newly launched mobile wallet and soon-to-be-released web wallet. And of course, for those who prefer the simplicity of centralized, custodial staking, this will be available with some of our existing exchange partners soon.</p><p>We’ll also be working to continue our blockchain innovation with features like traceable credentials, range proofs, and we’ll be working to build bridges between Dock and other blockchains to increase utility of the DOCK token while also adding other options for blockchain developers. And finally, we plan on continuing our effort to engage the Dock community through our forums, our governance process, as well as through projects like our newly launched Ambassador program and our up and coming Grants Program. Watch our social channels for more details.</p><p>We’re hugely proud of what we have been able to achieve this year, particularly as a small yet growing team. None of this would be possible without the amazing support of our partners and of course, the Dock community, many of whom give our team members, and the project, backing above and beyond the call of duty.</p><p>Thanks for an amazing year and best wishes to everyone for a healthy and prosperous 2022!</p>

Interoperability — SSI supports interoperability across different systems  <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</a> — This is a process by which one entity can prove if a statement is true by revealing as little information as required.  Portability — SSI supports the use of data formats that are portable across&nbsp;devices.  Secure — Since it uses cryptography and blockchain, the information tends to be&nbsp;secure.  <p>These principles provide a ton of flexibility and benefits for both individuals and organizations, and the society at&nbsp;large.</p> Benefits for Individuals <p>For individuals, it is a safe and secure way to store and share their information with others, all the while being in control of what is happening with their data. This is a big shift from the existing <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">federated identity</a> and other centralized systems where organizations store and control the way users’ data is shared and&nbsp;used.</p> Benefits for Organizations <p>SSI is beneficial for organizations too, as it streamlines the customer onboarding process and at the same time, enables the organization to comply with the growing privacy and security legislation.</p><p>With SSI, organizations no longer have to spend resources in protecting and managing users’&nbsp;data.</p> Benefits for the&nbsp;Society <p>SSI helps society as a whole by reducing the number of data hacks and by providing a framework for governance. It can provide the much-needed privacy and security that are necessary to enhance the trust factor among&nbsp;users.</p><p>Now that you know the benefits of SSI, how can you leverage&nbsp;it?</p><p>While there are many ways to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/do-you-need-blockchain-for-enabling-ssi-452d62b34890">implement SSI</a>, we will focus on its implementation through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p> Elements of a Verifiable Credential <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> are open standards to represent digital identities. These credentials are expressed using JSON and are digitally signed, thereby making them tamper-proof and machine verifiable.</p><p>Here’s how a VC looks&nbsp;like.</p> {  “@context”: [      “https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",      “https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"  ],  “id”: “http://example.edu/credentials/58473",  “type”: [“VerifiableCredential”, “AlumniCredential”],  “issuer”: “https://example.edu/issuers/565049",  “issuanceDate”: “2010–01–01T00:00:00Z”,  “credentialSubject”: {      “id”: “did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21”,      “alumniOf”: {          “id”: “did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1”,          “name”: [{              “value”: “Example University”,              “lang”: “en”           }, {      “value”: “Exemple d’Université”,      “lang”: “fr”      }]    }  },    “proof”: { … }  } <p>Source: w3.org</p><p>If you look closely at the VC, it contains the following elements.</p> Context <p>The context provides a background to what’s coming and in the case of a VC, it always starts with “@”. This is an ordered set where the first is always the URI — <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1">https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1</a>. This lets the other systems know that this is a VC and will process it accordingly.</p> ID <p>This element helps to identify a particular object or credential and is unique for every VC. Since this ID doesn’t change, it can be used across devices and platforms to represent the thing. This element can take only one&nbsp;value.</p> Type <p>Type is a mandatory field that identifies whether the rest of the JSON code is a verifiable credential or not. Also, it must mention what kind of a credential it is, such as a passport, university degree, driver’s license, and&nbsp;more.</p> Issuer <p>The issuer is the entity issuing the credential and along with the holder and verifier, it forms what’s called a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>.</p> Credential Subject <p>This is the core part of the VC and describes the VC itself. It talks about the holder and can have many properties such as id, name of the attribute, its value, etc. There is no defined format for this part of the VC as it depends largely on the VC&nbsp;type.</p><p>For example, if the VC is a university degree, its attributes would be the name of the university, the degree of the holder, year of passing, etc. On the other hand, if the VC is the holder’s passport, it will contain information such as first name, last name, address, date of birth,&nbsp;etc.</p> Proof <p>This is the last element of a VC and is a mandatory one as it contains the digital signature of the issuer. This is the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">cryptographic part</a> that authenticates the rest of the information in the VC, and this is the attribute that makes the VC tamper-proof and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>You can explore different VC types with <a href="https://schema.affinidi.com/">Affinidi’s Schema&nbsp;Manager</a>.</p><p>Also, visit the <a href="https://build.affinidi.com/">Dev Portal</a> to learn more about SSI and VC, and how you can leverage our tech stack to generate and issue VCs and to build SSI-based apps.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/an-in-depth-exploration-of-self-sovereign-identity-and-verifiable-credentials-1a3eb2296004">An In-Depth Exploration of Self-Sovereign Identity and Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bio-key.com/">BIO-key</a> is trying to make its PortalGuard Identity-as-a-Service platform more user friendly with the release of an updated Admin Panel. The Admin Panel allows IT departments to manage their organization’s security posture from a single centralized location, which in turn allows them to reduce costs while closing any security vulnerabilities.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, administrators can use the Admin Panel to manage all of the users with access to their organization’s network, and to set access permissions for each of those individuals. In doing so, administrators can ensure that only those with the proper clearance are able to gain access to particularly sensitive information.</p>



<p>The Admin Panel can also be used to generate reports, and to view an auditable record of access control events. PortalGuard itself comes with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-extends-portalguard-coverage-with-new-sso-concierge-062306/">Single Sign-on (SSO)</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-upgrades-portalguard-with-new-palm-authentication-feature-051003/">multi-factor authentication</a> capabilities, which gives IT teams the ability to set extremely granular security policies for different aspects of the organization. For example, security professionals can integrate corporate applications into the organization’s SSO framework, or set stricter authentication requirements for people who are logging in remotely.</p>



<p>Administrators can access the Admin Panel through a web browser on any standard computer and mobile device. The platform can be used to create a Zero Trust security ecosystem, and can do so while minimizing both financial costs and the workload on the IT department. With that in mind, BIO-key is pitching PortalGuard as an affordable option for organizations that want to strengthen their security posture in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>As it stands, the majority of cybersecurity professionals believe that they do not have the staff they need to implement an effective security policy. The improved Admin Panel arrives shortly after the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-survey-shows-many-organizations-still-relying-on-passwords-even-when-they-know-better-121305/">publication of a report</a> that found that 48 percent of organizations believe that a lack of resources is one of the key barriers preventing them from switching to a Zero Trust model.</p>



<p>“With limited IT resources and the significant gap in available cybersecurity talent across all industries, most organizations are struggling to figure out how to do more with less,” said PortalGuard President Mark Cochran. “The inspiration for the next generation of our admin experience was consistent customer feedback seeking solutions that are easy to manage, flexible, efficient, and can empower the IT team.”</p>



<p>BIO-key has provided PortalGuard services for multiple <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/orange-county-elections-office-supplements-bio-key-fingerprint-scanners-with-portalguard-iam-solution-082706/">government agencies</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-provides-portalguard-services-oklahoma-wesleyan-university-110205/">academic institutions</a>. The company has credited the platform for its strong performance in its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/portalguard-drives-core-business-of-bio-key-in-q3-update/">most recent quarterly report</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/">Innovatrics</a> has shared more details about the steps that it has taken to improve its passive liveness detection algorithm. To that end, the company noted that most spoofs are attempted with either low quality images, or (somewhat ironically) with extremely high-quality images that are sharper than they would be if taken in real time.</p>



  



<p>As a result, Innovatrics was able to improve the accuracy of its system by adding a pair of filters that automatically reject liveness photos that fall above or below a certain quality threshold. In the case of low-quality photos, the system is unable to determine whether or not it is looking at a real face, or the face of an imposter, a doll, or someone wearing a mask. In those situations, Innovatrics’ platform will not accept the photo for the liveness check, and will instead ask the user to submit another image.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-adds-passive-liveness-detection-to-biometric-facial-recognition-solution-904211/">passive liveness system</a> can also provide users with feedback to make it easier to capture a satisfactory photo. For example, those using Innovatrics’ <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-shows-off-onboarding-capabilities-with-dot-demo-app-083105/">Digital Onboarding Toolkit</a> (which features the liveness tech) may be asked to move to better lighting, and the platform has an auto-capture feature that can automatically take a selfie when the necessary quality conditions are met.</p>



<p>Images that are too crisp, on the other hand, are only as sharp as they are because someone has taken a picture of a photo displayed on a screen. Filtering for sharpness therefore yields similar benefits to filtering for a lack of clarity.</p>



<p>According to Innovatrics, the idea for quality filters during the liveness check emerged from a study that used the same technique to guard against various forms of racial and gender bias in facial recognition systems. Getting rid of poor images makes the entire system more accurate, since it is not trying to make a decision based on edge cases, and is instead only verifying someone’s presence (or their identity) when it is confident in the result.</p>



<p>Innovatrics’ passive liveness system had already achieved <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-passes-level-2-ibeta-biometric-presentation-attack-detection-testing-705101/">iBeta Level 2 certification</a> before introducing the new filters. The company also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-adds-two-new-algorithms-passive-liveness-detection-platform-102805/">added new algorithms</a> to the passive liveness solution in October. The Digital Onboarding Toolkit, meanwhile, uses a combination of face and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-explains-how-digital-onboarding-toolkit-verifies-identity-documents-042606/">document recognition</a> to verify the identities of people signing up for services online.</p>

 <a href="https://www.aware.com/"></a> 



<p><a href="https://www.aware.com/">Aware</a> sits at the forefront of a movement. The company is best known for its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/awares-knomi-platform-can-now-recognize-voice-biometrics-905201/">multimodal Knomi authentication platform</a>, which <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-announces-update-for-on-device-version-of-knomi/">runs on mobile devices</a> and offers support for both face and voice recognition. The solution can be used for remote onboarding and for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-pushes-knomi-contactless-access-control-applications-081807/">contactless access control</a>, two services that have been in extremely high demand since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That has translated to a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-displays-dramatic-year-over-year-improvement-q2-report-072905/">strong year for Aware</a>. The company processed more transactions in the first six months of 2021 than it did in all of 2021, and that growth has continued into the second half of the year. Aware CEO Bob Eckel discussed the company’s recent success with FindBiometrics Multimedia Editor Eric Weiss in our latest executive interview. He also addressed the mobile biometrics trend, and explained how solutions like Knomi will enable better and safer user experiences moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: Mobile onboarding has been one of the biggest stories of the past two years, and Aware is one of the many companies that’s benefited from that trend. You just signed a new <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/imprivata-epcs-self-enrollment-solution-features-aware-knomi-tech-706071/">partnership with Imprivata</a> for their healthcare technology, for example. Why has there been so much recent interest in biometric onboarding technology and what kind of impact can a solution like Knomi have for an organization that needs a safe and convenient way to identify their customers?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: The adoption of biometrics in general has been on the rise for some time. When you add in the global COVID-19 pandemic, interest in biometrics, remote onboarding and authentication really accelerated. Suddenly in-person onboarding workflows were impossible or unwanted, and mobile onboarding methodologies started to take over. People didn’t want to leave their homes and they didn’t want to travel to a local bank or an office to conduct their business. The companies that did rely on in-person methodologies needed to pivot.</p>



<p>The entire purpose of onboarding is to get to know your customers – KYC – or your employees when you enroll them. Without strong security, the risk of imposters or identity theft increases, and this is where we believe biometrics come in. Biometrics are inherently a very secure authentication method because they use our unique physical characteristics. Mobile biometric onboarding – such as Aware’s Knomi solution – empowers organizations to onboard new customers and employees, and there’s no sacrificing of security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You also mentioned convenience, and it’s a key element of biometric onboarding that Aware is focused on. Modern biometrics process using almost any smartphone or device. It doesn’t require complicated passwords or security questions, and it can be very convenient compared to other methods. At Aware, we’ve intentionally invested the ability to tailor our Knomi framework to optimize the friction/security balance. Each financial institution, or retail, or whoever tailors it to what they’re trying to do – whether it’s increased security, fraud prevention, or onboarding quickly – depending on the transaction value or size. Even before COVID, there was a big uptake, and interest in the technology has been growing around the world. Just see the benefits: you get to own your identity and control it when you use it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s really the focus of Aware and the Knomi platform: it allows a truly biometric alternative to passwords and traditional multifactor authentication. It’s multimodal. You can use speaker authentication as well as face authentication. You can access financial accounts. You can put in additional security. And it’s software. It’s not a hardware solution at all. You can use your smartphone, or your internet browser. It increases accessibility and provides access to government programs and social programs. Knomi has already provided more than 43 million transactions globally, and this continues to grow daily. In my earnings call we talked about 31 million through Q3. But overall, the total is 43 million transactions globally, so that’s almost a 4X increase in transactions over just last year. It’s working. Our customers using Knomi serve about 20 million users and 30,000 organizations across the globe. It’s a good product that we’ve been getting a lot of traction on, not just because of its robustness, but its ability to tailor to the environment that they’re in. We’re very excited about the product.</p>



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: You did touch on it at the end of your answer there, but Aware has been posting some really stellar numbers in your past two quarterly reports. You also hinted that you processed more transactions in the first six months of this year than you did in all of 2020. What’s been driving that recent success, and what do you need to do to make sure you stay on that trajectory moving forward?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: You’re correct. We did surpass our 2020 transactions. We’re now up to more than 43 million transactions protected by Knomi worldwide. We’ve seen growth over the last five quarters and it’s not just a testament to the adoption of biometrics and the value proposition. We’re seeing a growing need and desire for biometric solutions, both commercially and in the government space. In the commercial space, identity fraud is driving demand, and it’s contributed to our surge in the past year. Additionally, in the government space – where I know they’re looking at imposter scams, such as tax refund fraud – it’s also driving increased adoption. Then you get into contactless travel and border management—being able to get through borders or being able to do a transaction just by looking at a reader and not having to touch anything or get close.</p>



<p>Our offerings address these and improve the peace of mind of the stakeholders, both on the business side and the consumer side alike. The volume is a testament to the strength and the scalability of this particular product. New customers are looking at it and its effectiveness. We’re anticipating market needs and contactless solutions, and then we’ll be able to continue beyond Knomi. There is also a consumption-based need. You have people who want to buy just what they need to use, and through our SaaS offerings, they’ll be able to get that as well, based on our Knomi framework.</p>



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: One of the big use cases you’ve been talking about is contactless access control, especially for businesses that are trying to reopen in the middle of the pandemic. What are the benefits of a platform like Knomi in that particular use case for corporations that want to bring people back to the office, and what kind of feedback have you received from clients that have deployed the solution in those kinds of settings?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: Typical visitor access control systems usually require key fobs, key cards, kiosks, or somebody at the front desk to check in. These things, when they’re lost, could be security hazards. Key cards can be stolen. They’re not tightly associated with anyone, and potentially grant outside individuals access to the company’s sensitive assets. Biometric technology avoids the need for these physical elements. Only the authorized individuals gain access to the buildings or the digital assets. Part of that is even through your mobile device. One of the key things that we’re focused on is the touchless solution and not having to change the infrastructure; essentially being able to use existing front desk kiosks or tablets. It can leverage the cameras that are there, or the microphones that are there within your smart device – a lot of buildings have it already.</p>



<p>The nice thing about the technology that we have is that it uses the existing infrastructure and biometric access. You’re controlling it, it’s quick. And since it’s software, it can be integrated in and tied into it. Some of the software could be downloaded as part of the application, or built-in and to get fast access. You can reduce costs as well. We’re making sure that the barrier to entry of using biometrics is as small as possible and putting control back in the individual’s hands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: Could you elaborate a little bit on the kind of concrete benefits some of the people who have deployed your technology are starting to report in their own workforce? What kind of responses do you get once the system is up and running?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: They don’t need to have a manned area, somebody that checks them in and checks them out. It can be added to the access control system. You show up, it pings you, you look at your phone, and you’re able to walk right in. If that’s not accessible to you, you can speak into a speaker recognition [device] and do that. It’s simple, it cuts costs. It also can be used for things like timekeeping. The people that are using it are just saying, “Wow, this is easy. It’s easy to use. It’s intuitive. I’m always looking at my phone anyways. I have it with me.” And if your phone or device is lost, anyone who finds it doesn’t get access to sensitive assets.</p>



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: The use case you were just talking about is a corporate private use case. It’s a smaller number of people. What if you’re talking about the general public, or even if you’re talking about a public facing business, like a restaurant or a theater, or a retail outlet? Do the benefits of Knomi change at all when you’re in one of those more public-facing environments, or even when you’re in a corporate environment where you have to worry about <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-makes-case-face-based-visitor-management-systems-060301/">visitor management</a>?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: We don’t think so. Mobile biometrics lets Knomi operate virtually in any setting, so it’s flexible. It’s a framework that allows you to be incorporated into nearly any solution, if you have your own existing applications or are using another application. We’re actively working on solutions for events and hospitality spaces. I absolutely see a future where people can attend a show or a game safely and conveniently using biometrics. You own your ticket, you’d go through. Plus, with age dependent purchases, such as alcohol or the like, you can ensure that the individual can make the purchase without having to repeat and show the identification over and over.</p>



<p>The nice thing about that too is, when you do that, they don’t need to know where you live or have any more information about you whatsoever. You’re biometrically enabled to go through. In these cases, you’ve opted in, and are pre-registered with the particular club or the venue. Once you opt in, it can be shared across multiple venues, multiple events, so you don’t have to keep doing it over and over again.</p>



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: Are we going to start to see this new scenario where mobile onboarding technology is actually going to make your in-person experience better, once we are able to go to spaces like games and theaters more comfortably again?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: Yes. We’re testing a few things out, but as it’s married with the venue that you’re going to, you’ll be able to go through with less friction. It’s a different version of the fast pass or fast lane that you see on a highway that takes a picture of your license plate, which isn’t that personal. You go in, and you control it as you go in, and it knows you’re supposed to be there. It’ll speed things up. It’ll make it convenient. It’s in your hands as well. If somebody else claims to be you, then it’s easy to tell it’s not, and you don’t get inconvenienced.</p>



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: We’ve been talking about Knomi, which offers support for two main biometric modalities. You have face authentication and speaker authentication, and it can also run on several different types of technologies. You’ve looked at mobile devices. You’ve talked about the kiosks or tablets you might already have in a workspace. Are you seeing more of an interest in one technology relative to the other? Are you seeing more of an interest in mobile tech for in-person solutions, or are you seeing more interest in face or speaker authentication?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: I think it’s safe to say that facial recognition drives the greatest interest. For the most part it’s because people have heard of this technology for a longer time and you’re starting to see it in action, whether you go through a travel checkpoint or unlock your smartphone. Speaker recognition hasn’t achieved the same level of general awareness. I’m talking about speaker recognition, not speech recognition. This isn’t about&nbsp;understanding what you say and creating an action. It’s about a speaker that is recognized. Are they the person authorized to do what they are doing? It’s less about “what did they say,” more about “are they authorized?” “Is that really the person?” With our text-independent capability, it doesn’t matter what you’re saying. If you’ve consented and enrolled your voice, Knomi can validate that you are you. Now you can use it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why I gave the access control case. You can come in and get pinged when it’s not convenient for you to use your face, but now you could use your voice and speaker recognition. I expect it to grow as people begin to use it and understand, and the combination of face and speaker recognition gives you the multimodal option. You can use it in series, you can use it reverse, you can use it as fused. Let’s say you have an asset you’re really trying to protect. Speaker recognition, as well as face recognition, fused gives you a higher level of confidence. You have to say a couple of words along with presenting your face. A lot of these technologies are starting to resonate because people had to get used to it, or didn’t want to touch things relative to COVID-19. As people are traveling, they’re saying, “Gee, why can’t we do this?” You start to see more and more kiosks use facial recognition. To get that next level, mobile technology, the kiosks, the fixed stations will all start to use both.</p>



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: You’ve recently integrated your iris recognition software with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-iris-id-team-up-to-provide-joint-ngi-offering-706221/">Iris ID’s iris recognition hardware</a>. I know that that particular partnership is focused on law enforcement applications, and accessing FBI databases, but are you expecting to see any other applications of the technology? Are other sectors going to be interested in this iris tech?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: Our relationship with Iris ID was designed to empower local agencies to use advanced biometrics and improve their identification capability. State and local law enforcement can take advantage of the FBI’s Next Generation iris service. They can drive adoption now, with fast, accurate iris-based identification for criminal justice use cases at any level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other part of your question is outside of law enforcement, can it be used for a number of civil applications? Whether it’s in healthcare, human resources, visitor management – just think of it as another modality of biometrics in addition to face and voice that we talked about. Of course, there’s fingerprint, too. Each of these accomplishes the same result: it ensures a user is authorized to perform a certain task, but uses a different biometric based on the use case.</p>



<p>My feeling is that iris identification lends itself very well to in-person use cases. You can see it being used for access, but you need a device. If you have the infrastructure set up, or want to have it set up, we’re ready to go. Our software and technology is compatible with all the modalities. It’s just a matter of taking advantage of the infrastructure that gets in place as we grow.</p>



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: You mentioned before that face authentication has been leading over speaker authentication because people are more familiar with the technology. Where does iris recognition sit on that spectrum of technology that people are comfortable with? Is it one they need to learn more about before they want to use more readily?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: &nbsp;Iris seems like it’s more personal or physical. Typically, a lot of the technology requires you to get fairly close. Facial recognition or speaker recognition is just what you’re normally used to doing – looking at your phone to open it, or looking at something to get access, or speaking. Iris is not really accessible from your own device. I think part of this comfort level is because it’s on your own device. You can speak into it. I think for government applications or some other specific lens of high security, iris recognition is fine. It is quick, but to get an opt-in it just gets into your personal space a little bit more.</p>



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: We’ve talked about the biometric market as it currently is, especially in the wake of COVID-19, but how do you think the biometrics market is going to evolve in these next few years as we do start to emerge from this global health crisis?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: I believe, in the near term, adoption of biometric technologies will continue to rise. People will use it for many processes that are done today, but at a level that’s more secure and under your control, such as account access, or password replacement, or for physical access. We expect the technology being a key driver to ending password-based authentication. Passwords, as you know, have been shown to be fraud-prone. Large scale data breaches, identity theft happening regularly – with all the security challenges and frustrations with using them, like password resets, it’s less convenient. When you forget a password you need to figure out where you wrote it down, or you need to get access and go through multifactor authentication again. Biometrics, especially if you use a couple modalities – let’s say you had access using your face but the lighting that isn’t great or it’s in your pocket – you can do speaker recognition instead. I think that’ll gain some adoption. I also think touchless solutions were brought forward by the COVID pandemic. I don’t think those are going away. I was just on a flight, and contactless biometrics doesn’t just mitigate the germ spread. It’s convenient. We’re getting used to it. It can be applied to a ton of use cases, like we talked about: visitor access management, point of sale purchases, and visiting a hospital environment, or an assisted living facility.</p>



<p>At Aware – and this is my personal stance – we expect biometrics to be the key driver for enabling people to own their identity so they can control it. Our goal as a company is to empower people to do just that. Give them the means to protect their personal information and decide when and where their personal information is used, and how much. If you want to buy alcohol you should be able to do that once you’ve opted in. There’s plenty of chains and clubs that you can opt into and get authenticated, so when you show up, you don’t have to break out your license and be compromised. All they need to know is that you’re of age. Ultimately, I think it’s going to give the power and the control back to the individual.</p>



<p>Eric Weiss, Multimedia Editor, FindBiometrics: Any closing thoughts that you want to leave our readers with?</p>



<p>Bob Eckel, CEO, Aware, Inc.: I think that the key thing for us is to make sure that individuals are able to own their identity, and control the use of it. As this all becomes better, if there are data breaches and things like that, it will be less likely that everybody’s data is being compromised because it will be better protected and backed up with forensics. Finally, we are a big proponent of the ethical use of biometrics. It’s the proper ethical use of biometrics that matters most, and we think it will enable individuals to control their identity and their future.</p>

<p>A trio of Canadian provinces are once again cracking down on Clearview AI. The privacy commissioners of British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec were part of an investigation that ruled that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/commissioners-rule-clearviews-data-collection-practices-violate-canadian-privacy-laws-020410/">Clearview violated Canadian privacy laws</a> in February, and have now ordered the company to stop <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-quietly-sells-face-recognition-tech-law-enforcement-agencies-012008/">collecting images of Canadians without consent</a>, and to delete any such images that are already in their system. Clearview has also been ordered to stop using and sharing those images in its facial recognition operations.</p>



  



<p>The news is noteworthy because the three provincial orders are binding in a way that earlier Federal orders are not. Canada’s Federal Privacy Commissioner asked Clearview to stop collecting new images (and to delete old ones) in February. However, the Federal Commissioner does not have enforcement powers. Canada’s provincial privacy laws (at least in the three provinces in question) are actually stricter than the federal one, and carry more legal backing.</p>



<p>“We welcome these important actions taken by our provincial counterparts,” said Federal Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien. “While Clearview stopped offering its services in Canada during the investigation, it had refused to cease the collection and use of Canadians’ data or delete images already collected.”</p>



<p>The injunction further bars Clearview from selling facial recognition services in British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec. Clearview <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-ends-all-contracts-canada-response-privacy-investigations-070706/">suspended all of its operations in Canada</a> when the privacy commissioners first opened their investigation in 2020, though the decision was voluntary at that time. The new order prevents Clearview from returning to the three jurisdictions.</p>



<p>For its part, Clearview has already indicated that it intends to ignore the new orders, just as it ignored Therrien’s federal order earlier in the year. An attorney for the company has argued that it has no obligation to follow the provincial edicts because it has stopped offering services in the country. The company has also pleaded incompetence, to the extent that the company claims that it cannot comply with the order because it cannot determine which photos were taken in Canada or depict Canadian citizens.</p>



<p>On that front, BC privacy commissioner Michael McEvoy has tried to call the company’s bluff, noting that Clearview has claimed that it can sort its database by region in a US court proceeding in which it pledged to limit its data collection practices in Illinois. Clearview has repeatedly expressed open disdain for international privacy laws, and has tried to argue that they <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-claims-legal-injunction-would-violate-first-amendment-rights-081905/">do not apply to images posted to the internet</a>. Courts have tended to disagree, with both <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/australian-information-commissioner-finds-clearview-violated-privacy-act-110901/">Australia</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-ai-could-face-17-million-fine-privacy-violations-uk-120301/">the UK</a> finding that the company has violated their domestic privacy legislation.</p>

<p>In that regard, PingOne Authorize is geared toward financial institutions, healthcare providers, and other establishments that need to safeguard sensitive personal data while still giving people access to the information they need to conduct their business. Administrators can use the platform’s centralized dashboard to customize their permission policies based on their business model and their desired level of risk.</p>



<p>PingOne Authorize provides consolidated coverage for all of an organization’s applications, APIs, and databases. Once active, it can be configured to take a wide range of factors into account, including user behavior and the nature of the request. The platform can also gauge the amount of risk present in the interaction, and take action accordingly. In some cases, permissions can be set in advance. In others, the platform will <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-securedtouch-lands-patent-for-continuous-user-authentication-072204/">analyze the situation in real time</a> before granting someone conditional access to certain information.</p>



<p>PingOne Authorize is a cloud service, which allows organizations to get up and running with the solution more quickly. Ping Identity indicated that the solution will allow organizations to deliver a better user experience while still guarding against fraud and adhering to any relevant privacy regulations.</p>



<p>“The dynamic authorization management market is set for explosive growth over the next decade thanks to its ability to give enterprises the greatest level of control over what users can see or do while still delivering an amazing user experience,” said Ping Identity Founder and CEO Andre Durand. “PingOne Authorize establishes a new standard for dynamic authorization by allowing enterprises to easily control authorization logic and update data access policies in minutes in a cloud environment.”</p>



<p>Ping Identity added <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/pingone-cloud-gets-behavioral-biometric-capabilities-101203/">behavioral biometrics capabilities</a> to the PingOne Cloud Platform in October, leveraging technology that came through its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ping-identity-acquires-behavioral-biometrics-specialist/">June acquisition of SecuredTouch</a>. The company also introduced selfie onboarding with <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/ping-identity-launches-face-based-onboarding-solution-020209/">PingOne Verify</a> earlier in the year.</p>

This enables eligibility in upcoming Funding Rounds.

Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>4. Veteran&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $35,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 5 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>Above are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects for OceanDAO Grants Round 13. The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  24,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  12,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  134,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>A total of 200K OCEAN is available.</p><p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core Tech Working Group</a> has prioritized these this core tech, integrations, or applications. Items on the list for a round have a special earmark in that grants round. Here are some&nbsp;items:</p>  Enhance Ocean’s Fine-Grained Permissions to support <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (vs. just Ethereum addresses) in allowlist and&nbsp;denylist  First-class integration with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSockets</a> as a data&nbsp;service.

They can qualify again for funding up to 35,000 OCEAN conditional that Unleash Data projects:</p>  “Unleash data” has actually always had a broad intent, towards driving Data Consume Volume. It is intended for projects like: becoming a data broker to get data owners’ data into Ocean Market, networking / “hitting the phones” to increase consumption on Ocean Market, integrating Filecoin &amp; publishing data on Ocean Market, etc. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#3-unleash-data">Here are further examples</a>. It was never meant to be solely for constructing / maintaining a small number of datasets.  Whatever is proposed should be high value-add to the Ocean ecosystem.  Example of poor value-add: requesting a lot of OCEAN to construct / maintain a small number of datasets to sell with expectation of profit. We expect and encourage OceanDAO voters to downvote such proposals.  <p>Burning becomes Recycling</p><p>Starting Round 13, any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the Treasury.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">For intuition on how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>Funding Rules</p><p>Starting in R13, burning and earmark rules have been updated. Burning has been disabled, remaining funds in Earmarks are made available in General Category, and any final remaining funds are returned to the treasury. You can find all the steps&nbsp;below:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  Any remaining funds inside an Earmark, are then moved towards [General&nbsp;Grants]  [New &amp; Core Tech] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Categories].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds inside the [General Grants] Category are moved back to the treasury.  <p>Voting &amp; Ballot&nbsp;Design</p><p>We have continued with the use of Weighted Ballots which has improving voter representation. In this model, OCEAN can only be used once to support or downvote projects.</p><p>This will continue to be the voting method until Quadratic Voting is released. For further information on Single Ballot and Weighted Ballots, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Voting">please visit our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>Working Groups &amp;&nbsp;Stewards</p><p>Head to the <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> and dive into each Working Group. There you will find each Working Group’s respective documents, stewards, members list, meeting times, and&nbsp;more:</p>  Project Guiding Working&nbsp;Group  Parameters &amp; Roadmap Working&nbsp;Group  Core Tech Working&nbsp;Group  OceanDAO Engineering Working&nbsp;Group  Data Consume Volume Working&nbsp;Group  <p>Working Group&nbsp;Legos</p>  Each Working Group has its own public discord sub-channel.

<p>One reason the UK Government wants to abolish citizens’ rights to data protection is to create conditions for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to blossom. This, it says, will “bring incredible benefits to our lives”. This third blog in our series prompted by the Government’s proposed reforms (‘Data: A New Direction’) examines the flaws in the Government’s arguments.</p>  You need lots of data to ‘do’ AI. But it doesn’t have to be personal data. It can, and should, be anonymised data. So there is no need to reform data protection law to promote AI’s potential.  Most of the hopes (and fears) pinned on AI, along with many of its mis-uses and abuses, stem from a basic misconception about what AI is. AI does not replicate or substitute for human intelligence. Calculation is not the same as perception. Computation is not the same as intelligence. The real power of AI comes from its ability to do things that humans can’t do, rather than replace what they can do. Unfortunately, the Government is compounding the misconceptions.  <p>We think AI has great potential&nbsp;… to do what it is good at. But in perpetuating misconceptions about AI, the Government risks compounding the damage done by mis-applications of AI’s potential while distorting policy decisions (including those relating to data protection law and investment priorities). This blog examines these misconceptions.</p> AI and personal&nbsp;data <p>The Government is proposing to abolish citizens’ rights to data protection in all but name. Its main justification for doing so is the “incredible” benefits it believes AI will bring. But it does not need to ‘reform’ data protection law to realise these benefits.</p><p>Many AI-based services such as driverless cars or automated online translation services don’t need any personal data at all. Others, like facial and voice recognition, may generate new personal data about the person whose face or voice it is but they don’t actually need personal data to work. Yes, they need huge amounts of data to identify the patterns needed for recognition. But they don’t need to know whose faces or voices they are: they need anonymised data, not personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Many other AI-based services such as medical diagnoses or predictive modelling also need huge amounts of data to generate their insights and predictions and often this data starts out as personal data (e.g. about identifiable people). But again, AI does not need to know who these people are to work. The data can and should be anonymised.</p><p>Of course, there are many technical questions relating to how data should be anonymised. Can it be easily de-anonymised, for example? But this doesn’t alter the underlying fact: these applications don’t need personal data to work, so rules about the collection and use of personal data aren’t relevant to it and shouldn’t be allowed to be made relevant by using personal data when they shouldn’t.</p><p>The only time when personal data does become important is if an organisation acts on the outcomes of AI’s number crunching when dealing with an identifiable individual. But this has got nothing to do with AI itself. This is about service provision, when normal rules and safeguards relating to the use of personal data in service provision should&nbsp;apply.</p><p>In short, the Government’s proposals for data protection reforms as they relate to AI are without foundation.</p> Misunderstanding AI <p>Unfortunately, there’s more: the Government’s proposals are based on a definition of AI that is confused, at least partially wrong and potentially highly damaging.</p><p>Here is how its ‘Data: A New Direction’ paper defines artificial intelligence.</p><blockquote>“The use of digital technology to create systems capable of performing tasks commonly thought to require intelligence. AI is constantly evolving, but generally it involves machines using statistics to find patterns in large amounts of data, and the ability to perform repetitive tasks with data without the need for constant human guidance.” [Paragraph 63&nbsp;(a)]</blockquote><p>This definition has three parts. The middle part — “using statistics to find patterns in large amounts of data” — is spot on. The third part — “performing repetitive tasks with data without the need for constant human guidance “— is simply wrong. That’s what all computer software does. Automation and AI are not the same thing, and to suggest they are is a fundamental misunderstanding.</p><p>But the real dangers lie in the first part: the implication that AI is replicating human intelligence, which it is&nbsp;not.</p><p>It’s true: AI can be trained (with great difficulty) to do some things (like recognise faces) that we commonly associate with human intelligence. But AI doesn’t undertake these tasks in the same ways as humans (calculation is not the same as perception), and it can only do a very small proportion of the things that human intelligence can&nbsp;do.</p><p>In fact, far from being different versions of the same thing, AI and human intelligence are near opposites. AI is really good at doing some things that human beings are really bad at (such as using statistics to find patterns in large amounts of data, which is what makes it powerful and useful). But it is terrible at performing most of the “tasks commonly thought to require [human] intelligence”.</p><p>Promoting AI in the hope that it can become a substitute for human intelligence is a recipe for disaster. Many of its errors and abuses stem from this mistake. Unfortunately, the misconceptions on which this mistake is based are now extremely common — which is why we take time out in this blog to explore&nbsp;them.</p><p>AI finds it really difficult to ‘see’ things which we humans see instantly and automatically This is called the ‘bundling problem’. When we see a cup of tea on a saucer with a spoon on the side, that’s what we ‘see’: a cup of tea on a saucer with a spoon on the&nbsp;side.</p><p>AI doesn’t see anything of the sort. It ‘sees’ a jumble of thousands of different pixels represented by different data points. A complete blur. (To see what AI ‘sees’ when looking at a picture of a panda, take a look <a href="https://medium.com/@ml.at.berkeley/tricking-neural-networks-create-your-own-adversarial-examples-a61eb7620fd8">at this article</a>.)</p><p>To see anything in this blur, AI has to do an enormous amount of computation, comparing one data point to another. It takes an immense amount of effort and training for AI even to ‘see’ an ‘edge’ (because that implies it can see some ‘thing’ which has an edge that separates it out from other ‘things’).</p><p>It’s almost impossibly difficult for it to understand that the spoon and the saucer are different things to ‘the cup’. This is because, to it, they are all part of the same bundle of data points and it has no reason to unbundle them with no logical basis for doing so. Also, it does not have any ‘history’ or experience outside of what it has been fed by AI engineers or has already computed. It does not have the cultural or experiential history to understand the concepts ‘cup’, ‘saucer’ or ‘spoon’. We humans can do these things so quickly, automatically and effortlessly that we don’t even realise we are doing them. This is testimony to billions of years of evolutionary history — which AI does not&nbsp;have.</p><p>AI does not have ‘general’ intelligence Much has been made recently about AI’s ability to ‘learn’ using things like neural networks. These feats are indeed impressive. But they are tightly constrained, because AI cannot apply what it has learned in one task to another. When Google’s Deep Mind project announced that its AI could beat a human expert at the game of Go it provoked a flurry of excited speculation. What next? But Google’s AlphaGo only works on a board of 19 x 19 squares. If it is asked to work on a board of 18 x 18 it is stumped, having to start all over again. It cannot ‘apply’ what it has learned from one board to another, never mind from one complex situation to&nbsp;another.</p><p>This is no real problem for humans whose evolutionary survival rests on the flexibility and adaptability that the ability to apply lessons ‘learned’ from one experience to another brings. An ability that AI doesn’t&nbsp;have.</p><p>AI cannot use analogy or metaphor Humans are instinctively able to see likenesses in things that are very different, and use this capability to aid their understanding. If I say “March came in like a lion and went out like a lamb”, you instinctively understand the implied references to ‘roaring’ and ‘fierceness’ as opposed to ‘gentleness’. For AI, this is a massive barrier. Because AI doesn’t work in the currency of concepts, only in correlations between data points, it cannot use analogy and metaphor to&nbsp;reason.</p><p>AI cannot imagine or create Humans don’t only think about what is. They also think about what is not but could be. They use these imaginings to better understand their current situation and to see ways to change it. Because AI can only work with the data it has been fed with (it cannot crunch data it hasn’t got) it cannot imagine what could&nbsp;be.</p><p>It is indeed possible for AI to give the impression that it is being ‘creative’ by acting on an instruction to generate new, random combinations of data. This can be useful. But it is mimicking the outputs of imagination, not recreating the processes behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>AI cannot distinguish between correlation and cause and effect Humans instinctively reason by linking causes to effects (to the point when often they see causes or effects that aren’t actually there). But AI, which has no experience of living in a world where ‘causes’ have ‘effects’, can only identify correlations. (And, by the way, the bigger the data set, the more ‘correlations’ it will identify, most of which will be meaningless).</p><p>AI cannot ‘level jump’ AI cannot stop to think. It cannot ‘step outside’ of what it has been programmed to do to ask: “hang on, am I asking the right question?”, or “hold on, does this really make&nbsp;sense?”.</p><p>This is what makes ‘adversarial examples’ so dangerous in AI training. Adversarial examples can happen when someone changes just one pixel in a series of images to interfere with the correlations that are being computed. If one pixel is changed in a picture, humans see the same picture. But AI might see something entirely different: a computer instead of a cat; <a href="https://medium.com/@ml.at.berkeley/tricking-neural-networks-create-your-own-adversarial-examples-a61eb7620fd8">a gibbon instead of a panda</a>. Crucially, AI has no way of knowing that it is making this mistake and carries on regardless — which can be incredibly dangerous.</p><p>AI cannot switch attention to something more important AI cannot stop to think “hold on, should I really be focusing on this right now? Shouldn’t I be doing X instead?” Because AI doesn’t understand concepts (and has to be trained through millions of trials and errors to even ‘see’ a cat), and because it can only see correlations but not their relative significance, it cannot understand that one task may be more important than another — or even be aware that another, different task may exist. (It may be trained by human beings to allocate scores to things within a task, but it cannot make judgements as to the value or importance of different tasks.)</p><p>AI cannot sense or respond to anything outside of the data sets it is provided with Humans have multiple different senses which are ‘always on’ — such as sight, sound, smell, touch, taste and so on. Our brains are monitoring our environments all the time to see if anything ‘out there’ needs paying attention to. If there isn’t, our brains relegate this vast inflow of information (billions of bits a second) to the unconscious so we can focus our attention on the task at hand. Psychologists are still at a loss as to how we process multiple incommensurate senses (such as sight plus sound) to create single experiences.</p><p>This ability to sense a background environment, to make constant judgements as to its significance, and to switch attention to another task is way beyond AI. Instead, for AI to work its wonders, it has to be fed with huge amounts of data by human beings, separately, task by task — by human beings who choose what data to feed it with, and who pre-empt the calculations that AI can make in doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>AI does not have an experiental ‘history’ to draw upon like humans do. Take that cup of tea, for example. We humans know that if we turn a cup of tea upside down, the tea will pour onto the floor. AI doesn’t know this because it has never experienced gravity — a piece of knowledge that we humans simply take for&nbsp;granted.</p><p>But, you might say, AI personal assistants such as Siri and Alexa are ‘always on’, listening for the words that will ‘wake them up’. But that confirms the key point: they have been carefully trained to do this one, small, particular task.</p><p>It’s testimony to the brilliance of AI engineers that they have managed to create driverless cars. But no piece of AI has the ability to decide that the car should change its destination, on the basis of new, external information (say that a friend has just been taken ill). It needs a human being to tell it to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>AI cannot feel emotions and or display human empathy It goes without saying that, as a machine, AI does not have emotions. It cannot feel pleased, excited, or hurt. It cannot use such information to modulate its&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Ai cannot use norms or values to assess situations or decisions As a piece of software, AI is not like a human being who is embedded within a society and culture and acutely aware of the norms or values by which this culture operates. For this reason, AI cannot make human decisions which are always, to some degree or other, value judgements. It can only make logical decisions, based on criteria programmed into it by human&nbsp;beings.</p><p>But ‘Ah!’ you might say, feeling emotions or making value judgements have got nothing to do with how a piece of computer software goes about its business. But that is precisely the point. Real life human intelligence is embedded within and awash with emotional impacts and ethical and moral judgements. They are an essential part of how humans make decisions about what to do and what not to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Indeed, when humans put their intelligence to work, much of the information they are dealing with is about other people’s actions, intentions, attitudes, beliefs, motivations, concerns and so on. Human intelligence is recursive (‘I know that you know’), not linear; social, not abstractly logical. As soon as the task at hand requires any assessment of any of such human factors, AI systems are at a&nbsp;loss.</p><p>AI can only solve a tiny proportion of the problems human intelligence has to deal with AI works by making calculations, which means it can only find solutions to questions that can be computed. But a surprisingly small proportion of real world problems are actually computable.</p><p>AI can only work with problems that are ‘algorithmically compressible’. That is, with problems that can be finally and completely solved by a finite series of logical ‘if-then’ questions. But the majority of the most important issues that humans have to apply their intelligence to are not ‘algorithmically compressible’: they do not have a definite answer that can be calculated. They involve judgement.</p><p>In fact, for AI to be able to come up with its clever answers, the questions it is asked and the ways of addressing them must display key criteria that makes them calculable: e.g. with a clearly defined goal, a clear end point for the calculation, and a clearly defined way of getting there. That’s why AI promoters use games like chess and Go to sell their&nbsp;wares.</p><p>Yet many of the issues taxing human intelligence have neither clear goals, nor clear end points, nor clear rules for reaching them. They are ‘wicked’ ‘infinite’ (i.e. forever unfolding) problems where, for example, it’s not actually clear whether we are asking the right question in the first place, whether we can rely on the information we’ve got, where the people involved have different perceptions, motives and goals, and where the ‘rules of the game’ may suddenly change half way through. AI cannot answer the question “what is the best way to implement AI?” because this is a ‘wicked’ problem, not a computable one.</p> Artificial stupidity? <p>For hundreds of years, in their quest for immortality Chinese alchemists sought to perfect the art of embalming — because, they believed, the closer they got to mimicking the appearance of life they closer they were getting to life itself. Today, AI is being used in many clever ways to mimic the appearance of human intelligence. But that doesn’t mean it is intelligent. It is as close to intelligence as embalming is to&nbsp;life.</p><p>If we put all the limitations discussed above together, AI is actually quite stupid. When it comes to things like understanding common sense (meaning, significance, cause and effect), social relationships, or the physics of gravity it is much less intelligent than a toddler, which is why it makes so many awful mistakes.</p><p>The fact that it is now common practice to equate AI with human intelligence, as the Government does in its proposals, does not mean these claims are right. It simply means many people are repeating a mistaken conventional wisdom, just as centuries ago millions of people sincerely believed they were at risk of harm perpetrated by witches’ use of black&nbsp;magic.</p><p>Fact is, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ is not a description. It’s a marketing slogan designed to sell a product. After all, would people talk about AI in hushed tones of awe if it was simply called ‘large scale number crunching’ or ‘Artificial Stupidity’ (which it often&nbsp;is)?</p><p>Don’t get us wrong. We like AI for what it can do. As a means of deploying clever statistical methods to find patterns in large quantities of data, AI can be extremely useful in tackling a wide range of tasks. We at Mydex are embracing AI to help individuals make better decisions and manage their lives better. But we like it for what it can do, not for what it&nbsp;can’t.</p><p>The AI hype we see today is more of a sociological phenomenon than a technological one — similar to the railway mania that gripped Britain in the 1840s. At that time, this awe-inspiring new technology seemed to promise spectacular social and economic opportunities — and financial returns. Soon, every hairbrained venture with the word ‘railway’ in it was attracting huge amounts of money, only for thousands to lose their fortunes when the bust came. The same is happening now, except that the trigger word is ‘AI’ rather than ‘railway’.</p><p>AI mania is dangerous. Precious time and money are being squandered on inflated dreams and expectations. Vested interests stoking the bandwagon for their own purposes. People are using AI to make bad decisions. And policy is being distorted to fit the hype (e.g. dreams of unprecedented <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">‘innovation and growth’</a>), not the&nbsp;reality.</p><p>That is what the UK Government is doing now, with its proposal to abolish the existing citizen right to object to automated processing of their data “if this processing significantly affects them”. Which raises the issue of consent: the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other blogs in this series are <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">Five Myths about Data, Innovation and Growth</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is Data Valuable?</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">AI: The Emperor’s New Clothes?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>She is a Mama of three and a wifey to one. Hello Titi.</p>
<p>Titi Akinsanmi: Hello.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very welcome. It’s nice having you. It’s a pleasure.</p>
<p>Titi: Thank you very much. Thank you for having me. It’s a real pleasure to be able to join this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent, Titi. So let’s talk about digital identity. I would like to hear more, a bit more about you. So please tell us about yourself and what was your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Titi: Thank you very much again. Telling about my journey in itself is a podcast I think. But the short, short, short version of it is this. I recall that in my final year of university, of my very first degree, my very first university degree, I was in a situation where I realised that yes, I was graduating with a first degree. But I had absolutely no idea how to use technology or navigate the world using technology. At least not at the level I thought I needed to be able to do it.</p>
<p>That fuelled a passion in me to one, build up my capacity. When building up my capacity, it became even more obvious that there were a whole lot more people like me who didn’t have the right technical skills and yes, there were a lot more people who didn’t have the right technical skills but there was an endless array of end users who had absolutely no idea around what technology could – you know, the difference technology could make in their life. But more so that there where governments in place that were approaching the adoption, deployment and growth of technology without having the right regulatory environment in place that ensured the user was consistently in the middle of it.</p>
<p>So that’s well quite a bit of work. I ended up in the policy space, the public policy space, the regulatory space, whichever label you want to put on it. And increasingly I began to see for me that you as a user, because of the “non-geographical nature” of the internet and I say that with a caveat. I can hear the technical folks going, “What do you mean it’s non-geographical?”</p>
<p>You could literally adopt a variety of persona, a variety of identities and, you know, concurrent with that was an increase in shift or growth in the use of new technologies that more or less was pulling the world as we used to know it into the digital space. So there was increasing measures around securing your existing personal information, increasing measures around being able to port your data, your personal data so to say, as well as there are human beings who are deciding I’m going to be X, Y, Z in this space but I will be X, Y, Z in that space.</p>
<p>That for me is at the core of all the conversations around data, around privacy. It’s the end user and into the digital space and what they choose to adopt and use it for.</p>
<p>So to some extent, if you are asking, “OK. Tell me about yourself,” I’m a policy wonk. Everything I do resonates and returns to the place of putting in the right structures whether they be policies, regulations, laws, legislations. Find whatever label you want to find for it but ensuring that the digital world cannot just grow and continue to innovate. But that the end user, the consumer, the human being, at least for now, the human being behind it or making use of it does not get lost.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. I think it’s super interesting that even though I think you didn’t study technology, right? But you graduated and you had this interest about knowing more on technology and having this edge. You know, an interest for the ultimate use of end user. So …</p>
<p>Titi: Yes, absolutely. My first degree that I was referencing is not even in technology at all. My first degree is in English, English language with two minors in French and literature. So you can imagine the kind of educational system I was in where yes, I was getting this first degree and I could do amazing things with it. But nobody had thought it was important for me to be equipped, right, with the technological skills that will enable me or create in the years post Y2K and I’m dating myself by saying Y2K.</p>
<p>But that gives you some context. But part of what I did, I am an entrepreneur also. Yes, policy wonk first but I – I’m a Nigerian by birth. So I have the hustle spirit in me.</p>
<p>When that incident happened, kind of what I did was deliberately brought my skills to bear. I made a snack that is very ubiquitous across West Africa – chin chin. I sold those to a plethora of people and I sent myself to evening computer school, which was my first foray formally, post high school where you had to take computer science as part of your course.</p>
<p>So I spent the next what – plus or minus about 18 months in the evenings while working during the day, learning everything I could about the computer – from computer language all the way through to how to be a good hacker, all the way through to the many uses of it. It was in this process that I got connected to what was the World Summit on the Information Society and I actually then led that process from a youth angle and ensured that while policies were being written at the UN level, they were not leaving out – they actually had been. But then they were not leaving out young people who are actually at the forefront of innovating with technology and adopting it and making use of it. Then that’s what has led more or less to this space now.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, I can see. It’s also entrepreneurial from the very beginning of your professional career.</p>
<p>Titi: Oh, yes. It’s a very deliberate choice. I grew up in an environment with parents, and I’m appreciative of this, they were perfectly imperfect – that consistently demonstrated to us that yes, have an education. But more importantly, and this is the way it’s put in my culture, have skillsets that you can make use of your hands, make use of your physical being, right? To be able to deliver and make sure you can earn and that has paid off for me. So if for any reason this policy side does not really work, I can open up a hair salon. I’d do great with that or I can actually open up a restaurant. I cook great African food.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow. You have a lot of backups for career.</p>
<p>Titi: Oh, yes. I do.</p>
<p>Oscar: And I’m sure you would enjoy that.</p>
<p>Titi: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: The way I hear you.</p>
<p>Titi: Don’t worry. When we do eventually meet in person, I owe you a meal.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow.</p>
<p>Titi: Invite me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you very much. Fantastic. Well, fast forward to these times, I know now you are based in Canada and you work with different global initiatives and a lot of it is related to the trust frameworks. So – and these trust frameworks are being developed across the world. So tell us a bit of some insights into what you are seeing right now in terms of trust frameworks.</p>
<p>Titi: I will start by saying this, right, that digital identity has “become increasingly mainstream” over the last what – plus or minus seven years. The conversation has moved away from purely technical spaces or policy-oriented spaces to featuring more in day-to-day conversations and that has meant that there is a plethora of – what do we call it? Digital identity systems that have been developed from Australia to Canada to Sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa, Nigeria, all the way through to Estonia as well.</p>
<p>There have been leaders at the governments or even industries that have developed trust frameworks that enable digital identity. But not all of them have always come from the point of entrenching trust, right, in the digital economy. But before I go here, first, I can hear the listeners going, “OK. So what are you talking about first? What is digital identity? What is a trust framework?”</p>
<p>Digital identity is a set of potentially credentials, things that can be presented in the digital space that helps confirm that you are who you are. So in light of that very simplistic definition, right, we’ve only got so many minutes, a trust framework typically describes a set of auditable, technical or even legal rules that apply to the identification, authentication and authorisation of accessing resources across organisations or across a network, right?</p>
<p>So that such a framework then enables that these systems and the services that they offer can be trusted and ultimately mass adopted, and that’s on the side of those offering particular services.</p>
<p>On the side of the end user, trust frameworks are in place to be able to verify, authenticate that you are who you say you are when you want to access those services. So I will talk real quick around the kind of trust frameworks that we are finding in general, starting with my current home here in Canada.</p>
<p>There’s the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework which is very user-centric in the kind of requirements it has, choosing choice, control. All of it yield on the notion of privacy by design, right? A deliberate inclusion in the design of technology that is privacy focused. Privacy first so to say, which is a foundational element for anything that you’re doing on the platform.</p>
<p>If you look at the PCTF website, that’s the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework website. It says it’s designed for it to be suitable for digital identification, authentication, credential, online credential, authorisation systems, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera and they have put it in place to be used by government entities, citizens or business partners.</p>
<p>So that’s for Canada and I will be very deliberate about not mentioning the likes of the US which has digital identity guidelines and the Federation and Assertions framework, which you can refer. I’m being very deliberate about speaking to other spaces that are not seen as digitally dominant in the digital economy space, right?</p>
<p>We also have the European Union which historically included the UK but, you know, we’re talking Brexit this morning and the EU has what it calls the eIDAS, the electronic identification, authentication and trust services regulation, which has been put in place particularly to regulate electronic signatures, transactions and embeds the processes that provide a safe way for users to conduct business online.</p>
<p>I do know that it was June this year. I believe it was the third of June particularly that they proposed a trusted and secure digital identity which will allow all EU citizens, residents and businesses to be able to link their national digital identities with proof of other personal attributes. So think of your driver’s license, bank accounts, and also be able to access services online without having to use private identification methods or even necessarily sharing any extra personal data.</p>
<p>This is one of the things I’m really gung-ho about when it comes to digital identity and the trust frameworks, is the ability for those who are on the design end of things to put in place technology that then means that I as an end user can pick and choose what credential I’m sharing at any point in time.</p>
<p>The UK has developed its own digital identity and attributes trust framework. Australia has a really advanced one, the trust and digital identity framework. So those are a few that are in place. There are two or maybe three parts of the world I haven’t really spoken to. But there are – so think Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. What’s happening in these spaces around digital identity?</p>
<p>Digital identity is very much at the core of a lot of the adoption of technology that’s happening, a lot of the start-up ecosystem for example that we’re seeing emerge out of Africa. The fintech space is very much built on being able to have what I have defined as the technology behind authentication, verification, access of service, etc.</p>
<p>However, they have not necessarily framed it as, oh, we have a trust framework in place. But the critical elements are being put in place and that for me is really heartening and maybe we will get to it a bit later around being able to ensure interoperability and all of that.</p>
<p>But so far, lots of identity registries have been set up in Sub-Saharan African, which is my heritage where I am from. I always say that I’m a Nigerian by birth but an African by choice and global citizen. Then in Latin America as well because this is central to a lot of the “solutions” that are in place and of course there are flags around from the privacy folks which includes myself, around if we have this ubiquitous collection of data, digital identity, what does it mean for privacy. But I will hand it back to you and let’s take the conversation forward.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. It’s interesting to- You have mentioned particularly some countries there but let’s say more advanced than others but you also have said that in other countries, the governments don’t mention the words, “this is a trust framework” but there are the elements of that.</p>
<p>What about most of the trust frameworks are seen in a – maybe with exception of the European Union, most of them are just one country. One country completes the project. So now that we are in a time when there’s a lot of business across borders, how will these trust frameworks interact with each other?</p>
<p>Titi: OK. So I will start from this. I’m putting on my Canadian hat now. Yes, the European Union is not one country. But if you look at Canada, for example, which is a provincial system of governance, the provinces actually operate relatively independent of each other, right? If you dig deep, Ontario has its own work ongoing around digital identity, as does the British Columbia, and these are all provinces within Canada. So in as much as you know one is a collection of countries, the approaches being taken in Canada is very similar to what’s being done in Europe, in that these are independent governance structures coming together and actually looking to put in place an interoperable trust infrastructure that backs all of the digital identity being put in place.</p>
<p>The same in Sub-Saharan Africa, the approach is riding off of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, the digital aspect of it, to ensure that there’s actually interoperability to put the structures, the legal structures in place to ensure that there’s interoperability, even with the basic identity document that you need to be able to carry to move around across the continent.</p>
<p>So, how would they be able to operate so to say? This is where it is important that conversations are not happening in silos, right? And there are trust frameworks that are being put in place reflective of a common agreement. And this is where the question mark is. I know 2020 has been what it is, but part of the proposals that had been put on the table was that there needed to be more conversations, particularly around what you would call the G20 countries, around digital identity, and the tenants that were being put in place that would ensure that if I have a set of verifiable credentials coming out of the EU, they should be presentable when I come to North America. And the same if I come from Sub-Saharan Africa, or even North Africa, I can present it in Asia.</p>
<p>Now if you allow me, I’ll take a quick pause and say that this would have gone a bit slower. But one of, and this is not in any way good or a sign of that the pandemic has been great, but one of the things the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic, has forced us to do is not just sit as individual countries and figure out how you can ensure people are safe and steady while not violating their privacy rights, but also for us as humans on this earth to interact and connect a whole lot more.</p>
<p>So borders are finally opening. And as part of that process, I can take my vaccination certification, right, whether it’s a QR code, or you know, it’s just a PDF document, and I can actually present that in other spaces in other countries. And I’m able to- you know, it’s verifiable, because a set of standards have been agreed. And there’s a saying that there’s nothing new under the sun, right?</p>
<p>And it’s not that this has not been done before. I’ll give you an example particularly around the “contentious” vaccinations certifications, or proof of vaccination. As a West African, as a Nigerian by birth, all my traveling life, which now is almost going to 30 years, I have had to carry with me something called a yellow card, a yellow fever card that actually shows my vaccination history, right, helps identify that I am free of yellow fever, right? And I have had to present this for me to be able to either apply for visas, or even get into certain countries, not just on the African continent, but in Europe, in the US, et cetera. Now, that has been put in place. That is a form of physical identity that I believe precedes what we now see with the COVID vaccination. And that’s on the one hand of digital identity.</p>
<p>On the technical side is the ability to be able to connect with particular services, right? If you’re thinking, OK, I want to be able to access XYZ service being offered, or I want to be able to access on the organisational side XYZ users’ data. The ability to be able to then verify this is very much dependent on a set of standards, right, and a common framework that enables interoperability, right? And that can be a really tough call, because, you know, the interpretations around trust really differs across borders.</p>
<p>So yeah, to finalise, I must say that any institution that’s looking at any institution, or even the end user, and you’ll notice I’m speaking a lot from the perspective of the end user, because again, I don’t want us to lose the conversation around trust frameworks, just around the infrastructure, the digital infrastructure that needs to be in place. It’s that for any institution, you know, there are predictions that by 2023, any organisation that wants to be able to instil digital trust and wants to participate at the very least a 15% more ecosystem will need to sign up in one way or the other to a digital trust framework. But I do think the technology is in place, we just need to be able to agree.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. I think with the examples you have you have mentioned, yes, technology, most of technology is available already. It’s a matter of agreeing between the trust framework between the countries. Something else I would like to – jumping a bit off topic but something I like to hear from you is, as you work closely with data privacy, you have mentioned a few times, and now you are sitting on the board on the Good ID please tell us, tell us more what is Good ID and yeah, how is it spreading the word about this project?</p>
<p>Titi: Yes, I must say, I will start from when I first got the call Oscar that when I was told, you know, “Would you please join the advisory board for Good ID?” The first question I had for them is what do you mean by Good ID? How do you define Good ID? Good ID in one context could be terrible ID in another context, right? But you know it was a good way to step forward. And I will tell you this is why I am open and consistent about supporting and continue to be a part of Good ID.</p>
<p>It is, at the very core of it, best practice with respect to identity management, which promotes the principle of privacy and security. So it’s a practice, it is a movement, a series of conversations, a series of standard setting that pushes for the centrality of privacy and security, either on the infrastructure building side, the digital infrastructure building side, on the end user side, or on the governance side, whether the governance from government or from elsewhere.</p>
<p>GoodID is a valuable identity management approach that allows everyone without restrictions to not just participate, but to play an important role in their own identity management. And I think it’s important to emphasise that each one is able to play an important role, a critical role in their own identity management. So you can think of the gamut of being able to fully grasp as an end user, what digital identity is, and how you can manage it as an end user all the way through to the one who is looking to innovate, to provide some services at any of the parts of digital identity for them to have a full understanding of how they can participate.</p>
<p>GoodID uses the principles of inclusion, transparency, and accountability in entrenching public trust in ID management. And some would ask, “Why is this necessary?” Because you know, there has been the biggest fear is that Nineteen Eighty-four by George Orwell will come to pass, meaning Big Brother will constantly be able to control. Some would say that’s already in place. But I would argue that actually it’s not in place, where we have the biggest concern is that we don’t have enough people who care enough to make informed choices. Most people just want to be able to get along with it, just get it done, right?</p>
<p>So that’s what GoodID is. It’s been around for about three, maybe slightly, like three-and-a-half, four years now. And it’s at a phase right now where we are looking to be able to grow further knowledge on the folks who are doing great work around GoodID. But more importantly, also [unknown] around the adoption of laws that enable digital ID across board. And also, just promoting those who are doing great work in terms of organisations or even individuals.</p>
<p>Oscar: As you said, part of this is educating end users how to take control of their good practices of their identity, whichever tools services are using today. And then it goes to, for instance, helping how to design, how to design application services based on data privacy, correct?</p>
<p>Titi: Yes, correct. And all of this is informed by the fact that, you know, context always differs, such that, the design and the development of one technology is not ubiquitous for the entirety of the world, but that adoption and adaptation would need to happen across different spaces. And that’s part of what makes the conversation really tough around the adoption of a trust framework, right, on digital identity. But because it’s tough does not mean it’s not doable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Like with trust frameworks, every country has different reality in terms of the services, both public and private. So it’s… Yeah.</p>
<p>Titi: Yeah, it certainly does. It certainly does. And you know, for those who have an interest I would say that they should go spend a bit more time, just walking through what the Pan-Canadian trust framework speaks to as well as the Australian model, I think those are really interesting models that could be potentially adaptable across various economic environments. Nothing against the eIDAS actually, but it can be quite onerous. That’s the EU trust framework.</p>
<p>Oscar: And GoodID – where is it operating the most nowadays? I guess the idea is to be global, correct? But right now where it has more presence?</p>
<p>Titi: Oh, GoodID is definitely global. You cannot go to a particular office and identify “Oh, this is where GoodID is.” And that’s why I said it’s also a movement. And one of the things I’m really appreciative of is that we’ve had the privilege of being able to curate conversations and influence conversations across the world. So you know, you will find GoodID, if you go to the <a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/">website GoodID</a>, you will find conversations, you will find articles. You will find resources for Asia, for Sub Saharan Africa, for Europe and for North America, and also for Latin America.</p>
<p>And that’s one of the things that I think demonstrates the need for us to be able to take this conversation and not just have it amongst ourselves, but also help guide those who make the laws, right? I mean, as much as the private sector or even the civil society can be at the forefront of conversations, if we don’t have the requisite laws and regulations in place, or the institutions that are tasked with guarding this, you know, we’re still all just having a conversation and operating outside “the law”. So yeah, you will find GoodID online, you will find GoodID everywhere.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Just one more thing about trust frameworks, how important are the trust frameworks to ensure data privacy?</p>
<p>Titi: Right. That’s a really good question. A key reason why you would set up a trust framework, right, is to protect data, right? To put privacy practices at the core of it. The goal is to be able to protect the personal information of individuals across boundaries, across digital ecosystem. So if digital identity systems are being designed without an agreed set of standards or principles, right, an agreed set of processes that specify how data should be handled, then we are going to have the big brother state, right?</p>
<p>So I’ll go back to the PCTF. It’s again around instilling confidence of end users that there is protection in the disclosure use of the identity and personal information, while ensuring that secure and privacy enhancing services are readily available, right? So the trust framework is around ensuring that there’s efficiency, that effectiveness is happening, meaning you can do what you exactly you set out to do, either as a service provider, an authenticator in the process, and that, you know, there’s ongoing confidence in digital services being provided. It’s an ongoing work. I don’t think it’s one that you start. It’s about having the right processes and systems in place to ensure that this does not change, and being able to state in really simplistic terms, not just in technical terms.</p>
<p>Oscar: A final question for all business leaders listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Titi: Amazing, all business leaders, meaning across sectors not specific to one, it’s this. And you know, this is known, you know, there’s the – it’s not an idea or a thought that they – I assume they would not have had. If you’re going to write anything into your agenda, it’s this: Privacy, data privacy, particularly around personal information is not an issue that will go away. So if there’s any actionable thing you can do, it’s this. The core of innovating either an idea, or a new technology, or delivery of a service, that you put privacy first. That’s one.</p>
<p>How do you put privacy first? It means that you need to be able to sit in the seat of the end user. And that end user could be an individual or actually be another organisation or an institution, and design in a way that trust is strengthened. Meaning I am confident enough as an institution or an individual that when we are having this transaction, when I’m giving you my data, it will only be used for what it’s meant to be used for. It will only access what it needs to access. That’s actionable.</p>
<p>So innovate, design with privacy first in mind, not by design only, but that it’s consistently, iteratively checked against how personal information is being used. Don’t design just for your local context, design in a way that anybody anywhere across the world would be looking to be able to engage with what you’re designing or what you are looking to sell or what you are offering in terms of service or platform. The world is global. There are physical boundaries. But remember, with the internet, the boundary is only as much as we set it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more, Titi. Fantastic and I agree that privacy first, of course. Thank you so much for this super interesting conversation, knowing more about you, your fascinating stories and the work you are doing about trust framework and privacy. For people who like to continue the conversation with you or learn more about your work, please let us know how we can find you.</p>
<p>Titi: Oh, yeah, you can find me – I will say that for the longest time I hid from the rest of the world behind pseudonyms. But you can find me across all platforms <a href="https://twitter.com/titiakinsanmi">@titiakinsanmi</a>, so that’s @ my first and my surname. And I will tell you, I am a policy wonk. Yes, you will find me speaking of policy but you will also find me sharing about the totality of who I am in different spaces in different ways. You can also find me if you want to have a chat a bit more professionally, yes on <a href="https://titiakinsanmi.com/">www.titiakinsanmi.com</a>. Thank you, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. It was a pleasure talking with you, Titi, and all the best.</p>
<p>Titi: Thank you very much, Oscar. Have a really great one. Thank you, listeners.</p>

<p><a href="https://abkiosk.com/">Precision Kiosk Technologies</a> is bringing its automated breathalyzer system to Texas. One of the company’s AB Kiosks has now been installed in the lobby of the San Patricio Community Supervision and Corrections (SPCSC) headquarters in Sinton, where it is being used to screen 450 low-risk individuals to help them fulfill the terms of their probation.</p>



  



<p>San Patricio County is the first jurisdiction in the state to implement Precision’s AB Kiosk system. The fully automated solution negates the need for a face-to-face check-in, and makes the process simpler and faster for law enforcement employees and probationers alike. Those on probation can use the system to set up an appointment and check in remotely, before using the kiosk itself to complete a breathalyzer and answer any user-specific monitoring questions.</p>



<p>The AB Kiosk is outfitted with a fingerprint scanner, which biometrically verifies the identities of those with probation appointments. The system also has a camera that records each interaction, and ensures that the right person is taking the breathalyzer test. The Kiosk can handle as many as 30 breathalyzer appointments in a one-hour period, and comes with client management software that will automatically upload the results of each appointment to the appropriate file.</p>



<p>“More than 40 jurisdictions across the US now use the AB Kiosk to automate their alcohol monitoring programs and probation check-ins,” said Precision GM Patrick McKinney. “Not only will this system enable SPCSC to keep high- and low-risk probation clients separated, but it will also enable their staff to focus their time and energy on higher-value corrections work.”</p>



<p>“Our goal is to efficiently monitor hundreds of our low-risk clients while holding them to a high level of accountability,” added SPCSC Probation Director Jason Woods. “The AB Kiosk will enable our probation professionals to intensify their supervision of higher risk populations.”</p>



<p>Precision’s AB Kiosks are already being used to screen probationers in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/two-south-dakota-counties-embrace-biometric-breathalyzer-kiosk-100602/">South Dakota’s Codington and Minnehaha counties</a>, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/wisconsin-county-installs-new-automated-breathalyzer-kiosk/">Wisconsin’s Iowa County</a>, and at the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/acoma-pueblo-deploys-precisions-biometric-breathalyzer-kiosks-092501/">Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico</a>. The company noted that its self-service solution allows law enforcement to keep tabs on probationers while <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/precision-offers-ab-kiosks-monitor-inmates-during-covid-19-pandemic-033106/">minimizing the threat of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.frost.com/">Frost &amp; Sullivan</a> has named <a href="https://www.lumenvox.com/">LumenVox</a> as one of the top players in the speech recognition industry. The firm has presented LumenVox with its Enabling Technology Leadership Award for 2021, and is specifically recognizing the company for its contributions to the contact center industry in North America.</p>



  



<p>According to Frost &amp; Sullivan, the annual award acknowledges a company at the forefront of its industry. In practical terms, that means that the recipient has developed some kind of new technology that improves its existing portfolio, and that has the potential to inform the development of new products moving forward.</p>



<p>In that regard, LumenVox is best known for its robust voice portfolio, which includes a wide range of biometric and non-biometric software offerings. On the biometric front, the company’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-lumenvox-releases-version-8-advanced-biometric-authentication-suite-013002/">voice recognition tech</a> can be deployed in a customer-facing contact center to enable both active and passive authentication. The technology <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-genesys-appfoundry-lists-lumenvox-voice-authentication-tech-021803/">allows businesses to identify customers</a> in a more seamless fashion, and does so while minimizing the threat of fraud.</p>



<p>The LumenVox platform has additional speech recognition, transcription, and natural language understanding capabilities, all of which can help automate the contact center experience and reduce the administrative burden on employees. The company also offers call progress analysis and text-to-speech technology to further streamline contact center operations.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to receive this recognition for our dedication to creating excellent customer experiences,” said LumenVox Founder and CEO Edward Miller. “Our speech recognition and voice enabling software helps companies deliver accurate, efficient, and scalable voice experiences to a diverse base of users.”</p>



<p>“LumenVox stands out as a premier provider of emerging and maturing technology that others in the market adopt for product development and performance,” added&nbsp;Frost &amp; Sullivan Digital Transformation Practice Industry Director Nancy Jamison. “LumenVox is broadening its core portfolio while pivoting to be a more product-focused company. This has doubled LumenVox’s reach and allows the company to market core technologies embedded in a variety of provider platforms or be sold as white-labeled solutions.”</p>



<p>LumenVox was previously recognized as a top speech technology vendor in Speech Technology Magazine’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/lumenvox-recognized-in-speech-technology-magazine-peoples-choice-awards/">People’s Choice Awards</a> in 2020. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-lumenvox-outfits-cct-contact-centers-voice-recognition-tech-021208/">CCT Solutions</a> started using LumenVox tech in its own contact centers earlier that year.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking">Mastercard’s The Rise of Open Banking study</a>, security, privacy, and trust are at the center of innovation. Open banking technology is paving the way for hundreds of millions of people to enter the digital economy. Three-quarters of U.S. consumers have already linked their bank accounts to automate financial tasks. They’re confidently adopting digital apps, products and services to make everyday financial tasks easier and quicker. Consumers are looking for more secure and simple ways to pay bills, send money to friends and open online accounts.</p>
<p>The study also revealed an accelerating demand for more complex needs, like financial forecasting, crypto investing and crowdfunding. This isn’t a surprise. Open banking is shifting and elevating what consumers can expect and demand from their financial apps and services. Payments are instant and automated. Adding financial data to boost credit scores is available. Buying and selling cryptocurrencies or stocks are immediate on many digital platforms. Banks, financial institutions and fintechs are connecting financial data securely and seamlessly to make these services a reality.&nbsp;</p>
 Convenience is Paramount, and Open Banking Offers It 
<p>Time is our most precious resource. The consumers surveyed made that abundantly clear. Of all the respondents, 59% cited the time and work saved by speed and ease of use as the reason they’re adopting financial technology. Nine in 10 consumers in the U.S. utilize technology to manage their finances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top use cases are financial task automation and peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. One of the major P2P platforms saw a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2021/paypal-venmo-volumes-grow-58-pct-yoy-to-58b/">58% year-on-year increase in pure volume</a>. Everyone loves being able to pay their friends quickly for dinner and drinks, or being able to send funds to a family member in need. These services continue to grow, quarter by quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers are also happily automating payments for rent, bills, gym memberships and streaming service subscriptions. The average consumer in the U.S. is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/average-consumer-spending-273-per-month-on-subscription-services-report/">spending $273</a> per month on various subscriptions. For each consumer, this could mean initiating a multitude of relatively small payments on a monthly basis. If that’s done manually, it would needlessly soak up extra time and create tedious work. Open banking provides consumer-permissioned data to facilitate these real time payments simply and easily.</p>
 What the Future Holds 
<p>The survey also revealed a rising appetite for more complex needs like crypto investing and crowdfunding. As the adaptation of these tasks grows, this does not come as a surprise. In our hyperconnected world, consumers are used to tapping a few buttons on a screen to complete any task instantly. This expectation of immediacy has been groomed for years by other digital habits such as social media apps, email services and SMS text messaging. Until recently, those expectations haven’t moved into the financial arena, but now consumers are finding the same convenience in finances.</p>
<p>Alleviating pain points and privacy concerns for consumers would significantly boost adoption of open banking apps and services. Respondents wanted more control over their data. They want to own it, control it and benefit from it. They want financial institutions and payment networks to keep it secure. Twenty-nine percent of U.S. consumers and 28% of Canadians said they’d be willing to adopt digital financial apps and services if they knew what financial details are being shared, how often they were being shared, and if tools to revoke sharing access were offered. Mastercard’s data principles around consumer data ownership, control and security are aligned with these desires. They’re a key foundation to driving more consumer adoption of open banking.</p>
<p>With privacy and security being a leading concern for digital finances, control over data and protection from fraud is the way forward. Seventy-five percent of consumers actively try to protect their private data and 54% of U.S. consumers think additional authentication steps can help ease concerns when it comes to linking financial accounts.</p>
<p>The critical elements of the success and promise of open banking are access, control and trust. By turning more control of their financial data over to the consumer, they will reap more benefits. In turn, banks, financial institutions and fintechs will have greater opportunity to create new financial products and services for these consumers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.socure.com/">Socure</a> is boasting about its strong showing in <a href="https://aite-novarica.com/">Aite-Novarica</a>’s latest Global Document Identification and Verification Impact Report. In the Report, Aite-Novarica evaluated identity verification and fraud prevention offerings from eight of the industry’s top vendors, and listed Socure’s ID+ Platform as the best of those eight solutions.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, Socure was the only identity verification provider that made its way into the best-in-class circle in a number of different categories. ID+ was recognized for its product features, while Socure was recognized for its strong client roster and services in addition to its stability as a vendor.</p>



<p>Aite-Novarica also commended Socure for its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/socure-launches-risk-scoring-solution-complement-selfie-onboarding-platform-79202104/">Predictive Document Verification (DocV) solution</a>, which debuted in September and uses computer vision to analyze various elements of an identity document. The solution can <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/socure-report-shows-how-unbiased-tech-can-help-raise-financial-inclusion-102807/">estimate the age of the person</a> in a photo, and uses optical character recognition to extract information from an ID.</p>



<p>The DocV platform can be integrated into a company’s app or deployed through a web browser, and analyzes transactions in real time to generate a risk score for each interaction. In doing so, it helps separate fraudsters from legitimate customers, and explains how it got those scores to help clients make more informed decisions about their user base.</p>



<p>“Legacy solutions aren’t accurately predicting whether or not it is safe to allow a user to enter a company’s ecosystem,”&nbsp;said Socure founder and CEO Johnny Ayers. “Accurate identity risk assessment reduces losses at <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/socure-provides-onboarding-services-hundreds-kasasa-financial-institutions-101804/">customer onboarding and the surge in online growth</a> has forced organizations to adopt solutions that add good customers in real time while eliminating fraud.”</p>



<p>Ayers noted that strong identity verification services are becoming increasingly essential in virtually every industry, from the automotive sector all the way through to healthcare, hospitality, entertainment, transportation, and finance. The Aite-Novarica news comes shortly after Socure brought in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/latest-funding-round-makes-socure-most-highly-valued-identity-company-110907/">$450 million in a round of Series E funding</a>, which raised the company’s valuation to an industry-leading $4.5 billion.</p>

				  Indicio’s newest workshop is designed to provide the business community with the knowledge and confidence needed to make informed decisions about adopting and investing in the transformative power of trusted data ecosystems  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Scott Harris, COO, SSI Trainer</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to offer the <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/executive-education-ssi-workshop/">Executive Education SSI Workshop</a>. This two-hour, instructor-led workshop will provide a business and technical grounding in self-sovereign identity (SSI) technology. Participants will walk away with an essential understanding of how SSI works, the pain points it solves for, the risks it mitigates, the use cases currently in deployment, and the opportunities that are created by being able to build Trusted Data Ecosystems (TDEs).</p>
<p>Self-sovereign identity can be confusing. SSI involves new technologies, standards, and infrastructure to solve fundamental problems in Web 2.0. These include:</p>
 
 The absence of an identity layer 
 The vulnerabilities of user profiles, logins, and passwords 
 The burden of data privacy compliance 
 The need to adopt zero trust security approaches to prevent data breaches. 
 
<p>TDEs bring together the components to solve these problems and are available in off-the-shelf products that are easy to integrate with existing systems.</p>
<p>The Executive Education SSI workshop from Indicio is designed to show a business audience how decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials, and all their associated applications and infrastructure make it possible to verify data without having to check in with the source of that data—and in a way that solves the problem of privacy.</p>
<p>This training session is designed as a deep but manageable dive into a new and rapidly advancing technology. We’ll answer questions such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 What is identity as defined by the technology? 
 Why was this technology developed? 
 What problems does it solve? 
 What is the business value of implementing a Trusted Data Ecosystem? 
 What is required to make SSI work? 
 What is machine-readable governance? 
 How to implement a trusted data ecosystem? 
 How do you integrate SSI with existing IAM systems? 
 How does a business make and save money with this technology? 
 
<p>We’ll also discuss use cases — using verifiable credentials to communicate between different systems and sectors, such as between healthcare providers and the travel industry. Learn how, by solving even the smallest critical trust issue, you can mitigate all sorts of data and identity risks while generating new revenue and opportunities.</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/how-covid-19-catalyzed-digital-identity/">Indicio’s workshops</a> are interactive and instructor-led to provide the very best experience in small meeting groups of up to five people. This provides a setting to discuss specific use cases, answer questions and explore different types of high value data that needs to be verified as trustworthy.</p>
<p>Each session will conclude with Q&amp;A and each participant will be provided with course materials for their personal use. This workshop is particularly suitable for business executives and investors seeking to understand how this new technology works, how it is currently being implemented, and what we, as a leading developer in this field working with dozens of enterprises, see happening in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registration for this workshop is open now. Interested participants can purchase a session <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/executive-education-ssi-workshop/">here</a>&nbsp;.</p>

Learn about how you can jump-start your decentralized identity transformation with trusted data ecosystems to achieve powerful, measurable, and sustainable results.

 GiD Report #190 — The age of&nbsp;DAOs <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-189-crypto-takes-over-art-basel-ca301127e133">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The age of&nbsp;DAOs  The billionaire v. the&nbsp;DAO  Could DAOs replace corporations?  DAOs in&nbsp;action  This week in&nbsp;web3  Stuff happens   1. The age of decentralized autonomous organizations <p>Or DAO for&nbsp;short.</p><p>Over the summer, the sole copy of WuTang album, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html">acquired by PleasrDAO</a> (from the U.S. government via Martin Shkreli).</p><p>Some DAOs, like <a href="https://www.fwb.help/">Friends With Benefits</a>, are purely&nbsp;social.</p><p>Other DAOs, like many of today’s DeFi platforms, are powering tomorrow’s finance.</p><p>Could Fortune 500 corporations one day be set up as DAOs? (More on that&nbsp;later.)</p><p>Chris Dixon believes that networks should <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-187-what-is-a-dao-and-why-does-it-matter-d3fa4cf2a6c0">inherently be run as DAOs</a> (rather than corporations). It’s about incentives.</p><p>DAOs are “the ultimate combination of capitalism and progressivism,” <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1399498071873134592">says Mark&nbsp;Cuban</a>.</p><p>In many ways, DAOs represent the spirit of web3. When provided the proper tools — digital money and non-custodial wallets, governance, smart contracts, decentralized identity — we can start to reimagine the future and challenge the old ways of doing&nbsp;things.</p> 2. The billionaire versus the&nbsp;DAO <p>And the billionaire’s son.</p><p>I’m not sure if you could paint a more fitting&nbsp;picture.</p><p>On one end, you have hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, worth an estimated $20 billion — the poster boy for traditional finance. On the other, ConstitutionDAO, a loosely organized crypto community on Discord started by two Atlanta-based Millennials working in finance, Austin Cain and Graham, who collectively raised $40&nbsp;million.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/ken-griffin-s-son-told-him-you-have-to-buy-the-constitution">It wasn’t&nbsp;enough</a>:</p><blockquote>Why did Citadel founder Ken Griffin buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution last month for $43.2 million? His son told him&nbsp;to.</blockquote><blockquote>“I was sitting at home in New York and my son calls me to say, ‘Dad, you have to buy the Constitution,’” Griffin said in an interview after a luncheon hosted by the Palm Beach Civic Association at the Florida city’s Four Seasons hotel. Griffin didn’t give his son’s specific reason for wanting his father to make the purchase.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“I told myself, ‘I am going to own this,’” he said. “I don’t do that very&nbsp;often.”</blockquote><p>Goliath wanted to win, and he&nbsp;did.</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/ken-griffin-s-son-told-him-you-have-to-buy-the-constitution">Billionaire Ken Griffin’s Son Told Him ‘You Have to Buy the Constitution’</a>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution">From a meme to $47 million: ConstitutionDAO, crypto, and the future of crowdfunding</a>   3. Could DAOs replace corporations? <p>There’s <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/dao-llc">still a lot to figure&nbsp;out</a>:</p><blockquote>DAOs could be another way to form LLCs, but can they really replace companies? Crypto-friendly Wyoming passed a law in July allowing people to create an LLC with a DAO that has an Ethereum address. If a conflict arises in a DAO, a judge in Wyoming could rule on a dispute. But this wouldn’t work if one of the parties is outside of Wyoming, Jackson said: That aspect of the law hasn’t been&nbsp;tested.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s not either/or. Some DAOs need to register as LLCs and have done so. The LAO is a Delaware-registered LLC that is “primarily administered via an online application (a ‘DApp’) and related smart contracts,” its website says. In other words, the DAO structure provides coordination and voting, but sits on top of the LLC structurally.</blockquote><blockquote>One group, CityDAO, purchased 40 acres of land in Wyoming under the law seeking to build a blockchain city. However, after Wyoming recognized another DAO, American CryptoFed, the SEC in November blocked the DAO’s token registration due to a “materially deficient and misleading registration form.” In other words, even if a state recognizes a DAO, it may still need SEC approval to register its&nbsp;tokens.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The biggest challenge for DAOs may be their legal status, which is still unclear. “As with many ‘innovations’ in crypto, the primary novelty here seems to be ignoring laws,” Thompson&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/dao-llc">Crypto advocates want to replace the LLC with&nbsp;DAOs</a>  <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/do-daos-work">Do DAOs&nbsp;work?</a>   4. DAOs in&nbsp;action <p>The EOS community isn’t satisfied with Block.one, the company that created the network (co-founded by Brock Pierce). Now <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/126801/eos-community-halts-payments-worth-250-million-in-eos-to-block-one-and-brock-pierce">they’re taking&nbsp;action</a>:</p><blockquote>The EOS community today elected to stop ongoing payments to Block.one — the company that originally designed the network — over claims that it is no longer acting in the network’s best interests.</blockquote><blockquote>Those running have stopped the issuance of 67 million EOS ($250 million) that was set to be distributed over the next six to seven years. This will also affect Brock Pierce — a co-founder of stablecoin issuer Tether and co-founder of Block.one — since Block.one said he would have received around half of the&nbsp;tokens.</blockquote><blockquote>“Through a super majority consensus, the EOS network has taken its future in its own hands by voting to fire Block.one and stop vesting tokens to them. This begins a new era for EOS and highlights the power of the blockchain to enable a community to stand up against corporate interests that don’t align with theirs,” said Yves La Rose, leader of the EOS Network Foundation.</blockquote><p>But DAOs in action can also mean inaction. Democracy <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/sushiswap-infighting-exposes-pitfalls-of-decentralized-crypto">can be&nbsp;messy</a>:</p><blockquote>SushiSwap, the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that started with a scandal, is facing a crossroads as infighting among developers has investors seeking to reorganize the supposed autonomous organization.</blockquote><blockquote>Two large owners of Sushi tokens, which gives holders governance rights over how the protocol operates, submitted a proposal to restructure the project that may be considered for adoption as early as this week. The plan suggests establishing a more formalized entity to manage the effort, and checks and balances to ensure the proper spending of&nbsp;funds.</blockquote><blockquote>SushiSwap was supposed to be “a community-built open-source ecosystem,” in which users could trade directly with each other, without intermediaries, and make operational decisions. But it turned out to be largely controlled by a handful of mostly anonymous developers, who sometimes bypassed community votes and have been seeking to increase their compensation. The discord has led to the trading of accusations of extravagant spending and self-enrichment without community approval or oversight, and the quitting of the exchange’s chief technology officer Wednesday.</blockquote><blockquote>“It is physically impossible for every decision a DAO makes to go to a public vote,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto investment firm Arca, which is one of the sponsors of the restructuring proposal, said in an interview. “We are using Sushi as a microcosm for what all DAOs should look like in the&nbsp;future.”</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/126801/eos-community-halts-payments-worth-250-million-in-eos-to-block-one-and-brock-pierce">EOS community halts $250 million of funding to Block.one, Brock&nbsp;Pierce</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/sushiswap-infighting-exposes-pitfalls-of-decentralized-crypto">SushiSwap Infighting Exposes Pitfalls of Decentralized Crypto</a>   5.

<p>This fall, we started our <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/verified-by-civic-pass/">Verified by Civic Pass</a> program to build trust within the NFT community. Today, we’re beyond thrilled to announce that we’ve verified our 50th creator and confirmed they will use Civic’s Ignite Pass to protect their NFT drop from bots.</p>



<p>Please join us in welcoming <a href="https://proleague.gg/">ProLeague</a> to the Verified by Civic Pass club!  ProLeague is fostering the growth of the next generation of esport professionals by offering an engaging platform that uses blockchain, NFTs, and their own unique cryptocurrency to reward and incentivize competitive play.</p>



<p>To be Verified by Civic Pass, team founders went through identity verification that included identity document scanning and limited-scope document verification; a 3D face scan; facial match comparison between the 3D face of the live user to their 2D photo identity document; and screening for sanctions, PEP and adverse media listings. Control of their project Twitter handle and project domain were also verified as part of the process.</p>



<p>Now that ProLeague has been Verified by Civic Pass, the project’s nascent community will continue to accumulate trust, the most essential building block of a strong community. As Aristotle once said “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” With Civic Pass, we’re helping lay a stronger foundation for the whole.</p>



<p>ProLeague will also be using Ignite Pass, which will protect their NFT drop from bot manipulation. Ignite Pass is just one of the features that we’ve added to our suite of Civic Pass products for NFT creators. Other features to make minting easier will soon be available on CandyMachine v2.</p>



<p>Since our first verifications of <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1447383173420052480">Metasaurs by Dr. DMT</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1453031075265929223">Flux Art Project</a> with Civic Pass, we’ve grown the Verified by Civic Pass program by leaps and bounds.

<p>DECEMBER 14, 2021 | NEW YORK</p>
<p>Report finds more than 80% of consumers in the U.S. – and 90% of younger consumers – are already connecting their bank accounts to technology apps.</p>
 
<p>Mastercard released a new report today,&nbsp;<a href="https://openbanking.mastercard.com/the-rise-of-open-banking">The Rise of Open Banking</a>, demonstrating the mainstream adoption of technology to power smarter, more meaningful digital experiences. Open banking puts consumers at the center of where and how their data is used to more effectively provide the services they want and need. Fintech companies and banks use this consumer-permissioned data to provide easier and more inclusive access to credit, personal financial management, digital wallets and payments services.</p>
<p>Open banking is already embedded in several areas of our daily lives, including personal financial management tools, linking of financial accounts and account opening. According to the report, nine in 10 consumers in the U.S. and Canada use online and mobile financial applications to manage money, with paying bills (82%) and banking (80%) as the most popular use cases.</p>
<p>“Open banking gives consumers choice by enabling them to use their own data to obtain financial services solutions quickly, simply and securely,” said Chiro Aikat, Executive Vice President, Product &amp; Engineering, North America. “Mastercard plays a central role in this ecosystem as a trusted intermediary and secure data network that powers smarter, more meaningful experiences and empowers consumers to practice good financial habits that enhance their day-to-day lives.”</p>
<p>Accelerated Shift to Digital</p>
<p>The survey uncovered that over the past year consumers have increasingly conducted common transactions digitally including:</p>
 
 Sending money to friends, family and businesses, with 59% of consumers using digital apps, products and/or services to do so and 36% in the U.S. using this technology for the first time in the last year 
 Securing or refinancing a loan (28% of consumers) 
 Emerging use cases like buying or selling cryptocurrency and crowdfunding 
 
<p>Open banking is at the foundation of many of these applications, where fintech companies, banks and financial institutions are connecting financial data securely and seamlessly to enable a wide range of financial products and services.</p>
<p>Willingness to Connect Financial Accounts</p>
<p>Critical to driving many, if not all, of these transactions is the ability for consumers to securely link their bank or payment accounts and authorize their financial data to be used in online financial applications. The report found that:</p>
 
 74% of consumers in the U.S. (65% of Canadians) have, or would, consider connecting their bank accounts to financial apps and services to automate financial tasks 
 68% in the U.S. (69% of Canadians) would do so to easily send money to someone 
 
<p>Trust in Fintech</p>
<p>Consumers are already connecting their data via multiple platforms to manage finances, and thus make their data work harder for them. Of those surveyed:</p>
 
 59% of US respondents (55% of Canadians) feel very confident using technology to manage money 
 Convenience is a top driver for using financial technology, with 59% of consumers in Canada and the U.S. saying fintech saves them time and is less work. 
 
<p>Putting consumers at the center of how and where their financial data is used ensures greater transparency and in turn helps fintech companies, banks and financial institutions gather feedback, scale faster and create new financial products and services more efficiently. Mastercard is a trusted partner and provides the highest levels of security and protection in every interaction and data transfer, adhering to its own data protection principles and standards: Consumers own the data they produce every day — and have the right to understand and control how it is shared and used.</p>

<p>On November 10, 2021, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXoEq7Za4Sw">KILT reached the final phase of decentralization</a>. Until that day, any changes to the KILT blockchain could be made using the Sudo key which was under control of BOTLabs GmbH, the company that initially developed KILT Protocol. This Sudo module allowed KILT’s developers to initiate staking and introduce governance and a Treasury. Once these were tested, KILT functionalities such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials were added and audited, and the Sudo key was&nbsp;removed.</p><p>Governance of KILT Protocol now belongs to the community of KILT Coin holders, which has the power to decide on the future of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>This decision-making power comes with responsibility. To encourage active participation in the democracy of the network, this step-by-step guide was created by BOTLabs GmbH to help the community fully understand the process and use their&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Before voting on any referendum, you can read more about it and join the discussion in <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/onchain">Polkassembly</a> (under “On-chain” → “Referenda”). Polkassembly is an open-source platform for providing information, context and a discussion forum for proposals and referenda in the Polkadot ecosystem. Of note, coins that are locked for staking may also be used to&nbsp;vote.</p> Casting a Vote on Polkadot.JS   Go to <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/democracy">KILT Spiritnet</a> on Polkadot.JS  Under the “Governance” → “Democracy” section you will see active referenda and proposals  Scroll to the referendum you wish to vote&nbsp;on  Click “Vote”  <p>5. This opens a separate pop-up. Enter the amount of coins you want to lock (1 in the image above). The minimum required to vote is 1&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>6. You can vote with multiplier 0.1 (up to 10% of your voting coins) and your coins are only locked for the duration of the referendum.</p><p>If you wish to increase your voting power by selecting a period of time to lock your coins, click the arrow next to conviction (2 in the image above). Choose your conviction in the drop-down menu.</p><p>Please note: if the referendum is successful, your coins will remain locked for this period; if unsuccessful, your coins will be unlocked when the referendum has finished. Also because voting happens transparently on-chain, it requires a small transaction fee (around 0.017 KILT). While locked coins or coins used for staking can be simultaneously used for voting, a usable, unlocked balance to cover this fee is required.</p><p>7. Vote “Aye” if you agree with the proposal and “Nay” if you disagree.</p><p>8. Click “Sign and Submit” in the&nbsp;pop-up.</p><p>9. Sign the transaction by entering your password (Sporran or Polkadot.JS, depending on where you are connected.)</p><p>10. That’s&nbsp;it!</p> Backgrounder: Conviction Voting <p>Like Polkadot and Kusama, KILT Protocol has conviction voting. This means if you feel very strongly about a proposal, you can lock up coins for longer periods to increase your voting power up to a maximum factor of 6. The longer you lock your coins, the stronger your vote will be weighted.</p><p>The times range from no lockup to a period of around 224 days, with the lockup time beginning after the voting period ends. Coins used for voting will always be locked until the end of the voting period, no matter what conviction you vote&nbsp;with.</p><p>Of note: the lock time is based on the standard block time of 12 seconds per block and hence may vary due to differences in the real block&nbsp;time.</p><p>If you choose not to lock any coins, your vote only counts as 10% of the coins that you commit to the voting (vote value), while the maximum lockup of around 224 days means you can make your vote count for 600% of the vote value. You can choose to lock all or some of your coins for any range between 0.1x and 6x, with a lockup time as outlined&nbsp;above.</p><p>For example: You have a wallet with 1,001 KILT Coins. This could include staked or vested&nbsp;coins.</p><p>Example 1 — minimum</p>  You want to vote but don’t want to lock any&nbsp;coins.  You enter 1,000 into the “vote&nbsp;value”  You choose “0.1 x voting balance, no lockup&nbsp;period”  This gives you a voting power of 100 KILT&nbsp;Coins  Note that all your 1,000 coins are locked for the time of the voting period (7&nbsp;days).  <p>Example 2 — maximum</p>  You strongly believe in the referendum and want to vote with your full balance and maximum conviction.  Choose “6 x voting balance, locked for 32x enactment (224&nbsp;days)”  This will give you a voting power of 6,000 KILT Coins, if you use your full amount, or 6 times the voting power of the amount you chose. The chosen amount will be locked for a period of around 224 days after the voting period ends (7&nbsp;days).  <p>Of note: rounded numbers are used as an example only — make sure that you always leave enough free, usable balance to cover the transaction fees.</p><p>Conviction voting allows users with a small amount of coins to increase their voting power, and deters a KILT coin holder from creating and voting on a malicious proposal and then leaving the&nbsp;network.</p><p>If the referendum is successful, your voting coins will remain locked for the time specified (which means that you will be unable to transfer them, but they will still be usable for staking during that time); if unsuccessful, your coins will be unlocked after the referendum has finished.</p><p>KILT also uses an algorithm to adapt the amount of “aye” (yes/agree) votes needed to pass depending on voter turnout: the greater the number of voters, the lower the threshold required to pass. Therefore, when voter turnout is low a supermajority is generally required; with a high turnout a simple majority is sufficient.</p> How to Remove a&nbsp;Vote <p>If you change your mind and want to remove your vote from an open referendum, you will need to find the index of the referendum you voted on, remove your vote from that index, and unlock the coins locked for&nbsp;voting.</p> Find the referendum index   Go to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/democracy">democracy tab in the Polkadot&nbsp;Apps</a>  Note the number next to the referendum you voted&nbsp;for   Remove the&nbsp;vote<a href="https://dev.kilt.io/docs/chain/Governance/remove_vote/#remove-the-vote">​</a> <p>Go to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/extrinsics">extrinsic tab in the Polkadot&nbsp;Apps</a></p>  Select the account you used for&nbsp;voting  Select the “democracy” pallet  Select the “removeVote” extrinsic  Enter the index of the referendum  Sign and send the extrinsic  <p>6.

<p>Description:</p> <p>It’s a bittersweet episode, as Richard announces that this will be his last show before he moves on from Ping Identity. After sharing a few highlights from former guests and episode topics, he then passes the baton and welcomes Aubrey Turner, Executive Advisor at Ping Identity. Aubrey shares some of his career highlights and embraces the new role, inspired to connect with the audience and continue with deep conversations that help connect, educate, and motivate.</p> <p>Key Takeaways:</p> <p>[6:40] Richard thanks the listeners, former guests, and production team for working with him on the podcast. He then brings on the new host, Aubrey Turner. Aubrey shares his background and what spending time at Deloitte did to prepare him for his role at Ping Identity.</p> <p>[10:45] Identity was all about resource sharing, and now identity is all about trying not to share resources with the bad guys.</p> <p>[12:27] What are the trends in identity that Richard and Aubrey see that we should be paying attention to? Why does the fraud angle fascinate Aubrey?</p> <p>[21:20] What is the Great Resignation, and how do we thrive in a society where “rage quitting” and not showing up for your first day of work is becoming more and more common?</p> <p>[28:27] Ultimately, technology is a means of production. We’re building capabilities to deliver outcomes for human beings.</p> <p>[32:26] Richard shares his parting words, and emphasizes the importance of looking at new solutions from a different angle.</p> <p>Quotes:</p>    “What we do matters.” — Aubrey   “Identity was all about resource sharing, and now identity is all about trying not to share resources with the bad guys.” — Richard   “[An] IT job is a security job, right?

 What is Affinidi’s Digital&nbsp;Wallet? <p>Wallets are an important accessory that we carry at all times. Besides money and debit/credit cards, it also holds our <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/protecting-your-drivers-license-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-25d22aeac05b">driver’s license</a>, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/accessing-medical-records-anywhere-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-81a248f9b746">health insurance</a>, and other documents that identify you and authenticate you to access certain services.</p><p>As we transition to a digital life, the physical wallet is giving way to a digital wallet that contains all the information related to our identity, but in a digital&nbsp;format.</p><p>In this sense, a digital wallet is an encrypted storage for <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">securely storing</a> your verifiable credentials, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public and private keys</a>, or any other secure information related to your identity.</p><p>Now that you have an idea of what a wallet is, let’s learn more about the Affinidi&nbsp;wallet.</p> What is the Affinidi&nbsp;Wallet? <p>The <a href="http://wallet.affinidi.com">Affinidi Wallet</a> is a web-based responsive <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> wallet application for holders to request, store, share and manage their <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">digital identity</a>.</p><p>Specifically, you can do the following with Affinidi’s wallet.</p> Store Verifiable Credentials <p>Affinidi wallet is a single repository of all your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">verifiable credentials</a> obtained from different issuers.</p><p>You can imagine this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a> to be something similar to your physical wallet where you carry your driver’s license, credit cards, and other IDs. Except that in this wallet, everything is digital, so it is safe from thefts and accidental losses.</p> Share Verifiable Credentials <p>You can share your VC with anyone on the Internet with just a click. Simply click the share button and copy the link that the Affinidi wallet generates for that&nbsp;VC.</p><p>You can share the link with anyone or you can even choose to share the link directly through social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Whatsapp.</p> Control your&nbsp;VCs <p>One of the key tenets of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> is to give you complete control over your data and credentials.</p><p>With Affinidi wallet, you can choose to accept or reject any VC, and can decide whom you want to share it with. Also, you can choose to select only some part of the VCs, based on how the VC is implemented.</p><p>Additionally, you can view the VCs issued to you at any time and delete the ones that you think are <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">revoked</a>, expired, or not applicable for you&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>Thus, these are some things you can do with the Affinidi&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Next, let’s look at the workflow of the wallet, right from the time a VC is issued to a new&nbsp;user.</p> Workflow of Affinidi&nbsp;Wallet <p>The Affinidi wallet is simple to use, thereby making it ideal for all scenarios and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use-cases</a>.</p><p>Here is the step-by-step workflow for a new&nbsp;user.</p> Step 1: Create a VC and send an&nbsp;email <p>When an issuer issues a new VC to a holder who is not already signed up for the Affinidi wallet, an email is sent to the holder with a link to create the Affinidi&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>When the user clicks the “Add to wallet!” button, the onboarding process&nbsp;begins.</p> Step 2: Create a new&nbsp;account <p>The user is directed to an onboarding screen. Here, the user is prompted to enter a new password and confirm&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, there is a two-factor authentication check in place, and the user has to enter the OTP sent to the associated email&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Please note that the password must contain a minimum of eight characters with one lowercase, one uppercase, one special character, and one number respectively.</p> Step 3: Accept or Reject the&nbsp;VC <p>Once the user logs in, he or she can choose to accept or reject the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>As you can see, all the pertinent information about the VC is displayed, so the user can make an informed decision.</p><p>This is an important step as it gives the user complete control over what he/she wants to do with every VC. If the user rejects the VC, the same is discarded and not stored in the wallet. On the other hand, if the VC is accepted, it is stored in the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Step 4: View the&nbsp;VC <p>After accepting the VC, the same is stored in the wallet and is displayed to the&nbsp;user.</p><p>During subsequent logins, the user can see all the VCs stored in the wallet and can click on them for specific&nbsp;details.</p><p>When the user clicks on a particular VC, all the information contained in it is displayed.</p> Step 5: Share the&nbsp;VC <p>Sharing the information contained in the VC is&nbsp;easy.</p><p>There are two ways to share the VC, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Entire VC, where all the information such as your first name, last name, email ID, etc. are&nbsp;shared.  <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602">Selective disclosure</a>, where you choose to share only some information from the&nbsp;VC.  <p>To do this, choose a VC and click on “Selective Share” at the top right-hand corner and a pop-up will appear showing all the&nbsp;details.</p><p>You can select the information you want to share and click the “Update”&nbsp;button.</p><p>This will create a shareable link that you can send to anyone. You can even share it through Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, and LinkedIn.</p><p>Please note that the “selective share” option will be displayed only if the VC supports selective disclosure that’s implemented through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signatures</a>. If the VC doesn’t support selective disclosure, you will see only a “share”&nbsp;option.</p><p>In this case, you can share the entire VC&nbsp;only.</p> Step 6: Delete the&nbsp;VC <p>An important pillar of self-sovereign identity is to give you control to do whatever you want with your information, including deleting&nbsp;it.</p><p>Affinidi wallet gives you the option to delete any VC at any time. Simple click on the three dots on the right-hand top corner and choose “delete”.</p><p>You will be asked for confirmation.</p><p>When you select “yes”, the VC will be&nbsp;deleted.</p><p>Thus, these are the things a user can do with the Affinidi wallet, right from the time a VC is&nbsp;issued.</p><p>Moving on, let’s dwell a bit on the technical implementation.</p> Technical Implementation of the&nbsp;Wallet <p>The key API of our tech stack that supports wallet implementation is&nbsp;the</p><p>Cloud-wallet-api</p><p>This API interacts with the user and enables this entity to securely store, access, and share&nbsp;VCs.</p> Functionality <p>This API supports the following functionalities.</p> Onboarding   DID/key creation  Recovery flow   Storage   Backup of&nbsp;VCs  Key Recovery  Key Rotation  VC Revocation   Exchange   Claim a&nbsp;VC  Share a&nbsp;VC  Share a&nbsp;VP  Selective disclosure   User management   API for signup — This API will create DIDs and&nbsp;keys.

<p>If you would rather watch a video, <a>Micah Silverman</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJlfrAicVtc&amp;start=1000&amp;end=1262">JWTs for CSRF &amp; Microservices</a> (at 16:42) talk covers some of these topics too!</p>
 
 

 
 
 1. Checking secrets into source control 
 
 
<p>Checking a secret into source control is a mistake that’s easily made. This is an anti-pattern that most of us have done in error at some point, even if we don’t want to admit it. Once a secret is in your source control, it’s there forever; and can easily be found by doing a <a href="https://github.com/search?q=removed+password&amp;type=commits">a quick history search</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>If you find a secret in your source, remove it and revoke it. Of course, it’s best if secrets are never checked in to begin with! Watch out for them in code reviews and scan your code bases to ensure this doesn’t happen: <a href="https://www.gitguardian.com/">GitGuardian</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets">git-secrets</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Secrets often enter source trees by accident, usually because you temporarily typed one into a config file. When secrets are mixed in with other application properties, they become harder to spot and easier to forget about. Keep secrets out of your source entirely by using an <a href="https://12factor.net/config">external configuration</a> provider like <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">HashiCorp Vault</a>, using environmental variables, or by keeping secrets in a separate file outside of your source tree (or one that is explicitly ignored in your <code>.gitignore</code> file).</p>
 
 






Check out the <a href="https://github.com/paulschwarz/spring-dotenv">spring-dotenv</a> to use <code>.env</code> files with your Spring projects.



 
 
 
 
 2. Conflating encoding with encryption 
 
 
<p>They are not the same! Many folks are confused about the difference between encoding and encryption; they are distinct operations and cannot be interchanged.</p>
 
 
 Encoding 
 
<p>Data that is encoded is transformed into another format, usually to make transferring between systems possible. An encoded value may or may not be human-readable, but it needs to be treated the same way as the original input source.  The following examples show a string encoded in two common encoding schemes: URL encoding and base64 encoding.</p>
 
 
 URL encoded: 
 
 <code>String text = "Can you still read this text?";
String encoded = URLEncoder.encode(text, UTF_8);
// encoded: Can+you+still+read+this+text%3F
String decoded = URLDecoder.decode(encoded, UTF_8);
assertThat(decoded, equalTo(decoded));</code> 
 
 
 
 Base64 encoded (not human-readable): 
 
 <code>String text = "Can you still read this text?";
String encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(text.getBytes(UTF_8));
// encoded: Q2FuIHlvdSBzdGlsbCByZWFkIHRoaXMgdGV4dD8=
String decoded = new String(Base64.getDecoder().decode(encoded.getBytes(UTF_8)));
assertThat(decoded, equalTo(decoded));</code> 
 
 
 






In both cases, the encoded data can easily be reversed, and the encoded string must be treated the same way as plain text.



 
 
 
 Encryption 
 
<p>In contrast, data that’s encrypted can only be read by authorized parties (anyone with the correct cryptographic key). When data is encrypted, the resulting value is indistinguishable from random data. Because of this, encrypted data is often also encoded to make it easier to transport. For example, in the case of JSON Web Encryption (JWE), the JSON payload is encrypted and is then transformed to a base64-encoded string.</p>
 
 






Encryption is a complex topic and not suitable for a quick example. If you want to see a follow-up post covering common encryption use cases, leave a comment below!



 
 
<p>If you are using Kubernetes, make sure your secrets are encrypted. By default, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Kubernetes Secrets</a> store data as base64-encoded strings, as shown above. This isn’t any better than plain text. The good news is there are a few alternatives: use HashiCorp’s Vault, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/amazon-eks-supports-adding-kms-envelope-encryption-to-existing-clusters/">AWS KMS</a>, or <a href="https://dev.to/stack-labs/store-your-kubernetes-secrets-in-git-thanks-to-kubeseal-hello-sealedsecret-2i6h">Sealed Secrets</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 3. Using the bytes of a string for your key 
 
 
<p>Many of us confuse the terms password and secret key. Generally speaking, passwords make poor cryptographic keys. People often choose memorable words for passwords, making them easy to guess.  Even good passwords that are long and randomly generated have less entropy (the measure of the randomness) than a byte array of the same size.</p>
 
 
<p>To illustrate this point, think of a password of eight characters. (To keep the math simple, limit the characters to displayable ASCII.) There are 95 displayable ASCII characters, which means an eight-character password has a total of 958 = 6.6×1015 possible combinations. A random array of bytes doesn’t have this displayable character limit; each byte in the array has 256 possibilities, so a byte array of the same size has 2568 = 1.8×1019 total possible combinations!</p>
 
 
<p>Instead of getting the bytes directly from a <code>String</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>String secret = "password";
byte[] secretBytes = secret.getBytes(UTF_8);</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Use random bytes that are base64 encoded. The example below was generated by running: <code>openssl rand -base64 8</code></p>
 
 
 
 <code>String secret = "JJsm0MaRPHI="; // 8 random bytes base64-encoded
byte[] secretBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(secret.getBytes(UTF_8));</code> 
 
 
 







Did you notice that I hardcoded secrets into these examples?
 
 
 

 
 
 




 
 
 
 
 4. Failing to restrict access to secrets 
 
 
<p>It’s hard to keep secrets, well…​ secret. Do you know who has access to each secret used by your application? Secrets kept in environment variables can be viewed by anyone who has access to the running process on the system <code>ps e -ww -p &lt;pid&gt;</code>, or access to the Docker daemon <code>docker inspect &lt;container&gt;</code>.  Even "hidden" secrets used by your build server are <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/GitHub-Actions-Secrets-Example-Token-Tutorial">easy to leak</a>. Most popular CI services will filter build logs of passwords, but it’s easy to work around filters. For example, this GitHub Actions script adds a space between each character to bypass the filtering.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>steps:
- name: Not So Hidden Secret
  run: "echo ${{secrets.TEST_SECRET}} | sed 's/./&amp; /g'"

# output: C a n   y o u   s t i l l   r e a d   t h i s   t e x t ?</code> 
 
 
 






I’m not suggesting you do this; doing so may get you fired. Just be aware that it can happen and treat your secrets accordingly.



 
 
 
 
 5. Building your own crypto 
 
 
<p>As the old saying goes, "Don’t roll your own crypto." You are probably aware that you shouldn’t implement crypto algorithms yourself, but there’s much more to it. Knowing how the output will be used and understanding the protocol involved are just as important as the actual algorithm choice. Different algorithms have been developed for different use cases; many protocols or formats are designed with these specific use cases in mind.</p>
 
 
<p>Instead of cobbling together lower-level primitives, use a high-level library.  This suggestion may be obvious for protocols like TLS/HTTPS, but it also applies to simple formats; a lot can go wrong when a <a>JWT is parsed without a quality library</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Bonus: Be ready to rotate your secrets 
 
 
<p>If history has taught us anything about secrets, it’s that they will leak. In the last year there have been a few notable cases of secrets exposed: <a href="https://travis-ci.community/t/security-bulletin/12081">Travis-CI</a> and <a href="https://about.codecov.io/security-update/">Codecov</a>. After these issues were disclosed, teams scrambled to update secrets that may have been affected, which often resulted in broken builds.</p>
 
 






When people leave your project, any secrets they had access to must be updated.

				  As you build, as you implement decentralized digital health credential systems, keep these broad points in mind  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio is a leading developer of decentralized digital health credentials and leads the <a href="http://cardea.app/">Cardea </a>community group at Linux Public Health Foundation. When it comes to building and using decentralized digital health credentials for managing Covid testing and vaccination, there’s a lot to consider. We want to share what we’ve learned through successful development and trials, and hope these eight rules will be a useful guide if you’re a policy or decision maker thinking about implementation and a helpful reminder if you’re an engineer focused on building a system.</p>
<p>1. The thing just has to work — This may sound like a no-brainer, but from our experience, this can be often overlooked. Want broad adoption? Your application must be fast and functional. If it causes too much friction people either won’t use it or they’ll look for ways around it.</p>
<p>2. When in doubt throw it out — Don’t include a data point unless you have a strong use case for that information. This keeps the data to a minimum, requiring less load time and storage, and provides fewer chances for the information to be misused or data lost.</p>
<p>3. Don’t reinvent the wheel — If you are making a passport, driver’s license, certification, or form, make the credential a digital twin of that form so people will find it easier to recognize it and adopt.</p>
<p>4. Go with open source over proprietary — Open-source products lead to easier fixes, upgrades, and competition to keep the price down. There’s a community of expert developers backing the product — and interoperability is built in. Proprietary often means expensive upgrades or expansions, or obsolescence and replacing an entire system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. There must be a backup plan — Ideally you have multiple backup plans. If the technology isn’t available what happens? You need to maintain some kind of offline option or option for people without access to a phone or unable to use a phone.</p>
<p>6. Test across a wide range of devices — Compatibility and accessibility go hand in hand: What works on Apple might not work on android — or any other phone people might have access to. The same goes for internet browsers. The best thing you can do is break it first—so you can fix it before people rely on it.</p>
<p>7. Partner with businesses for the rollout — To drive adoption, people will need some sort of incentive to use the credential along with places to use it. People will go with the option that requires the least amount of effort; but if they are turned away when trying to use your credential, they will be unlikely to use it again.</p>
<p>8. Start now — No technology is perfect; some bugs will always need to be worked out; but those who build early will see the most benefits. Implementation is a teacher. They will be able to improve their systems, learning from experience, while everyone else is still working on their first attempt.</p>

<p>13 December 2021, Grand Cayman and Berlin — SpiderDAO and BOTLabs GmbH, the company that initially developed KILT Protocol, today announced that identities composed of DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials) using the KILT Protocol will be integrated into SpiderDAO’s range of&nbsp;routers.</p><p>KILT is a decentralized blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous verifiable credentials. KILT provides a way to represent your identity without revealing things you prefer to keep private. KILT brings the old process of trust in real-world verifiable credentials (passport, driving license) to the digital world, while keeping your data private and in your possession.</p><p>KILT can also be used for machine identity to create identifiers for machines, services and anything that identities can be built on — such as routers. SpiderDAO’s developers will be working closely with BOTLabs GmbH to enable integration of DIDs into the firmware of their military-grade VPN routers. The combination of a world-class VPN router and a fully decentralized way of issuing, holding and verifying credentials, all in one piece of hardware, will create a powerful tool for consumer protection and privacy. This integration will also combat identity theft and loss of control of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>SpiderDAO has developed a multi-layered governance setup based on hardware and software tools built on Polkadot, providing a “one router one vote” approach. Users could verify themselves via a combination of the MAC address and serial number of the router, and the DID that uses the KILT Protocol. The DID would be implemented as an additional middleware layer, bonded to the hardware, making it difficult to copy or spoof a user’s identity and governance votes.</p><p>Quote from Nathan Vary, CEO SpiderDAO:</p><p>“SpiderDAO is delighted to work with BOTLabs GmbH as they build out their extensive roadmap. We look forward to being able to provide our clients with industry-leading security and offer further protection of their online privacy by utilizing KILT Protocol within our SpiderVPN routers. As more and more users demand decentralized and secure personal data ownership, we anticipate an exciting long-term collaboration.”</p><p>Quote from Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH:</p><p>“We were interested in collaborating with SpiderDAO due to their unique approach to governance through machine identity. SpiderDAO has the potential to democratise internet access and we are happy to be part of this journey. KILT Protocol became a fully decentralized blockchain in November, and we look forward to testing new tools that advance governance initiatives in the Polkadot ecosystem.”</p> About BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH <p>BOTLabs GmbH is a Berlin-based research and development company focusing on blockchain. It was founded in January 2018 by Ingo Rübe and German publishing house Burda GmbH, for whom he served as CTO from 2012 to 2017; Swiss publisher Ringier AG later joined as a shareholder. BOTLabs is the initial developer of KILT Protocol, now a decentralized blockchain network. The SocialKYC identity verification service, Sporran wallet and Stakeboard platform were developed by a subsidiary of BOTLabs called B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH. BOTLabs is a founding member of the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) and a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and Blockchain for&nbsp;Europe.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s open-source Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy. KILT Protocol was initially developed by BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH.</p><p>Reach KILT Protocol&nbsp;on:</p><p><a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/">Medium</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/">Website</a></p> About SpiderDAO <p>SpiderVPN provides a decentralized router-based VPN service for its users by using a dual-governance model which brings together hardware and software tools with on-chain elements.

<p>Wylie is a large suburb in Collin County in northeast Texas. Located just shy of 25 miles from downtown Dallas, there’s nothing particularly striking about this relatively small community (by American standards) of around 50,000 people. Named after Col. W.D. Wylie, a railway engineer who, according to historians, was rather keen on having a town named after him. His wish was granted in 1887.</p>

 What is the SmartWallet 2.0 and what does it do?&nbsp; 



<p>The main purpose behind Jolocom’s SmartWallet, first and foremost, is to give the user more control over his or her data in a privacy preserving way. In a nutshell, the SmartWallet therefore merges the SSI world in one single application. Compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the SmartWallet 2.0 is unique because it is built off the blockchain, giving EU citizens the right to opt-out of companies collecting personally identifiable information. In this way, SmartWallet 2.0 is&nbsp; the first of its kind because it represents a successful GDPR-compliant self-sovereign identity solution.&nbsp;</p>



 Planning and Creating&nbsp; 



<p>Planning started back in 2019. The previous Smartwallet 1.x.x. was in need for a remaking; especially the camera and settings screen needed improvement. It was soon to be decided that instead of a new update, what the SmartWallet actually needed was a complete new refactoring. So, instead of amending changes, the Wallet should be build from scratch as something new. July 2021 saw the first release of the new SmartWallet 2.0. The main focus hereby layed on the improvement of user experience, visual aspects and also functionality. Some aspects of the previous Wallet were kept, however, if only a few, for instance the first screen images and parts of the onboarding. Overall, a new SmartWallet was created.&nbsp;</p>



 Why it’s special&nbsp; 



<p>It is often overlooked, the way we share identity data. Jolocom’s SmartWallet 2.0 therefore wants to ensure that the data that we store today remains safe tomorrow. By this forward-looking approach to identity management, Jolocom helps individuals, enterprises, and governments to employ identity solutions for a digitally native world. Moreover, the SmartWallet 2.0 is adaptable to fit future use cases like eID, Covid passports, or gym memberships, for example, by being GDPR-compliant. No one – not even Jolocom – can access the info with out permission from the holder.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Avast, a cybersecurity and privacy company, announced on December 9th 2021 their intent to acquire Evernym.</p>
<p>Founded in 1988 in Prague, Czech Republic, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response">Avast</a> focuses both on meeting both consumer and enterprise use cases. On the enterprise side it offers endpoint protection such as patch management, internet/email/web gateway, and content filtering. For consumers, Avast provides a range of security protections and privacy measures for individual devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80521/providers-of-verified-identity">Evernym</a> was founded in 2013 in Salt Lake City, UT, USA. It provides blockchain-based decentralized identity solutions that enable organizations to issue and request Verifiable Credentials, and individuals to establish identity wallets and personal control over identity information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/avast-to-acquire-evernym-301440885.html">Avast CEO’s statements</a> have centered primarily on the consumer aspect: “Consumer trust in the online world has been critically compromised...Our vision for a digital freedom is to enable people to manage and retain control over their personal data so that they can interact and transact safely, privately and with confidence. Decentralized digital identities are a key component of that vision.” This seems to indicate a focus on the individual with future products based on the Evernym technology, perhaps to further interrupt digital tracking, online surveillance, and identity fraud. Indeed, a stated goal at this time is to enable a secure, portable, reusable identity that are universally and globally available.</p>
<p>The acquisition is projected to close in mid-December with products based on Evernym technology to be available in 2022.</p>
<p>A Promising Pairing</p>
<p>There is a natural pairing between the goals of a consumer cybersecurity company and a decentralized identity company: they both work to empower the individual to take control of and protect their online presence.</p>
<p>Avast’s product suite ranges from VPNs, antivirus, anti-tracking, monitoring of personal information potentially affected by data breaches, and so on. Evernym enables user-centric identity, where the individual user holds, controls, and shares their identity data in a privacy-preserving way.</p>
<p>Adding a decentralized identity function to Avast’s arsenal of personal privacy tools is a natural step to empower individuals to keep their information from being stockpiled in the many siloes of the many service providers they interact with.</p>
<p>The Pathway to Mass Adoption?</p>
<p>Decentralized identity has been striving for adoption beyond flashy Proof of Concepts for a few years now. Acquisitions like Avast of Evernym could be the way to product maturity and mass adoption. Since the inception of decentralized identity, its biggest selling points have been the capacity to protect the privacy of individuals and put control into their hands (literally, by storing their identity information in the secure element of their mobile devices and with proofs stored in the blockchain instead of in enterprise identity siloes). Combining the privacy aspect with user-centricity, a company like Avast who serves individual consumers could equip their customers with exactly that.</p>
<p>But there is the other perspective to consider. Individuals, equipped with identity wallets and Verifiable Credentials will need service providers who accept this type of credential; in addition to individual buy in, enterprises need to participate as well. Decentralized identity has been thus far unsuccessful in gathering a large, consolidated following of individual users to create the draw that enterprises need to build support for decentralized identities into their systems. A continuing challenge of decentralized identity is that although individuals can create a secure, validated, and reusable identity, there are very limited places to use this identity – the enterprise side has not yet provided the opportunities to issue, use, transact, verify, authenticate, exchange these identities on the sites and with the service providers that users interact with most. That is to say, decentralized identity will need a place to be used before it becomes useful to individuals. It is possible that Avast’s ability to create a cohesive decentralized identity user base may bring enough attention and attractiveness for other service providers to integrate such capabilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This acquisition has piqued the curiosity of KuppingerCole Analysts, and we will certainly be watching how Avast’s decentralized identity products evolve in the coming months. Closer integration with their anti-tracking and monitoring of exposure in data breaches may be vehicle enough for end users to find utility in their decentralized identity solutions, without relying on enterprises to adjust their onboarding procedures to accept decentralized identity credentials. In any case, it is a promising time in the evolution of decentralized identity.</p>

<p>In Europe, the rapid trend toward digitalization in daily life and banking has maintained pace with the rest of the world. Remote verification services such as IDnow provide a primary entry point to remote account opening, online banking, robo-advising, InsurTechs, and other products and services. Such digital trends represent a natural and organic disruption of traditional market offerings and services.</p>



<p>FinTech research revealed that nearly 71 percent of users prefer digital financial products over traditional banking. Such trends show no sign of slowing. McKinsey consultancy suggests that the COVID -19 pandemic pushed us seven years ahead in digital transformation.</p>



<p>The European verification ecosystem has developed a distinct flavor that favors customer privacy, security/trust and convenience. It is clear to all parties that new identification methods have the potential to increase risks of fraud as traditional processes are expanded. Knowing this, regulators mandate that electronic verification processes must be “at least or more secure than a traditional face-to-face procedure.”</p>



<p>This mandate has been the bedrock of IDnow’s work and actions.</p>



<p>As a top-tier software solution provider, IDnow offers identification products that surpass the highest levels of security and fraud detection requirements within strictly regulated digital markets in finance and banking, insurance, telecoms, mobility and other sectors. </p>



<p>As such, we feel that we have set a benchmark for security and accuracy standards. </p>



<p>Through this benchmark in our industry, we feel that we have a unique ability to support new legislation. This includes our participation in setting new technical specifications such as our work on ETSI TS 119-461 and continual work on identity verification standards with ETSI, FIDO Alliance, the W3C and other global organizations. Our collaboration and exchanges further support robust regulations and smart growth, which leads us to say:</p>



<blockquote><p>Innovative technologies must not offer a false sense of assurance when it comes to pushing for greater cross-border interoperability.</p>Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



 Blocking the Identity Fraud Gates with state-of-the-art verification technologies 



<p>We have witnessed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/idnow-trend-report/">relentless growth in fraudulent activity</a> and increasing sophistication around it. Our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AI-powered ID verification solution AutoIdent</a> is based on optical technology, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technology to ensure secure identity verification.</p>



<p>AutoIdent provides access to the person who was identified in a seamless process, and there is no separate “Issuance, delivery and activation” process necessary. </p>



<p>The system verifies that the video stream of the ID document has not been manipulated and captures a photographic record of the user with a “selfie.” The biometric verification confirms the document’s rightful owner, comparing the user to the ID document picture, enabling subsequent face comparison and checking that a natural person is in front of the camera through a “liveness detection.” The option exists to include an identification specialist to verify and review the data and results gathered from the AutoIdent solution.</p>







 Evolution of identity verification and regulation 



<p>Identity verification techniques and regulatory requirements for the application of remote proofing have evolved a great deal over the past 6 to 7 years. </p>



<p>More automated solutions gradually replace or support traditional manual onboarding and verification processes. Generally, video-based solutions, which came first, are now shifting to more automated biometric-based solutions. </p>



<p>Take, for instance, France, Switzerland and Austria. These countries have introduced new legislation this past year, permitting more automated processes using AI and ML to support digital Know Your Customer (KYC) applications for their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws</a>.</p>



 Harmonizing regulations in the EU while closing technical and regulatory gaps 



<p>While the rapid evolution of digital applications in both the public and private sectors has taken off, the need for regulatory harmonization within this changing landscape is essential across the EU and the Member States. </p>



<p>The EU issued recent regulations that address digitization, including The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj">EU Cybersecurity Act</a> (EU 2019/881) and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/GA/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148">EU NIS directive</a> (EU 2016/1148), amongst other regulations. </p>



<p>The EU released two new draft proposals that further take these rules into account. These include the latest draft proposal for the EU regulation&nbsp;910/2014&nbsp;on electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) and the draft proposal for a new European AML Regulation presented earlier this year.</p>



<p>While the existing eIDAS regulation provides groundbreaking rules on electronic identification and trust services, technical and regulatory gaps result in fewer notified electronic ID schemes and fragmented cross-border interoperability across Europe. </p>



 The new proposal (EU regulation&nbsp;910/2014 + new European AML Regulation) aims to address these gaps: 



  The regulation offers EU citizens the choice of a digital identity that can be stored in a digital wallet.   A user will be able to select which attributes they want to present for access to a specific product or service with the ability to store new attested attributes like a university degree.   The Commission is preparing the technical and regulatory framework so users are able to access online and offline services with the wallet option.  



<p>Additionally, AML Regulations are foreseen at the EU level in the future. The Commission aims to harmonize better national AML regulations and better address fraud and enforcement criteria. It is expected that there will be a European AML Authority, new EU regulations on customer <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/due-diligence/">due diligence</a> and beneficial ownership, and new rules concerning national supervisors and Financial Intelligence Units. These regulations will go into effect in the next few years.</p>



 Looking ahead towards a European digital ecosystem 



<p>Many of these regulations are part of a longer-term goal, the evolution and implementation of a European digital ecosystem. They are elaborate and set several ambitious objectives in the realm of digital services, markets and application.</p>



<p>At the same time, Digital identity proofing for Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML onboarding, or account processes, is still a relatively new practice. Though so much seems to have happened in this sphere, we must remind ourselves that it was only 2014 when <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)</a> permitted VideoIdent for KYC use.</p>



<p>As such, this industry hasn’t yet achieved the collective presence in our minds as it will in the coming years. Identity proofing remains a fragmented concept operating under different definitions of digital identity, variations to national regulations and competing technologies.</p>



&nbsp;



  
<p></p>
  



 Developing AutoIdent to meet changing regulations 



<p>Using a solution that meets and keeps up to date with changing regulations is vital. </p>



<p>IDnow has moved to develop and expand <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">its platform</a>, offering a wide range of products. The experience and expertise we gained from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a> has allowed us to develop new solutions with increased functionality. This includes products that offer fully automated biometric identity verification, the use of NFC technology and electronic signatures, and in development of a digital wallet for KYC screening for AML and non-AML requirements.</p>



<p>Let’s look at the Financial Services Industry. We can confidently claim that our KYC platform offering with AutoIdent in its core can serve even the most highly regulated markets and industries.</p>



<blockquote><p>IDnow’s AutoIdent solution offers a range of use cases within the financial services industry – including customer onboarding, opening an account or signing a loan agreement. </p>Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>AutoIdent meets EU regulations for these use cases in many ways. The key areas include:</p>



  Fully automated onboarding, with video backup. AutoIdent offers fully automated biometric identification of users, but also offers a hybrid (manual) alternative. This can be handled by internal or third-party staff. Regulations differ between countries regarding whether they allow verification to be fully automated or to have manual involvement. AutoIdent allows both – and its solution meets regulations in many countries, including Germany, Austria, Spain, the UK and the UAE.  Meeting 5AMLD and 6AMLD regulations for Anti-Money Laundering. Improving AML regulations have brought many new requirements. 5ALMD added a new focus on sources of finance, including pre-paid cards and cryptocurrencies. Earlier regulations introduced the concept of beneficial ownership, where the ultimate owners of legal entities are recorded centrally. AutoIdent fully meets the KYC and data collection requirements for this.  AML screening functionality. Many financial services use cases also require AML screening. AutoIdent can be expanded to add fully compliant AML Screening &amp; Monitoring. This includes checking Politically Exposed Person (PEP) and Sanction Lists. The identification of PEPs and carrying out enhanced due diligence and monitoring was a feature of 5AMLD.  Issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) as part of document signing. AutoIdent is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1)d.&nbsp;This is standard across Europe and regulations are similar in the UK.  Use of NFC technology. AutoIdent has the functionality to read biometric data from NFC chips. This is currently used to read German identity cards, but the solution can be easily expanded as it fully meets the global ICAO 9303 standard.  



 Differing regulations across Europe 



<p>The use of a fully automated verification solution differs considerably across jurisdictions. </p>



<p>To meet this, AutoIdent provides various modules to the product. At IDnow, we are fully aware of different regulations in use across the EU and the UK. While some areas are set at the EU level, there are many country-specific differences. </p>



<p>As just one example, to meet German AML laws to verify the identity of customers, an automated solution must include a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> and a one-cent-bank transfer for remote onboarding.</p>



<p>European regulators’ adoption of automated or hybrid identity verification has expanded significantly in past years. </p>



<p>There is growing evidence that automatic techniques are more secure than manual ones in some areas (especially facial recognition, for example). The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recently issued digital identity guidelines that support the use of automated identity verification.</p>



<p>Some of the leading countries allowing automated solutions include The Netherlands, Austria, Spain (with an element of video review) and Sweden (with manual review). </p>



<p>Germany has long been the most regulated market and it has now accepted an element of automation combined with a manual review (and the use of qualified electronic signatures). France allows the use of QES for bank account opening and stand-alone use of AutoIdent for verification – IDnow is currently undergoing approval.</p>



<p>IDnow believes that such a trend will be for more countries to permit automated biometric verification and AutoIdent is ready to handle this.</p>



 Meeting UK regulations 



<p>Since the UK is no longer part of the EU, it has different regulations. AutoIdent maintains compliance with each set of regulations. The UK has always taken a more deregulated approach and generally supports automated solutions. It is also one of the only countries that allow the use of biometric processes without the end user’s consent.</p>



<p>After withdrawal from the EU, the EU eIDAS Regulation was adopted into UK law, with a few differences. The UK introduced <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/89/made">The Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Regulations in 2019</a>.</p>



<p>One significant difference in the UK is the lack of a national identity card. If any solution is offered in the future, private providers will be more likely to be used. UK regulations guide states that these should follow ICAO 9303 NFC standards, which will allow adoption into the AutoIdent solution.</p>



 Moving to a digital future 



<p>As mentioned earlier, trends are moving to portable identity to be reused in other domains and even into a form of self-sovereign identity. Technology companies will seize these opportunities to develop sector-specific solutions, products, and relationships with customers that allow for greater ownership of a user’s identity and its reuse.</p>



<p>New amendments in regulation, such as eIDAS, presents game-changing possibilities and lay the foundation for a truly portable identity. </p>



<p>It is now incumbent upon businesses to work more actively with the EU, its member states and regulators to bring the advantages of eIDAS into the private sector. Our understanding of this can be summarised as follows:</p>



<blockquote><p>IDnow fully supports the call for building an EU framework that considers identification for its reuse across borders and sectors with appropriate levels of assurance and reliance on open standards.</p>Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



 The future of digital identity is based on trust, reliability and security 



<p>As we move closer to a person-centric digital identity, safety and accessibility will require initial identity verification grounded in trust, reliability and the ability to meet a minimum level of security.</p>



<p>The Commission recognizes the complexities around one aspect of the digital identity, namely digital onboarding. Part of producing the regulatory and technical framework ahead addresses interoperability, security and innovation. Rapidly, digital identity is evolving beyond digital national identity schemes and best practices in customer KYC regulations.</p>



<p>IDnow supports and prepares for future evolutions in digital identities stored in wallets and their verification and authentication. It is equally essential to IDnow that we best serve the market’s current requirements and user expectations. </p>



<p>AutoIdent has been developed alongside these regulation changes and remains ready to support all current and future shifts. IDnow strives to be the best, offering innovative, competitive and secure platforms. </p>



<p>Ultimately, digital identities and automated verification make things safer for verifying institutions and individuals. </p>



<p>Alongside offering security, creating a user experience with less friction and challenges is very important for financial institutions to increase conversion rates and maintain their brand. IDnow is at the forefront of development.</p>



<p>For a more in-depth look at AutoIdent, how it has evolved, and how it offers a well-thought-out balance between security and user experience, take a look at IDnow’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHcpM_dj4x8">recent webinar</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, we can help in discussions addressing interoperability, innovation, and, most importantly – security frameworks. </p>



<p>Employing the most robust practical security measures is a strategy through which we believe the growth of our market segment will be achieved. The achievement will be based on trust.</p>

<p>After building software at a major global ocean carrier for about half a decade, I decided this year to switch to a technology startup company. I had come across a particular set of emerging technologies, and the more I dug into them the clearer it became to me that they would define and revolutionize the future of digital supply chains. Passion took over; I just had to be part of driving these revolutionary technologies forward.</p><p>This article aims to explain to supply chain participants the future which these technologies will enable. In particular, we will explore what they do, what brought them about, how they fit together, and how they can be applied to our industry.</p> The Present <p>Today, supply chain operations are largely based on manually handled documents: PDFs, pictures, Excel sheets and even physical paper. These require human processing — vast amounts of emails are exchanged to enable the flow of&nbsp;goods.</p><p>EDI messaging is also very prevalent for automatic data processing. However, EDI connections have generally been over-customized for decades, which shifts the manual burden from business processing to EDI maintenance. EDI is the technological legacy of the industry: we are forced to respect it, but we all wish it would go&nbsp;away.</p><p>In recent years, we’ve made steps towards HTTP-based API integration, exchanging JSON-encoded data. Forward thinkers have exposed their business services this way, allowing customers to integrate with modern tooling and prevalent programming languages. Industry standard groups such as IATA, DCSA, UN/CEFACT play an important role guiding the industry&nbsp;ahead.</p> The Future <p>The macro trend towards API adoption is clear, but technologies continue to evolve. Particularly, Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identifiers are emerging standards which will revolutionize all industries of&nbsp;trade.</p> Linked Data <p>Let me start with a real example from two of my favorite ocean carriers’ developer portals: what CMA-CGM calls `voyageCode` on their schedules APIs, Maersk calls `voyageNumber` on theirs. Humans can infer that `voyageCode` and `voyageNumber` both mean the same thing, but computers need very explicit instructions and can only connect these terms with human assistance. This puts the interpretation burden on the developer tasked to integrate to these APIs. Interpreting two APIs doubles the risk of making incorrect interpretations.</p><p>Adding more carriers means the complexity and risk increases further. When we multiply that risk by the thousands upon thousands of customers integrating these APIs we come to a sad conclusion: every developer is doing the same costly repetitive work. And since we all have different backgrounds, language, cultures and skills, we invariably interpret API intention and meaning differently.</p><p>This is the challenge which <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON Linked Data</a> addresses. JSON-LD is a W3C standard which acts as a “layer” on top of JSON and literally adds context to the data. The context defines web Unique Resource Identifiers (URIs) for each of the terms used in the&nbsp;API.</p><p>The common meaning behind the above voyage example is in fact formally defined by UN/CEFACT. The URI for this definition looks like this: <a href="https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/#scheduledIdentificationId.">https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/#scheduledIdentificationId.</a> This URI is not exactly sexy, but computers love (unsexy) unique identifiers. Now, using JSON-LD CMA-CGM can define `voyageCode` by pointing at the UN/CEFACT URI. Maersk, in turn, can point their `voyageNumber` to the same UN/CEFACT URI. Now there’s no interpretation left for the developer. Both terms are explicitly defined and can be directly consumed by computer&nbsp;code.</p><p>JSON-LD switches the responsibility of determining meaning from the many consumers to the one single provider — where it&nbsp;belongs!</p><p>Linked Data deals with semantics: the meaning of the exchanged data. Ensuring that we “speak the same language” is the very essence of standards.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> is a W3C standard for cryptographically signing JSON data. Explained very briefly, encryption means mathematically signing a chunk of data with a private key known only by you. Subsequently, using your public key anyone can verify that the chunk of data indeed comes from&nbsp;you.</p><p>Cryptography is nothing new, but it is traditionally applied on the transport layer (HTTPS, for example); Verifiable Credentials bring cryptography to the data-layer. Instead of keeping track and remembering “I received this piece of data from that party via this channel”, at any point in the future you can verify where data came from and trust that it hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>There is a reason why traditional paper-based contracts are printed on letterhead paper and are signed: it’s so that the agreement can be proven in the future. The idea of just jotting down contractual data on a white piece of paper and trusting its validity based on the courier who carried it is absurd. Nonetheless, that is exactly what happens with a standard API call over HTTPS. This also explains why paper (physically as well as PDFs) is still so widely used in supply chains. The fundamental requirements remain while technology is catching&nbsp;up.</p><p>A Verifiable Credential is a container for data, which can be whatever the API call requires to support a business use case. The container adds `issuer` and `proof` elements. `issuer` captures the identity of the entity issuing the data, typically in the form of a Decentralized Identity (more on that in the next section). `proof` contains the cryptographic material needed to verify the data, particularly the “signature” string which is generated based on the data and the issuer’s private key. Anyone receiving this “contained” data will know who it came from and can verify that the data is how the issuer intended it to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Again, the paper analogy is useful: `issuer` corresponds to the pre-printed company letterhead on paper contracts while `proof` corresponds to the analogue signature. This analogy falls short, however, since a cryptographic signature is many times more secure than an analogue signature on&nbsp;paper.</p><p>I do want to quickly mention what Verifiable Credentials are not: a Verifiable Credential does not deal with data access management. Sensitive data still needs to be securely handled when sent (in transit) and stored (at rest). Also, a Verifiable Credential does not deal with originality. Verifiable Credentials can be copied and distributed just like any other JSON file, every copy is tamper-proof and can be verified.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials couple trust with&nbsp;data.</p> Decentralized Identifiers <p>The third and final aspect deals with identity. Managing who is who is a massive undertaking all over supply chains. Every organization keeps registries of customers, suppliers, contractors, and employees. Essentially, everyone maintains a model of everyone else. This is an exponentially complex problem, computer science-wise. The total amount of effort that goes into keeping customer master data up-to-date is staggering, and costly mistakes are a standard part of operations.</p><p>Traditional digital identity is based around identity providers which lends out tokens that represent you. The identity provider typically knows nothing more about you than verifying a working email and checking that “you’re not a robot.” This falls way short of knowing and trusting a supply chain counterpart on a foreign continent.</p><p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> turn the identity solution inside out. DIDs can be generated freely and can represent anyone or anything. They are trustless, meaning they don’t pretend to represent any sort of objective vetting; rather, trust is built from Verifiable Credentials. A DID is just an identity. DIDs are controlled by the holder of a private key, and additional keys can be associated with it to perform actions like authentication or signing Verifiable Credentials. Keys and DIDs are related, but clearly distinct aspects. So again: DIDs only represent identity.</p><p>There is no limit to what a DID can identify. The obvious examples are organizations and people, as explained above. They can also represent assets such as shipping containers, seals, boxes, vessels, or locations, and intangible concepts like bookings, agreements, transactions, or documents.</p><p>Here is an example of a DID: `did:web:transmute.industries`. DIDs are strings which always start with `did:`. What comes after depends on its type, its so-called DID Method. Just like a URL resolves a web page, DIDs resolve a DID Document. That DID Document carries public information relevant to the DID, notably its associated public keys. This way, anyone in the world can verify that someone claiming to control a DID indeed does hold its private key, or that a Verifiable Credential was indeed issued by the controller of the `issuer`&nbsp;DID.</p><p>There are a number of different DID Methods to choose from serving a range of requirements such as availability, confidentiality, censorability, and affordability, just to name a few. Some examples include `did:key` where the DID and its keys are consciously hard coupled (self contained, fast, simple), `did:web` where the DID Document is kept on a web server (tangible, transparent), and `did:elem` where the DID Document is kept on Ethereum (immutable, censorless).</p><p>So, an organization may control many DIDs. One could represent the organization itself and its geographic subsidiaries (`did:web` would likely be a suitable choice for these). But the same organization could also control DIDs representing, say, owned shipping containers and the seals applied to them (`did:key` would be a good choice here). As the DID controller, the organization can perform all corresponding actions such as proving ownership of assets and issue claims on behalf of legal entities.</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers put the digital identity of every supply chain actor in their own hands. It is the only globally scalable solution to a challenge faced by this truly global industry.</p> Bringing It All&nbsp;Together <p>Let’s bring together Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identifiers to more closely examine the future of supply chain data flows. When combined, these three emerging technologies lead to semantically unambiguous data, well-managed identities, and claims based on trusted sources. Let’s imagine what the future would look&nbsp;like.</p><p>As a domestic buyer, I can remotely establish a trusted relationship with a foreign supplier. The risks inherently present in intercontinental trade are largely mitigated by the credentials which the supplier presents. These credentials prove government-issued company legality, long standing relationships with several known carrier brands, and show ethical and environmental certificates issued by established NGOs. I may not know the exact issuer of the environmental inspector, but I am also presented with an agency credential issued to that inspector from a global NGO which I do know. So, all the needed claims are issued by DIDs which I know and trust, or through a “trust chain”, which links back to trusted entities.</p><p>The products I purchase are given precise DIDs and their quality is inspected on-site by a trusted 3rd party. The manufacturer is also able to present credentials proving a degree of recycling and sustainable materials sourcing.</p><p>Since all documentation is completely digital, the carrier booking and export documentation processing is completely automated. Product DIDs are linked to a carrier consignment DID which cryptographically proves they have taken ordered goods into custody. I have chosen “slow steam, low emission” transport, so the consignment gets issued a reduced carbon-footprint credential which in turn links back to my products.</p><p>Upon arrival, Customs can easily build a holistic model of origin, commodity, provenance, transport routing risks, and factor in backgrounds of every party involved from the presented credentials. Fully automated, Customs can make near real-time risk assessments, duties calculations, and release determinations.</p><p>With the goods landed, I can flaunt the exact certificates of the ethical and low carbon premium choices which I made during production and transportation. Selective disclosure allows me to cryptographically prove this to my customers without revealing any other data elements from, say, the commercial invoice or bill of lading documents.</p><p>Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identifiers are standards, comparable to the likes of HTTP or JSON. All these advanced use cases are cross-vendor interoperable, and each actor can freely choose whichever tool or software provider they&nbsp;fancy.</p><p>All data will eventually become verifiable. After all, why would you ever again settle for ambiguous data from vaguely identified sources?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-digital-supply-chain-of-the-future-79e9431aaa0d">The Digital Supply Chain of the Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>9th December, Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokenchampions.com/">Tokenchampions</a> is the first investment fund that tokenizes debts for the acquisition and management of international football players’ image rights. Partnering with tokenization platform provider Tokeny, Tokenchampions makes this asset accessible for retail investors in Europe for as little as €100. Furthermore, a secondary market solution will be offered to improve liquidity.</p>
<p>The selection of the football players is headed by Josep Maria Minguella, who discovered and developed talents like Maradona, Messi, Stoichkov and Guardiola, among others. In this first issuance, Tokenchampions is incorporating young football stars on the rise with enormous growth potential, including Nicolò Zaniolo (Roma), Rúl Moro (Lazio), Bobby Adekanye (Lazio) and David Navarro (Atlético de Madrid Youth A Sub-19).</p>

		 
	 
    If we add the use of blockchain technology to the knowledge amassed over all these years of experience with players, we are in a position to tackle the challenges posed by the future of football business management with a greater likelihood of success.  Josep Maria MinguellaHonorary Sport President at Tokenchampions    
	 
		 
			<p>As an investor, it has traditionally been difficult to invest in the football business, either because the minimum investment amount is very high or because there is simply no access to such investment opportunities. In addition, this type of asset is notoriously illiquid, further complicating the investment in the field.</p>
<p>Tokenchampions aims to change that through tokenization, the process to digitize assets on the blockchain. Assets can be programmed and fractionated with this technology, allowing for smaller investments and automated compliance.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokenchampions democratizes the football business by combining the latest technology with an unrivaled experience in the management of sports talent, and thanks to financial strength allowing all football fans to participate, regardless of whether they are small or large investors.  Carlos SalasCEO of Tokenchampions    
	 
		 
			<p>By using Tokeny’s Billboard, Tokenchampions also provides a secondary market for investors, enabling them to meet other eligible counterparts and make compliant peer-to-peer transactions prior to the maturity date.</p>

		 
	 
    The Tokenchampions team is a pioneer in using tokenization to make football investment more accessible and liquid for a wider range of investors. By providing them with a compliant infrastructure, we bridge the technology gap and enable them to concentrate on their core business. Our end-to-end tokenization platform helps them to achieve rapid onboarding of investors, cost-efficient management, and rapid transfer of securities in a compliant manner.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Tokenchampions has been structured in Luxembourg, as Bill 7637 gives clear regulatory status to blockchain as the underlying technology for the issuance and circulation of securities. This is yet another demonstration that Luxembourg is the hub for asset tokenization, attracting more serious and promising projects. Both token issuers and investors will benefit greatly from the tokenization ecosystem that is being developed and completed here.</p>

<p>Tokenchampions is the first investment fund allowing all football fans to participate in the appealing business of their favorite sport. Tokenchampions tokenizes debt for the acquisition and management of the image rights of upcoming international talents in the world of football.

 About Tokeny&nbsp; 
<p>Tokeny allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments. Tokeny is the leader in its field and in 2020 was named one of the top 50 companies in the blockchain space by CB Insights. The company is backed by Euronext.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>We know that the way forward for business IT is to use multi-hybrid architectures for long term agility of operations. Such architectures will include multiple clouds for new services, on-prem stacks, edge devices, OT integration and much more. But while the need for multi-hybrid is clear, the resulting complexity of ad hoc deployment of multi-hybrid architectures can lead to serious security holes.</p>
<p>Unmanaged complexity will invariably result in an enlarged attack surface that will encourage attackers to take a pick and mix approach to find and exploit vulnerabilities within your operating environment. Attackers will find holes to deposit new malware or ransomware and then mix these with malicious tools that they may already be deploying on your networks – all without your knowledge. Unlike the Pick ‘n’ Mix counter at the sweetshop, such malign confectionery will taste sweet only to the attackers.</p>
 So why don’t we just make everything simpler? 
<p>Good point, and we will get to that but unless your organization was built yesterday, from the ground up, with a cloud native architecture that so far does not extend much beyond your own employees – a kind of cloud first perimetered structure, it is likely your IT stacks will be complex and challenging to audit and manage as part of a multi-hybrid architecture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: An expanding infrastructure will inexorably get more complex as it grows beyond its original state. The spheres represent resources such as multi-clouds, on premise stacks, databases, date centres, tools and applications etc. The swirling dots represent machine and human identities (Source: KuppingerCole).</p>
<p>No, like the Universe, today’s typical IT infrastructure is constantly expanding as demand shifts and change and unplanned and unsanctioned mini galaxies are created in the form of clouds purchased at departmental level and DevOps groups, among others.</p>
<p>Because, of course, IT is complex, it’s a fact – even that seemingly simple cloud native architecture will take trained and qualified people to construct – and the same level of expertise to maintain. Now consider the more typical scenario that we see every day. Older organizations will consist of the old and the new – usually not working together in perfect harmony. There will be (possibly) old mainframes, legacy stacks on premises, private clouds, public clouds, third party networks, remote workers, endpoint devices, edge devices, IOT, unauthorised devices and more.</p>
<p>And of course, within all that will be the reason why the architecture can be become a deadly attack surface. It’s all those identities – your people, your devices - flowing in and around the architecture looking for access to services, applications and more. And this is key. If IT ran without identities acting with agency, then the attack surface would be minimal. Unfortunately, nothing can be created, nothing can be done without human and machine identities doing something and using applications.</p>
<p>Our new multi-hybrid world is geared expressly around the notion that the quicker employees and others get access to resources, the more efficient the business will be and the more competitive – and this is mostly true is the IT architecture is engineered well. But multi layered IT stacks engineered for a business outcome will not solve the security and risk equations the architecture poses on its own. IT architecture can only be simple to a certain degree so we need to look at how organizations can simplify the policies and processes needed for the business outcome and harden the identity and access management protocols. For this, organizations need to take their own pick and mix approach to the stuff happening inside their multi-hybrid infrastructure.</p>
 So, how to simplify what happens within the multi-hybrid infrastructure. 
<p>First off, this is not a quick process and trying to outline every step you should take to reduce your attack surface in a multi-hybrid infrastructure is impossible in a blog, but we can do themes and high-level options. And of course, KuppingerCole analysts are always available for advisory services on digital transformation.</p>
<p>In short, you need to reduce complexity by focusing on processes and outcomes – mostly around managing identities and access to resources. The chart below, by KuppingerCole’s Principal Analyst, Martin Kuppinger, shows at least some options that may be useful to an organization created in that way. But this is just one example, every organization – yours most importantly – will be different. Your universe will be expanding in different ways – you may be running AWS but you may not use VMs. You may process financial information, but you don’t use edge devices or IoT. And so on, bearing in mind that may all change in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: How to start thinking about managing complexity in multi-hybrid environments.</p>
<p>Therefore, before you can simplify operations inside your infrastructure the three key questions to ask are:</p>
 
 What is the desired outcome? How can you deliver, run and secure the services the business needs? 
 What are the components in your IT environment needed to deliver that outcome? Look at what makes up your infrastructure, the data, the applications, and the policies that control usage. 
 Who or what needs access to those components? Choose from data, people, machine identities, third parties, digital things, devices etc. 
 
<p>So that’s a very simple chart we have created to illustrate what, in reality, looks more like the expanding universe infrastructure in the first diagram. But it’s a start and one that will focus minds on reducing complexity within, and from a user identity viewpoint – that is critical. You need to reduce vulnerability from identity management failings and determine how a complex environment can be made simpler and reduce the attack surface at the same time.</p>
<p>A Pick ‘n’ Mix mentality should be something that works for you – you choose what you need, who gets access to what and what the outcome is. This is good, but without rationalising identities and access management within and outside of your multi-hybrid architecture, you will never overcome the inevitable complexity of the physical architecture because you have no view on what is happening across it. And it will reduce the risk of attackers picking unmanaged identities to find their way in across your multi-hybrid infrastructure.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago we wrapped up our first public test of Holochain + the Holo hosting infrastructure, and in my opinion, it went wonderfully. For those of you who weren’t involved, we used a proof-of-concept app called Elemental Chat to collect insights on what was and wasn’t working. Five thousand of you signed up and eagerly attacked it, sending each other about 30,000 messages in English, Turkish, Dutch, French, Greek, and other languages.</p><p>(Note: I realise this isn’t really news anymore, and I apologise for the gap in Dev Pulse publication. My attention was unexpectedly taken away from work for a couple weeks.)</p><p>The most important finding was that Holochain is already working pretty well. In fact, it exceeded our expectations. When we told the Holo dev team about how many people we hoped to invite, one team member was concerned about pushing it past 300 concurrent users. Well, you all helped us blow past that by more than 3× without any visible problems.</p><p>This was exciting, partly because there are a bunch of improvements that didn’t even make it into this test. Sharding was still turned off, none of the recent database work was included, and there are many more optimisations we could explore. Given that sharding is part of our strategy for achieving near-infinite scalability, it looks like performance can only get better — by orders of magnitude.</p><p>We also discovered bugs and slowdowns. As Holo wrote in their <a href="https://press.holo.host/205474-elemental-chat-public-test-success-amp-learnings">most recent update</a>, that was the purpose of this test. So even though this might seem like a bad thing, it was really just another marker of success.</p> Kinda special <p>When you’ve been immersed in the development of a project for a few years, it’s easy to forget what’s different about it. But as I lay awake in bed a few weeks ago, thinking about our plans to open testing up to the whole world, I started remembering why what we have is special.</p><p>Usually, when you want to access a P2P network, you have two options:</p>  Become a full participant, which means downloading the software, connecting to peers, and replicating their data. For non-blockchain networks, this is often <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases">as</a> <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn/releases">easy</a> <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/">as</a> <a href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork">downloading</a> <a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/downloads/">an</a> <a href="https://aether.app/">app</a> — as long as your computer’s permissions allow it. (Don’t even try this on a public library computer.) But for blockchain networks, this is nearly impossible — the hardware demands are too high, and installing the software can be a challenge.  Access a centralised ‘gateway’, which handles all the P2P stuff for you. If you want to write things to the network, depending on the nature of the gateway, you either need to install a ‘wallet’ browser plugin for your cryptographic keys (most blockchain dApps work this way) or trust the gateway to handle your keys for you (most cryptocurrency exchanges work this way).  <p>I prefer the first option. I get to take charge of my participation in the network, I can work offline if I like, and I get the happy feeling that comes from supporting something that matters to me. While I’ve never tried installing a blockchain node on my machine, I’ve tried other P2P apps, and they’re quite nice. My only frustration is that I can’t easily switch my work to another computer.</p><p>The second option lets me work from any machine I like, but I have to be connected to the internet all the time. And if the gateway goes down, good luck getting anything done. To me, this doesn’t seem very decentralised. And besides, I have a really hard time figuring out how crypto wallets work — even after four years in the business. If this is what my experience is like, what’s it going to be like for my dad?</p><p>Holochain + Holo hosting can blend the offline-friendliness of self-run nodes with the portability of web access, all while maintaining users’ sovereignty and making their experience pleasant and familiar. I know of <a href="https://datdot.org/">very</a> <a href="https://fission.codes/">few</a> other projects doing that.</p> What’s next? <p>During the test, the dev teams identified some areas of work. You already know about some of them — the last few releases have included bugfixes that came directly from this test. Here are some others:</p>  Database optimisations that increase efficiency. One of these, which permitted asynchronous database queries, arrived in Holochain <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#holochain_sqlite-0015">0.0.115</a>. The other, a large <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1130/files">database refactor</a>, was completed in 0.0.117 (see below).  Gossip algorithm improvements and other bug fixes to issues discovered during testing, to reduce overhead and make gossip sustainable over time. One issue in particular involves gossip of historical DHT data. When two nodes sync with each other, they compare the data they’re holding using something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a>. It’s a small data structure, kind of like a hash, meant to quickly compare approximate differences between two data sets. Currently Holochain calculates it on every round of sync, which results in a lot of database I/O, causing the sync to time out and restart. We believe this is one cause of the slowdowns, and we’re investigating ways to make historical gossip more efficient. Some of this work has already landed in recent releases.  And of course sharding. This will likely give us the biggest improvements. Overall efficiency will get better, because fewer nodes to gossip with = less gossip = more time and space to work on other things. ‘Convergence time’ will also improve. In distributed systems speak, convergence is the moment when all nodes agree on the data they’re holding. In Holochain terms, this means that newly published data will become available more quickly, new nodes will sync more quickly with their peers when they first become part of the DHT, and old partitions will heal more quickly.  <p>Now that you know where we’re heading, let’s take a look at what happened with Holochain the past four weeks.</p> Four new Holochain releases  Holochain 0.0.116: Dependency cleanup <p>This was a very small release: some unused dependencies were removed, which sped up compilation time. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1116">#1116</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.117: Database refactor <p>The biggest change in this release is that gossip is shared between all cells on a conductor which share a DNA, which allows Holo-hosted cells to gossip more efficiently.</p>  Breaking: DHT shard and authored databases are shared among all cells that share a DNA. There’s no breaking changes to the HDK, but your conductor will have to start over with a fresh database. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1130">#1130</a>)  Breaking: Wire messages have been changed to support shared gossip, which means that this version’s gossip protocol breaks compatibility with earlier versions. Again, no HDK changes. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1091">#1091</a>)  Breaking: The <code>db_sync_level</code> directive in the conductor config has been renamed to <code>db_sync_strategy</code> and can accept the values <code>Fast</code> and <code>Resilient</code>. This directive handles how SQLite writes are flushed to storage. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1130">#1130</a>)  Bugfix: Some databases can handle corruption by wiping and recreating the database. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1039">#1039</a>)   Holochain 0.0.118: Small gossip change <p>This release brings one breaking change to gossip: nodes now keep metrics on each other based on their agent key, not TLS certificate. This once again breaks the gossip protocol’s compatibility with earlier versions of Holochain. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1114">#1114</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.119: Performance improvements <p>This release brings a bunch of small changes that increase performance.</p>  Breaking: when syncing the DHT ops they’re holding, two nodes can send the data in batches rather than in one huge message. Again, this breaks gossip protocol compatibility. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1143">#1143</a>)  A few cleanup sweeps have been done over the entire codebase, catching database queries that weren’t made async in 0.0.115 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1145">#1145</a>) and various outstanding todos (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1150">#1150</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1152">#1152</a>).  A small database change results in faster <code>get</code> queries. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1143">#1143</a>)  Agent info entries are published, not just gossiped. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1115">#1115</a>)  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.119/CHANGELOG.md#20211208091009">release notes for the last four versions</a>.</p> Wait, where’s HDK 0.0.119? <p>You may have noticed that, while Holochain is now at version 0.0.119, the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hdk/versions">HDK is still at 0.0.115</a>. What happened to the four newest versions?</p><p>Based on feedback from hApp developers, the release team has decided to only bump HDK release numbers when there are actual changes. This does cause a mismatch between a HDK version and the Holochain version(s) it works with, but it also means you don’t have to update and rebuild your zomes with every Holochain release.</p><p>To find the HDK version that matches the Holochain version you want to use, we’ll be introducing some tools and documents. In the meantime, you can visit this URL (using Holochain 0.0.119 as an example release; you’ll need to change that number to the release you actually want):</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.119/crates/hdk/Cargo.toml">https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.119/crates/hdk/Cargo.toml</a></p><p>In this case, you can see that the HDK version is at 0.0.115:</p> A first-time hApp creation tutorial <p>Today I came across this tutorial by <a href="https://github.com/wimpheling">wimpheling</a>, a new hApp developer, documenting their recent learnings as a tutorial. This guide takes you through setting up the Holochain dev tools, building a hApp backend, and creating a web-based UI for it. I found it easy to read and follow — and I’m grateful they wrote it, since we don’t currently have a good beginner tutorial that takes you all the way to a running app.</p><p>If you haven’t yet built a hApp but you’d like to give it a try, <a href="https://blog.without.hosting/posts/holochain-getting-started/">follow the tutorial</a> and see what you think! (Note: it says it’s written for 0.0.117, but it should work for 0.0.119 just fine. One other thing to keep in mind is that, while the blog says to use <code>https://nightly.holochain.love</code> to download the latest dev tools, you should use the non-nightly URL <code>https://holochain.love</code> instead.)</p> Playground: now with real DHT data! <p>Long-time readers will remember the Holochain Playground, a simulator that helps you understand how all the agents and data in a DHT relate to each other. You could create cells and watch how their source chains and the shared DHT data grew as they made zome calls.</p><p>Now, Playground’s creator Guillem has added a ‘connected’ mode, which hooks up to a real conductor and shows you exactly what’s going on in a real DHT! Because I’m not much of a hApp dev myself, I’ll let others describe what they think:</p><blockquote>This is amazing, Guillem. Really awesome. [...] Everybody will benefit from using this.<br>— Eric Harris-Braun, Holochain co-creator</blockquote><blockquote>To me, as a hApp developer, this is game-changing. Really next-level in terms of being able to learn as I go and more deeply understand all the mechanics that are going on — and understand bugs and ways to optimise.<br>— Harlan Wood, hApp developer</blockquote><p>Even Guillem discovered fun <a href="https://youtu.be/rA_SvneAhQE?t=1100">surprises</a> as they played with a copy of Eric’s Where app.</p><p>If you’d like to understand a bit more about why this could be useful to you, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/rA_SvneAhQE">Holochain in Action demo</a>. When you’re ready to try it out, download it from the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-playground/holochain-playground">GitHub repo</a> and watch the video again for usage instructions.</p> Holochain In Action: countersigning <p>If, like me, you’ve been enjoying the entertaining, explorative, and educational Holochain In Action videos, there are four or five new ones since last Dev Pulse. They cover interesting topics like test-driven design with Sweettest, creating a minimum viable NFT implementation, and more. I thought this one looked particularly educational: countersigning and multi-party signatures. Since countersigning will be an important part of any sort of transactional app, it seems important to get a good grounding in how it works.</p><p>You can find all the other videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwIuwkCI5HMSzHJpKys-RQ/videos">here</a>.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@mphotographym?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Moritz Mentges</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hammer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 A Public&nbsp;Q&amp;A <p>In October Caribou Digital convened a discussion around the use of geospatial technology and data for humanitarian crises. We were privileged to be joined by UKHIH Caribou Space fellows<a href="https://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/nakalembe/catherine"> Catherine Nakalembe</a> (Associate Research Professor, University of Maryland),<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mapmakerdavid/?originalSubdomain=nz"> David Garcia</a> (PhD candidate at University of Canterbury, Christchurch looking at geospatial technologies) and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stella-chelangat-22a1a8177/?originalSubdomain=ke"> Stella Chelangat</a> (Geospatial and remote sensing expert) as well as over forty people from different backgrounds and organisations.</p><blockquote>A recording of the session <a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/rec/share/wETYmRqtFQkc6XTjz2AMB1wLi56FcTCmZ2_9Shvi7Kv4t5nUXUpuA22s1mRchzT4.mL8YWvGtTU1X9B2U">is available here</a>.</blockquote><p>The discussion focused on the Fellows’ cutting edge research and their work on mapping the geospatial technology for humanitarian crises sector, and covered a wide range of topics from Catherine’s insights into the application of technologies and data, David’s deep understanding of community uses of geospatial data and Stella’s rich experience of using satellite technology and geospatial data for humanitarian response. Amongst others, one underlying theme that ran through much of the discussion was the importance of the bridges and connections between the technical dimensions of satellite technologies and geospatial data and the users and impact of these innovative data&nbsp;sources.</p> The data is out&nbsp;there <p>Stella described the importance of satellite data for humanitarian response, saying ‘It allows us to understand the hazards, the services and the needs prior to humanitarian event after humanitarian event.’ but that it also played an important role in anticipatory humanitarian action — ‘particularly in areas that face conflict in Eastern Africa, including South Sudan and Ethiopia’. Stella went on to describe in Kenya, satellite data is available, but it’s application always depends on the use and their knowledge. Catherine went on to describe how at a macro level resources such as the Google Earth Engine and the Sentinel hub, which provides detailed data and analysis exist — as she put it, ‘the resources are out there. You just have to know how to find them’&nbsp;.</p> From data to application <p>But the existence of data does not necessarily translate into application. Catherine went on to describe her perception of the gap between the advanced technical research work producing data and the application of geospatial data, and a sense that ‘nobody wants to do the in-between work. And that in-between work is really important when engaging with different stakeholders’. This is particularly striking from field experience, where she described ‘the chaos of setting up, you know, buildings and structures, giving people support and aid has no relationship with a geographical interface because sometimes there’s even no power or no internet’. This leads to a sense that there is ‘this in-between void between the satellite application and the practical implications on the&nbsp;ground’.</p><p>David, drawing on his experience of working with communities, elaborated on this, and how important he found it to view mapping in a social and technical way — ‘So for example, I deal with shapefiles and rasters. At the same time, I have to face the community’. David shared three keywords that helped illustrate the challenge of applying geospatial data in practice: It’s about accuracy, it’s about accessibility and about accountability: accuracy in terms of making sure that information is accurate in response to people’s needs, describing how as needs changed the data didn’t — ‘the imagery focused on the buildings, so we couldn’t trace the reefs, an important part of our long long-term resilience’. Accessibility refers to the presence of really easy to use open geospatial tools — ‘One of my favourites is Field Papers. I just go to the website and then select an area of interest. I select how many A4 papers I want to spread the map over. And then the website generates a map layout based on OpenStreetMap. After printing the PDF, I could lay the maps side by side and tape them together. Our mapping team can then go to do fieldwork without the need for a large-format printer, especially in rural areas’. Finally, accountability connects to the importance of maintaining relationships and accountability to people on the ground, especially given the temporary nature of humanitarian funding — ‘And then funding goes, but it’s the same people that’s doing the&nbsp;work’.</p> The use of data: ethics in&nbsp;practice <p>A second theme of the discussion was around the ethical use of data, which is increasingly a concern, particularly to the application of satellite and geospatial data in ways that uphold humanitarian principles.</p><p>All three Fellows emphasised the importance of incorporating ethics into the use and application of geospatial technologies and data. David illustrated this with an account of involvement in one of the OpenStreetMap pilot projects in 2013, and how he had to translate the complex concept of ethics ‘in an ordinary way, in an everyday level’ in engaging with both international diplomats and village leaders because ‘people like me who are both international and local, we have to translate this at the local level’. He went on to describe how, faced with a government that was reluctant to share detailed mapping data, the OpenStreetMap community embarked on a community mapping exercise — but in the process came up against opposition from local community to including certain spiritually and culturally significant sites and locations on the map, and had to negotiate the ‘humanitarian imperative’ of saving lives against the local concerns and values around protecting certain sacred spaces. This negotiation highlighted the challenge of translating high level, at times abstract concepts such as ‘ethics’ and ‘humanitarian principles’ into practice — and the importance of negotiating these issues with people themselves — as David concluded, ‘So I suppose there is the focus on ordinary ethics. That is one key phrase. We had to negotiate to have opportunities for both geospatial refusal and knowledge equity.’</p><p>The discussion covered a broad range of topics, from specific data availability to the challenges of applying and translating technical data into usable formats to the application of geospatial data for anticipatory humanitarian response — this is a select, edited summary of some key themes. The Beyond Borders programme continues, and will produce a report providing an overview mapping of key issues and opportunities in the sector in early 2022, while the Fellows own research complementing this programme will also be completed at the same time — and we look forward to a second public discussion around these findings. Watch the <a href="https://www.caribou.space">Caribou Space website</a> and social media channels for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>Beyond Borders is funded and supported by the UK Humanitarian Innovation Hub (UKHIH), an initiative working to overcome long standing humanitarian challenges through strategic collaborations, networks, and evidence. The UK Humanitarian Innovation Hub is funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and hosted by Elrha, a global charity that finds solutions to complex humanitarian problems through research and innovation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/satellite-and-geospatial-tech-for-humanitarian-crises-b90b670aba46">Satellite and geospatial tech for humanitarian crises</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Rise of Privacy Tech (<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/">TROPT</a>) organization recently surveyed key players in privacy tech to bridge the gaps between tech, capital and expertise in finding technological solutions to privacy problems. The results are published in the newly release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TROPT-Defining-the-Privacy-Tech-Landscape-2021-v1.0-1.pdf">whitepaper</a>,&nbsp;Defining the Privacy Tech Landscape 2021: The Rise of Privacy Tech – A Foundational Whitepaper to Help Fuel Privacy Innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were particularly interested in what B2B privacy tech buyers and consumers had to say about the privacy tech space: the privacy problems they’re trying to solve, and what they want from solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This group put forward a list of areas where they need most help from privacy tech: data minimization, retention, vendor management, de-identification, accountability tools, and what’s called “shift left privacy” tools for developers. Does your organization also need support in these areas? (Go straight to our solution,&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, or read on.)</p>



 Data minimization 



<p></p>



<p>Organizations increasingly need to adopt&nbsp;<a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/business/glossary/data-minimisation/">data minimization</a>, which is both a privacy principle and held up in legislation (such as the GDPR) as a technique that helps organizations comply with the regulation. Data minimization&nbsp;<a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/business/glossary/data-minimisation/">means</a>&nbsp;that organizations should not hold or further use data collected and processed unless it is essential for reasons that they clearly state in advance to support data privacy. The GDPR defines minimal data as data that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many organizations want automated data minimization tools that function at earlier stages in both the data and development lifecycles to help minimize privacy risks and to force them to only process relevant data. Another aspect of data minimization is cultural. The organization needs to be willing to make and maintain an inventory of the data they collect and process, how they use it and how long they keep it – and then be willing to challenge their status quo on every aspect of the inventory.</p>



 Data retention and disposition 



<p></p>



<p>End-of-life data retention and disposition can be a difficult privacy challenge to solve because holding onto data has become a default mindset for many organizations; it’s not a customer-facing function so tends to be given lower priority; it must be addressed under most data protection regulations; and shadow IT systems make retention and deletion technically difficult to solve. Shadow IT refers to IT systems that the organization doesn’t know about at the enterprise level, such as copies of data that live in other places in the organization that aren’t part of the known inventory.</p>



 Vendor and third party management 



<p></p>



<p>Organizations are seeking solutions in this area since regulators and the public are increasingly interested in how enterprises are sharing customer data with their vendors and other third parties.&nbsp;</p>



 DevPrivOps (or Shift Left privacy tools for developers) 



<p></p>



<p>Pleasingly, there’s a trend towards organizations wanting to solve privacy problems earlier on in the data lifecycle. TROPT calls this the “shift left privacy” trend and it’s extending to even before the start of the data lifecycle (before an organization begins to collect customer data) to the privacy product development stage.&nbsp;<br><br>TROPT found privacy tech buyers and consumers want to see how code and algorithms affect privacy and are hunting for code governance tools for their developers. The new goal here is to stop the privacy problems before they’re created.&nbsp;</p>



 How Sudo Platform solves these privacy concerns 



<p></p>



<p>Sudo Platform, our business toolkit of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhancing_technologies">privacy enhancing technologies</a>,&nbsp;is founded on Privacy by Design. We apply its 7 principles to designing, building and operating&nbsp;our products so our brand partners&nbsp;can move easily to a more data minimal culture. (Read&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">How We Apply the 7 Principles of Privacy by Design</a>.)</p>



<p>We designed&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;with data minimization and data retention and disposition in mind from the outset. Our consumer facing capabilities (platform, SDKs for safe browsing, VPN, password manager, etc.) preempt the potential issues privacy tech buyers and consumers described to TROPT. But not only do we provide these consumer privacy solutions, we’ve got the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">expertise</a>&nbsp;to build them in a way that adheres to privacy principles from inception.</p>



<p>For vendor and third party management, the challenge for organizations is really about knowing where they put their data. We have business processes in place to take heavy scrutiny of our suppliers. And while Sudo Platform is not a general purpose DevPrivOps tool, for the specific privacy and cybersafety&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">features</a>&nbsp;we offer in Sudo Platform, by choosing our products and the benefits of our deep engineering, privacy and security experience, our brand partners are taking a shift left approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the TROPT whitepaper reveals that privacy tech buyers and consumers look for certain features when buying privacy tech tools: product effectiveness, automation, efficiency, budget, scalability, vendor trust, and ROI.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform is not a ubiquitous or general purpose data management toolkit, but we provide significant benefits. For our brand partners, using the existing capabilities in Sudo Platform delivers a time-to-market and ROI advantage over building the same capabilities themselves. They also gain from the efficiency of integrating with Sudo Platform once to pick up multiple services, rather than going to multiple vendors and going through a vendor evaluation, selection and integration time-after-time. The more Platform products our brand partners license, the greater the efficiency benefit.</p>



<p>We’re saying to the priv tech consumer market, Sudo Platform is a great choice from a budget, efficiency and ROI perspective. Learn more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">here</a>.</p>

 Highlights <p>In a relatively new industry like blockchain, change is a constant state. When Ontology launched at the end of 2017, Bitcoin was putting crypto on the map through continuous price surges, before crashing at the end of 2018. Since this time, in an uncharted landscape that at times seemed dominated by speculation, Ontology strove to be a lighthouse in a sea of confusion, providing clear and reliable blockchain use cases that put users’ interests first. To celebrate Ontology’s 4th anniversary, Ontology and community members jointly designed the anniversary special event “Cyberspace 4 Philosophers”.</p><p>At the same time, the new version of our official website <a href="https://ont.io/">ont.io</a> was launched. The new architecture and multi-language version will bring users a better experience. With a continued focus on decentralized identity and data solutions, Ontology will bring better trust, privacy, and security to the new&nbsp;web3.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet and are 97% finished with testing. At the same time, the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Security Vulnerabilities and Threat Intelligence Bounty Program</a>’’ launched by Ontology and SlowMist is in progress.  We have finalized Ethereum RPC support and have completed internal testing. The TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 98% done with&nbsp;testing.  We have completed Ontology’s Ethereum account system development and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 97% done with&nbsp;testing.  The EVM/OEP-4 asset seamless transfer technical solution, which facilitates the efficient conversion between OEP-4 assets and EVM assets, is complete and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 100% done with&nbsp;testing.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the decimals of ONT and ONG and we are 20% done with&nbsp;testing.  The ontology-go-sdk and ontology-java-sdk support ONT and ONG decimals&nbsp;updates.  We are 40% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.

Community Growth   814 new members joined our global community this week, and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1463809689775329284?s=20">Polaris</a> from the English community officially became a Ontology Harbinger. This excellent community member has always been an active supporter and will bring more new energy to our community, and also welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join&nbsp;us</a>.  Ontology published the next couple of interviews in its Harbinger Series. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-polaris-31234dc4c1dd">Polaris</a> from our English community said that Ontology uses blockchain technology to continuously promote the development of the smart economy on the basis of protecting user privacy, making it fairer and more transparent, so he has become a supporter of Ontology.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1466489847217020932?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He focused on how OScore promotes a fairer blockchain; There needs to be a system that allows us to quickly determine the authenticity or credibility of a person in the blockchain world. OScore is an onchain credit score for programmable creditworthiness, OScore can present one’s credit standing in DeFi and is calculated using many different pieces of on-chain transaction data.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1465606533480259588?s=20">Telegram weekly Community Call</a>, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about Ontology’s 4th anniversary NFT event and recent popular NFTs and games. Community members expressed their great anticipation for this extraordinary commemorative event.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Ontology’s Chief of Global Ecosystem Partnerships, Gloria Wu, published the article “<a href="https://forkast.news/why-decentralized-metaverse-is-web3-new-frontier/">Why a decentralized metaverse is Web 3.0’s new frontier</a>” in Forkast. She said decentralized networks built on blockchain can help to ensure no single entity has monolithic control over a given technology. Blockchain will be essential for creating a thriving metaverse and providing the decentralized infrastructure needed.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Verdict — 《<a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/web2-web3-blockchain/">Web3: A fundamentally different kind of internet?</a>》</p><p>“Blockchain has come a long way in recent years and, due to the massive hype surrounding it, it can be easy to forget that the nascent technology has not been around for long. Web3 has gained traction throughout 2021 due to the rise of blockchain-based technologies including cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), DeFi, and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).”</p><p>In such an environment, we need to have a unique identity-decentralized identity. Based on this, we can log in to countless applications in Web3, manage our own data, and prove our credibility. In order to achieve this goal&nbsp;, Ontology intensively cultivates decentralized identity and data solutions, carefully polishes existing products, and puts user identity privacy and data security at the core.

  <p>Businesses have unique and complex needs. In addition to the user or organization-specific data to show, there might be a need to display different views and content conditionally. The conditions might include the user’s role or which department they belong to.  The information about a user might be part of the authenticated user’s <a>ID token as a profile claim</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a>, you can show different components or even parts of templates conditionally using built-in directives such as <code>*ngIf</code>. Using <code>*ngIf</code> works when the amount of conditional template changes are small, but what if the view has a lot changes, or if the number of conditions to evaluate increases? Managing the correct view only by using <code>*ngIf</code> becomes difficult. These types of scenarios are where <a href="https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-component-loader">dynamic components</a> are helpful. Angular has the mechanics to load components at runtime so you can dynamically display content.</p>

<p>After following the instructions in this post, you’ll have an Angular app using <a href="https://material.angular.io">Angular Material</a> UI controls that displays unique content based on an authenticated user’s claim value.</p>

<p>The main flow for the application is after initially launching a welcome page; you’ll log in using Okta from a button in the toolbar and redirect to the guarded content. The toolbar now displays your name, and you’ll see a rotation of dynamically created components based on a user claim from your ID token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this post, we’ll</p>
 
   Set up an Angular application with routing and lazy-loaded modules 
   Create an OIDC client in Okta 
   Add authentication to the Angular application 
   Capture authenticated user information and user claims 
   Simulate an external server call and implement the dynamic components 
   Complete displaying the dynamic components using the user claim value 
 

<p>We’ll be covering a lot in this post to build out a non-trivial Angular application. As a result, this post assumes some Angular knowledge. We’ll be blazing through some basics to focus on working through the dynamic components and user profile information.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>
 
   A valid version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> for Angular v13, such as Node.js 14.15 
   <a href="https://cli.angular.io">Angular CLI</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> 
 

 Scaffold the Angular application 

<p>The <a href="https://cli.angular.io">Angular CLI</a> automates creating Angular apps quickly. It makes the project folder and scaffolds the application shell. We’ll pass in the parameters to</p>
 
   add routing 
   use scss for styles 
   use inline templates 
   use inline styles 
   skip tests (The code repo includes tests to show working tests with testbed setup and authentication service spies, so feel free to include tests if you want to try that yourself.) 
 

<p>We’ll have a lot of small components in this application, so inline templates and styles will allow us to minimize the number of files to touch.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create an Angular v13 app.</p>

   <code>npx @angular/cli@13 new dynamic-components --routing --style=scss --inline-template --inline-style --skip-tests
</code>   

<p>You now have a directory named <code>dynamic-components</code> with a working application skeleton. All CLI commands in the rest of this post should be run inside the project directory.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll add the Angular Material component library to the application using their schematic. We’ll pass in the parameters to</p>
 
   set the theme 
   add typography 
   enable animations 
 

<p>Run the following command with preset values to add the Angular Material v13 library and affirm that you will proceed with the installation.</p>

   <code> ng add @angular/material@13 --theme=custom --typography=true --animations=true
</code>   

<p>Feel free to serve the app using <code>ng run</code> or <code>npm start</code> in a second terminal so you can view the changes as you progress through this post.</p>

 Create components for the initial view 

<p>With our application scaffolded and libraries added, we can now add our code. Start by creating three components: a <code>Home</code> component that contains the application’s default view, a <code>Menu</code> component to handle logging in, and a <code>Profile</code> component to display your name after authentication by running the following code.</p>

   <code>ng generate component home
ng generate component menu
ng generate component profile
</code>   

<p>We can update what we’ll first see when loading the application with these components. Open the project in your favorite IDE and open the <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> file to add <code>HomeComponent</code> as a default route, as shown below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [  
 { path: '', component: HomeComponent }  
];
</code>   

<p>Next open <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code>. We need to add some modules for the Material components we’ll use.</p>

<p>In the <code>NgModule</code> <code>imports</code> array, add the following Angular Material component modules:</p>
 
   <code>MatToolbarModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/toolbar</code> 
   <code>MatIconModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/icon</code> 
   <code>MatButtonModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/button</code> 
   <code>MatMenuModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/menu</code> 
 

<p>Now we can update the templates. Open <code>src/app/app.component.ts</code> and replace the entire component with the following code.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-root',  
  template: `  
    &lt;mat-toolbar color="primary" class="toolbar"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;My favorite work app&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;app-profile&gt;&lt;/app-profile&gt; 
        &lt;app-menu&gt;&lt;/app-menu&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/mat-toolbar&gt;
    &lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt; 
  `,  
  styles: [`  
   .toolbar { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; }
 `]  
})  
export class AppComponent { }
</code>   

<p>We added a Material toolbar that displays text, along with the contents of the <code>Profile</code> and <code>Menu</code> components. We’ll update the template of those components in a bit. Below the toolbar, the <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;</code> shows the view for the current route. You should see the output of the <code>Home</code> component when you serve the app.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/app/home/home.component.ts</code>, which is your welcome landing page. Feel free to change the template and styles to whatever suits you.</p>

<p>I added text, an illustration, and styles like below for my tastes.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-home',  
  template: `  
    &lt;div class="welcome"&gt;
      &lt;h2 class="mat-display-1"&gt;Welcome! Log in to get started.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="assets/welcome.svg" alt="welcome illustration" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; `,  
  styles: [`  
    .welcome {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;  
 
      h2 { margin: 3rem; }  
      img { width: 40%; } 
    } 
  `]  
})  
export class HomeComponent { }
</code>   

 Create module for dynamic components 

<p>Next, we’ll create a new module, <code>Protected</code>, to hold the view guarded by authentication. We can pass in the parameters for routing, creating the default component, and lazy-loading, by running the following command.</p>

   <code>ng generate module protected --routing --route=protected --module=app
</code>   

<p>This module also contains the dynamic components, interfaces, and directives for dynamic loading, which holds most of the app’s business logic.</p>

<p>There’s a directive for the component view reference named <code>DynamicDirective</code>, and a component to house the dynamic component view and orchestrate the loading called <code>DepartmentComponent</code>.</p>

<p>We’ll put all the code in the same folder by running the following code.</p>

   <code>ng generate component protected/department
ng generate directive protected/department/dynamic
</code>   

<p>Now on to the dynamically created components themselves. There’s a base interface for all dynamically created components that contains component data named <code>DynamicComponent</code>. We’re being a little tricky for the CLI here, so we need to rename the interface after we generate it manually. First, create the interface by running the following command.</p>

   <code>ng generate interface protected/department/dynamic --type=component
</code>   

<p>Open the <code>src/app/protected/department/dynamic.component.ts</code> file and rename the interface from <code>Dynamic</code> to <code>DynamicComponent</code> to help us better keep track of what the interface provides.</p>

<p>We have three dynamically created components to display content: <code>Clawesome</code>, <code>Pawesome</code>, and <code>Smiley</code>.</p>

   <code>ng generate component protected/department/clawesome --flat
ng generate component protected/department/pawesome --flat
ng generate component protected/department/smiley --flat
</code>   

<p>Let’s get the main view for the <code>Protected</code> module set up. The default view in this module shows <code>ProtectedComponent</code>, which displays a task list and the <code>DepartmentComponent</code> dynamic component loader. First, we’ll import the Material component modules, then update the <code>Protected</code> component template and styles, and populate the task list.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/app/protected/protected.module.ts</code> and add the following Material component modules to the imports array:</p>
 
   <code>MatCardModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/card</code> 
   <code>MatListModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/list</code> 
 

<p>Next open <code>src/app/protected/protected.component.ts</code>. First, we’ll set up the tasks. Create a public array for task items in the component and set the values to whatever you want. Here’s my task list.</p>

   <code>public tasks: string[] = [
  'Respond to that one email',
  'Look into the thing',
  'Reply to their inquiry',
  'Set up the automation'
];
</code>   

<p>For the <code>ProtectedComponent</code>’s template, we’ll use Material’s List component. Update the inline template and styles code to look like the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-protected',  
  template: `  
    &lt;div class="dashboard"&gt;
      &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;mat-selection-list #todo class="task-list"&gt;
          &lt;mat-list-option *ngFor="let task of tasks"&gt;  
            {{task}}  
          &lt;/mat-list-option&gt;
        &lt;/mat-selection-list&gt;
      &lt;/main&gt;
      &lt;app-department&gt;&lt;/app-department&gt;  
   &lt;/div&gt;
   `,  
  styles: [`  
    .dashboard { 
      margin-top: 2rem; display: flex;  
      main { 
        width: 75%;
        h2 { text-align: center; }
        .task-list { width: 80%; margin: auto; }
        mat-selection-list { max-width: 800px; }
      }
    }
  `]  
})
</code>   

<p>If you want to check out your work by running the application, you’ll need to manually type in the route for the <code>Protected</code> module as part of the URL.</p>

 <code>localhost:4200/protected
</code> 

<p>When we add authentication, we’ll automatically route to it.</p>

 Dynamic component loading 

<p>Next, let’s get into this exciting dynamic component loading part! Here’s how this works. The <code>Department</code> component is the container for the dynamic components, and controls which component to show. The <code>Department</code> component HTML template contains an <code>ng-template</code> element with a helper directive to identify where to add the dynamic component to the view.</p>

<p>Angular v13 included updates to the <code>ViewContainerRef</code> API to make working with dynamic components more straightforward. We could use Angular Component Development Kit (CDK) <a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/portal/overview">Portals</a> instead since it has extra helper functionality, but let’s take the updated API out for a spin. 😁</p>

<p>Each of the dynamic components needs the same base component interface. In our case, the base component interface is the <code>DynamicComponent</code> interface. Open each dynamic component file, <code>Clawesome</code>, <code>Pawesome</code>, and <code>Smiley</code>, and implement the <code>DynamicComponent</code> interface to the class. The interface is empty now, but we’ll add members later. Feel free to remove the <code>OnInit</code> lifecycle hook too. The <code>Clawesome</code> component class looks like the following example, and the <code>Pawesome</code> and <code>Smiley</code> component classes should look similar.</p>

   <code>export class ClawesomeComponent implements DynamicComponent {
   // ...remaining scaffolded code here
}
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/app/protected/department/dynamic.directive.ts</code> to inject the <code>ViewContainerRef</code>. Your code will look like the following.</p>

   <code>@Directive({  
  selector: '[appDynamic]'  
})  
export class DynamicDirective {  
  constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) { }  
}
</code>   

<p>Now on to the container component. Open <code>src/app/protected/department/department.component.ts</code>. First, we’ll update the template and styles. Update the inline template to include the template reference with the <code>Dynamic</code> directive. I added text, so my template and styles look like the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-department',  
  template: `  
   &lt;h3 class="mat-headline"&gt;Relax, you got this&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;ng-template appDynamic&gt;&lt;/ng-template&gt;
  `,  
  styles: [`  
    h3 { text-align: center; } 
  `]  
})
</code>   

<p>In the component class code, we have a bit to do. We need to load the dynamic components and rotate the components to display. We’ll hard-code the list of components to show for now, but later we’ll add a service and add in the logic for handling the user claim value.</p>

<p>We use the <code>ViewChild</code> decorator on the <code>Dynamic</code> directive to access where to insert the component. When creating the component, we pass in the component <code>Type</code>. Copy the following class code and replace your <code>DepartmentComponent</code> class code.</p>

   <code>export class DepartmentComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {  
  @ViewChild(DynamicDirective, {static: true}) private dynamicHost!: DynamicDirective;  
  private interval: number|undefined;  
  private currentIndex = 1;  
  
  private messages: { type: Type&lt;DynamicComponent&gt; }[] = [  
    { type: ClawesomeComponent },  
    { type: PawesomeComponent },  
    { type: SmileyComponent }  
  ];  
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {  
    this.loadComponent();  
    this.rotateMessages();  
  }  
  
  public ngOnDestroy(): void {  
    clearInterval(this.interval);  
  }  
  
  private loadComponent(): void {  
    if (this.messages.length === 0) return;  
    this.currentIndex = (this.currentIndex + 1) % this.messages.length;  
    const message = this.messages[this.currentIndex];  
  
    const viewContainerRef = this.dynamicHost.viewContainerRef;  
    viewContainerRef.clear();  
  
    const componentRef = viewContainerRef.createComponent&lt;DynamicComponent&gt;(message.type);  
  }  
  
  private rotateMessages(): void {  
    this.interval = window.setInterval(() =&gt; {  
      this.loadComponent();  
    }, 10000);  
  }  
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s talk through the <code>loadComponent</code> method in a little more detail. First, we make sure we’re rotating through the messages sequentially by keeping track of where in the array we are, then clearing out the previous component. To dynamically load the component, we use the directive as an anchor and create the component into its position in the DOM. The <code>createComponent</code> method requires the component type, not the instance. We use the base interface as a generic type for all the components, and use concrete component type in the method parameter.</p>

<p>If you look at your app, you’ll see the components rotating!</p>

 Add authentication 

<p>Now we can start customizing based on the user information.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You will need them in the following steps.</p>

<p>We can use the Okta-provided Angular SDK to connect to the OIDC client quickly. Add the two packages by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-angular@4 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.8 --save
</code>   

<p>Open <code>srcs/app/app.module.ts</code> and create an <code>OktaAuth</code> instance by adding the following before the <code>NgModule</code> and replacing the placeholders with the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code> from earlier.</p>

   <code>import { OKTA_CONFIG, OktaAuthModule } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
});
</code>   

<p>Next, add <code>OktaAuthModule</code> to the <code>imports</code> array and configure the provider for the <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> token, as shown below.</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...,
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth } }
  ],
  ...
})
</code>   

<p>Okta has a component for the login callback, but we need to add the route. Open <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and add the following to your routes array.</p>

   <code>{ path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
</code>   

<p>We also want to guard the <code>Protected</code> component route to authenticated users. Okta has a guard we can use. Open <code>src/app/protected/protected-routing.module.ts</code> to add a <code>canActivate</code> guard to the default route. Your routes array will look like the code snippet below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [{ path: '', component: ProtectedComponent, canActivate: [OktaAuthGuard] }];
</code>   

<p>For the actual logging in, open <code>src/app/menu/menu.component.ts</code> to add a menu with login and logout buttons. We’ll use some Okta-provided code to log in, log out, and identify the authenticated state. Update the component code to match the code below.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-menu',  
  template: `  
    &lt;button mat-icon-button aria-label="Button to open menu" [matMenuTriggerFor]="menu"&gt;  
      &lt;mat-icon&gt;menu&lt;/mat-icon&gt; 
    &lt;/button&gt; 
    &lt;mat-menu #menu="matMenu"&gt;  
      &lt;button mat-menu-item *ngIf="!isAuthenticated" (click)="login()"&gt;  
        &lt;mat-icon&gt;login&lt;/mat-icon&gt; &lt;span&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;/button&gt; 
      &lt;button mat-menu-item *ngIf="isAuthenticated" (click)="logout()"&gt;  
        &lt;mat-icon&gt;logout&lt;/mat-icon&gt; &lt;span&gt;Logout&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt; 
    &lt;/mat-menu&gt;
  `
})
export class MenuComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {  
  public isAuthenticated = false;  
  private _destroySub$ = new Subject&lt;void&gt;();  
  
  constructor(private _oktaAuth: OktaAuth, private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService, private _router: Router) { }  
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {  
   this._authStateService.authState$.pipe(  
     filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s),  
     map((s: AuthState) =&gt; s.isAuthenticated ?? false),  
     distinctUntilChanged(),  
     takeUntil(this._destroySub$)
   ).subscribe(
     (authenticated: boolean) =&gt; this.isAuthenticated = authenticated
   );  
  }  

  public ngOnDestroy(): void {
    this._destroySub.next();
  }
  
  public async login(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {  
    await this._oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect().then(  
      _ =&gt; this._router.navigate(['/protected'])  
    );  
  }  
  
  public async logout(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {  
    await this._oktaAuth.signOut();  
  }  
}
</code>   

<p>Now that you can log in let’s get your name displayed in the toolbar. Open <code>src/app/profile/profile.component.ts</code>.  Okta’s auth state has user info. Notice it’s also available through a claim. Replace the <code>Profile</code> component code with the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-profile',  
  template: `  
    &lt;ng-container *ngIf="name$ | async as name "&gt;
      &lt;span class="mat-body-1"&gt;{{name}}&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;/ng-container&gt; 
`})  
export class ProfileComponent {  
  public name$: Observable&lt;string&gt; = this._authStateService.authState$.pipe( 
    filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s &amp;&amp; !!s.isAuthenticated),  
    map((s: AuthState) =&gt; s.idToken?.claims.name ?? '')  
  );  
  
  constructor(private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService) { }  
}
</code>   

<p>Now you see your name when you log in to the application.</p>

 Format the dynamic components 

<p>All the messages have data to display. The data always includes an URL plus other content that is unique to each component. Let’s define the interface to support the message data. Run the following command to create the interface.</p>

   <code>ng generate interface message
</code>   

<p>There’ll be three different message formats, one for each dynamic component. So we’ll define a message type, standardized data properties, and a class that holds the type and data properties. Open <code>src/app/message.ts</code> and replace the contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>export type MessageType = 'Pawesome' | 'Clawesome' | 'Smiley';  
  
export interface MessageData {  
  url: string;  
  content?: any;  
}  
  
export class MessageItem {  
  constructor(public type: MessageType, public data: MessageData) { }  
}
</code>   

<p>When we created the dynamic components earlier, they all implemented the same base interface, <code>DynamicComponent</code>. Since all the dynamic components have some data, we need to update the <code>DynamicComponent</code> interface to reflect this shared property that all the components will implement.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/app/protected/department/dynamic.component.ts</code> and add a property named <code>data</code> of type <code>MessageData</code> to it. The interface now looks like the following.</p>

   <code>export interface DynamicComponent {  
  data: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>Because we have separate components specifically designed to handle each message type, we keep the logic very straightforward. We’ll apply template updates to each component and implement all the interface members by adding an input property to accept the data.</p>

<p>Start by opening <code>src/app/protected/department/clawesome.component.ts</code>. This component’s data has an URL to an image and string content.  Update the component to the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-clawesome',  
  template:  `  
    &lt;mat-card class="card"&gt;
      &lt;img mat-card-image src="{{data.url}}" alt="Photo of a clawesome creature" &gt;  
      &lt;mat-card-content&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{data.content}}&lt;/p&gt;  
      &lt;/mat-card-content&gt;
    &lt;/mat-card&gt;
  `,  
  styles: [` .card { max-width: 300px; } `]  
})  
export class ClawesomeComponent implements DynamicComponent {  
 @Input() data!: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>Each component is a Material card control with an image to display. Next open <code>src/app/protected/department/pawesome.component.ts</code>. In addition to the URL, content contains the properties <code>name</code> and <code>about</code>. Update the component to the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-pawesome',  
  template: `  
    &lt;mat-card class="card"&gt;
      &lt;mat-card-header&gt;
        &lt;mat-card-title&gt;{{data.content.name}}&lt;/mat-card-title&gt;  
        &lt;mat-card-subtitle&gt;Good doggo&lt;/mat-card-subtitle&gt;
      &lt;/mat-card-header&gt;
      &lt;img mat-card-image src="{{data.url}}" alt="Photo of a pawesome creature" &gt;  
      &lt;mat-card-content&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; {{data.content.about}} &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/mat-card-content&gt;
    &lt;/mat-card&gt;
  `,  
  styles: [` .card { max-width: 300px; } `]  
})  
export class PawesomeComponent implements DynamicComponent {  
 @Input() data!: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, open <code>src/app/protected/department/smiley.component.ts</code>. The only data in this message type is the URL. Update the component to the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-smiley',  
  template: `  
    &lt;mat-card class="card"&gt;
      &lt;img mat-card-image src="{{data.url}}" alt="Photo of a smiley creature" &gt;  
      &lt;mat-card-content&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SMILE!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/mat-card-content&gt;
    &lt;/mat-card&gt; `,  
  styles: [` .card { max-width: 300px; } `]
})  
export class SmileyComponent implements DynamicComponent {  
 @Input() public data!: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>The rotating components look a little goofy now and you’ll see a lot of errors in the console, but we’ll get it fixed up soon.</p>

 Add claim in Okta dashboard 

<p>Next, we need to add the claim. We’ll assign a department to the user and create a claim that pulls in the department value. We can do this in the Okta dashboard. Navigate to Directory &gt; People and click the user you’ll log in with.</p>

<p>Navigate to the Profile tab and press Edit. Scroll down to Department and enter the number <code>1</code>. We’ll label the department names as either <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> for ease of coding.</p>

<p>Since we see different content by user claim, it’s helpful to have more than one user. If you have a second user, update their department name to <code>2</code>, but you can also edit the department value between logging in.</p>

<p>For the claim, navigate to Security &gt; API and select your Authorization Server to edit in the Okta dashboard. If you are using a Developer Account, you’ll have one named “default”. In your “default” Authorization Server, navigate to the Claims tab. Press the Add Claim button to create a new claim. Name your claim “department”, always include it in the “ID Token”, and set its value to <code>user.profile.department</code>. Your inputs should look like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The ID token now contains the new claim with the value of the user’s department.</p>

<p></p>

 Use claims in the application 

<p>The dynamic components are cool, but they don’t do anything yet. The value of dynamic components is that the component contents change, and we can show whatever data in the component we want. Let’s add the code to see how flexible dynamic components are. We need a service that emulates a server response to return messages. Run the following command to create the service.</p>

   <code>ng generate service message
</code>   

<p>The <code>MessageService</code> returns messages the company wants to display to its users. All messages have a URL, and some have additional content to display. Open <code>src/app/message.service.ts</code> and add the following code to fake out message responses as a private class property.</p>

   <code>private messages: MessageItem[] = [  
  {

      content: {

  },  
  {  
    type: 'Pawesome',
      data: {  
        url: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/406014/pexels-photo-406014.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1260&amp;h=750&amp;dpr=1',  
        content: {

    }  
  }  
];
</code>   

<p>There’s one more property to add. A real server call should only return the messages relevant to the department of the caller. Users of department “1” shouldn’t see the messages for department “2” by inspecting the network response. We’ll handle this within the service by creating a mapping for message types by the department. Add the <code>departmentMapping</code> property and update the constructor for the service as shown below.</p>

   <code>private departmentMapping: Map&lt;number, MessageType[]&gt; = new Map&lt;number, MessageType[]&gt;();  
  
constructor() {  
  this.departmentMapping.set(1, ['Smiley']);  
  this.departmentMapping.set(2, ['Pawesome', 'Clawesome']);  
}
</code>   

<p>Now let’s add a method to get the messages. Add the following code to filter the hard-coded messages.</p>

   <code>public getMessages(department: number): MessageItem[] {  
  const messageTypes = this.departmentMapping.get(department) ?? [];  
  return this.messages.filter(m =&gt; messageTypes.includes(m.type));  
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to call this service method. To do so, we’ll read the claims values of the authenticated user and pass in the department to the <code>getMessages</code> method. We’ll access the claim through the ID token from Okta’s auth state subject. Even though we’re in a guarded route, we’ll still add the safety measures to verify the user authentication, and to return a default value if the claim isn’t on the ID token for some reason. Open <code>src/app/protected/protected.component.ts</code> and update to the following code.</p>

   <code>export class ProtectedComponent implements OnInit {  
  // ... task list property here don't delete 
  
  public messages: MessageItem[] = [];  
  
  constructor(private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService, private _messageService: MessageService) { }  
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {  
    this._authStateService.authState$.pipe(  
      filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s &amp;&amp; !!s.isAuthenticated),  
      map((s: AuthState) =&gt; +s.idToken?.claims['department'] ?? 0),  
      take(1)  
    ).subscribe(  
      (d: number) =&gt; this.messages = this._messageService.getMessages(d)  
    );  
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We now have a list of messages to display to the user. We’ll pass this to the dynamic component’s container component to action. In the inline template for <code>ProtectedComponent</code>, update the <code>&lt;app-department&gt;</code> element to pass in <code>messages</code> as an input property. You’ll see an error in the IDE since we haven’t created the input property in the Department component yet. The element in the inline template will look like the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;app-department [messages]="messages"&gt;&lt;/app-department&gt;
</code>   

<p>You can probably see where this is going. Now we’ll update the Department component to support the input property. Open <code>src/app/protected/department/department.component.ts</code>. Replace the hardcoded private <code>messages</code> property into a public input property like the code snippet below.</p>

   <code>@Input() public messages: MessageItem[] = [];
</code>   

<p>You’ll have a new error in the app because our code in the <code>loadComponent</code> method expects a component type. We’ll add a factory method to return the component type to create by matching the <code>MessageType</code> to the component type like the following example.</p>

   <code>private componentTypeFactory(type: MessageType): Type&lt;DynamicComponent&gt; {  
  let comp: Type&lt;DynamicComponent&gt;;  
  if (type === 'Pawesome') {  
    comp = PawesomeComponent;  
  } else if (type === 'Clawesome') {  
    comp = ClawesomeComponent;  
  } else {  
    comp = SmileyComponent;  
  }  
 return comp;  
}
</code>   

<p>Then we can update the <code>loadComponent</code> method to use the factory method. We also have message data to pass into the components, although the dynamic components can’t support the input property. Update the code and add the new line of code to pass data to the components like the code block below.</p>

   <code>const componentRef = viewContainerRef.createComponent&lt;DynamicComponent&gt;(this.componentTypeFactory(message.type));  
componentRef.instance.data = message.data;
</code>   

<p>Now everything should compile, and you should have a working app that displays a rotating set of cute animals images to help you power through working on that task list. Try logging in as a user with a different department (or change the department value for yourself in the Okta dashboard) to see the various dynamic components at work.</p>

As one veteran Basel-ite who had an exhibition at Design Miami explained to me — and I’m dutifully paraphrasing here — Art Basel is the one major art festival (or really, marketplace) where you’ll see world class contemporary art sitting side by side next to world class clickbait.</p><p>(You all remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian_(artwork)">the infamous banana</a> that made headlines pre-COVID.)</p><p>That clickbait — perhaps unsurprisingly — emerged in the form of all things crypto this&nbsp;year:</p>  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/04/1061539871/nft-art-craze-hits-miami-art-basel">NFT art craze hits Miami Art&nbsp;Basel</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-nft-collector-hit-art-basel-miami-beach-for-a-crash-course-we-tagged-along-11638626828">A Day in the Life of an NFT Collector at Art Basel Miami Beach — Told Through&nbsp;Photos</a>  <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/12/french-montana-nft-jean-michel-basquiat-art-basel-miami">French Montana Leaks A Rare NFT Featuring Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>  <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/04/star-trek-creator-gene-roddenberrys-signature-becomes-first-living-nft/">Signature of ‘Star Trek’ creator Gene Roddenberry becomes first living NFT at Art&nbsp;Basel</a>  <a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/12/05/artist-narine-arakelian-sells-her-eggs-as-an-nft-at-art-basel/">Artist sells her eggs as an NFT at Art&nbsp;Basel</a>  <p>Art and money have always existed hand in hand so modern art’s natural symbiosis with new age money and value frameworks makes plenty of sense. Today, Art Basel’s home in Miami has crypto&nbsp;fever.</p><p>And boy were things feverish. Enthusiasm, alcohol, and money flowed freely throughout the week. Artists and entrepreneurs abound, promoting their projects. VCs diligently scampering from dinners to afterparties in search of the next big&nbsp;thing.</p><p>While crypto insiders, builders, and investors are rallying around the promise of DeFi, NFTs have brought in a whole new demographic to the space — further fueled by Facebook’s recent Metaverse pivot, providing a new form of energy centered around engagement.</p><p>There’s plenty of hype, speculation, and easy money at the moment, which leads to plenty of&nbsp;noise.</p><p>One thing was clear. It’s buzzy to talk about things like web3 and the metaverse, but these are very early days and much of the hard work is yet to be&nbsp;done.</p><p>It reminded me a bit of Bitcoin 2013 in San Jose, a formative moment in crypto’s history. There was plenty of energy and money (relatively speaking) then, too. People were already talking about concepts like smart contracts and how they might fuel a new chapter for decentralized finance — and this was before Vitalik Buterin had even published his Ethereum white paper. (That would come out later that&nbsp;year.)</p><p>But that was all it was back then. A lot of talk and some really compelling concepts. We’ve only started seeing the fruits of those labors in the last couple of&nbsp;years.</p><p>We’re going through that same process today with web3 and the metaverse.</p><p>Just as the rise of Bitcoin did back then, the prevalence of NFTs and DeFi has given us a taste of what’s possible for this next&nbsp;chapter.</p><p>Now, it’s time to&nbsp;build.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/at-art-basel-nft-fans-say-no-thanks-to-facebooks-metaverse.html">The Future of the Internet May Be Happening in Miami.

A crypto Bill of&nbsp;Rights <p><a href="https://yourcryptorights.com/">Courtesy of Binance</a>, the world’s largest crypto exchange:</p>  Every human being should have access to financial tools, like crypto, that allow for greater economic independence.  Industry participants have a responsibility to work with regulators and policymakers to shape new standards for crypto assets. Smart regulation encourages innovation and helps keep users&nbsp;safe.  Responsible crypto platforms have an obligation to protect users from bad actors and implement Know Your Customer (KYC) processes to prevent financial crimes.  Privacy is a human right, and personally identifiable information (PII) data should be subject to strict levels of protection.  Crypto users have the right to access exchanges that keep their funds secure, in safe custody with comprehensive deposit insurance.  Healthy markets should maintain a robust level of liquidity to ensure a stable and frictionless trading environment.  Regulation and innovation are not mutually exclusive. Crypto users deserve safe access to emerging technologies and practices, including NFTs, stablecoins, staking, yield-farming, and&nbsp;more.  Closing the knowledge gap is essential when it comes to crypto. Users have the right to accurate information on crypto assets, without fear of falling victim to unfair or deceptive advertising.  Marketplaces that offer derivative instruments should be subject to the appropriate regulations. This ensures all users meet eligibility requirements and that their transactions are fairly&nbsp;settled.  Crypto regulation is inevitable.* Users have the right to share their voice on how the industry should evolve with their blockchain platform of&nbsp;choice.   4.

<p>Open banking technology is responding to the demands of an expanding market, creating new payment choices for consumers within the ACH network. Electronic payments are growing at an exponential rate, quarter by quarter. In<a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/ach-network-sees-record-growth-2020-268-billion-payments"> 2020 alone</a>, 26.8 billion payments were initiated, moving $61.9 trillion, up 10.8% from 2019. Internet-initiated consumer payments for bills, account transfers and other payments increased 15% to more than 7.7 billion. It’s clear that open banking payment apps and services are a major factor contributing to the increased ACH volume, and they are gaining mass adoption due to the added value of digital enablement.</p>
<p>The transition to convenient digital payments and banking services is picking up speed. Friction-hampered, outdated account validation processes are increasingly unacceptable to consumers. Remember when borrowers faxed in voided checks to set up ACH payments? While ridiculous today, clunky account validation processes persist. Loan servicers need accurate data to confirm account ownership. Finicity, a Mastercard company, and its open banking platform simplifies this and expands possibilities for both lenders and borrowers through the FinicityPay solution set.</p>
<p>Using ACH transactions, Financial Institutions can set up a new account, fund a loan, retrieve closing costs and origination fees, or set up recurring payments across mortgage, auto, small business and personal loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FinicityPay serves up rich data sets in seconds, verifying account details, account owners and balances to enable accurate, confident payments. Our real-time retrieval of account financial data helps mitigate fraud risk, reduce payment failures and fees, enable onboarding and aid in maintaining compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Leveling Up With Finicity Open Banking 
<p>Finicity recently reached an integration agreement with<a href="https://loanpro.io/"> LoanPro</a>, a tech-forward SaaS-based solution in loan servicing software​​.</p>
<p>LoanPro will utilize consumer-permissioned data and smart analytics from FinicityPay solutions to verify account ownership and account credentials to fund loans, and help mitigate payment failure and fraud. LoanPro’s SaaS-based loan servicing, management, and collections platform offers a full-featured, configuration-first, API-based lending solution, designed to streamline both loan servicing and loan collections workflows. FinicityPay seamlessly adds real-time account verification capabilities to LoanPro’s digital repayment solutions.</p>
<p>Using Finicity’s smart data, account owner and balance check, can be verified in seconds, before initiating a payment. LoanPro can now offer improved payment success rates, reducing the risk of NSF fees. Payment fraud and failure are also minimized with FinicityPay’s secure, encrypted digital data flow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Finicity’s work with LoanPro is a great example of how open banking can help providers create a seamless payments experience,” said Steve Smith, Chief Engagement Officer, Open Banking at Mastercard. “Through the integration, LoanPro’s customers will be able to validate account information in real time before pushing out funds and scheduling repayments, initiating a more strategic and accessible approach to loan servicing.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for digital repayment solutions, as<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/us-digital-payments-achieving-the-next-phase-of-consumer-engagement"> consumers move more of their finances online</a>. LoanPro’s Loan Management System (LMS) software integration with Finicity Pay adds speed, security, and increased payment success to the platform, an absolute necessity as the growing payments market goes digital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Pay Confidently 
<p>With FinicityPay, you receive fast, reliable data from the largest financial institutions, with 95% market coverage. The deep learning analytics layer in our data services mitigates fraud risk, payment failure and fees. Finicity’s solution suite is also aligned with<a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits"> Nacha’s WEB Debit Rule</a>, so consumers and businesses can set up and manage their accounts with confidence.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce the launch of the Dock Wallet on mobile, the app is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dock-crypto-wallet/id1565227368">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dockapp">Play Store</a>. This is a significant milestone for Dock, as not only can community members now store, send, receive, and manage Dock tokens from their mobile device, it will serve as an important gateway to a number of planned Dock innovations. </p><p>The Dock team has been developing the app since March 2021 with a vision to provide a safe, secure and convenient mobile wallet for storing and transacting with Dock tokens. Importantly, Dock’s Wallet App gives the token holder full control over their DOCK tokens as the wallet enables them to control and manage their own private keys, allowing them to send and receive tokens without the involvement of any third party.</p><p>Dock Wallet App vs. Crypto Exchanges</p><p>Existing centralised crypto exchanges are in control of the tokens held on their platforms; to send, receive, lock, or withdraw cryptocurrency, the network must first approve of this transaction. With these so-called custodial wallets, there are many security considerations including; (1) them being hacked or (2) blocking your access to your account for a certain reason if they feel it’s necessary.</p><p>With Dock’s Wallet App, and as previously mentioned, the token holder is in control of the private key, can send, receive, withdraw, and manage their tokens without the permission or input of any third party. The user creates their own recovery phrase and can create several accounts on the App. </p><p>Work before the launch</p><p>Developing the App began on the 29th March, and engineering came into play around the 10th June. Full steam ahead, Dock relied on the community to help with beta testing which took place on and after the 22nd September. After getting some great feedback and suggestions from the community, our expert engineers worked out the bugs and took the suggestions into consideration. In mid October, the Dock team submitted the App to the App Store and Play Store - the Play Store had approved of the App within a few days, followed by the App Store a week later. By the 22nd October, the App has been approved to go live on both Apple and Android devices. </p><p>Shortly after, the app was audited by Oak Security. We’ve published the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-app/blob/master/audit-reports/OakSecurity-AuditReport-Wallet-v0.1.pdf">full report here</a>. We are happy to announce that all discovered issues have been resolved. The audit was completed on the 6th December. </p><p>This is just the start</p><p>As mentioned above, the wallet not only represents a much improved user experience for the Dock community today, but it will also be a building block for new features. Future iterations will include the ability for individuals to receive, store and send verifiable identity and credentials, as well as staking and governance features. Watch this space...</p><p>Download</p><p>Download the Dock Wallet App from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dock-crypto-wallet/id1565227368">AppStore</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dockapp">PlayStore</a> here.</p>

<p>As more and more people are turning to working from home, with a vast majority of those people living in huge epicenters around Europe, we are seeing a few growing trends within the mobility industry. The major trend is the versatility in which people are getting from A to B and the conveniency it offers.</p>



<p>A study from McKinsey expects the annual growth rate for shared-mobility solutions to exceed 20 percent through 2030. With this prediction, the way in which mobility is seen, used and offered will change and the requirements will need to be met.</p>



<p>Aspects such as flexibility, price, conveniency and sustainability must be incorporated in order to stay relevant and competitive. But what exactly are consumers using and why are we seeing these trends? Let’s have a look:</p>



 Top Trends: 



  Micro-mobility: The first trend we are seeing is an increase in popularity of what has come to be called micro-mobility. This includes all small vehicles used by an individual such as a bike, e-bike, e-scooter, moped, etc. It is a very practical solution for those that don’t have a far commute or reside in large cities where smaller modes of transportation are easier and more convenient.  Car-sharing/car-hailing: A somewhat new phenomena for getting around is a concept known as car-sharing/car-hailing. Easily book a car for a short period of time or order a ride to take you where you need to go. This type of traveling is better when the distances are greater between destinations and is just as accessible as micro-mobility.  



 Reasons for the rise in shared-mobility in a digitized on-demand world 



<p>Both of these somewhat new mobility trends change the way of how we view transportation due to the fact that there isn’t a need to personally own a vehicle. But why are we seeing these trends coming into the mobility market?</p>



  Home Office. With the majority of people working from home these days, there is no longer the necessity to own a personal vehicle. Why waste time and money on something that you don’t need every day? Car-sharing or car-hailing becomes more practical and is as simple as a click on your smartphone.  Global Pandemic. The Corona virus has changed many aspects of our lives and one of those would be the urgent need to get from A to B. Instead, there’s less of a demand for constant or immediate transportation. Plus, micro-mobility is more appealing due to the fact that there is minimal contact with other people when traveling.  Sustainable. When comparing micro-mobility and car-sharing/hailing to other forms of transportation, these two new trends are far more eco-friendly. Many of the smaller vehicles are sustainable and there are even options for electric vehicles. The future of mobility is greener with the help of these rising trends.  Cheaper. When considering the costs of owning a personal vehicle, around half of the people underestimate the total amount. Car ownership is not to be taken lightly, as unexpected costs can arise. Both car-sharing/hailing and micro-mobility offer a less expensive option based on traveling needs.  Convenient. The conveniency is extremely desirable with these up-and-becoming trends since living in larger cities can pose obstacles for personal autos. Instead, e-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing and other options are readily available without wasting any time.  Flexible. When owning your own vehicle, there aren’t many options for switching to a different model and trying something new. However, with micro-mobility and car-sharing, the choice is yours whenever you want. The options are there to fit your lifestyle and not the other way around.  







 Convenience through Security 



<p>As mobility becomes more flexible and diverse, security plays a major role in leading the future of mobility. Companies and consumers want to know they can trust one another because safety is everyone’s concern. End users of these services are not only looking for convenience, but also secure mobility options. They need to trust that they are getting exactly what they are looking for in a transportation service.</p>



<p>In return, mobility providers want to deliver on that because they know that the more convenient and secure their service is the higher the conversion rate. Therefore, security is a two-way street for both the consumers and the companies because when convenience is met by providing a secure and reliable service, conversions rates rise.</p>



<p>Furthermore, when automated ID verification is integrated into the onboarding process it increases the confidence of users in using a certain mobility provider. Onboarding feels safe, robust, straightforward and convenient for consumers while also being flexible to the services through easy integration into a mobility app with different languages in the interface.</p>



<p>IDnow is there to assist in this endeavor with products such as AutoIdent or AutoIdent with e-sign add-on. With an onboarding process of only a couple of minutes, consumers have the conveniency they are searching for, while companies meet KYC needs. Trust is our top priority and we wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>



 Why conveniency and security should be at the top of your priority list 



<p>Not only have we mentioned that the right balance of conveniency and security will increase your conversion rates, but it will give you a step-up from your competitors. Because users are looking for these two main aspects in a mobility service, if you don’t provide it, or aren’t fast enough, they will easily find the next scooter or car that does provide what they are looking for. Looking ahead gives you the benefit of knowing what consumers want and need, and they will thank you for it by choosing you every time.</p>



 Grow your mobility services with our in-depth mobility guide 



<p>For further information on the subject with more insights into the new driver experience, our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/mobility-report/">Mobility eBook</a> is a great resource for delving further into the trends we are seeing within the industry. The tools you need to grow your service are also described in more detail. We are there for you by providing you with all your digital identification needs.</p>



<p>So, as transportation starts to head in a different direction compared to what we’ve seen in the past, one thing remains the same: people want a solution that fits their lifestyle. And these two trends we are seeing fit to the lifestyles today’s generations are living. Thus, adapting to these new requirements is essential for the mobility industry and ID verification is there to support in those needs. Security and trust are the platforms for the mobility of the future and IDnow is there for you every step of the way.</p>

<p>The UK Government plans to ‘reform’ data protection law to replace citizen data rights with corporate data&nbsp;rights.</p><p>The paper containing its proposals, Data: A New Direction, has 51,503 words. But you only need 58 of them to get to its essence (if you can find&nbsp;them).</p><p>The Government, says the paper, intends to “create a limited, exhaustive list of legitimate interests for which organisations can&nbsp;… process personal data without unnecessary recourse to consent.” [Paragraph 57]. One of these ‘legitimate interests’ (where no consent is required) would be “Managing or maintaining a database to ensure that records of individuals are accurate and up to date, and to avoid unnecessary duplication.” [Paragraph 58&nbsp;(i)]</p><p>The “bold new data regime” created by this carefully crafted wrecking amendment (supported by many others) would replace today’s core principle for data protection legislation — that organisations should only process individuals’ data for ‘specified, explicit purposes’ — with a new general corporate right to data surveillance: the right to maintain databases about individuals without their&nbsp;consent.</p><p>The Government’s stated reason for these reforms is its wish to “usher in a new golden age of growth and innovation” [Ministerial Foreword] by creating “​​a better balance” between data protection and data use. [Paragraph 59] In other words, it’s based on the idea that there is an unavoidable trade-off between data protection rights and innovation and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>This narrative is flawed from start to finish. Everything the Government says it wants to achieve could be achieved without major changes to existing legislation and by enhancing rather than abolishing citizens’ control over their data. The Government wants a ‘new direction’ for personal data, but it has chosen the wrong direction.</p><p>This blog, the second in a series prompted by the UK Government’s proposals, shows why — and in doing so also shows why a practical, positive, citizen-empowering alternative to what the Government is suggesting already exists and is ready and waiting to be implemented.</p> The ‘trade-off’ myth <p>The thinking behind the Government’s proposals goes something like&nbsp;this:</p><p>“1. Personal data can play a huge role in enabling innovation that drives economic growth that benefits both citizens and businesses.</p><p>2. But organisations’ ability to access and use this data is being constrained by data protection regulations such as&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>3. Therefore, to unleash personal data’s innovation and growth potential, citizens’ rights need to be curtailed.”</p><p>Some other sub-narratives go along with this story. They include the ideas&nbsp;that:</p>  The innovations we’re talking about will take the form of ‘products’ that will be sold for money in ‘markets’ (where ‘amount of extra money made’ is the best or only way to measure the resulting ‘growth’)  By definition, this innovation and growth will be generated by the private&nbsp;sector.  <p>Let’s start with the sub-narratives first.</p> Myth #1: ‘Innovation takes the form of products that generate growth by being sold in&nbsp;markets’ <p>This may be true on some occasions. But not always. In our last blog we showed that data’s <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">biggest source of value lies in its reliability</a> — that if you can be confident that the data you are using is correct, you can use it without the costs and risks of making mistakes or having to invest time and effort ensuring that these mistakes are not&nbsp;made.</p><p>This being case, the most important form of innovation made possible by data lies&nbsp;in:</p>  better processes for making reliable data available — not separate ‘products’&nbsp;…  primarily relating to the more efficient, effective administration by which stuff gets done — not selling a product, or data, in ‘markets’&nbsp;…  resulting in cost reductions — not the ‘new revenue streams’ by which ‘growth’ is usually measured. (In fact, by enabling system-wide reductions in friction, effort, risk and cost, better uses of reliable data could result in a reduction of GDP because it involves less money being spent: GDP measures money spent not real value created.)  enabled by new data logistics infrastructure that helps people and organisations to get exactly the right (reliable, up-to-date, accurate, complete) data to and from the right parties in the right formats at the right times — not a separate, additional activity called ‘new product development’.  <p>Developing such infrastructure is a hugely important arena of innovation because it supports all the monitoring, decision-making, planning, organising, coordinating, implementation and administration that is needed wherever services are delivered to individuals across all industries and sectors — and it does not need to compromise citizens’ data protection rights in any&nbsp;way.</p><p>To the contrary, its best achieved by enhancing them, by providing individuals with their own personal data stores which enable them to collect and share their own data under their control. This approach is already being pursued in the public sector by the Scottish Government with its <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a> (and by Mydex CIC). But it is ignored by the UK Government in its proposed ‘reforms’.</p> Myth #2: ‘The private sector is the source and driver innovation’ <p>Again, this may be true. But not&nbsp;always.</p><p>Developing the infrastructure needed for improved availability of reliable data is an innovation that can (and needs to) take place everywhere: in the private sector and the public sector and the third sector (charities, social enterprises and so on). Yet, by focusing its attention on the private sector the Government’s proposals miss this opportunity.</p> Myth #3: ‘To innovate better, organisations need access to more&nbsp;data” <p>As ever, this may be true. But not&nbsp;always.</p><p>The story told by ‘Big Data’ enthusiasts is that organisations always need more data, because more data means they can generate better ‘insights’. But if the biggest economic benefits come from better administrative processes using reliable data, the key source of added value is not ‘insights’ made available by ‘more data’, but efficiencies made possible by the ability to access exactly the right data at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>It’s worth exploring this a little more because of all the myths behind the Government’s disastrous proposals, this is probably the biggest&nbsp;one.</p><p>The vast majority of organisations that collect and use personal data to provide services do not need ‘more’ data. They need the right data for their specific&nbsp;service.</p><p>An online retailer doesn’t need to know your blood type. A doctor doesn’t need to know your bank balance. Whatever the service we are talking about, whether it is diagnosing an illness, assessing eligibility to a loan or a benefit, purchasing a product or ticket online, switching an energy supplier etc, delivery of the service in question depends on the availability of the exact data needed to complete that particular operation.</p><p>In such scenarios, which account for the vast majority of real life uses of data, ‘more data’ doesn’t drive value. To the contrary, it drives waste. A product manufacturer who has to handle a wide range of components that are not needed to make its product simply incurs extra unnecessary costs. Likewise, a service provider processing extra&nbsp;data.</p><p>Yes, service quality, timeliness and efficiency is compromised if any key data points are missing. To that degree, service providers may need to get hold of data that they don’t currently hold. But the key issue here is not accessing ‘more data’ in general. It is about being able to access the right data, which takes us back to data logistics infrastructure.</p><p>In fact, ‘more data’ is only needed in a very small proportion of activities. They boil down to two categories. Activities such as research and the use of training data in AI do indeed need ‘more data’ to get better results, but they don’t need personal data. That’s because they are using data for statistical analysis where anonymised data does the job just as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The only industry that always wants more personal data is ad-tech. The inner logic of data-driven advertising targeting flies directly in the face of data protection. To achieve perfect targeting (e.g. to eliminate waste and error in targeted messaging) you need a perfect profile, and to achieve a perfect profile you need to know all there is to know about the individual concerned. People may argue about the social and economic pros and cons of advertising itself. But the ad-tech industry is a different kettle of fish. It is an intrinsically totalitarian project.</p><p>Advertising accounts for around 1.5% of all economic activity. Basing a wholesale re-write of 25 years’ worth of regulatory fine-tuning on the needs of a tiny, toxic offshoot is not a sound way forward. But that is what the Government appears to be&nbsp;doing.</p> Myth #4: “Growth comes from helping organisations to improve their operations” <p>At first sight, this seems obvious. Who else is going to ‘innovate’?</p><p>But what this statement actually articulates is an innovation-constraining organisation-centric assumption. The organisation-centric mindset assumes that the only entities that can (and therefore should) collect and use personal data are organisations — not people themselves, because it is only organisations that do stuff with data. According to this view, individuals are (and always should be) treated as data subjects (as they are called under the GDPR data protection regulations).</p><p>Data subjects are not empowered to collect and use their own data for their own purposes. Rather, organisations collect data about these data subjects and use this data for their own organisations’ purposes (which may be benign or malign: see Myth #5&nbsp;below).</p><p>But what would happen if individuals were able to collect and use their own data to manage their lives better (just as organisations collect and use data to manage their operations better)? What would happen if individuals could become the point where information about themselves is aggregated and integrated, directly under their control, rather than having their data dispersed across hundreds of separate and different organisational data&nbsp;silos?</p><p>Answer: an explosion of innovation focused on improving citizens’ lives by helping them use their own data to make better decisions and get stuff done in their lives. This is a whole new dimension of innovation — a vast new continent of opportunity — that is still waiting to be explored. And, far from creating a trade-off between data protection rights and innovation and growth, it relies on the opposite: on empowering citizens with their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Given this enormous untapped opportunity for innovation and growth, you would think the UK Government would be bending over backwards to promote it. But no. None of its proposals address this opportunity. Instead, they all reinforce the organisation-centric assumption that charges in exactly the opposite direction — of disempowering citizens, minimising their ability to control their own data&nbsp;… and ignoring opportunities for innovation that don’t fit its preconceptions.</p> Myth #5: “All ‘innovation’ is, by definition, a good&nbsp;thing” <p>Usually, when people talk about innovation, the unquestioned underlying assumption is that all innovation is a good thing, by definition. This is the assumption behind the UK Government’s proposed&nbsp;reforms.</p><p>But it is palpable nonsense. Nuclear bombs were an innovation. Fraudsters are constantly innovating: coming up with new, better ways to con people out of their money. Cambridge Analytica was profoundly innovative. So it is simply not true that all innovations make peoples’ lives better. Many do the exact opposite.</p><p>In fact, a recent research review of the history of innovation and entrepreneurship* concluded that throughout history there have been two types of entrepreneurship, resulting in two types of innovation: productive and unproductive/parasitic, with unproductive innovators “seeking to obtain a larger slice of the pie for themselves, rather than increasing the size of the pie for everyone”.</p><p>Here is the study’s conclusion:</p><blockquote>“How the entrepreneur acts at a given time and place depends heavily on the rules of the game, the reward structure in the economy, that happen to prevail&nbsp;… It is the set of rules and not the supply of entrepreneurs or the nature of their objectives that undergoes significant changes from one period to another.”</blockquote><p>By depriving citizens of most of their current rights under data protection law, the UK Government is trying to change ‘the rules of the game’ to recast ‘the reward structure in the economy’ in ways that incentivise the wrong sorts of innovation. What it is proposing would not benefit citizens or bona fide service providers. Instead, it would create a breeding ground for dozens more different types of unproductive, parasitic Cambridge Analyticas.</p> Conclusion <p>The rationale behind the UK Government’s data protection ‘reforms’ is flawed, made up of a bundle of myths, misconceptions and mistaken assumptions. It misunderstands what makes personal data valuable in the first place, where the biggest opportunities for innovation and growth lie, and the role data has to play in unleashing these opportunities.</p><p>This blog has shown that the route to innovation and growth lies in an entirely different direction to the one assumed by the Government: empowering citizens with personal data store-based data logistics infrastructure that enables the right, reliable data to get to and from the right people at the right times, while keeping citizens in control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The same infrastructure can enable individuals to aggregate data about themselves that is currently dispersed across hundreds of separate organisational data silos, to create new-to-the-world citizen-centric data assets that act as engines of privacy protecting innovation.</p><p>Current data protection law does nothing to hinder these — the right sorts of innovation and growth. What the law does hinder is the collection and use of personal data without individuals’ consent for purposes that individuals have not asked for — i.e. ‘innovative’ Cambridge Analytica-style business models.

 Rennes and Munich, Dec. 7, 2021, AutoIdent+QES is an all-in-one solution with qualified electronic signature (according to eIDAS v1) paired with remote identity verification, compliant with the AML-CFT Directive, available on the French market and a real alternative to a PVID service. 
<p>IDnow and ARIADNEXT, who recently joined forces (June 2021) with the purpose of becoming the KYC leader in Europe, introduce a qualified electronic signature solution paired with automatic and manual identity verification: AutoIdent+QES complies with KYC requirements of French companies under the European AML/CFT Directive.</p>
<p>As a reminder, many sectors are subject to the AML/CFT Directive: banks, insurance companies, fintech and neobanks, online gambling, etc. As part of their onboarding process (KYC), they are required to implement measures such as verification of the person’s identity document, micro-payment, identity verification by a Remote Identity Verification Provider (PVID) or qualified electronic signature. These measures can be considered as constraining, in the integration of the solution but especially in their impact on the onboarding process for end users, looking for smooth experiences.</p>
<p>The AutoIdent+QES solution, certified by an accredited body, effortlessly orchestrates a hybrid identity verification completed by a qualified electronic signature according to eIDAS. Easily integrated, it enables regulated companies to address their services in full compliance to all types of audiences (even non-banked) and delivers a complete, fluid and fast user experience, with a less than 10 minute onboarding process during which the user proves their identity.</p>
<p>A significant advantage of the AutoIdent+QES onboarding process is its total flexibility: depending on the customer’s needs, the eSign module for digital contract signing can complete the journey by enabling the signing of a contract, paving the way for other use cases, such as taking out a consumer loan in a fully digital process.</p>
<p>“With AutoIdent+QES, our customers, who operate in an ever-changing environment, have the peace of mind and flexibility to choose the solution that best meets their needs,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>
<p>Marc Norlain, co-founder of ARIADNEXT and IDnow Board Member adds “this certified solution, already available on the European market, offers a real alternative to the upcoming PVID certification in the French landscape. The AutoIdent+QES solution completes our product offering for companies required to comply with AML-CFT regulations and anticipates the upcoming certification of our PVID solution by offering a service that can be deployed by financial institutions”.</p>

  <p>Electron is one of the most popular desktop frameworks today. Electron uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for its front end and Node.js for its backend. This design enables developers to quickly write and easily maintain cross-platform applications between their desktop and web applications. Since Electron uses Node on the backend, it also has access to the entire npm ecosystem that Node developers have come to rely on.</p>

<p>Even though it is built on Node, Electron is used for desktop applications rather than web applications. This can present a new set of challenges. For example, one of the most common and popular ways to interface with Okta from a Node.js application is to use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/oidc-middleware">Okta NodeJS OIDC Middleware</a>. The middleware takes some configuration and connects with Okta. This process is super simple to set up and use securely.</p>

<p>Matt Raible wrote a blog post <a>about using Electron with Okta</a> in 2018. In his example, he used <code>AppAuth</code> with its PKCE extension to secure his Electron application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Both of these approaches require a callback path where Okta can send the authentication code to be processed by your application. For some companies, allowing <code>localhost</code> to receive the response from Okta may pose a security concern. There are many ways to handle this, but in this article, you will use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-auth-js">Okta’s Auth JS SDK</a>. This SDK exposes a <code>signInWithCredentials()</code> method that you can use to authenticate your users.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Native and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and the Logout Redirect URI 
    (where <code>dev-133337.okta.com</code> is your Okta domain name). Your domain name is reversed to provide a unique scheme to open your app on a device.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Native App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Native App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>You can leave the redirect URI at the default as you won’t be using it for this project. If you have multiple authorization servers you will need to pick one. For this application, the <code>default</code> server is fine.</p>

<p>Once your application is configured, the Okta CLI will return the issuer and client-id. Make note of these as you will need them when you build your application.</p>

<p></p>

 Build an Electron app 

<p>Now you’re ready to build an Electron application. First, open a new folder using your favorite IDE. In the console, type <code>npm init</code> and complete the setup presented to you. Accepting all the defaults is fine. Once you are done with the setup, install the following dependencies:</p>

   <code>npm i -D electron@16.0.3 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.8.0
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>start</code> script to your <code>package.json</code> file.</p>

   <code>"scripts": {
  "start": "electron .",
  ...
},
</code>   

<p>Create a new file called <code>main.js</code> and add the following code to it. Make sure to replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> and <code>{yourClientId}</code> with the settings from the OIDC app you created earlier.</p>

   <code>const { app, BrowserWindow } = require("electron");
const path = require("path");
const OktaAuth = require("@okta/okta-auth-js").OktaAuth;

const { ipcMain } = require("electron");

let mainWindow;
let user;

var config = {
  // Required config
  issuer: "/oauth2/default",
  clientId: "{yourClientId}",
};

var authClient = new OktaAuth(config);

ipcMain.on("user:login", (event, data) =&gt; {
  authClient
    .signInWithCredentials(data)
    .then(function (res) {
      console.log(res);

      if (res.data.status != "SUCCESS") {
        event.reply("login-failed", err.errorSummary);
        return;
      }

      user = res.user;
      openHome();
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
      console.log(err);
      event.reply("login-failed", err.errorSummary);
    });
});

ipcMain.handle("user:get", (event) =&gt; {
  return user;
});

ipcMain.on("user:logout", (event) =&gt; {
  user = null;
  openIndex();
});

function createWindow() {
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js"),
    },
  });
}

function openIndex() {
  mainWindow.loadFile("index.html");

  // Open the DevTools.
  mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();
}

function openHome() {
  mainWindow.loadFile("home.html");
}

// This method will be called when Electron has finished
// initialization and is ready to create browser windows.
// Some APIs can only be used after this event occurs.
app.whenReady().then(() =&gt; {
  createWindow();
  openIndex();

  app.on("activate", function () {
    // On macOS it's common to re-create a window in the app when the
    // dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open.
    if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) createWindow();
  });
});

// Quit when all windows are closed, except on macOS. There, it's common
// for applications and their menu bar to stay active until the user quits
// explicitly with Cmd + Q.
app.on("window-all-closed", function () {
  if (process.platform !== "darwin") app.quit();
});
</code>   

<p>This file serves a few different functions. First, it is the main entry point for the application. Because of this, it also handles creating the window as well as the close function.</p>

<p>The <code>main.js</code> file also serves to navigate between the unsecured <code>index.html</code> page and the secured <code>home.html</code> page. When the user is authenticated you will direct them to the <code>home.html</code> page. After the user logs out, direct them to the <code>index.html</code> page which contains the login logic.</p>

<p>The file also contains handlers for the main process and communication back to the renderer process. In Electron, these processes are isolated from each other for security. The appropriate way to communicate between the two is to use the <code>contextBridge</code> and the <code>ipcRenderer</code> or <code>ipcMain</code> modules, depending on which way you are trying to communicate. In <code>main.js</code> you are receiving communication from the renderer process when the user attempts to log in or requests to log out. There is also a handler for <code>user:get</code> that will return the user stored by the main process to the renderer process.</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>main.js</code> file will also handle the authentication logic from the Okta SDK. You will need to configure your client first, using your issuer and the client ID obtained during the setup process above. Next, you can create a <code>login()</code> method that makes use of the <code>signInWithCredentials()</code> method provided by the SDK. This method will return a result that you can parse. If the message is a success then you can redirect the user to <code>home.index</code>, otherwise you can return an error message and handle that on your renderer side as you see fit.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>preload.js</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require("electron");

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("electron", {
  login: (data) =&gt; ipcRenderer.send("user:login", data),
  getUser: async () =&gt; {
    const user = await ipcRenderer.invoke("user:get");
    return user;
  },
  logout: () =&gt; ipcRenderer.send("user:logout"),
});

ipcRenderer.on("login-failed", (event, message) =&gt; {
  document.getElementById("error-message").innerHTML = message;
});
</code>   

<p>The <code>preload.js</code> file is where you will mediate the communication between the main and the renderer process. <code>contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld</code> allows you to define an API, in this case, called <code>electron</code>, that your renderer can invoke. This file has access to both the renderer and main process and can delegate messages from the renderer to the main process. When the renderer calls <code>electron.login</code>, the <code>ipcRenderer</code> will send the message and payload through the <code>contextBridge</code> to be handled in the <code>main.js</code> page you saw earlier.</p>

<p>Next, add two HTML files. Start by adding <code>index.html</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;A Brief Electron demo with Okta&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Electron and Okta&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Please Login&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="username" id="username"/&gt;

    &lt;label&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="password" name="password" id="password"/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;button id="login-button"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;label id="error-message"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  .container {
    width: 60%;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  document.querySelector("#login-button").addEventListener("click", () =&gt; {
    const username = document.getElementById("username").value;
    const password = document.getElementById("password").value;

    const data = {
      username: username,
      password: password,
    };

    window.electron.login(data);
  });

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>index.html</code> page is for users who are not authenticated yet. You are presenting the user with a login screen that collects a username and password and calls <code>window.electron.login</code>. As you learned earlier, this function is added in the <code>preload.js</code> file.</p>

<p>Finally, add a <code>home.html</code> file and provide a landing page for authenticated users.</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Home&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Congratulations &lt;span id="username"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;, You've made it to a secure page using Okta.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;button id="logout-button"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () =&gt; {
    window.electron.getUser().then((user) =&gt; {
      document.getElementById("username").innerHTML = `${user.profile.firstName} ${user.profile.lastName}`
    });
  });

  document.getElementById('logout-button').addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
    window.electron.logout();
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>The logout button calls your <code>electron</code> API from the <code>preload.js</code> file. You are also displaying the user’s name from Okta. This helps verify that the user is logged in and who they signed in as.</p>

<p>This page has been left intentionally simple for a very good reason. Electron doesn’t care what frontend you use. This could be a full-fledged React application or could have very little JavaScript at all. How you handle managing the application and user state is up to you. But, by using the Okta SDKs you can securely authenticate your users, and push them into the application state you need.</p>

<p>With your application ready, you can use the command <code>npm start</code> or run your debugger to see the application. You will see a warning in your console when starting:</p>

   <code>[okta-auth-sdk] WARN: Memory storage can only support simple single user use case on server 
side, please provide custom storageProvider or storageKey if advanced scenarios need to be 
supported.
</code>   

<p>For development, this isn’t an issue; in production you may want to consider implementing a custom storage provider for your application. You can find <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#node-js-and-react-native-usage">more usage information here</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once the application starts up, you can use your Okta credentials to log in and see the <code>home.html</code> page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Wolf McNally’s <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash">LifeHash</a> is one of Blockchain Commons’ interoperable specifications intended to make digital infrastructure open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate. A LifeHash takes a cryptographic objects such as a seed or a key (or really, any sort of data) and turns it into a beautiful and easily recognizable image.</p>

<p>You can now play with LifeHashes at <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash-web/">C++ implementation compiled to WebAssembly</a> allows you to enter an arbitrary text string or a SHA-256 digest and view the corresponding LifeHash — using one of a few different LifeHash variants. (We recommend v2 as the “official” LifeHash.) Because it’s compiled into Webassembly, LifeHash.info does all the work in your browser, ensuring your secrets stay safe!</p>

<p>A similar idea called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-blockies">Blockies</a> already exists to identify Ethereum addresses. They’re a great addition to the Ethereum ecosystem, but LifeHashes incorporate a few additional features. Because each one is built from an iteration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>, they’re more detailed. They also have been carefully formatted to display well on grayscale screens and low-resolution screens, with our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/Q1-2021-Report/">LetheKit offering a proof of concept</a>.</p>

<p>So why use LifeHashes? They ensure that any time that you see a key or seed in a different environment, you’ll be able to recognize it through the visual hash (and now you can use <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a> to display the LifeHash derived from the SHA-256 hash of an object, even if your app doesn’t support LifeHashes). As an adjunct to existing computer and human examinations of digital hashes, LifeHashes can improve your security.</p>

<p>LifeHashes are particularly important for Blockchain Commons given our focus on resilient and independent airgapped architectures: a LifeHash allows for the easy comparison of a cryptographic object on either side of the gap, so that you know that you received what you were expecting. Transferred a seed? Asked to sign a PSBT for a specific account? LifeHashes can help you avoid costly errors.</p>

<p>Our explainer video talks more about LifeHash and demonstrates how it works:</p>





<p>Blockchain Commons is dedicated to improving the human aspects of the digital world; LifeHash does that by considering the human experience of cryptographic hashes and providing visual cues to replace (or at least supplement) the long strings of letters and numbers that we can’t easily differentiate.</p>

				  The emergence of a global pandemic has driven the digitalization of services making reliable authentication online a critical need, says Charlyn Ho, a privacy and technology expert at international law firm Perkins Coie, in a new white paper.   
			  
				
				
				 <p>We caught up with Charlyn to learn more about her paper, <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/4/247949/2021-Perkins-Coie-LLP-Health-Passport-White-Paper.pdf">COVID-19 as a Catalyst for Advancement of Digital Identity</a>,&nbsp;and to talk about&nbsp; the future of decentralized identity. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio: &nbsp;Tell us about yourself and your work and how it led you to write this paper. </p>
<p>Charlyn Ho (CH): Perkins Coie has a long history with self-sovereign identity beginning in 2016 when we were approached by a pro-bono client that was looking to use digital identity to empower refugees to control their own national papers to help mitigate the risk of physical papers being lost or stolen. These efforts started the Blockchain Technology group’s passion for self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Blockchain Technology group authored “<a href="https://www.virtualcurrencyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2017/05/Perkins-Coie-LLP-Legal-Aspects-of-Smart-Contracts-Applications.pdf">Legal Aspects of Smart Contract Applications</a>” a white paper that provided an initial analysis of the legal aspects of five prominent smart contract use cases that included self-sovereign identity. Later that year, Perkins Coie became the first law firm to be selected as a <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/perkins-coie-selected-as-a-founding-steward-in-self-sovereign.html">Founding Steward</a> by the Sovrin Foundation, which is when I began my work in this space. In 2018, I co-authored a white paper addressing self-sovereign identity and Distributed Ledger Technology titled “<a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/1/v3/218495/Perkins-Coie-Self-Sovereign-Identity-and-Distributed-Ledger-Tech.pdf">Self-Sovereign Identity and Distributed Ledger Technology: Framing the Legal Issues</a>.” The paper outlined the high-level legal issues and technological challenges that must be addressed ahead of mass adoption of self-sovereign identity. Also in 2018, Perkins Coie began representing Sovrin with whom we co-authored a white paper titled “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf">A Protocol and Token for Self-Sovereign Identity &amp; Decentralized Trust</a>.”</p>
<p>As we watched the COVID-19 pandemic unfold, we became convinced that flimsy paper cards and quick-fix health passes would not provide sustainable solutions. So, we decided to put pen to paper and draft “<a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/4/248113/2021-Perkins-Coie-LLP-Health-Certificate-White-Paper.pdf">COVID-19 as a Catalyst for Advancement of Digital Identity</a>,” which we believe lays out the fundamental principles underlying self-sovereign identity. We hope our paper can serve as a framework upon which governments and institutions can build digital identity systems in a way that is both privacy-preserving and widely adoptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio: &nbsp;How did you land on the three pillars of digital identity? You mentioned Christopher Allen’s paper “The Path to Self Sovereign Identity,” how influential was that material to the direction of the paper?</p>
<p>CH: Any comprehensive digital identity system is unlikely to garner widespread acceptance without being able to convincingly assuage your average user’s (understandable) concerns about how their data is stored, used, shared, and accessed. Such skepticism can be healthy—it’s your data after all. But if we also believe that digital identity systems hold the potential to not only provide users enhanced security and efficiency of their data but also the ability for nations and institutions to respond quickly to disasters, pandemics, and other threats, then we need to prioritize systems that are crafted with users’ needs and interests in mind if we are to reap these rewards.</p>
<p>One of our primary objectives in writing this paper was to ascertain the fundamental building blocks of any healthy digital identity system. While any number of desirable features may be present in a successful digital identity system, from our review of the relevant literature and existing digital identity systems we determined that trust, user-centricity, and data security are the pillars for any comprehensive system to function effectively and secure users’ confidence.</p>
<p>While many thought leaders influenced this project, Christopher Allen is certainly a pioneer in this space, so his work had a particularly important influence us. I think he put it best when he wrote, “You can’t spell identity without an ‘I.’” Digital identity starts and ends with the user — a concept that was vital to our work, particularly our second pillar (user-centricity). Hopefully we’ve been able to build on the foundation that Mr. Allen has laid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio: You mention paper vaccination cards and plastic drivers licenses as examples of physical identification cards and cite the problems in offline identification systems being not fully inclusive — with 1.1 billion people being “invisible, discounted, or left behind.” Is a trustworthy, secure, user-centric digital credential system a necessity that governments should pursue with more urgency? What are your thoughts on the urgency of adoption of digital identity at the government-level?</p>
<p>CH: Paper and plastic provide a veneer of security — you can see, touch, and physically move a driver’s license or birth certificate. But those same characteristics create a double-edged sword. If paper and plastic can be seen and touched, they can also be forged. If they can be moved, they can also be lost or stolen. For those fleeing conflict or born into poverty, physical credentials are scarce, which makes proving that you are who you say you are all the more challenging.</p>
<p>For these reasons (and many others), governments absolutely should be exploring trustworthy and secure digital credential systems. Governments around the world have been slow to develop comprehensive digital identity systems, which became all-too-apparent during the somewhat disjointed and on-the-fly approach that various nation states and institutions took to developing credentialing systems during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio:&nbsp; In the paper, you describe Indicio’s digital identity system with SITA as being in Phase ‘3.5’ in evolution for user control of identity. Can you talk about what a Phase 4 system would look like in relation to health credentials? Would a more comprehensive digital identity system need to be adopted at a government level for user-centric digital identity to catch on or will private use cases help push us to Phase 4 evolution?</p>
<p>CH: A Phase 4 (self-sovereign) digital identity system is more of a journey than a destination. As the name implies, Phase 4 is true self-sovereignty, but whether or not true self-sovereignty can ever exist in practice is debatable due to countervailing state interests in having some measure of control over or access to one’s data. A Phase 4 system requires that users be vested with autonomy or sovereignty with respect to their credentials, which would apply to health credentials or otherwise. But what that looks like and the friction that may exist when such a system is put into practice remains to be seen. Without moving through Phase 3.5 (user-centric) we only have limited ways to conceive of what a Phase 4 system could look like in a practical sense. Putting the pieces of the puzzle together remains murky because we are only at the very nascency of Phase 3.5.</p>

Currently, payment service providers dealing in fiat currency must collect and share information on the sender and beneficiary of each wire transfer they process. This is what the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) refers to as the Travel Rule (FATF Recommendation 16). In June 2019, the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfgeneral/documents/outcomes-plenary-june-2019.html">FATF updated its guidance</a> to apply its Travel Rule standards to cryptoassets. <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14259-2021-INIT/en/pdf">With this proposal</a>, the EU is advancing to expand the scope of regulation to apply to cryptoassets.</p> 
<p>EU ambassador Andrej Šircelj, said “this agreement is an important step towards closing the gaps in our financial systems that are malevolently used by criminals to launder unlawful gains or finance terrorist activities. Crypto-assets are more and more at risk of being exploited for money laundering and criminal purposes, and I’m glad the Council could make swift progress on this urgent proposal.”</p> 
<p>In practice, cryptoasset business will need to provide originator and beneficiary information which will accompany cryptoasset transfers. This also applies to cryptoasset business which process transfers from the EU to outside the Union. This information will be submitted “before or at the moment the transaction is completed” by the customer of the cryptoasset business.</p> 
<p>If the parties involved in a transaction are suspicious or are the subject of sanctions, the proposal highlights that: “payment service providers of payers and of payees, as well as intermediary payment service providers, take appropriate action to freeze certain funds or that they comply with specific restrictions concerning certain transfers of funds.” The document highlighted that personal data collected to comply with this regulation should not be processed for commercial purposes. Furthermore, negotiations should include requirements regarding data protection and sharing.</p> 
<p>The proposal also clarifies exemption for a number of blockchain network participants.&nbsp; Indeed, “persons that are merely ancillary participants, which do not provide or actively facilitate the transfer of crypto-assets, such as persons that provide only Internet services, cloud services, a gateway to connect to a distributed ledger network (for example a so called ‘unhosted wallet’) or nodes that help validate the transactions, should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.” However, when a cryptoasset business receives or transfers funds from or to a private address not linked to a business, the cryptoasset business “will have to obtain information both on the originator and the beneficiary, usually from their customer.”</p>

  Reports From India Suggest the Government Will Regulate Rather Than Ban Cryptoassets  
<p>A bill seeking to prohibit all private cryptoassets in India was presented for consideration to the Lok Sabha, India’s parliament, as<a href="http://loksabhadocs.nic.in/bull2mk/2021/23.11.21.pdf"> announced in the official bulletin</a> on November 23rd 2021. A week later, the creator of this bill, former Finance Secretary Subhash Gard,<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-misinterpreted-private-crypto-ban-says-crypto-bill-creator"> said</a> it was misinterpreted by observers. In fact, he believes that “the future of currency is in digital currencies.”<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cabinet-note-suggests-india-will-regulate-rather-than-ban-crypto"> Local reports</a> suggest that investors will have to declare their cryptoasset holdings and will be given time to transfer their funds to soon-to-be regulated exchanges. In parallel, the Reserve Bank of India is working on a framework to<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-backed-digital-currency-soon/articleshow/87977223.cms"> experiment launching its central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC). This would also be covered by the bill pending introduction to the Lok Sabha as detailed in the bulletin. These announcements follow two significant cryptoasset regulatory developments covered by Elliptic in November 2021<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-president-working-group-releases-report-on-stablecoins"> here</a> and<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-infrastructure-bills-cryptoasset-reporting-requirements-seen-as-overreach"> here</a>.</p>

  SEC Clamps Down on Cryptoasset Fraud Costing More Than $7 Million to Investors  
<p>On December 2nd 2021, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-248?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"> charged a Latvian national</a>, Ivars Auzins, with fraud involving cryptoassets. The charges relate to two separate cryptoasset offerings which defrauded hundreds of retail investors. These schemes operated in 2018 and 2019 but Auzins failed to register with the SEC and adhere to anti-fraud requirements. It is estimated that at least $7 million of the funds raised through these offerings were misappropriated by Auzins. The Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit, Kristina Littman, declared: “[w]e will continue to detect and pursue those that seek to victimize investors in the digital asset space.”</p>

 &nbsp; Luxembourg Releases Guidance on Cryptoasset Investments  
<p>On November 29th 2021, Luxembourg’s financial markets regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), <a href="https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/FAQ_Virtual_Assets.pdf">&nbsp;published an FAQ</a> document on cryptoassets. It outlines which market participants are authorised to trade cryptoassets. It clarifies that alternative investment funds (AIF) and investment fund managers (IFM) must obtain prior approval from the CSSF before trading cryptoassets. This includes, “[a]n updated risk management policy including in particular how the risks in relation to the virtual assets are managed” and “AML/CTF analysis on the assets side.” Furthermore, the “CSSF expects [...] supervised entities investing in virtual assets possess, and can demonstrate, an adequate understanding of the new ML, TF, Proliferation Financing risks posed by virtual assets and the necessary measures to mitigate them.” Cryptoasset business looking to operate in Luxemburg should refer to the<a href="https://mj.gouvernement.lu/dam-assets/dossiers/blanchiment/ML-TF-vertical-risk-assessment-on-VASPs.pdf"> Ministry of Justice’s vertical risk assessment framework</a> for cryptoasset businesses.</p>

<p>A summary of Jolocom’s projects in 2021 provides a broad overview of how we work, what our values ​ are, and how we have developed. Spoiler Alert: A lot has happened since January.</p>



 ONCE in implementation 



<p>In spring this year we began the implementation phase for the project ONCE. ONCE had been selected as one out of four projects of the innovation competition ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’ by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) for a three-year implementation phase. Jolocom brings its expertise in the development of wallet-based digital identities based on the self-sovereign identity (SSI) approach to three of the selected implementation projects.</p>



<p>In this project, Jolocom is responsible for the development of an ONCE-compliant wallet. Based on the Jolocom Smartwallet. In the next two years, this is to be supplemented with additional modules and functions together with the project partners.</p>



<p>In the initial phase, the projects focuses extensively on the development, implementation and integration of the technical components. Soon, however, the implementation of use cases from the areas of public administration, mobility and tourism will come to the fore. The solutions of the ONCE ecosystem will then be piloted and put into circulation in particular in the Hesse region and in partner cities in Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia.</p>



<p>From this point on, the practical results of ONCE will be tested in everyday life by residents of the regions. In terms of its functionality, the ecosystem is designed to serve both sovereign identities and evidence (eID, mDL, iKfz), as well as identity features that are issued and used according to the principles of SSI.</p>



<p>The ONCE project also takes current developments around the European eIDAS regulation into account, with the clear goal of providing future-proof solutions on the subject of digital identities for German and EU citizens.</p>



<p>Read more about ONCE? You can find more information here: <a href="https://www.once-project.de/partner/jolocom/">https://www.once-project.de/partner/jolocom/</a> &amp; on our website: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/once-eidas-de/">https://jolocom.io/blog/once-eidas-de/</a></p>



 Jolocom goes Consulting – since 7 years 



<p>2021 was a productive year for Jolocom. A lot has happened since January: projects have been further developed and expanded. An example of this is the area of consulting.</p>



<p>In its seven years, Jolocom actually always held a consultant role, which means that we can pull off a great deal of know-how through various project implementations. The focus here is of course on SSI. But Jolocom has also been able to acquire a lot of knowledge through active work in the field of technology or in networks of various bodies (e.g. W3C, DIF, INATBA) and consortia (e.g. shop window projects digital identities). That, in turn, can flow into our advisory role.</p>



<p>We don’t just strive for advice from start to finish. No, rather from start to operation without detours. Because Jolocom covers all areas and levels, from the first contact with the topic of digital identities, creation of the strategy, selection of the technology to implementation. This enables efficient first-hand advice without time-consuming and costly detours.</p>



<p>Principles and solutions</p>



<p>We are convinced that a decentralized identity should be an open platform with uniform standards, regardless of a single solution. Products and solutions have to be interoperable. This is the only way to realize the potential of the technology for the individual, public, and private sector.</p>



<p>This principle guides us in consultation and in the creation of our freely available platform. When it comes to consulting, we are therefore independent of technology and aim to avoid a vendor lock-in or other dependencies.</p>



<p>Jolocom Consulting supports project / consortium management, so that the solution goes into operation as planned and the potentials can be realized. <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/">https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/</a></p>



 



<p>The development and thus the projects of Jolocom are constantly evolving. For example, we are working on demos that clearly and vividly present what we do and what we are working on. For the ConDIDi project, Jolocom created a demo together with the TIB in Leibniz, which shows this well and can be tried here: <a href="https://labs.tib.eu/condidi/">https://labs.tib.eu/condidi/</a></p>



<p>Jolocom started its ONCE project in 2021 and was able to further expand the area of ​​consulting. We also worked on the development of the Smartwallet 2.0, which will be presented in more detail in another article. We are very excited about the opportunities 2022 will bring and proud of the progress we made in 2021.</p>

 Eine Übersicht über die Projekte von Jolocom bietet ein umfassendes Bild darüber, wie wir arbeiten, was unsere Werte sind, und wie wir uns entwickelt haben. Spoiler Alert: Seit Januar hat sich viel getan.&nbsp; 



 ONCE in der Umsetzung&nbsp; 



<p>Im Frühling begann die Umsetzungsphase für unser Projekt ONCE. Als eines von vier Projekten wurde ONCE im Innovationswettbewerb ,,Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten’’ vom Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi) für die dreijährige Umsetzungsphase ausgewählt. Jolocom bringt seine Expertise in der Entwicklung von Wallet-basierten Digitalen Identitäten auf Basis des Selbst-Souveränen Identität (SSI) Ansatzes in insgesamt drei der Umsetzungsprojekte ein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Im ONCE-Projekt ist Jolocom für die Entwicklung einer ONCE-konformen Wallet zuständig, welche auf der Jolocom Smartwallet aufbaut. In den kommenden zwei Jahren soll diese gemeinsam mit den Projektpartnern um weitere Module und Funktionen ergänzt werden. In der Anfangsphase liegt der Fokus noch stark auf der Entwicklung, Implementierung und Integration der technischen Komponenten. Bald jedoch wird die Umsetzung von Anwendungsfällen aus den Bereichen Öffentliche Verwaltung, Mobilität und Tourismus in den Vordergrund treten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Lösungen des ONCE-Ökosystems werden dann insbesondere in der Region Hessen, sowie in Partnerstädten in Bayern und Nordrhein-Westfalen pilotiert und in Umlauf gebracht. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt werden die praktischen Ergebnisse von ONCE im Alltag durch Anwohner:innen der Regionen erprobt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In seiner Funktionalität ist das Ökosystem darauf ausgelegt, sowohl hoheitliche Identitäten und Nachweise zu bedienen (eID, mDL, iKfz), als auch Identitätsmerkmale, die nach den Prinzipien von SSI herausgegeben und verwendet werden. Das ONCE-Projekt berücksichtigt auch derzeitige Entwicklungen rund um die europäische eIDAS-Verordnung, mit dem klaren Ziel, zukunftsfähige Lösungen zum Thema Digitale Identitäten für deutsche und EU-Bürger:innen bereitzustellen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Jolocom goes Consulting – schon seit 7 Jahren&nbsp; 



<p>2021 war ein produktives Jahr für Jolocom. Seit Januar hat sich viel getan: Projekte wurden weiterentwickelt und Schwerpunkte ausgebaut. Ein Beispiel hierfür ist der Bereich der Beratung.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom hatte in seinen sieben Jahren eigentlich immer auch eine Beraterfunktion inne, wodurch wir von großem Know-How durch verschiedene Projektdurchführungen zerren können. Der Fokus hierbei liegt natürlich auf SSI. Doch auch im Bereich der Technologie oder in Netzwerken verschiedener Gremien (z.B. W3C, DIF, INATBA) und Konsortien (z.B. Schaufensterprojekte Digitale Identitäten) hat Jolocom sich durch aktive Arbeit viel Wissen aneignen können. Dass wiederum kann in unsere Beraterfunktion einfließen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir streben eine Beratung nicht nur von Anfang bis Ende an. Nein, vielmehr vom Anfang bis zum Betrieb ohne Umwege. Denn Jolocom deckt alle Bereiche und Ebenen ab, von erstem Kontakt mit dem Thema digitale Identitäten, Erstellung der Strategie, Auswahl der Technologie bis zu einer Implementierung. Dies ermöglicht eine effiziente Beratung aus erster Hand ohne zeit- und kostenintensive Umwege.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grundsätze und Lösungen&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass eine dezentrale Identität eine offene Plattform mit einheitlichen Standards sein muss, unabhängig von einer einzelnen Lösung. Produkte und Lösungen müssen interoperabel sein. Nur so können die Potentiale der Technologie für den Einzelnen, für den öffentlichen Bereich und die Privatwirtschaft umgesetzt werden. Dieser Grundsatz leitet uns in der Beratung und in der Erstellung unserer frei verfügbaren Plattform. In der Beratung sind wir daher technologieunabhängig und verfolgen das Ziel, dass ein Vendor lock-in oder andere Abhängigkeiten vermieden werden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom Consulting unterstützt bei Projekt-/Konsortienmanagement und als Spezialist, damit die Lösung wie geplant in Betrieb geht und die Potentiale realisiert werden können. <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/">https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Weiteres  



<p>Die Entwicklung und damit die Projekte Jolocoms sind sich stets am Weiterentwickeln. Beispielsweise arbeiten wir an Demos, die übersichtlich und anschaulich vorstellen, was wir machen und woran wir arbeiten. Für das Projekt ConDIDi erstellte Jolocom gemeinsam mit dem TIB in Leibniz eine Demo, die dies gut darstellt und gerne hier probiert werden kann:</p>



<p>Jolocom hat 2021 sein Projekt zu ONCE gestartet und den Bereich der Beratung weiterausbauen können. Weiterhin arbeiteten wir an der Entwicklung der Smartwallet 2.0, die in einem weiteren Artikel näher vorgestellt werden wird. Wir freuen uns sehr auf die Möglichkeiten, die 2022 bieten wird, und sind stolz auf den Fortschritt, den wir 2021 erzielen konnten.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thinking in a decentralized architecture</p>
<p>We have a tendency to apply existing solutions or frameworks towards new things. </p>
<p>In the early days of the web, many companies implemented fax on the Internet, rather than rethinking if faxes were still the best solution for certain types of information exchange. </p>
<p>Are we doing the same thing today with wallets? </p>
<p>Wallets are a tool which we employ to store physical identity cards, credit/debit cards, receipts and other things. But when we think about storing digital identities/credentials, of course employing a wallet sounds like an appropriate thing to do, considering it’s what works as the physical world. </p>
<p>I wonder however if framing it as a digital wallet boxes our thinking.</p>
<p>A second tendency we have, specifically in the digital identity space (and I’m guilty of this at times..), is to look at things as layers or foundations. </p>
<p>I often hear phrases such as: “Government issued digital identities will form the foundation for [insert use case].” </p>
<p>Rather than looking at it as something foundational, we should try framing our thinking around a decentralized architecture.</p>
<p>Let’s take the government regulated environment for instance. Rather than thinking of governments issuing Digital IDs as being foundational, can we instead look at a particular government agency being one identity system?</p>
<p> The ministry managing health cards is one identity system. The ministry managing driver’s licences is another. </p>
<p>They are all individual identity systems, but they participate in an Identity Metasystem. </p>
<p>Rather than being a layer they are a node.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Identity Metasystem Diagram</p>
<p>In this podcast episode, Phil talks about a time where he made a back of the envelope calculation to approximate how many credential types existed within the US. The number he came up with was 16 million.</p>
<p>16 million credentials that need their own identity systems – 16 million identity systems which are built by specific entities for specific contexts.</p>
<p>Identity systems are everywhere and new ones are being built every day (most being very small for very niche contexts).</p>
<p>Identity Metasystems leverage common standards (e.g., Verifiable Credentials, DIDs) and technology protocols (e.g., DIDComm, DID Registries). These are the well areas where the various identity systems can participate and inject/extract value from.</p>
<p>If we can distinguish Identity Systems from Identity Metasystems, it creates a better framing for discussions around the roles of governments, private sector and wallet technology providers.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 SSI Wallets – what can be learned from the Web Browser? 
 How will SSI Wallets be adopted? – Will we have very few or many wallets? 
 Distinguishing Identity Systems from Identity Metasystems. 
 How can governments best contribute to Identity Metasystems? 
 Phil’s thoughts on Open ID SIOP (self-issued IDs).&nbsp;

LFG<p>May we have your attention please! This is the paging announcement for all SafleNauts ready to #GoBeyond with us on this journey. Mark your calendars for the 16th of December, 2021 as the Safle project is thrilled to announce its much awaited Initial DEX Offering (IDO) for the $SAFLE token on Polkastarter, the premier decentralised platform for launching new tokens and projects.</p><p>We want to thank our community for continually supporting us and welcome all the curious newcomers interested in mastering the world of cryptos &amp; blockchains with Safle. To understand how to participate in a Polkastarter IDO, make sure to check out Polkastarter’s <a href="https://polkastarter.com/projects/safle">blog post</a> on this&nbsp;topic.</p><p>Safle has created a set of tools for developers and retail end users that provide private, non custodial open governance protocols to manage their self sovereign identity based wallets, and a complete suite for running and managing web services needed to connect to fully synced blockchain nodes. Safle technology stack was built envisioning the challenges in current mainstream mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and of applications built on top of blockchain. The Stack empowers the community to make independent decisions and have power over their digital assets. The current Safle technology stack as well as the envisioned solution offerings for future use cases are built on two main&nbsp;pillars:</p>  Access to Identity in a Decentralised Environment  Access to Finance in a Decentralised Environment  <p>$SAFLE: The protocol’s native governance token</p><p>In order to maintain a balance between developers and retail users, Safle intends to develop wallet infrastructure in a completely non-custodial fashion using open governance mechanisms via the SafleDAO, coordinated and maintained by the Safle token economy. The native $SAFLE token will not only enable token holders to propose and vote on changes (governance privileges) to functionalities and feature sets of the wallet and node services, but will also create a self-sustaining token economic model, where value will be generated by providing access to finance and identity in the decentralised digital world. $SAFLE is a governance and a multi-utility token. Users can earn yield by staking it via the staking&nbsp;pool.</p><p>The $SAFLE token will have two main utilities:</p><p>Asset Value $SAFLE can either be used as a method of payment or as a staking token that enables users to use various subscription services as long as tokens are&nbsp;staked.</p><p>Governance $SAFLE holders can participate in the future of the project by participating in the Governance mechanism through SafleDAO. Holders of the $SAFLE token will have a 1–1 ratio for voting on the proposals. Holders also get the right to propose for carrying the ecosystem forward.</p><p>About Polkastarter</p><p>Polkastarter is the fully decentralised protocol for launching new ideas. Our curation process and industry access enable us to offer the best new projects in blockchain and digital assets. With Polkastarter, decentralised projects can raise awareness, build a loyal community, and receive long-term support. Users of the platform will be able to participate in a secure and compliant environment and use assets both in and beyond the current ERC20 standard.</p><p><a href="https://www.polkastarter.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/polkastarter">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/polkastarter">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://t.me/PolkastarterAnnounce">Telegram Announcements</a></p><p>Stay tuned for our upcoming announcement on how to join the whitelist!</p><p>Safle 🔗</p><p><a href="https://getsafle.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/getsafle">GitHub</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/aj9YRCfh26">Discord</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetSafle">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://instagram.com/getsafle">Instagram</a> | <a href="http://t.me/safleann">Telegram Ann</a> | <a href="http://t.me/saflechat">Telegram&nbsp;Chat</a></p>

<p>Bloom recently launched <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a>, a new DeFi-focused product that helps enterprises with KYC &amp; AML compliance as well as enabling risk assessment via traditional and alternative financial data, all while preserving user privacy. By enabling access to reusable, verifiable credentials for ID verification, sanction screening, and PEP screening, as well as other identity data such as phone number, email, and social accounts, OnRamp is a key piece for DeFi companies facing increased regulatory efforts.</p><p>Bloom Meets Plaid</p><p>Bloom is excited to announce an integration with <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, a data network that powers the digital financial ecosystem. The Plaid integration gives Bloom the ability to offer consumer-permissioned, traditional financial data for better risk assessment through OnRamp.</p><p>With OnRamp, enterprises can prioritize user privacy while still working towards compliance requirements. Bloom uses Plaid so that consumers can link &nbsp;their bank accounts to verify their account information, all while keeping their information private, even from Bloom. &nbsp; The Plaid integration provides users with the option to securely permission and confirm information used in enabling risk assessment by connecting their financial accounts.</p><p>In addition to bank balance data, the Bloom-Plaid integration opens the door to exciting future integrations, including salary verification. The opportunity for OnRamp to incorporate alternative signals like bank account balance and salary can not only expand financial inclusion, but they may, in fact, be more reliable indicators for creditworthiness than traditional metrics. Stay tuned for more updates on how Bloom is unlocking the full power of DeFi! <br></p><p>About OnRamp</p><p><a href="https://bloom.co/">Bloom</a> plans for <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a> to be a key piece of infrastructure for DeFi companies, whether they are in launch or growth mode. The developer-friendly application includes no integration fees, no monthly minimums, no long term contracts, and flexible pricing. OnRamp reduces the barrier to entry for new builders, allows growing companies to expand, and most importantly, opens the door a bit wider for those who deserve access to the decentralized finance markets. Beyond achieving compliance, the use of reusable, verifiable credentials will help DeFi companies enable risk assessment, transcending the collateralized lending structure that has limited growth in the sector up to this point. OnRamp offers reusable, verifiable credentials (VCs) for bank account activity, balances and other financial signals.</p>

<p>A letter from IdentityNORTH Co-Chair, Aran Hamilton</p>
<p>This week we lost a giant in the digital identity space and a leader in the IdentityNORTH community. Kim Cameron was recognized in 2016 as a Founder of Canada’s Digital Economy for his work in recognition of his foundational and groundbreaking work writing the “<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of Identity</a>” (2005).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim was the Chief Architect of Identity in the Identity and Access Division at Microsoft, where he championed the emergence of a privacy-enhancing Identity Metasystem reaching across technologies, industries, vendors, continents and cultures. Kim played a leading role in the evolution of Active Directory, Federation Services, Forefront Identity Manager, CardSpace and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s other Identity Metasystem products. In 2009, he was appointed a Microsoft Distinguished Engineer.</p>
<p>A true friend and mentor to many of us, Kim spoke at IdentityNORTH on several occasions. His talk in 2012 was “Cloud Identity Aha Realizations”, Kim helped us kick off the public consultation for the BC Services Card in Vancouver in 2014, speaking with Don Thibeau as we worked to help the BC Government plan the roll-out of their digital ID program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim was actually the inspiration for the Award that we started in 2015 but we made him wait for it. He spoke to us twice in 2016, first as the Keynote for our Annual Summit “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqUXYl90XHM">Beyond the Laws of Identity</a>” referring to his ground-breaking work and taking us through what he felt he missed when he published his Laws. Kim spoke later on the importance of the community when he received recognition as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdlBg0Ai9aQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">Founder of Canada’s Digital Economy</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim joined us again in 2020, after he retired from Microsoft and gave a different sort of talk. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSYCxw6I8c">keynote</a> at the IdentityNORTH Annual Summit was a sort of career retrospective, a humble recount of some regrets regarding his work and a call for us to pick up where he was leaving off. Always introspective, Kim wished he’d focused more on creating inclusive solutions for individual and enterprise identity challenges and he wanted us to learn from his mistakes. Once again Kim was ahead of his time, thoughtful, and thought-provoking with a large measure of humour and wit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an honour to learn from him, and our community will continue to drive forward his work in shaping and implementing meaningful digital identity solutions.</p>
<p>In our most recent chat over Zoom, Kim gave IdentityNORTH advice on a series of talks he thought we should host in the coming months and years. He spoke of his expectations of the world in covid, and after, and very eagerly of getting to spend virtual time with his very young grandchildren. He remarked at the resilience of children, and their ability to connect emotionally even when presented with technological barriers… and how much fun he was having getting to know them as real people. Our sincere condolences to Kim’s family, we will all miss Kim for his many contributions to our lives and the passion he brought to the IdentityNORTH community.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs is proud to be presenting at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/">The Rise of Privacy Tech</a>&nbsp;(TROPT) interactive forum during&nbsp;<a href="https://staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-week/">Data Privacy Week 2022</a>. Data Privacy Week is an international effort to empower individuals and encourage businesses to respect privacy, safeguard data and enable trust. Data Privacy Week will run January 24–28, 2022. The TROPT interactive forum will be held on January 26–27 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ahead of its interactive forum, the TROPT organization has released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/definingprivacytechwhitepaper2021/">whitepaper</a>&nbsp;titled,&nbsp;Defining the Privacy Tech Landscape 2021: The Rise of Privacy Tech – A Foundational Whitepaper to Help Fuel Privacy Innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, the whitepaper puts forth a comprehensive definition of privacy and, since there’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">much debate</a> about what data privacy really means, we thought we’d share the definition with you here.</p>



 The TROPT definition of privacy&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>First, as we’ve also&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">reported</a>&nbsp;in the past, TROPT acknowledges that&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy definitions</a>&nbsp;and conceptualizations vary widely. To overcome this, TROPT has united the common principles into a multi-dimensional definition of privacy, as you can see here:&nbsp;</p>







<p>TROPT believes this is “a multi-faceted understanding of privacy” which covers individual control and power over personal information (our priority at Anonyome Labs) and facilitating trust in personal information relationships.&nbsp;<br><br>The definition embraces a “comprehensive taxonomical approach to conceptualizing privacy based on the activities that impinge upon privacy: information collection, information processing, information dissemination, and invasions.”</p>



<p>Significantly, this definition rejects “the limited conceptualization of privacy as secrecy, obscurity, or anonymity only.”</p>



<p>Going further, TROPT identifies 7 principles of privacy tech from among the existing privacy principles in privacy regulations:</p>







<p>TROPT then maps its 7 principles to the stages of the data life cycle:</p>







 What does all this mean? 



<p></p>



<p>TROPT&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">agrees with us</a>&nbsp;that “privacy is one of the most critical issues of our time.” Better defining and understanding it, particularly at the practical level of the data lifecycle for an organization, will boost development and uptake of innovations that will help solve the privacy problems we now face at&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">crisis level</a>. Enterprises are demanding more privacy tools in response to growing&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">customer demand</a>&nbsp;for better stewardship of their personal data, and it helps to see what exactly is required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cybersecurity/trusted-tech.html">2020 PwC Trusted Tech report</a>&nbsp;put it, brands that get consumer trust and safety right will disrupt the market. At Anonyome Labs, through our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;business privacy toolkit, we help enterprises rapidly produce branded cybersafety solutions to get out in front of their competition. Through&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, the world’s only all-in-one privacy app, we’re putting the power to protect personal information directly into consumers’ hands.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce Dock’s collaboration with Transak, a platform for onboarding global users from fiat to crypto and back using local payment methods. Previously, Dock Tokens were only available for crypto to crypto buyers, thanks to Docks Integration with Transak, Dock Tokens can now be bought via bank transfers and card payments.</p><p>To celebrate the collaboration, Dock will contribute $10,000 USD toward user transaction fees. This means that early users will get the convenience of Transak without the fees, but you’ll need to be quick, as once the budget is used up the full transaction fees will apply. A small exchange fee will still apply.</p><p>How It Works</p><p>Transak enables bank transfers and card payments in multiple international currencies in over 60 countries, including the UK, Europe and India. In a few simple steps, you’ll own DOCK tokens and will be able to participate in governance, staking, and transacting on the Dock Network. </p><p>Purchase DOCK via the widget on <a href="https://www.dock.io/token#get-dock-token">Dock’s website</a>, sign up to Transak and follow the steps below.</p>  Enter the amount you’d like to purchase in your local currency  Pick your preferred payment method of bank transfer or card payment  Click “Buy Now”  Complete KYC  <p>To ensure compliance, you’ll be asked to enter necessary details such as name, mobile number and DOB, Transak can then tailor your experience for an easy fiat payment the next time you purchase.

Taking on board their concerns, Dock engaged Transak to enable purchases via their fiat on/off-ramp. The integration went live on the 1st of December 2021. </p><p>Dock has a total supply of 1 Billion tokens, circa 750 Million are in circulating supply owned by DOCK token holders. </p><p>Transak has enabled non-crypto holders to purchase DOCK allowing more people to partake in governance, validating, and staking, while ensuring all KYC, AML, and fraud monitoring requirements are met. </p><p>Dock CEO Nick Lambert commented on the collaboration “We’re really excited to be working with Transak in opening up DOCK to a wider audience, enabling non-crypto users to enter our ecosystem”. </p><p>Alessandro Raboni, Head of Growth at Transak commented "At Transak we are early believers in the Polkadot ecosystem and we are thrilled to see it developing with such strong solutions and applications like Dock. Dock solves a very important problem in addressing inefficiencies in current data solutions, leveraging blockchain technology.

<p>We are stoked to announce our partnership with PureFi, a decentralised protocol that provides compliance tools while maintaining the anonymity of its users. PureFi is the only DeFi compliance protocol for mitigating risks of interacting with high-risk illicit assets and onboarding institutions into DeFi. Developed by AMLBot in partnership with Hacken Foundation, it aims to provide a full-cycle solution for crypto asset analytics and AML/KYC procedures in the DeFi ecosystem. Through a set of smart contracts, PureFi seamlessly connects KYC/AML providers to DeFi end users &amp; protocols to provide them with analytics that help differentiate between honest DeFi market profiles and “suspicious profiles”. For example, a liquidity pool can avoid the risk of getting an illegal money trail into the pool through PureFi’s Verifiable Credentials Certificate providing the contributor’s full-fledged AML/KYC&nbsp;data.</p><p>Safle x&nbsp;PureFi</p><p>The prevalent economic narrative has revolved around the concept of inflation and DeFi has been increasingly seen as a safe-haven against it. DeFi as an industry has been disruptive to say the least, but the exposure to “black hats”in the DeFi ecosystem is causing hindrance in its mass adoption. To combat the same, Safle and PureFi will work together on mutually beneficial technical integrations. The SafleID wallet will be integrated as a means of authorisation within PureFi’s beta product, the widget. Furthermore, both projects will collaborate by integrating the PureFi proprietary Beta solution to assign an AML score for SafleID&nbsp;users.</p><p>In addition, within the scope of this partnership, PureFi will also act as a strategic advisor for the Safle project, facilitating strategic relationships with existing ecosystem partners &amp;&nbsp;others.</p><p>“ Being ethically conscious and imposing a strong culture of ethics within the DeFi ecosystem is obligatory. We’re looking forward to making DeFi Safe &amp; Simple together with PureFi.” Priyanshu Singh, CMO,&nbsp;Safle</p><p>About Safle</p><p>A next-generation non custodial wallet, self sovereign identity protocol and Web 3.0 infra. provider for the decentralised ecosystem, governed by the community. Safle is a decentralised blockchain identity wallet that enables secure private key management and seamless experience for dApps, DeFi and NFTs. In order to maintain a balance between developers and retail users, Safle intends to develop a wallet infrastructure in a completely non-custodial fashion using Open Governance Mechanisms via the SafleDAO coordinated and maintained by the Safle token economy. The native $SAFLE token will not only enable token holders to propose and vote on changes (governance privileges) to functionalities and feature sets of the wallet and node services, but will also create a self-sustaining token economic model where value will be generated by providing access to finance and identity in the decentralised digital&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://getsafle.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/getsafle">GitHub</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/aj9YRCfh26">Discord</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetSafle">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://instagram.com/getsafle">Instagram</a> | <a href="http://t.me/safleann">Telegram Ann</a> | <a href="http://t.me/saflechat">Telegram&nbsp;Chat</a></p>

<p>Digital identity thought leader Kim Cameron´s passion for fundamentally influencing the way we think about, and deal with privacy and digital identity, has brought us where we are today and will endure forever. On 30th November, 2021, Kim passed away after his courageous battle with cancer. We will continue to honor him by living by his ideals that he expressed back in 2005 with his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of identity</a>.</p>
<p>User Control and Consent, Minimal Disclosure for a Constrained Use, Justifiable Parties, Directed Identity, Pluralism of Technologies, Human Integration, Consistent Experience across Contexts -&nbsp; Kim injected his 7 laws of identity into Microsoft´s DNA as their Chief Architect of Identity at a time, when Microsoft was still&nbsp; “under the dark influence of Privacy is Dead”, and transformed that “big complicated place”, as he called it, into a modern and forward-thinking, privacy driven company that is respectful of the rights of individuals and organizations, and has become a strong contributor to the Identity Standards Community.</p>
<p>In his last two years at Microsoft, Kim paved its way into supporting Decentralized Identity as a new and sustainable way to balance privacy and state-of-the-art security. Gaining back more control over his time after leaving Microsoft in 2019, his interest in digital identity was “as keen as ever,” he wrote in an <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/">August 2020 blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Kim attended nearly all the European Identity Conferences (EIC), from the very first one back in 2007, to 2019 and inspired us with his visionary, content-rich yet entertaining keynote talks and panel sessions. Have a look at his 2019 talk about privacy in the platform economy (“<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2019_14_09_cameron">Turning the Web Right Side Up</a>”), his 2018 talk on the “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2018_06_cameron">7 Laws of Identity on the Blockchain</a>”, his visionary “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic15_keynote_cameron">Identity Services 2020</a>” talk at EIC 2015, where he also reflected on 15 years of working together with Jackson Shaw in the same company and cited Berthold Brecht saying “Because things are the way they are, things won´t stay the way they are.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all will miss you so much, Kim. Diving with your wife Adele, you and so many friends into the cultural life of Munich while we were there for EIC, enjoying Ingo Maurer´s Light Design Showroom and some delicious Italian food. Farewell, Kim, thank you for your guidance and advice. And thank you for being a friend.</p>

<p>Why offering multiple identity verification options can become a competitive advantage.</p>



<p><a></a>Like everything in life, there is rarely ever one solution that fits all. The same applies to identity verification. Even though automated solutions might offer your customers a fast and convenient way to get verified, some still prefer – or need – human guidance. This gap can be fulfilled with semi-automated processes such as video-based solutions.</p>



<p>Video-based solutions have been used for almost a decade in countries such as Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. Until very recently, this solution was the only accepted way to perform electronic identity verification for customer onboarding as it provides a higher level of assurance; according to some regulators, it is equivalent to face-to-face verification. Even though automated solutions are becoming available in some of these countries with strict regulations, video-based solutions are still widely used because of their ease of use as well as its efficiency to combat different types of fraud.</p>



<p>Providing options to customers not only protects the financial institution from fraud, but it can also improve customer engagement and conversion rates. It will ensure that the customer does not step away if they cannot go through the process with the primary method of verification, which converts into conversion rates. It will save time from customer success teams having to go into eternal email chains with customers. Most importantly, this will help businesses to demonstrate their efforts to become more inclusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow recognises the challenges of having only one method of identity verification. For this reason, IDnow has built a nimble identity verification platform that enables its customer to fulfil their regulatory requirements, combat fraud effectively and increase its conversion rates. All of the verification solutions are available in one joined platform, with one single API integration. </p>



<p>Want to learn more? Listen and watch (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">Webinar: The evolution of ID verification</a>) our IDnow experts discussing IDnow’s journey from a pure Video-based ID Verification player towards a multi-solution platform provider.</p>



 The right method for each customer and for your business. 



<p>Offering multiple identity verification options provides benefits to both customers and businesses.</p>



<p>On one hand, there might be some customers that for any reason cannot get approved. They might not be tech-savvy or perhaps have other learning disabilities which impedes them to complete the automated verification process. By providing alternative ways to verify themselves makes the process more inclusive and enables more customers to successfully complete the process. Customers feel more comfortable and in control and will also build trust in the institution.</p>



<p>Alternative methods of verification can also be valuable for businesses as the level of assurance can be increased and can help to prevent fraud. For example, a video-based verification can provide a more robust verification compared to an automated solution, as it can prevent more sophisticated fraudulent attacks like money mulling or social engineering attacks. IDnow’s identity platform offers multiple solutions to verify the identity of individuals. Below we present two of these main solutions, VideoIdent and AutoIdent, which can help to start providing the benefits to organisations and we dig into how each of them can serve different customer segments.</p>



<p></p>



 







 <a></a>AutoIdent for a fast and reliable onboarding process. 



<p>I<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">Dnow AutoIdent</a> offers a state-of-the-art automated identity verification leveraging modern AI and machine learning technology. Automated identity verification allows customers to identify themselves on their own, anywhere, anytime, and within just a few minutes.</p>



<p>Because of the automated and self-service onboarding approach, AutoIdent offers high convenience and conversion rates. The convenient user experience and ease of use, makes it popular with young and tech-savvy customers. Especially, customers who have used digital identity verification solutions before are looking for the fastest way to identify themselves.</p>



<p>AutoIdent supports identity documents from 195 countries and is available in over 30 languages. Additionally, more and more regulators are approving automated identity verification methods for due diligence purposes. This enables businesses to onboard customers in a variety of markets.</p>



 



<p></p>







 <a></a>Building a more exclusive and inclusive process with VideoIdent. 



<p>Even though today we live in a digital-first world, some individuals are still seeking personal customer service. That’s where VideoIdent shines. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">IDnow VideoIdent</a> offers customers a video-chat-based process, that is guided by one of our many Ident Specialists. VideoIdent not only provides a very tailored experience to customers, but also allows to better serve the elderly and less technology, affine individuals, making the process more inclusive.</p>



<p>With IDnow, you benefit from 15 Ident Centres with hundreds of identity verification and fraud prevention specialists. All of IDnow’s Ident and data centres are located within the European Union to ensure a high level of data protection. Let your customers enjoy multi-language support and 24/7 service availability.</p>



 <a></a><a></a>Optimise your conversion rates and save money with a fallback option. 



<p>Offering a selection of identity verification methods especially comes in handy when a customer is having issues with one of them. In these scenarios, it’s good to have an alternative solution as a fallback option.</p>



<p>For example, a customer might go through the onboarding journey with an automated identity verification method. However, the customer might struggle to navigate the process, and after a few attempts, they are not able to complete it. This can bring two consequences to the organisation: (1) the customer decides to contact the customer service team and ask for their assistance (2) lose the customer as they’ve given up completely.</p>



<p>None of the above consequences are ideal. The first one can represent a huge effort and cost for the organisation as they would require a dedicated team to solve these issues for customers. This can also be a lengthy process as instead of only taking a few minutes to get verified, it might now take days or weeks to be solved – another frustrating point for customers which might lead them to abandon the process.</p>



<p>Having a fallback option like VideoIdent provides instant guidance to customers and can save the organisation’s customer service team valuable time which could be used for other activities. Most importantly, providing options will ensure that customers go through one way of verification or another in only minutes, maximising the overall conversion rate and minimising the cost of verification.</p>

   Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are unique identifiers that enable entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.  Within the SSI community, there are many known DID methods, but most of them require you to have a digital identity wallet 🔒, where you will keep a seed (private key)&nbsp;🔑.

Furthermore, they have to go through the registration process, which will not be intuitive at all&nbsp;times.</p> Nature of Implementation <p>The other shortcoming from an implementation perspective is that issuers can’t issue a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credential (VC)</a> without knowing the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">holder’s DID</a>, which until now, was stored only in a digital wallet. In other words, VCs can’t be issued without a&nbsp;wallet!</p><p>In short, digital wallets are not for everyone, still, they are an essential part of the VC issuance and storage&nbsp;process.</p><p>To enable everyone to get on the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0">Web 3.0</a> bandwagon, we at Affinidi, decided to use some easy options that don’t require a digital wallet to store a&nbsp;DID.</p> Implementing DID Without a&nbsp;Wallet <p>Before we go into how you can use a DID without a wallet, let’s quickly understand why we need a private key in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>The simple answer — to prove that you are the owner (holder) of the digital asset (Verifiable Credentials) in question.</p><p>So, how can you prove that you’re the owner without a private&nbsp;key?</p><p>Well, you would&nbsp;need</p>  A unique id for your digital assets&nbsp;(<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a>).  Proof that you are the owner of that unique&nbsp;id.  <p>And how can you do&nbsp;both?</p><p>With two DID methods — did:email ✉️ and did:phone 📞</p><p>Since both email and phone numbers are currently being used in web 2.0 for authentication, it is a simple way to prove that you are the owner of a VC that has a unique DID. You will get an OTP(One Time Password, which mostly is just random characters) on your email/phone, and sending it back will prove your ownership.</p><p>Also, you will have the DID and will be able to get digital assets with this&nbsp;DID.</p> Advantages of DID&nbsp;Methods <p>The biggest advantage of this method is that it is universal and straightforward and provides the same experience for users as Web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>The other advantage is that users don’t have to install any additional software and this can work well for users of all technical knowledge and experience.</p><p>Also, issuers (service providers) can issue <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> to their existing clients (holders) without workarounds on how to get their holders’&nbsp;DID.</p> Limitations of DID&nbsp;Methods <p>Of course, these DID methods have some limitations as well. The most important is that the holder has to reveal his or her email/phone number to strangers, and this could be a spot of bother from a privacy standpoint.</p><p>Overall though, these methods are a great alternative to digital wallets and can be a good starting point for newcomers to embrace the world of VCs and web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>To know about more such interesting things that we do at Affinidi, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>, join our <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">mailing list</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>.</p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

  <p>Kubernetes has become an unavoidable part of a software infrastructure these days. If you are an enterprise or medium/large company, chances are you are already running Kubernetes clusters for your workloads. If you are a DevOps engineer, there is a good chance you are maintaining either an on-prem Kubernetes cluster or a PaaS like Amazon EKS, Microsoft AKS, or GKE. But regardless of how you run your Kubernetes clusters, you need to make sure that they are secure.</p>

<p>The Kubernetes API server has multiple layers of security.</p>

 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/controlling-access/">Transport security</a>: All API communication is done via TLS (transport layer security) using valid certificates. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/">Authentication</a>: All API requests are authenticated with one of the several authentication mechanisms supported by Kubernetes. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/">Authorization</a>: All authenticated requests are authorized using one or more of the supported authorization models. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/">Admission control</a>: All authorized requests, except read/get requests, are validated by admission control modules. 
 

<p>Kubernetes comes with many security options out of the box, but to bulletproof your infrastructure, you need to consider many more security best practices. Today we will look into some of the vital security best practices for Kubernetes.</p>

 1. Use Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 

<p>Kubernetes supports multiple authorization models for its API server. These are <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/abac/">ABAC (Attributed-Based Access Control)</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/node/">Node authorization</a> and the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/">Webhook mode</a>. Out of all these, RBAC is the more secure and most widely used and is ideal for enterprises and medium to large organizations. With RBAC, you can define role-based access control that closely resembles your organization’s business rules. RBAC also works great with OIDC authentication.</p>

<p>Most Kubernetes distributions have RBAC enabled by default. You can check this by running the command <code>kubectl cluster-info dump | grep authorization-mode</code>, which should have <code>authorization-mode=RBAC</code> in the output. If not, you can enable it using the <code>--authorization-mode</code> flag for the API server when creating or patching the cluster. For example, setting <code>--authorization-mode=RBAC,Node</code> will enable both RBAC and Node authorization on the cluster.</p>

<p>Once RBAC is enabled, you can create roles (<code>Role</code>/<code>ClusterRole</code>) and bindings (<code>RoleBinding</code>/<code>ClusterRoleBinding</code>) to control access to your resources. Here is an example of a role and role binding that lets users view pods and services.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: fancy-namespace
  name: pod-service-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods", "services]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
</code>   

<p>The below binds the above role to a specific group of users.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods-services
  namespace: fancy-namespace
roleRef:
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-service-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects: # subject can be individual users or a group of users. Group is defined in the external authentication service, in this case, an OIDC server
  - kind: Group
    name: k8s-restricted-users
</code>   

 2. Secure the API server with OpenID Connect 

<p>Kubernetes supports many authentication mechanisms. Some of the most common are:</p>

 
   Client certificates 
   Basic authentication 
   Tokens (Service account tokens, Bearer tokens, and so on) 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a> 
   Proxy 
 

<p>Out of all these authentication mechanisms, OIDC is the most secure and scalable solution. It is ideal for clusters accessed by large teams as it provides a single sign-on solution for all users and makes it easy to onboard and offboard users. It is also way more secure than other mechanisms as you don’t have to store any sensitive information on a user’s computer, like client secrets and passwords. You can also use features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">MFA</a> and Yubikey if supported by your OIDC provider.</p>

<p></p>

<p>OIDC combined with RBAC becomes necessary as more and more people start accessing the cluster. It becomes essential to create groups and roles and provide limited access to specific groups. You can read more about this in my previous post <a>How to Secure Your Kubernetes Cluster with OpenID Connect and RBAC</a>.</p>

 3. Use Secrets for all sensitive data with appropriate access 

<p>This one should be a no-brainer. Kubernetes has a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret">Secret</a> resource that can be used to store sensitive data. This is a great way to store passwords, keys, and other sensitive data. Secrets can be used for storing string data, docker config, certificates, tokens, files, and so on. Secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables to be used in containers. Secrets can be plain text or encoded, but please don’t be that person who uses plain text secrets.</p>

<p>Secrets are flexible and native to Kubernetes, so there is no reason for you not to use them. Also, make sure to implement proper RBAC for secrets so that not everyone has access to them.</p>

 4. Keep Kubernetes version up to date 

<p>Like any other software, Kubernetes also has bugs and issues. And from time to time, there might be a high severity bug that calls for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVE</a>. Hence, it’s an excellent idea to keep the Kubernetes version up to date on the server and the CLI client. You can check the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/security/">Kubernetes security and disclosure information website</a> to see if there are known security vulnerabilities for your Kubernetes version. If you are using a managed PaaS, it should be pretty easy to upgrade, and for on-prem installations, there are tools like <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kOps</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/">kubeadm</a>, and so on, that makes it easy to upgrade clusters.</p>

 5. Restrict kubelet, API, and SSH access 

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/">kubelet</a> is the primary “node agent” running on each node, and by default, a kubelet’s HTTP endpoints are not secured. This could allow unintended access and hence <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-authentication-authorization/">should be restricted</a>.</p>

<p>When someone has access to a Kubernetes cluster, they can access the k8s API server and SSH into the cluster nodes themselves. To limit node access, cluster access should be limited as much as possible. Disable SSH access for non-admin users. Secure the API server using OIDC and RBAC, as we saw earlier, so that only authenticated users with sufficient roles can access the API.</p>

 6. Secure container images 

<p>Securing the container images that run on the cluster is as important as securing the cluster itself. A malicious image running on a cluster could wreak havoc. Follow these best practices for container image security.</p>

 
   Do not run containers as root as this would give the container unlimited access to the host. Always run the containers using a non-root user. 
   Enable container image scanning in your CI/CD phase to catch known vulnerabilities using tools like <a href="https://github.com/quay/clair">clair</a> or <a href="https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine">Anchore</a>. 
   Use minimal up-to-date official base images and remove all unwanted dependencies, packages, and debugging tools from the image as it will make it more secure and lightweight. 
   Prevent loading unwanted kernel modules in the containers. These can be restricted using rules in <code>/etc/modprobe.d/kubernetes-blacklist.conf</code> of the node or by uninstalling the unwanted modules from the node. 
   Use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/">official verified images</a> for popular software. Use a trusted registry for non-official images and always verify the image publisher 
   Use <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security">Docker Bench for Security</a> to audit your container images 
   Use <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/">Pod security policies</a> to limit a container’s access to the host further 
 

<p>You can read more about it in our “<a>Container Security: A Developer Guide</a>”.</p>

 7. Control traffic between pods and clusters 

<p>Generally, pods within the same cluster will be able to communicate with each other, and if you have multiple clusters in the same network, there may be traffic between them as well. Do not leave this all open, as it could lead to a compromised cluster when another in the network is affected. Use <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/">Kubernetes network policies</a> to control traffic between pods and clusters and allow only necessary traffic.</p>

 8. Use namespaces to isolate workloads 

<p>Do not run all your workloads in a single namespace. Isolating workloads in different namespaces based on business needs is more secure and easier to manage with RBAC. This way, you can fine-tune RBAC even further to let users access only what they need to see. You can also use Kubernetes network policies to isolate traffic between namespaces where applicable.</p>

 9. Limit resource usages 

<p>As with securing APIs and the cluster itself, it is also essential to set resource limits on how much CPU, memory, and persistent disk space is used by namespaces and resources. This secures your cluster from denial of service attacks when a particular container uses up all the resources. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/">Resources quotas</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/memory-default-namespace/">limit ranges</a> can be used to set limits at the namespace level, and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/">Requests and limits</a> can be used to set resource limits at container level as well.</p>

 10. Use monitoring tools to monitor all traffic and enable audit logging 

<p>Finally, it is also extremely important to monitor and audit your clusters. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/">Enable audit logging for the cluster</a> and use monitoring tools to keep an eye on the networking traffic to, from and within a cluster. Monitoring can be done using open-source tools, like Prometheus, Grafana, or with proprietary tools.</p>

 Bonus 

<p>Furthermore, keep these infrastructure best practices also in mind when securing your Kubernetes cluster.</p>

 
   Ensure that all communication is done via TLS. 
   Protect etcd with TLS, Firewall, and Encryption and restrict access to it using strong credentials. 
   Set up IAM access policies in a supported environment like a PaaS. 
   <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2021/08/20/how-to-secure-your-kubernetes-control-plane-and-node-components/">Secure the Kubernetes Control Plane</a>. 
   Rotate infrastructure credentials frequently. 
   Restrict cloud metadata API access when running in a PaaS like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining. And today, we’ll hear insights from the world of hackers. Of course, ethical hacking is what we’re talking about. And we have a very special guest with Linus Kvarnhammar. Linus is an independent cybersecurity consultant and professional hacker. He’s also one of the hackers in the TV series Hackad on the Swedish TV SVT. He has more than 20 years of experience working in the IT industry, where the last 10 years have been spent exclusively doing penetration tests of applications and networks with a few social engineering assignments every now and then.</p>
<p>Hello, Linus.</p>
<p>Linus Kvarnhammar: Hello.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very welcome. It’s nice being with you, Linus. And well, good to hear more about the interesting work you are doing there. So…</p>
<p>Linus: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please tell us a bit more about yourself and how was your journey to this world of cybersecurity and hackers.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah. I- the last 10 years or so, I’ve been doing penetration testing as a security consultant. And yeah, my interest in computers started when I got my Commodore 64, I think it was 1987. And then I had an Amiga. And then I started working with computers directly after school and I’ve been doing that since. I also spent some time, some years doing development work, being a .NET programmer. So a quick bit about my background.</p>
<p>Oscar: You also worked as a developer at some point?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, yeah. I think my background as a developer, and an IT pro back in the early days, was a good way of getting into security. Because I think, for me, cybersecurity is about knowing how a computer system works and trying to break it, right. So if you know how the application is built, and if you know how operating systems and networks work, then I think you have a good chance of being good at cybersecurity, I think.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And I can imagine if you have had, since a child you had a computer at home, not many of the ones who are listening to this had that. And yeah, I’m sure you understand. You have time to understand quite well how the computer works exactly as you said and also in your perspective as a developer. So when you were, for instance, a developer, during time you were a developer, you had also this interest in trying to find the vulnerabilities or something that doesn’t work well, you had already this curiosity?</p>
<p>Linus: No, I don’t… Nah, not really, actually. I think I was mostly focused on – focusing on like writing good code for new and upcoming cool technologies. So I didn’t really… I wasn’t really that interested in security when I was a developer, actually. So it was first when I actually got a job at a security company doing development work. So there, as one of the few developers or maybe the only one, I saw what the security consultants were doing. I thought it was really cool that they could like break into systems and networks. It’s like being a thief, but being authorised to make burglaries, but in the cyber domain, I think it was really cool. And so I transitioned to that.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, OK, that’s… yeah, that’s how you found this path. Fantastic. You have just said you have been working at least the last 10 years in penetration testing and these kind of activities. And you recently, you will tell us more, recently you have started to appear in a TV series called Hackad in the Swedish TV, please tell us a bit about that, especially how, yeah, how you were chosen, or, yeah.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, the TV series firstly is six episodes, and it’s broadcast on the Swedish Public Service television. And it can actually be viewed all over the world. But it’s in Swedish obviously. It’s six episodes with various themes, like private people, celebrities, companies, the smart home, etc. In each episode, we’re hacking different things, and showing what we’re doing and a lot of social engineering as well.</p>
<p>And I was approached by SVT, like maybe a year ago or a year before we started recording. And it was – we started, we recorded a pilot in December last year. And then we recorded the TV series in February, March. And a year approximately before that, I was approached by a person who was like working on developing the programme idea, and he got my name from another security consultant. And I, in turn, gave a few other names of security consultants that I knew were good at their jobs.</p>
<p>And in the beginning, the idea was that they were going to make a TV series about integrity and privacy and big data. So like Facebook, Google, what do they know about us, kind of thing. But me and a lot of other security consultants, I think told them that we can hack stuff. That’s what we do. And that’s pretty cool as well. I think they turned their attention or the focus of the TV series more, or not more, completely towards hacking things, both hacking private people and hacking companies.</p>
<p>In the pilot in December, we didn’t get any preparation, we were three people. And we showed up at a hotel and they said, “Hack this hotel.” And we went at it. We opened doors to try to find network connections, we attacked the WiFi, we did everything we could, but then eventually, we realised that this hotel is just one computer in the lobby, and the rest of the building is like a shared office space. So we failed miserably. But actually, for some reason, the pilot was, it turned out well anyway. And the managers at SVT they decided they wanted it so they ordered it and the production started two months later.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds super cool. And definitely, I watched some of the – some of the episode even though I don’t understand Swedish, but yes, it looked great, very interesting.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, actually, Jinny, one of the hackers in the TV series, she did an awesome job at actually translating all the episodes. So you can find <a href="https://hackad-english.blogspot.com/2021/11/hackad-tv-2021-english-subtitles.html">English subtitles</a> for the episodes out there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, it’s already…</p>
<p>Linus: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow. I have to come back and watch then.</p>
<p>Linus: I can provide you with <a href="https://hackad-english.blogspot.com/2021/11/hackad-tv-2021-english-subtitles.html">the link</a> where you can actually watch the streaming – but streaming from SVT and then adding English subtitles on top of it, it’s possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, perfect. We’re going to share that information so everybody can watch them. Fantastic. All right, excellent. And, as you say, at least in this series, it’s super visual when someone says OK, you can hack a person, it’s a celebrity, big profile company, can have machines, particularly machines, and yeah, it’s super wide how you can be hacked. Let’s bring the attention a bit on identity, which is the main thing we talked about in this podcast. We know that identity is, of course, quite connected to security. What do you think are the biggest problems related to identity that you find or you have been finding through your work as a security consultant?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, there are obviously a lot of technical issues that can be connected to identity authentication more. But on a higher-level identity I’m thinking, a thing I have been talking with clients about recently is this issue of government issued identification – because when you log into a generic application, you can usually say, you can provide whatever identity. You can make up your name, you can make up your– you can register any Gmail or any email address. But what about these applications where you need to prove your real identity, like public service applications?</p>
<p>I think that’s something I don’t think we’ve solved in our business like, is it… what/ how do we identify to as like me with my social security number to an application? In Sweden, we have something called mobile BankID. In other countries, they have similar but is that something we can require or expect every user to have? I think that’s a problem. I’m not sure it’s the biggest problem we have but it is a problem. Because some people might say that, “Well, my mobile BankID that’s my private ID and I don’t want to share that with my employer, for instance.</p>
<p>That’s probably something that needs to be solved. Like, we have a standard way of identifying a person in real life – passport, driver’s license, national identity card. But as far as I’m aware, we don’t have one that is universally accepted both by the individual and companies. Do you have any take on that?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s true. As you said, in Sweden there is a solution, I think it works pretty well. In a few other countries there’s something similar. But yeah, in the vast majority of countries, there’s no – first of all, there’s no global, as you say, there’s not something universal. And such solutions as the Swedish BankID is not present in most countries.</p>
<p>Linus: Exactly. And I was talking to a customer yesterday about like drivers in a company and the drivers, like kind of taxi drivers, they need to prove their identity when they start the car, or start like a device inside the car. And the best way of proving their identity would be mobile BankID. But then the question comes up, like can we really require that everyone has a mobile BankID, which is a personal identification? I’m not sure. And I guess that’s more of a legal aspect, I guess, than cybersecurity. But it is interesting nonetheless.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it is a good question definitely. Do some places, like as you give this concrete example of a driver authenticating so to say, to a car? Yes. What is a reasonable way?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. Because if you don’t use that kind of identification, let’s say you use a regular login, register and login like you do online, then you would have drivers running around with nicknames as authentication. Or, if it’s username and password, yeah, what makes it not the case that you share your username and password with another driver. So, as far as the public authority is concerned, one guy is driving, but actually it was another guy. So he may be his subcontractor that’s driving – his contract to another guy, and he just shared his login.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, yeah, actually that’s a very good observation, because in some of those cases, like driving a taxi or a bus, yeah, there should be more security into how the personnel identifies himself there.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. Imagine if the real bus driver was sitting at home watching TV, and then his brother, who wasn’t a bus driver, he was logging into the bus and driving it around. That wouldn’t be very good from a public safety standpoint.</p>
<p>And I guess these challenges are coming more and more as we have digitalising society more and more. Because if now, this is a fictitious example, but when you get your bus in the old way, or probably the current way, then you go somewhere, and you maybe show your ID at the gate, and you get your key, and then you sit down in the bus. But let’s say you digitalise all that, then you need government-issued or government approved digital identification to prove your identity. And then we have BankID, but can we expect everyone to use that? Or is that perhaps not legal? I’m not sure. I think it’s an interesting question. That would be more important as we go further into the digitalisation of the society.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah it is. Yeah. So what else have you found related to identity on those activities? Obviously, I know that in the TV series already, you are hacking some person’s identity for instance, right? So what is typical? What situation is typical to find?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, I would… if you have only a password, so if you divide up like, it’s interesting to think of passwords as something you know, like a phone, something you have, and then your eye or your fingerprint as something you are. Let’s say you only have one factor, the password. Then we have a long list of different issues that can occur. And one of the most common ones that we abuse in the TV series is that users typically share passwords or use the same password on many sites. And then it’s enough that one of those sites is hacked and the database leaks. So I have terabyte of leaked databases on my computer, which I can search.</p>
<p>So that’s one of the first and most easy ways to do if you want to get into someone’s account, you search for their email address, and see what password they’ve been using previously, in other applications, and you try out those, that’s one.</p>
<p>Another one is that if I give my password to you, or to your application, then you have the password. And then if I share that password with another site, then you, with your application, can know my password and try it on other applications. That’s also I mean, a fundamental issue.</p>
<p>And then you have everything with password resets and password policies, there are loads of technical security issues that you can find. And it’s in applications that we penetration test. I think it’s our job to push the clients or we’d like to push them to increase security. So we often like add requirements as time progresses, up the requirement on password length, for instance.</p>
<p>But then, with multi-factor authentication, it’s interesting as well, because I think a lot of people think that if I have two-factor authentication, I have my SMS codes, for instance, I’m fine. Nothing can happen. Well, I think it’s, you’re way much better off compared to someone who doesn’t have it. But when it comes to the security of the application, then it becomes really important to secure this session. Because if you’re – once you are authenticated, there’s something proving that you continuously can access the application right – and that’s typically a session cookie or JWT token. And if someone can steal that, they have stolen your login without you actually giving up your password and the two-factor authentication code.</p>
<p>A good example of that I did an assessment years back of a medical application for the everyday person in the society. And they were logging on with BankID. So that worked really solid well. But then they had a vulnerability in the web application that disclosed the error log. And then the error log were errors from all the other users. And in the error log was also their session cookie. So if I looked at their log, and waited for another user to trigger some error in the application, their session cookie would be logged, and I could see it. And then I could take that cookie, put it into my browser, and boom! Now I’m logged in as them.</p>
<p>See, I think it’s a good example of how you think a web application that requires mobile BankID is like 100% secure, but it’s actually not if it has these kinds of vulnerabilities. So there are a lot of things to test with regards to session management, like cookies and stuff like that, where it can go wrong.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s on the application side, right, the application that is right after you authenticate.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and I’ve found vulnerabilities around 2FA, two-factor authentication as well, like, let’s say you implement it, and it’s working perfectly. It’s just that when you guess, or when you enter your 2FA code, you can do it unlimited amount of times. And often the 2-factor code is four to six digits and if you can guess that in a high speed, and there will never be anything that prevents you from guessing further, you can potentially guess the right code.</p>
<p>Oscar: So you have you have done that. You have managed to…</p>
<p>Linus: I have done that. Yes. Yes, absolutely. And also backup codes – so sometimes you have two-factor authentication code, but then you have a backup code in case you lose your device and you are supposed to write down the backup code. If the backup code, that basically becomes a password. So it must be strong enough to stand against, I guess. But I’ve seen backup codes that are weak. So if they’re weak enough for you to be able to guess it, and perhaps you can guess indefinitely, and as long as you don’t have an application that detects this – detects and/or blocks, then maybe I can guess for weeks. That’s some examples of technical vulnerabilities that can affect I mean, high security authentication mechanisms. I mean, seemingly high as in two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So you were able to hack most of two-factor authentication methods.</p>
<p>Linus: Not most, not most. Some, some only.</p>
<p>Oscar: The weakest ones. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: &nbsp;Like, for instance, ah, typical is the SMS OTP?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: &nbsp;Yeah, that’s one of the weakest, yeah. Just guessing and guessing and you find out the…</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. If you’ve not implemented it properly in the backend, I mean, in the application. And obviously, a problem with two-factor authentication via SMS is also that the code is actually displayed on the locked phone, typically.</p>
<p>Let’s say you and me work in the same office and I’ve searched database dumps online and found your password in one of them and I try it out and I get confirmation that the password works, but you have two-factor authentication connected to your phone, then probably I’ll just wait until you leave your phone. And most people don’t leave their phone. But if you leave your phone to go to the toilet or something, I can login and just look at your phone, enter the code into the web application and get in.</p>
<p>Oscar: The phone is locked but it shows them, yeah.</p>
<p>Linus: Exactly. Yeah, it shows at least the first line of the SMS, it will typically show.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, very, very interesting, of course.</p>
<p>Linus: And I guess you probably talked or maybe you talked about SIM swapping attack. Have you done that?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, tell us more if – what you have found out.</p>
<p>Linus: That’s another problem with SMS as a two – second factor is, you’re basically relying on your cell phone provider to not give anyone else your phone number. So you’ve outsourced your security to your mobile phone provider. So if someone and this has been done, it’s been written about online. If someone managed to go to the phone store and convinced them or over the phone, convinced them that they are you, get a new SIM card for your phone number, then for a brief period of time until you notice it, they will have access to your phone number. But during that window, they can log in as you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Linus: And it could be even the case that if you do issue a password reset, some applications will have a password reset functionality that only requires the user to have the phone available. So in that case, you don’t even need the password. You just have to do a password reset and confirm that you know you have the right number and then you’re in. That makes other types of two-factor solutions like a mobile app much, much better.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how often still this SIM swapping done nowadays?</p>
<p>Linus: I’m not so sure about that. I don’t have any updated data or news on that. It was long time since I heard about it. But it is, I mean, the principle is that you’re relying on your mobile phone provider. So it’s – in that sense, it will always be a viable attack. It will always be dependent upon them keeping your phone number secure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it is definitely. And this is where mostly the attack is with the social engineering, correct?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, I would say so. But it’s not unreasonable in more sophisticated scenarios that you have an insider. So, if you look at these mobile phone shops, it’s typically young people that work there, they probably don’t have that much pay, so if you go to them, one of them, maybe take the one who’s mostly the least moral and the biggest amount of cash need, and you give them 1,000 Euro, maybe 10,000 Euro, I don’t know, they might be able to issue you on a new SIM card for that number.</p>
<p>And then that’s the cost of getting into that account. So if you have – if you consider you as, I mean, if you value your security high, maybe you are a person with additional requirements for some reason, or security, maybe this should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see that’s still a big threat. Yeah, absolutely, I guess.</p>
<p>Linus: I would expect the future to show us more cases of buying insider access and stuff like that, especially ransomware gangs, nowadays, they have so much money. So it’s not unreasonable for them to pay these kinds of amounts, I think for insider access.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Well, especially like a big target, right? Not unlike like a normal person but yeah, the big target.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. But let’s say you work at a big company, but you’re a regular person. If it’s enough to take over your account to get VPN access into this big company, that can then be ransomwared, then you are actually a pretty normal person. But your access is worth a lot to a ransomware gang.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So they gave a bigger target than the company that we get. Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Linus: It’s like, sometimes, you say you can hear people saying I think it’s valid, like the, one of the best key chains to get hold of is the cleaner in an office because he can access everything. I mean, if you want to pay someone to do something for you, he has access to everything. And he’s walking around the office space when everyone is not there. So it’s him or her as a person. It’s not a high value target but the access they have is high value.</p>
<p>Oscar: Something I remember now when we had a chat with you a few weeks ago before this interview is that, you show us on the on the TV series, I think you hacked one person, I don’t remember what you hacked exactly – either Facebook or some password. And because of that, thanks to the – well the single sign-on, for instance – by accessing one of these services, you were able to access many other services.</p>
<p>Linus: Yep, that’s right. And that’s – I think that’s episode one where we hack a private person’s Facebook account and then we can show him and the viewers that we had access to, I don’t know, 10, 20 applications, because he was using Facebook to authenticate to these applications.</p>
<p>That’s – I mean, that’s the nice thing with single sign-on, as in a Windows, typical Windows network but it’s also the downside. So in a Windows network, if you get hold of the identity of one person, you get access to all the resources this person has access to. So it’s, yeah, both pros and cons with that.</p>
<p>I understand why people use Google and Facebook to authenticate. And you have a lot of, what do you say, pros with that because you don’t have to manage a bunch of different websites or passwords. I mean, and you only need to trust that Google or Facebook is doing the authentication right. So there is a lot of good things with that. But then you should really keep that password and that account closely guarded. Because if you lose that it’s yeah, you have a lot of problems.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it’s important to be aware of that. So the users see the benefits, the process you said, but also take it – yeah, keep it very secure, especially if it’s a main account, like Google or Facebook could be it’s a gate to other services as well.</p>
<p>In the side of, for instance, this case, we’re talking about authorisation because we are authorising via your access from Google, for instance, to some access to other applications. When you have, for instance, were able to hack some systems, bypass the authentication, have you found that the weaknesses in the authorisation that the systems are not properly configured or even designed to, to define well the authorisation of a user?</p>
<p>Linus: I think that’s one of the most common vulnerabilities we see because it’s complex. It’s typically more complex to get this right than other things. So an application typically has many, many different endpoints to get information, to change information, to add information. And every one of these needs to be configured properly usually in code. Like to access this endpoint, you need to be this role and this role. And it’s easy to miss that, to forget one or more of those, or configure them wrong. Maybe that’s one that should require a more strict role than another one. So I think the complexity there is working against developers. And we often see some mistakes in this area.</p>
<p>Oscar: And the mistakes goes more or both into designing the system and also configuring right, maybe in both, I think.</p>
<p>Linus: I would say it’s mostly implementing it, because when you design it, you can say that, well, the admin page should only be accessed by admins – administrators, for instance. But that requires that every admin action then is implemented such that it will deny a regular user access. So it’s up to the programmers often to do the right work to get this right.</p>
<p>And then it’s good to understand that, at least from my perspective, two main different types of access control mechanisms. It’s on a functional level, like role-based, you should have access to this area and not this. So let’s say you’re a regular user, you should not be able to access the admin page, or admin functionality. And then there’s an object-based, so I should be able to read my messages, not yours. And the latter one is typically the most difficult to get right because it might be that it’s built further down in deeper layers of the application where you need to actually check that the object that you’re trying to read and return is actually belonging to this user. That’s a typical vulnerability we find.</p>
<p>It’s actually something often pretty easy to test for regular people. If you’re browsing the web, and you– or you’re logged in somewhere and you’re maybe reading messages, downloading files, and you see the URL that has a number there, try changing the number to something else. And if you get someone else’s message, then maybe you committed a crime, I’m not sure. But at least you can report it to the company.</p>
<p>I did that for – you can say I can anonymise it a little bit, but privately I got, like I said, I got a certain kind of license, so I interacted with one government page. So I logged in, and I accessed like my test results on this license. And then I could see easily in the URL that there was a number there. So I just changed that number to another number, and I got someone else’s test results. And then I put that into a script. And I downloaded probably like 10,000 test results. And obviously I contacted them, found out who was responsible and told them about this, and they fixed it immediately. And they were really thankful. But it turned out that this database contains test results from I think back to the ‘90s.</p>
<p>Oscar: Did your service to the…</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Oscar: …to the community. Fantastic. Yeah, it’s excellent that the power of people like you that have this amazing technical expertise and can help not only specific companies, but also to everybody like to the whole country, the whole community. Fantastic.</p>
 
 Super interesting hearing your stories and everything we have in here. And please, final question we’d like to ask you is for all business leaders, decision makers who are listening to this, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today? 
 
<p>Linus: Business leaders should be aware of the risks that they are having. So if they are not talking to the IT department, IT manager or CISO, if they are not talking to them, asking them like what risks do we have? Are we doing – are we assessing security? Then they should do that, because otherwise, the risk is that security is something that is handled below like far down in the organisation. And then this need for budget and time and everything that is needed to invest in security is not getting addressed at the top.</p>
<p>So if the leaders asked their subordinates, “Tell me about the risks we are having.” and they – then they need to get these reports. And that’s I think, how you – how it should start, not start but if you know what I mean. I think typically or in many organisations, security is not addressed at the top. So it should be considered an investment in your company, in your solutions, not just a cost.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Yeah, I could not agree more with that. Thanks a lot Linus for this very interesting conversation. It’s been a pleasure. Let me know if people would like to see your work or get in touch with you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Linus: I think <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kvarnhammar/">LinkedIn</a> is the best. That’s where I’m pretty active. I answer messages and yeah, I publish some stuff there every now and then.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great. And of course, do watch the TV series Hackad on the Swedish TV, which I’m going to put the link on this episode. Again, thank you, Linus, what a pleasure talking with you and all the best.</p>
<p>Linus: Thank you very much.</p>

 GiD Report#188 — Square’s web3 identity ambitions <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-186-what-is-web3-155d493ac6c5">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-14-what-we-learned-at-solana-breakpoint-331ce5c0341f">EPISODE 14 — What we learned at Solana Breakpoint</a></p><p>This week:</p>  Square’s web3&nbsp;vision  A world full of credentials  Chart of the week — 90s internet&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. Square’s web3&nbsp;vision <p>First, they <a href="https://tbd54566975.ghost.io/introducing-tbdex/">published a white paper</a>, as per <a href="https://twitter.com/TBD54566975/status/1461791639308050443">their cheeky tweet</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a> and <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><p>The paper was <a href="https://github.com/TBDev-54566975/white-paper">also published to Github</a> (in case you want to contribute).</p><p>For context, TBD is a new division within Square focused on non-custodial and decentralized financial offerings.</p><p>The white paper’s vision is similarly straightforward — essentially a decentralized exchange with built in social trust (AKA identity). From the abstract:</p><blockquote>The tbDEX protocol facilitates decentralized networks of exchange between assets by providing a framework for establishing social trust, utilizing decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to establish the provenance of identity in the real&nbsp;world.</blockquote><p>For the world of self-sovereign identity, Square’s entrance into the arena will be huge when it comes to the promotion of open, interoperable, and privacy preserving standards such as decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.</p><p>As GlobaliD co-founder and CTO Mitja Simcic&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>Most interesting bit is that unlike traditional DEXs, Square doesn’t plan to use a trustless model, like atomic swaps, and instead uses decentralized identity and verifiable credentials</blockquote><p>As <a href="https://tbd54566975.ghost.io/introducing-tbdex/">their blog post explains</a>, this was a natural solution.The real world, both social and economic, is still based on the notion of identity — not merely the ownership of cryptographic keys. In order to build those bridges, building trust and identity into decentralized frameworks is an inherent requirement. There’s also the question of regulations and compliance:</p><blockquote>This means that such exchanges of value must necessarily be based on other means of governing social trust. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) provide part of the solution by enabling verifiable digital identities that facilitate trustworthy exchanges between counterparties. But the main benefits are lost if the DID method is not implemented in an open, permissionless, and censorship resistant manner.</blockquote><blockquote>We propose a solution that does not rely on a federation to control permission or access to the network; nor does it dictate the level of trust required between counterparties. There is no governance token. Instead, the tbDEX protocol allows participants to negotiate trust directly with each other — or mutually and voluntarily rely on trusted third-parties to vouch for the counterparty. Transaction costs are ultimately driven by risk. At maximum anonymity, transaction costs will necessarily be higher; at maximum disclosure, they should be lower. This approach to price discovery allows the marketplace to find the right&nbsp;balance.</blockquote><blockquote>The tbDEX protocol also facilitates the secure exchange of the minimum necessary identity information acceptable to counterparties in order to satisfy requirements, be they legal, regulatory, or related to any other consideration of risk. The protocol itself neither collects nor records any personally identifiable information.</blockquote><p>So there you have&nbsp;it.</p><p>It may or may not have been a coincidence that Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720">resigned as Twitter CEO</a> this morning. We know that ideas of web3 have been percolating in Jack for some time. Back in December of 2019, he <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">announced what would become Bluesky</a>, an initiative to develop a decentralized social media protocol. We haven’t heard much&nbsp;since.</p><p>But dreams of a decentralized future continued. In August, Jack announced their latest plan — <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1431320761474617344">develop a decentralized Bitcoin exchange</a>. This latest white paper is the culmination of that&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://tbd54566975.ghost.io/introducing-tbdex/">introducing tbDEX</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/19/square-releases-white-paper-detailing-protocol-for-a-decentralized-bitcoin-exchange/">Square Releases White Paper Detailing Protocol for a Decentralized Bitcoin&nbsp;Exchange</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/jack-dorsey-step-down-twitter-ceo-4051d42c-567b-468b-917d-11de1d7264f6.html">Jack Dorsey stepping down as Twitter&nbsp;CEO</a>   2. A world full of credentials Image: iStock/gremlin<p>If you build it, they will come. (And we’re thrilled that Square is joining the party when it comes to the building&nbsp;part.)</p><p>Adam Davidson <a href="https://adamd.mirror.xyz/tap-94pfnB_WvMT6W8odoYe5xiMD00WDFNouTytEHN0">illustrates what a web3 identity world might look like</a> when it comes to hiring (or in same cases, already is) — H/T <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-23/american-express-sold-some-tax-deductions">Matt Levine’s excellent Money Stuff</a> (via GlobaliD COO&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a>):</p><blockquote>But resumes are, typically, works of creative aspirational fiction. With web3, people can share tokens showing someone’s crucial role on a project. This happens, now, on DAOs (more on those here), blockchain-based communities. I spend a lot of time at the Bankless DAO, where it is just a routine part of the daily flow for people to send tokens of gratitude to those who have been helpful in some project or other. People who attend meetings, get a POAP, a token of attendance. So, you can see at a glance if someone is an active member or an occasional lurker. Every day, people send “tips” of tokens of gratitude to others. One person giving a particularly helpful colleague a tip often leads to an avalanche of others doing the same. (Come to think of it, I really haven’t gotten a lot of tips. I should up my&nbsp;game.)</blockquote><blockquote>As web3 becomes more ubiquitous (as I expect it to), younger employees will ask their bosses and co-workers and, eventually, demand of them that they implement this kind of in-real-time, collaborative credentialing.</blockquote><blockquote>Similarly, people can build up a collection of immutable tokens showing the conferences they attended, the courses they took, the skills they proved, the books they read, the creators they supported.</blockquote><blockquote>I expect it to become routine — first among younger people in more technical fields — that recruitment will involve looking at someone’s blockchain-backed identity to see a richer picture of the person’s background. If a candidate with an unpromising resume can demonstrate an unusually large number of these Gold Star tokens — in which former bosses and colleagues sent digital expressions of gratitude — from their past, you might overlook the fact that they didn’t, quite, graduate college. Alternatively, if someone with pristine credentials has a dearth of such expressions of gratitude, you might look at them more critically.</blockquote><p>Combining that with token issuance for specific projects:</p><blockquote>If you want to achieve some quick result — design an app, create a conference, build a new kind of bicycle, whatever — that you couldn’t do on your own, you typically have to spend a ton of time and resources NOT doing the thing you care about. You probably need to hire people, which means you need to raise money, which means you need a business plan and have to spend most of your time pitching.&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>With web3, you could announce your goal publicly. People who are interested will reach out. You can quickly see what they’ve done (see above) and choose the team that meets your requirements. You can create a coin or token and distribute it among the team members. You can have a system that grants more of these coins when someone is recognized by the rest of the team for a helpful contribution. Ownership, then, will be dynamic and will reflect real activity.</blockquote><blockquote>When the thing you all are building launches, the profits can be distributed through the coin system, and the people who added the most value will get the most&nbsp;reward.</blockquote><p>As Matt points out, “the potential future [Davidson] describes is both intriguing and also horrifying.”</p><p>Which is par for the course when it comes to technological innovation and tools — it’s always a double edged&nbsp;sword.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://adamd.mirror.xyz/tap-94pfnB_WvMT6W8odoYe5xiMD00WDFNouTytEHN0">Real world problems that web3 could solve — at least for me — Mirror</a>  <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/right-clickers-vs-the-monkey-jpg">Right-clickers vs. the monkey JPG&nbsp;owners</a>  <a href="https://society.robinsloan.com/archive/notes-on-web3/">Notes on&nbsp;Web3</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/web3-blockchain-battle-soul-new-web-7a3515f4-808e-4c17-a93d-439fdfee134c.html">What Web3 is and why everyone is talking about&nbsp;it</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/how-to-explain-web3-to-your-grandma-this-thanksgiving/">How to Explain Web3 to Your Grandma This Thanksgiving — Blockworks</a>   3.

 Introduction: <p>The team at Ocean is thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.neworder.network/">New Order </a>and <a href="https://reflexer.finance/">Reflexer Labs</a> will launch H2O, an $OCEAN backed, non-pegged stable asset. It’s based on the RAI stable asset by Reflexer Labs. Like RAI, it is decentralized, permissionless, and minimizes governance.</p><p>New Order DAO is driving this initiative. They are a community-driven venture DAO incubator for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. H2O will be available on New Order’s DeFi marketplace with strong benefits for the Ocean ecosystem, especially Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> What is&nbsp;H2O? <p>Stable crypto assets help attract would-be users of Web3 applications who have shied away from cryptocurrency due to excessive volatility. They are growing in popularity with their market surging past <a href="https://charts.coinmetrics.io/network-data/#313">$100&nbsp;billion</a>.</p><p>The H2O non-pegged stable asset is a friendly fork of RAI. Whereas RAI uses ether (ETH) as its asset for collateral, H2O uses OCEAN. The price of H2O is managed by an algorithm that rebalances to bring the redemption price close to the market price and participants are incentivized to aid in this process. Traditional stable assets are pegged to a price such as 1 USD. In contrast, RAI (and soon H2O) are free-floating but typically settle around a price; for RAI this has been&nbsp;~$3.</p><p>The (un)governing token of the protocol will be AQUA. This token helps manage the initial parameters of the protocol, bootstrap ecosystem development, and incentivize the liquidity of the protocol. AQUA token emissions will be done fairly, with portions earmarked for the Ocean community.</p><p>The H2O token will bring two near-term benefits to the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>First, OCEAN holders will be able to stake OCEAN in order to mint H2O tokens, similar to how ETH is staked to mint DAI or RAI. The OCEAN stakers can earn based on staking. Second, Ocean Market users are exposed to lower volatility data prices. Ocean Market is a decentralized data market powered by Ocean Protocol, which has been live since fall 2020. In it, people use $OCEAN to buy, sell, and stake in the OCEAN token. This adds liquidity to the Ocean ecosystem whilst generating demand for $OCEAN. With the launch of H2O, Ocean Market (V4) users will be able to price tokens and stake in data pools with H2O. Therefore, data prices do not fluctuate the way they would with changes in the price of $OCEAN. (Users will still have the option to use $OCEAN). This reduces the risk and increases the potential upside for Ocean Market&nbsp;users.</p> H2O Launch and Tokenomics <p>The project is overseen and executed by the New Order DAO which is a new permissionless incubation DAO, generating long-term value by building and launching early-stage financial protocols, applications, tools, and infrastructure. The DAO launches and supports projects across many layer one ecosystems, and explores DeFi &amp; NFT markets surrounding new digital asset&nbsp;classes.</p><p>H2O is currently in the final stages of the initial deployment. Its official mainnet deployment will be lined up with the release of the Ocean V4. Expected to ship in Q1 2022, Ocean V4 includes Data NFTs and resolves rug pull challenges. Then, there will be work for support of H2O in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>The distribution of the AQUA un-governance token is planned to occur over 18 months via staking contracts. This includes 2.45% to single-sided FLX staking, 2.45% to FLX/ETH Uniswap V2 LP, 2.1% to RAI Curve LP (subject to change to Reflexer’s liquidity plans). Some AQUA will be distributed directly to the Ocean community.</p><p>Visit<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/"> oceanprotocol.com</a> to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> |<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a> |<a href="https://blockfolio.com/coin/OCEAN_3"> Blockfolio</a> |<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/"> Blog</a> |<a href="https://www.youtube.com/oceanprotocol"> YouTube</a> |<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/"> Reddit</a> |<a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a> |<a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">&nbsp;Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/stable-asset-h2o-backed-by-ocean-is-launched-by-new-order-together-with-reflexer-labs-91d3a29efb21">Stable asset H2O backed by $OCEAN is launched by New Order together with Reflexer Labs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Building trust within an NFT community is tough. The NFT world is rife with scam stories about bots, rug pulls and bad actors, making it hard for buyers to trust good projects. Even worse, there are only limited tools available to combat these threats.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re proud to present an innovative suite of tools as an end-to-end solution that takes every step of the NFT lifecycle into account, helping creators prove authorship, protect their mints against bots, build more reliable communities, and create members-only experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creators can get started immediately by verifying their identities, pseudonymous-identities, and projects — they may simply go to our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MWmhXauJw8">Discord server</a> to get verified through our new automated Civic Pass portal. With Civic Pass, creators are also able to confirm that participants are legitimate buyers, not bots. And coming soon, creators will also be able to verify that community members in their Discord servers hold certain NFTs in their wallet. This feature will allow creators to offer members-only experiences.</p>



<p>Our goal is to make the process of building trust easier and more effective for creators. With that in mind, we’re sharing an overview of our plan to address the pain points of creators and marketplaces in the NFT space using identity tools.</p>



  
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Build trust: Get verified by Civic</p>



<p>The first step for NFT teams or creators is to get verified with the Verified by Civic Pass program.</p>



<p>Our NFT identity verification process includes biometric liveness checks, KYC and sanctions screening, Twitter handles and ownership of project websites. Once completed, Civic will announce that creators have been fully verified. This helps establish trust with potential buyers and community members. <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/verified-by-civic-pass/">We’ve verified over a dozen projects</a>, and we’ll have more product developments in this area in 2022.</p>
  



  
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Issue your NFT collection: Defeat bots and create member whitelists</p>



<p>Coming soon, Civic Pass will be integrated with Metaplex’s Candy Machine and Fair Launch Protocol (FLP), the leading Solana protocols for minting, to add on-chain real-person verification. <a href="https://docs.civic.com/candy-machine-and-ignite-pass-setup/how-to-protect-nft-mints-from-bots">Civic Pass TokenGuard</a> is fully compatible with Metaplex’s Token Metadata standard, so tokens remain fully compatible with wallets and secondary marketplaces. Creators can use Civic Pass TokenGuard to confirm that mint participants are legitimate buyers, not bots.</p>



<p>Freedom and security shouldn’t just be limited to creators, so Civic is creating a Discord bot to keep the community spaces fair and secure by providing industry-leading whitelisting tools. Our Discord bot will offer a standardized process, including a liveness check, for verifying participants within the Discord community.&nbsp;</p>
  



  
<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Create members-only experiences and gated experiences for DAOs</p>



<p>Soon, we will be enabling gated, members-only experiences with proof of NFT ownership. Using Civic Pass, community members will be able to enter Discord servers by holding certain NFTs in their wallets. And, the same NFT in combination with Civic Pass will enable a related decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to prove that members meet its requirements. With these tools, community members can start shaping communities that feel more meaningful.&nbsp;</p>
  



<p>We are excited to offer these tools to the NFT and DeFi communities because we believe identity verification is vital to safeguarding digital assets as they become more widely adopted.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">Developer Hub</a> is a great place for developers to start integrating Civic’s NFT solutions into their projects.<a href="https://twitter.com/civickey"> </a>And, verifying upcoming NFT drops and mints is <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MWmhXauJw8">easily started on Discord</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-federal-regulators-clarify-joint-approach-to-cryptoasset-regulation" title="">  </a> 
     
<p>🇺🇸&nbsp; US Federal Regulators Clarify Joint Approach to Cryptoasset Regulation</p> 
<p>In early November,<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-fatf-releases-its-revised-virtual-asset-guidance"> we noted</a> that the chairwoman of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Jelena McWilliams, made remarks on cryptoasset regulation and had previewed a collaboration with the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on this issue. On November 23rd, the three regulatory agencies<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2021/pr21096a.pdf"> released a statement</a> outlining their approach and plans to provide greater clarity on banks’ ability to offer crypto-asset related services.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The cross-agency statement details the main focus points of the “policy sprints” it conducted:</p> 
  
   <p>Developing a commonly understood vocabulary using consistent terms regarding the use of crypto-assets by banking organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   
   <p>Identifying and assessing key risks, including those related to safety and soundness, consumer protection, and compliance, and considering legal permissibility related to potential crypto-asset activities conducted by banking organizations.</p>   
   <p>Analyzing the applicability of existing regulations and guidance and identifying areas that may benefit from additional clarification.</p>   
  
<p>Based upon the above activities undertaken during the policy sprints, the agencies have identified five core activities in the cryptoasset space which may be of interest to banks:</p> 
  
   <p>Cryptoasset custody.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   
   <p>Facilitation of customer purchases and sales of cryptoassets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   
   <p>Loans collateralized by cryptoassets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   
   <p>Activities involving payments, including stablecoins.</p>   
   <p>Activities that may result in the holding of crypto-assets on a banking organization’s balance sheet.</p>   
  
<p>Throughout 2022, the agencies will work to give clarity on the legality of banks to provide cryptoasset services to consumers. According to their statement, the Fed, FDIC and OCC are especially interested in considering the regulatory implications of:</p> 
  
   <p>Crypto-asset safekeeping and traditional custody services.</p>   
   <p>Ancillary custody services.</p>   
   <p>Facilitation of customer purchases and sales of crypto-assets.</p>   
   <p>Loans collateralized by crypto-assets.</p>   
   <p>Issuance and distribution of stablecoins.</p>   
   <p>Activities involving the holding of crypto-assets on the balance sheet.</p>   
  
<p>Additionally, the statement indicates that, “The authorities will also evaluate the applicability of capital and liquidity requirements and liaise on this subject with international and intergovernmental organizations.”</p> 
<p>While the joint agency statement falls far short of providing actual regulatory guidance on any of these topics, it offers an important signal about where these agencies will be focusing attention over the coming months. Greater regulatory clarity on these topics will only boost the confidence and ability of banks to harness opportunities in the cryptoasset space, and will further spur banks to accelerate their offerings of related products and services.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In a related move, also on November 18th, the OCC released<a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1179.pdf"> a new interpretive letter</a> clarifying the obligations of banks when launching cryptoasset services. Previously the OCC had clarified in guidance issued during the tenure of former<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/webinars-events/financial-regulator-crypto-coffee-webinar-series-with-brian-brooks-occ"> Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks</a> that banks can provide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1170.pdf">custody services for cryptoassets</a>,<a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf"> hold reserves for stablecoin issuers</a>, and engage in other<a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf"> blockchain and stablecoin-related activities</a>.</p> 
<p>According to its new interpretive letter, the OCC still asserts that banks have the authority to carry out these activities, but with an important caveat: they must now seek and obtain a non-objection letter from bank supervisors before engaging in those activities. As part of that process, according to the OCC, a bank needs to demonstrate “that it has controls in place to conduct the activity in a safe and sound manner . . . including, but not limited to, operational risk (eg, the risks related to new, evolving technologies, the risk of hacking, fraud, and theft, and third party risk management), liquidity risk, strategic risk, and compliance risk (including but not limited to compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering, sanctions requirements, and consumer protection laws).”</p> 
<p>Hence, banks do not have an unfettered green light to engage in cryptoasset activities without regulatory permission,&nbsp; as some may have interpreted the earlier interpretive letters. Rather, they’ve been given more of a flashing amber light: they need to put compliance and risk management considerations front of mind before launching cryptoasset products and services, and need to satisfy their regulators they have done so.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some observers may interpret this new clarification as likely to set back the<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=elliptic+crypto+banking+convergence&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enGB955GB955&amp;oq=elliptic+crypto+banking+convergence&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4.4028j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"> crypto-banking convergence</a> already underway. However, at Elliptic we believe that an emphasis on clarifying compliance and risk management considerations upfront will in fact ultimately nurture greater financial institution adoption of cryptoassets.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Financial institutions are already highly sensitive to regulatory and compliance risks they could encounter in the process of launching cryptoasset services — and a lack of regulatory clarity can sometimes be a hindrance to them doing so. By providing a framework for banks to approach and discuss these issues with their supervisors prior to launching cryptoasset services, the OCC is letting banks know there is a pathway to offering these services in a sound and compliant manner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>🇰🇷South Korean Regulators Expand Cryptoasset Regulation Efforts to Market Manipulation</p> 
<p>Last week,<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-infrastructure-bills-cryptoasset-reporting-requirements-seen-as-overreach"> Elliptic commented</a> on a South Korean legislative proposal to tighten the AML/CFT regime for cryptoasset businesses. On November 23rd 2021, a report from the South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC)<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/25/s-korean-regulators-call-for-criminal-punishments-for-crypto-market-manipulation/"> expanded the authorities’ efforts</a> to regulate the cryptoasset industry by tackling market manipulation.

<p>🇳🇱The Netherlands’ Central Bank Clarifies Sanctions Regulations for Cryptoasset Business</p> 
<p>On November 19th 2021, the Netherlands central bank <a href="https://www.dnb.nl/en/sector-information/supervision-sectors/crypto-service-providers/integrity-supervision-of-crypto-service-providers/sanctions-act-1977/draft-q-a-of-november-19-2021-on-sanctions-screening-for-inbound-and-outbound-crypto-transactions/">released draft guidance</a> on sanctions screening for cryptoasset transactions in the form of a question and answer document. It reminds Dutch businesses that under the Sanctions Act 1977 “the assets of individuals and legal entities on a sanctions list must be frozen and no financial services may be provided to such individuals and legal entities.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To that end, cryptoasset businesses must take measures to identify "anyone involved in a financial service or a financial transaction." This includes screening a transaction, whether inbound or outbound from the business’ perspective, to identify any counterparties and beneficiaries involved. If the identity of a counterparty is unknown then cryptoasset business must, at the minimum, verify that their wallet address is not sanctioned. The regulator states that compliance teams are responsible for putting in place the appropriate measures to complete these checks in accordance with their business model and risk exposure. This is in line with the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf">Financial Action Task Force’s risk-based approach guidance</a> on virtual assets.</p>

<p>🇪🇺 EU Council Adopts Digital Finance Proposals&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On November 24th 2021, the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/11/24/digital-finance-package-council-reaches-agreement-on-mica-and-dora/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Digital+finance+package%3a+Council+reaches+agreement+on+MiCA+and+DORA">Council of the European Union adopted the proposals</a> for the “Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets” (MiCA) and the “Digital Operational Resilience Act’ (DORA). This adoption paves the way for European legislators to negotiate the details of this framework and reach an agreement with the European Parliament. Both proposals are part of the European digital finance package to ensure competitive, innovative and digitally-resilient financial markets. <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11053-2020-INIT/en/pdf">MiCA</a> will create a regulatory framework tailored to cryptoassets and related activities, with sweeping provisions that will impact stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) token issuers, and other emerging technologies in the cryptoasset space. On top of this, the <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11051-2020-INIT/en/pdf">DORA</a> sets new rules on cybersecurity for the financial sector to prevent and mitigate the impact of cyber attacks. Elliptic will provide ongoing regulatory updates on these measures as negotiations begin.</p>

<p>🇪🇺&nbsp; ECB Details Tailored Payment System Oversight Framework for Cryptoassets</p> 
<p>On November 22nd 2021, the European Central Bank (ECB)<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2021/html/ecb.pr211122~381857cdfe.en.html"> approved a new oversight framework to regulate electronic payments</a>. The electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements (PISA) framework is targeted at the governance bodies of electronic payment schemes with the safety and efficiency of payment systems in mind. It supports governance bodies by providing an<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/pdf/consultations/ecb.PISApublicconsultation202111_2.en.pdf"> assessment methodology</a> to define functions and arrangements of the electronic payment ecosystem. The PISA framework includes cryptoassets and related services. The methodology details the applicability of 24 principles ranging from legal basis to liquidity risk. The Eurosystem’s national central banks have the responsibility to implement measures which will meet the framework’s expectations. Companies that fall under the<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/pol/activ/systems/html/index.en.html"> Eurosystem oversight of payment systems</a> are expected to adhere to the PISA principles by November 15th 2022.</p>

<p>This series of blogs is prompted by the UK Government’s proposed reforms of data protection law contained in its consultation paper Data: A New Direction. The stated intention of these proposals is to unleash a new ‘golden age’ of innovation and growth. But the real effect of these reforms would be&nbsp;to:</p>  Under the banner of tackling ‘consent fatigue’, abolish citizens’ right to consent to the collection and use of their data: achieved by expanding the definition of organisations’ ‘legitimate interests’ (where they don’t have to seek consent) to cover almost every activity they would wish to undertake, thereby rendering consent irrelevant.  Under the banner of helping organisations access more data for the purposes of research and innovation, abolish the core principle upon which data protection regulations have been built: that personal data should only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. The Government’s proposals would do this by making ‘further processing’ of citizens’ data legal in so many additional circumstances (‘legitimate interests’, use in ‘research’, for AI, to improve ‘data sharing’, etc) that the core principle is rendered irrelevant.  <p>These proposals represent the biggest attack on citizen rights seen in this country for generations. They would <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/the-uk-governments-plan-to-reform-data-protection-laws-are-terrifying/">make new Cambridge Analyticas legal</a>, and would put UK citizens’ data up for sale in global markets — the stated goal being to “secure the UK’s status as a global hub for the free and responsible flow of personal data” (where ‘responsible’ is never defined in over 50,000 words of argumentation, but where the door is opened to ‘irresponsible’ uses of data many times&nbsp;over).</p><p>This blog series explores the many mistaken assumptions that lie behind this disastrous initiative. The innovation and growth that Government promises its reforms will bring are a fantasy. They will not unleash a new ‘golden age’ they are based on deep misunderstandings of what makes data valuable in the first place and how to unleash this value. This, first, blog in the series looks at why data is valuable.</p> Where data’s value comes&nbsp;from <p>Given all the fuss that’s made about data, you’d think everyone would have an immediate answer to this question. But when you ask it strange things&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Some people immediately go off on a tangent, talking about how much money is being made out of data. But this begs the question: why are people prepared to pay so much for it? Others repeat catchphrases such as ‘data is the new oil’. Very soon people are embroiled in arguments about whether data is, or is not, ‘like oil’ — while the original question gets forgotten.</p><p>But the answer to this question matters, because it will inform all the policies and strategies that follow. If you get it wrong (as the UK Government is currently doing with their proposals to ‘reform’ data protection regulations ) you risk wasting huge amounts of time, money and effort chasing rainbows, while missing the opportunities that really&nbsp;matter.</p> Reliability and&nbsp;Surprise <p>So why is data valuable? Because of two things. Reliability and Surprise.</p><p>Reliability If we know a fact to be true, we can act on it without incurring the risks (and costs) of making a mistake. If the data you are working with is unreliable — if you don’t know if it is true or not — any decisions or actions you take on the basis of it risks being wrong. One of three things then&nbsp;happens.</p>  You don’t dare making the decision or taking the action, in which case lots of things that could happen&nbsp;don’t.  You make a wrong decision or take a wrong action and then have to incur the costs of cleaning up the&nbsp;mess.  You invest significant amounts of time, money and effort trying to improve the reliability of your data (often paying external agencies exorbitant fees to confirm basic facts), so that you avoid the costs and lost opportunities of the first&nbsp;two.  <p>Across the economy today, individuals’ and service providers’ inability to access and use the right, reliable data when and where they need it is a major cause of unnecessary cost and waste, fraud and of missed opportunities.</p><p>This lack of access to the right reliable data has deep structural causes. Usually somebody, somewhere has generated or checked that a piece of information is correct — that is indeed reliable. But because our data economy is currently organisation-centric (that is, organised around hundreds of different, isolated, separate data silos run by different, separate organisations), this data remains inaccessible.</p><p>What’s needed is a new personal data logistics infrastructure which enables individuals to get hold of certified data about themselves (verified attributes) and to share this data, under their control, as and when they need to. If such infrastructure were put in place, everyone would have access to reliable data when they need it, and everyone would be able to eliminate the friction, effort, risk and cost that pile up when it’s not available.</p><p>We estimate that over 95% of all data processing activities undertaken by British services providers in the private, public and third sectors (e.g. banking, insurance, retail, utilities, media and communication, local and central Government public administration, education, health, transportation, leisure, charities, etc) relate to the collection and use of data for the purposes of service provision: primarily administrative activities that depend on the availability of reliable&nbsp;data.</p><p>Yet nowhere in the 50,000-plus words of of the UK Government’s Data: A New Direction consultation does it even come close to recognising this fact. Which means its entire ‘data strategy’ is already missing the most fundamental point.</p> Surprise <p>The second reason why data can be valuable is the opposite of the first: it can surprise you by telling you something you didn’t know. It’s data as ‘surprise’ that helps people and organisations keep abreast of a fast changing&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data as ‘surprise’ is what fuels research and those innovations that are driven by insight into peoples’ behaviours. It’s a great thing. But we have to keep it in perspective. By definition, innovations are exceptions to the rule — the rule being the administration of existing services. And once an innovative product or service has been created to realise its value, it needs to be delivered to people, which requires the reliable data that drives these processes. In this situation, data’s two aspects of reliability and surprise work together, with ‘reliability’ still ensuring the actual delivery of value. For the ‘surprise’ side of data to generate value, the ‘reliability’ aspect is essential.</p><p>That’s why we say that at least 95% of data’s value comes from reliability. But unfortunately, as we’ve noted above, the UK Government’s proposed data protection reforms focus entirely on research and innovation: the 5%. A classic case of the tail wagging the&nbsp;dog.</p> Mixtures of reliability and&nbsp;surprise <p>Even though they are like chalk and cheese, often the biggest value is generated by mixing reliability and surprise. For surprises to be valuable they need to be reliable: fake news can be a very dangerous thing, Some things can be surprisingly reliable as we’ll see when we discuss artificial intelligence in a later&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other things are ‘reliably surprising’: by which we are confronted by new information that changes what we do, but where the sorts of new information and the sorts of changes that result are part of a routine&nbsp;process.</p><p>Take your daily commute to work. You know exactly where you are going, what the route is, how long it should take, and so on. And yet, every journey you make is full of little surprises — little bits of new information that you need to respond to. A traffic light turns red. A child looks like they might run out into the road. A car suddenly turns right in front of you. In each case, you know how to deal with the situation. It’s happened many times before. But on each occasion, you still have to deal with the ‘surprise’.</p><p>In modern economies, a huge range of important value-adding activities fall into this category of managing ‘reliable surprises’. Take the health service which is largely organised around the management of ‘reliable surprises’: common ailments with well known symptoms and treatments but where, on each occasion, a diagnosis is still needed and a resulting set of actions planned and implemented.</p><p>Likewise financial services when deciding whether or not to give someone a loan or assessing an insurance risk, or public administrators deciding whether an individual is entitled to a benefit or service. And so on. A huge amount of the data that’s collected and used in our society today is devoted to the efficient management of such ‘reliable surprises’.</p> Implications <p>Talking about reliability and surprise as we’ve done here may seem simple and obvious. In a sense it is. But its implications are profound.</p><p>Practically speaking, for the full potential of data to be realised, individuals and service providers need to be able to access and use the right reliable data at the right time, on a mass scale. For this, we need new infrastructure. Just as the industrial age needed a national electricity grid to unleash electricity’s potential, so we need a new data ‘grid’ — a data logistics infrastructure that gets the right reliable data to (and from) the right people and places at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>That’s what we at Mydex are working on — personal data logistics infrastructure that puts citizens at the heart of the process, including them in the workings of society and economy. The Scottish Government has begun to realise this with its decision to create its <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a>. SAPS enables organisations to share verified (reliable data about their citizens) with the citizen so citizens, in turn, can share this data when and where they need to gain access to other services and eradicate things like form filling, delays and improve access, inclusion and outcomes.</p><p>Some of the work the UK Government is doing around personal data — its Identity and Attribute Trust Framework for example — has truly positive potential. But this Consultation and these proposals? Oh dear! They misunderstand where the real value of data lies and rely instead on a mythological narrative promoted mainly by Silicon Valley lobbyists. The <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">next post in this series</a> turns to this narrative.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is data valuable?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-terbu/">Oliver Terbu</a> (<a href="https://mesh.xyz/">ConsenSys Mesh</a>), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alen-horvat-0418b551/">Alen Horvat</a> (<a href="https://www.aceblock.com/">AceBlock</a>)</p> Introduction <p>With <a href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</a> the Web3 community has established a critical piece of infrastructure that is used by the majority of web3 protocols to different degrees. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> is part of the <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> stack and is used for the underlying peer-to-peer network for discovery, routing and data exchange. Peers in the network can dial other peers in the network to exchange messages using various transports, like QUIC, TCP, WebSocket, and Bluetooth. Modular design of the <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> framework enables it to build drivers for other transports. Peers can run on any device, as a cloud service, mobile application or in the browser and talk to each other as long as they are connected through the same <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>&nbsp;network.</p><p>A peer in a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network is identified through its <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/">peer identity (peer ID</a>). A peer ID is essentially derived from the public key (hash) of the peer’s key pair which can change over time, specifically when keys are rotated or revoked. For that reason, peer IDs are insufficient for building a stable fully-decentralized messaging framework. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, on the other hand, were designed to support key rotation while keeping a stable identifier. Hence, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> should be used as the more permanent public identifier for peers in the network, which would hold information about the peer IDs, <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network and supported protocols. Peers would still use their peer ID for <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> routing and authentication. Alice and Bob would exchange their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> out of band and will be able to find their counterparty’s peer ID via their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. In this way, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> acts as an indirection layer for the peer ID, thus allowing Alice and Bob to change their peer ID for practical reasons without the need to notify each&nbsp;other.</p><blockquote>Note: A <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/">peer ID</a> is a term defined by libp2p and is not the same as a <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">peer DID</a> although a <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/">peer ID</a> can also be used with a <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">peer DID</a> by following the approach described in this&nbsp;article.</blockquote><p><a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> is a modular system of protocols and specifications for building P2P applications. It can be also used to build P2P messaging applications. although messaging through <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> has limitations. Peers in the network are usually not always online, especially if Bob is travelling a lot, lives in an area with limited connectivity, is actually an intelligent car, or has a monthly limit with his mobile data plan. When Alice wants to send Bob a message and Bob is not online, then the likelihood of Bob eventually receiving the message reduces dramatically. DIF <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> solves this problem by defining mediator nodes that can run in high-availability mode. Those mediators can act as Alice and Bob’s mailboxes where both use DID authentication to receive the latest messages from their mediators. Instead of associating Bob’s peer ID with his <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>, Bob would associate his mediator’s peer ID with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>, so Alice would dial-up Bob’s mailbox through the <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network and first forward the message to the mediator. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> ensures that only Bob can decrypt the message and that Bob can verify Alice authenticated the message through authenticated encryption (authcrypt). Additional trust, security and access management can be added through <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> that counteract spam and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>This article explains how two parties, Alice and Bob, can securely communicate using <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> through a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network, where discovery, security and trust are rooted in Decentralized Identity technologies. First, we present how Alice and Bob prepare and exchange information about their peers, next we describe how peers establish secure P2P connections, and last we present DIDComm message exchange via the channels. We assume you are familiar with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VCs</a>. If you are not, check out <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">DIF FAQ</a> for a great&nbsp;intro.</p> Exchanging information <p>To start messaging, Alice and Bob must exchange information about their peers and mediators. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> help to establish a trusted Decentralized Identity layer for the peers, where peers can always find the latest information about the active mediators, peer IDs, authentication, and encryption keys. This enables mutual peer authentication and end-to-end stream encryption. We use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> service property to manage and share peer information as presented below.</p>DIDComm Messaging service section using libp2p transport<p>Thus Alice and Bob need to exchange their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> out-of-band and clients will be able to discover, authenticate and connect. The design is applicable to almost all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>&nbsp;methods.</p> Establishing secure&nbsp;streams <p>Now that Alice and Bob exchanged information about their peers, the peers establish authenticated and end-to-end encrypted P2P streams. If at least one of the peers has public endpoints or supports NAT transversal, peers can connect directly. Since most services are behind firewalls or don’t have public endpoints, P2P connection can be established only via relay or proxy nodes. These nodes either help with the NAT traversal or simply relay all the traffic. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> has full support for relay nodes that can be hosted by anyone, i.e. self-hosted or hosted by a 3rd party provider. Furthermore, every client can select which relay node(s) can be used to establish a connection with it and every new connection can be established via different nodes. Such an open design enables us to build a fully decentralized mesh of relay&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>After discovery, peers mutually authenticate. Authentication can be performed using peer IDs or any other <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> authentication key(s). <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> ensure that keys are valid (not revoked) and are linked to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>. Modular design enables plug in various mutual authentication protocols, like mutual TLS. After a successful mutual authentication, the streams are end-to-end encrypted either using TLSv1.3 or Noise Protocol, both supporting perfect forward secrecy. Note that other encryption protocols or frameworks can be plugged in. Only allow-listed peers, i.e., <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> of Alice or Bob registered with their clients, are allowed to open a stream. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) can be used to define more granular identity and access management policies.</p><p><a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> supports establishing a connection on the network levels, like QUIC, TCP/UDP, WebSocket, client authentication and traffic encryption. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> is introduced on top of <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> to fill-in the missing messaging capabilities.</p> Messaging <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> (aka DIDComm V2) provides a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Version 1 of DIDComm was specified in the HyperLedger (HL) Aries project as a set of HL Aries RFCs. With governance and further development moved to DIF, the goal was to specify one core specification for <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging </a>that addresses previously defined gaps and achieve better development experience. In particular V2 relies on better formalized methods, simpler message structures, has no requirement for DID exchange, treats ephemeral and full mode in the same way and has explicit support for all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> methods. Another goal was to address requirements beyond the HL Aries community.</p><p>In <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> trust is rooted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Atop <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> defines a set of methodologies to send messages between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> or more specifically their agents. Messages can be extended through specific <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocols. At a glance, <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> entails the following:</p>  Defines a data model for a common plaintext messages structure i.e. headers,&nbsp;body.  JOSE-based authn and encryption between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> with repudiation by&nbsp;default.  Defines a methodology for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> rotation.  Defines a methodology for (onion-)routing for various network architectures.  Defines core protocols such as invitations and feature discovery.  Defines core transport protocols for HTTP(S) and WebSockets.  Defines an extensibility model for adding new sub-protocols (e.g., VC Exchange) and new transports (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>).  <p>The following diagram shows the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> mental&nbsp;model.</p>DIDComm Messaging Mental&nbsp;Model<p>Typically, if Alice wants to send a message to Bob, Bob sends Alice an explicit invitation or Bob gives her his public <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> (implicit invitation through Bob’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Document</a>). Alice would then extract the service endpoint and recipient/routing keys from the invitation and can start sending messages to Bob. The first message could already contain a <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol message, since Alice can encrypt the message to Bob. After Bob receives the message, Bob can create a new <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> for Alice and indicate the change through <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> rotation.</p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> is transport-agnostic and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Documents</a> can be extended to support various transport mechanisms. The community developed approaches for HTTP(S) and WebSockets primarily, other transports such as Bluetooth are also under development.</p> Putting all&nbsp;together <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> running on top of a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network enables us to build a next generation decentralized messaging framework. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> enables establishing secure connections between peers regardless of their transport and IP properties (public, local, static, dynamic). Once peers establish secure connections with the help of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, they can authenticate (DID Authentication) and exchange <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol messages. Using a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network doesn’t require any changes to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol as <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> clients can support multiple messaging protocols and multiple different <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> networks (private or public) — it can work via existing public IPFS network, private <a href="https://www.aceblock.com/">AceBlock</a> network, and others. Layered architecture and clear separation of the P2P network from the messaging protocols, in our case <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>, enables us to design and develop the P2P network and <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> independently. Namely, the libP2P network doesn’t need to know anything about the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> and vice versa. Using such a setup, anyone can build edge agents and mediator nodes. Maintenance of such a P2P network is inexpensive. It is built using open source components.</p><p>The proposed solution&nbsp;supports</p>  direct communication (both clients have public&nbsp;IPs)  indirect communication (communication is relayed via <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> relay nodes; messages can be relayed via random relay nodes or pre-defined ones)  synchronous message exchange (if both clients are&nbsp;online)  asynchronous message exchange via mediator nodes (if one of the clients is&nbsp;offline)  Sending Messages through DIDComm Messaging and&nbsp;libp2p Conclusion and&nbsp;outlook <p>We outlined the next generation decentralized messaging solution built on top of <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VCs</a> and a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network. We presented how Alice and Bob establish a connection, exchange messages and demonstrated what connection types are supported.</p><p>We are currently working to demonstrate different setups and scenarios (using <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> and <a href="https://www.aceblock.com/">AceBlock</a> <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> client), we are adding <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> transport to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> specs and are working on the full framework design.</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates and j<a href="https://discord.gg/Er4E5xRdPj">oin our Discord</a> if you want to get involved!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/didcomm-messaging-through-libp2p-cffe0f06a062">DIDComm Messaging through libp2p</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Accelerate your decentralized identity skills with two free Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries workshops  
			  
				
				
				 <p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> are two of the popular open source repositories that can help propel development of decentralised identity products and services. Aries is a toolbox of several blockchain-agnostic repositories that allow for trusted online peer-to-peer interactions based on decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. The project grew out of work that was happening in Indy to create technologies for managing decentralized identity. Aries was moved to graduated status by the TSC in February 2021. Indy graduated in 2019 and provides a specific blockchain purpose-built for identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing the growth in interest for these two projects, Hyperledger Foundation has partnered with member company <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and its team of deeply experienced developers and architects to develop this free, multi-course curriculum to help developers and architects gain a deeper understanding of decentralized identity, with a deep dive into Aries and Indy. Registration and preparation information can be found on this <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops">Workshops page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two four-hour, beginning level, hands-on workshops provide opportunities to install and run the Indy and Aries components just like you would if you were making a real Indy-based network or Aries-based application. They introduce the necessary Git repos as well as how to use the Indy Command Line Interface (Indy CLI), run the Aries toolbox and create and issue a verifiable credential. They also introduce some current projects using Aries and Indy to help you accelerate your understanding of decentralized identity and build the skills necessary to successfully make changes to the underlying code with hands-on guidance to develop your own projects.</p>

<p>The second in the series is a four-hour course that advances your skills related to Hyperledger Indy node code and the Indy SDK. It also covers the commonly used cryptography libraries contained in Hyperledger Ursa, the Plenum ledger and how to interact with and change the repositories and code.</p>
<p>Topics also include:</p>
 
 Install and build with Indy SDK 
 Introduction to libindy, indycli etc 
 Indy VDR (replacement for Indy-SDK) 
 Making changes to Indy node code 
 Build and IndyTest the changes locally 
 How to get involved in the community further with chats, helplines, and meetings 
 
<p>Both courses do have several must-have prerequisites, including the installation of docker, installation of Indy-CLI, installation of rust, and the download of important repositories. This can be done independently, or you will have the opportunity to connect with instructors during pre-course office hours on a dedicated helpline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new courses are the first community workshops offered by the Hyperledger Foundation for free in an effort to expand the use, contributions, and maintainer community of Hyperledger Indy and Aries. Recordings of the courses will be made available at the conclusion of the instructor-led events.</p>
<p>Registration for the free course is limited to 100. Registration links and further information about the prerequisites and course materials can be found at <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops">https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops</a>.</p>

  For many businesses, Access Management still remains a big challenge. Not only should we control who has access to our systems, but we should also know where people are accessing this information from, and what exactly they are doing with it. This is particularly challenging when working in the cloud, as well as having customers, employees and other external sources accessing applications remotely and with multiple devices. Multiple devices mean more access points to manage which create a higher risk to your business. In this KCLive Event we take a critical look at employee and third-party identity management. Our analysts and experts will give you invaluable insights on how best to move forward on your digital transformation path.

  Digital Transformation has put businesses under a lot of pressure, not only with regards to compliance but also through a high demand for customer privacy and improved user experience. With too much security, e.g., through Authentication, users are scared off, whereas having too little security is risky. How do we find the right balance? To succeed in Digital Transformation, businesses need a strong digital identity backend that delivers all identity services required by the new digital services that are created. Unfortunately, most digital identities reside in silos. Building a modern Identity Fabric that delivers seamless yet secure and controlled access from everyone and everything to every service requires breaking down the legacy identity silos.

<p>As the world moves towards digitization, financial institutions are looking to adopt identity verification solutions that verify and validate in near real time the identity of the customer.</p>
<p>The UAE Central Bank along with the Securities and Commodities Authority, Dubai Financial Services Authority, and the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority recently issued guidelines for those financial institutions adopting such technologies. Within these guidelines, the UAE governing authorities have approved the usage of facial verification to identify banking customers at the time of onboarding.</p>
<p>This growing trend of regulatory approved biometric solutions that rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to onboard clients is spreading across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. And with the rise of cybercrime – cyber-attacks occurring every 11 seconds, regulators and authorities looking to solutions that are in compliant with the highest security standards.</p>
<p>IDnow, a leading expert for digital identities and identity verification welcomes these new guidelines. With extensive expertise serving Germany’s and Switzerland’s highly regulated markets, IDnow has always focused on striking a balance between security and user experience.</p>
<p>IDnow’s regulatory affairs team is part of several regulatory working groups like ETSI, FIDO Alliance, W3C, and Hyperledger and consults authorities worldwide that are working on digital identity verification and authentication standards.</p>
<p>Being an expert has allowed IDnow to develop financial regulatory compliant products, notably, BankIdent. This completely AML-compliant online identification solution utilizes the users’ current online bank account to create an easy and secure identity verification service that effortlessly combines technology with existing identity and banking data. All that is required of the user is a valid photo ID, an active online bank account, and valid login credentials.</p>
<p>In addition, IDnow is looking closely into the latest developments around digital identity wallets in Europe and, is supporting different expert- and working groups with their expertise. The new law will allow people to have their official documents, such as their drivers’ license or ID card in one central place on their smartphone with easy access to it and, the assurance that their information is securely stored.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, IDnow is expanding its global footprint. It recently opened two offices in the United Kingdom and one in the United Arab Emirates and is also looking to set up a call centre in the Middle East to comply with regional data residency laws.</p>
<p>This benefits every party involved in the process, from making consumers’ lives easier, to reducing waiting times and increasing conversion rates, while keeping a high level of security.</p>

<p>2021 saw a diverse range of events in which Jolocom could participate in. From debates about the future of seIf-sovereign identity (SSI) to the role of trust in the age of AI (Artificial Intelligence) – there were many important take-home messages and ways for us to contribute in discussions. A brief overview of the events we participated in in 2021 also offers a good insight into our goals, values, and projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>February 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom took part in a virtual meeting of the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) back in February. Also included: the position paper of the organization, which was published in 2020: “Decentralized Identity: What’s at Stake?”. One of the founding principles of Jolocom is the mission to promote the establishment and maintenance of standards in our industry. We were therefore very pleased that Kai led the discussion as an active board member of INATBA and as co-chair of the organization’s Identity Working Group. Together with four stakeholders, he discussed the current role of decentralized identities and how they should shape in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keryl Folwer from Transmute, Anil John, Director of the Silicon Valley Innovation Program, Dr. Loretta Anania, Research Associate at GD Connect of the European Commission, and Daniel Du Seuil, Belgian Project Leader for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) formed the discussion group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The position paper was drawn up by INATBA with the aim of defining the expectations of an open and innovative market in a decentralized identity. It analyzes the current status of SSI developments and opens discussions about the next steps, makes demands on the most important stakeholder groups and sets goals for the future of SSI. Kai asked about the first reactions of the participants to the content of the paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karyl highlighted the role and importance of interoperability. Interoperability is the ability to interact with different systems. If two systems are compatible with each other, they are also called interoperable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anil, in turn, spoke out against a “techno-utopianism of a self-sovereign identity”, but made it clear that he believes in personal freedom of choice and control. This is also supported by Jolocom and is one of our basic standards. Using a digital self-sovereign identity (SSI), we are always working on being able to manage the control and security of their own data independently for the individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loretta praised the European Commission’s plan to make the next decade a double transition, with green and digital going into everything. She argued that it is good and important to be there now, at the beginning, especially when the standards are being set. Founded in 2014, Jolocom is very committed to the development of SSI standards. We are always working on building more trust in a decentralized network and protecting the digital autonomy of our own data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Daniel saw SSI as the answer to the new demand for a European digital ID. If the European digital ID is about empowerment, data protection and new models of data sovereignty, it must be technology-neutral. In the end, says Daniël, the question is always the same: How can we empower citizens?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The discussion between the participants was very lively and underlined, despite different opinions and backgrounds, common values. There was agreement on the increasing importance of digital decentralization, which can be described as a global trend. Furthermore, everyone agreed that this is an interesting time. Both industry and the public sector are more interested in decentralized identities and what they can offer them. Jolocom agreed with the general opinion that working together can also create interoperability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>May 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2019, Jolocom has been a partner to three out of four winning teams in the German innovation competition for setting up Secure Digital Identites (SDI) projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the DWeb Meetup in May 2021, Jolocom was invited to explain its role at ONCE, ID-Ideal and SDIKA in more detail, which Kai Wagner did as our representative. His key message was: The challenges that lie ahead of us also offer great opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The four projects must be harmonized with EU directives, W3C and the global community in general; this requires coherent concepts and an interoperability infrastructure. SSI and decentralized identities are booming: that’s why it is important to keep pace with market dynamics. The DWeb community can benefit greatly from the projects; However, this requires a coherent infrastructure and uniform concepts. In this way, as many EU citizens as possible are reached, who then get the chance to manage their identity independently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kai also presented the background to the projects and their goal. The digital identity card is officially on the market, but it is only actively used by 0.5% of the population. Kai pointed out that Germany does not have a leading role in the field of digital identities. At the end of 2019, four projects were then selected to address these problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>October 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The topic of “digital identities” is also more up-to-date than ever, especially driven by the corona pandemic and the associated increasing digitization in almost all areas of life. The online event “Digital Identity” of the BFM (Business Research Center) also took place on October 20, 2021 under this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a lively discussion, the main topics were data security, dealing with skeptics and the costs of a wallet. The group of experts included Irene Adamski as a representative for Jolocom, as well as Fabiane Völter as a research assistant at the University of Bayreuth, Thomas Ruch as the person responsible for credit management at BAUR GmbH and Boris Lingl as Head of Blockchain at DATEV, who tried to answer questions from the audience .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Above all, Irene presented the idea of a wallet and presented SSI as a global trend, which is, however, still a developing market in Germany. Therefore, the questions about the costs of a wallet could not be answered specifically, but it could still be said with certainty: There are no costs for the end user. In addition, the use of a wallet should be voluntary. However, EU citizens must be able to have a wallet made available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore the term of a transition period came up, which can definitely be expected. Data security is always in the hands of the user. In the event of a request to identify something, they can select and deselect which information they want to share or even reject it completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your own data is encrypted on your own wallet. You only pull out the information that you want to share.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>November 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in dealing with the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Irene presented the role of SSI as a possible solution. The specialist conference “Trust in the Age of AI-Supported Bots and Fakes: Challenges and Possible Solutions‘ on November 4th included some keynote speeches on the topics of fake reviews, deep fakes, and possible solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exciting examples of the use of artificial intelligence in everyday life make it clear that this is a global trend. At this lively conference, the dark side of AI was also highlighted. Identity theft, manipulation of politics, dissemination of pornographic content … dangers that arise from AI cannot be ruled out and lead to growing distrust in the digital space. How is this to be dealt with?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where the role of SSI comes into play. It is one of Jolocom’s basic principles to maintain and protect the autonomy of citizens. Irene was happy to explain this in more detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The basic idea: control your own data. Broken down: selectively choose who has access to his and her data and reject who should not have access. This is well expressed when using a digital wallet: I can prove that I am over 18 years old without having to share my personal date of birth. This selective transfer of data also brings more trust in the digital space with it. A secure wallet provides the opportunity to retain and protect autonomy over your own data in the early days of AI and automated bots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>2021 once again underlined the importance of of SSI is and how it is widely discussed. The team behind Jolocom is very happy to have attended such interesting events and looks forward to many more exciting discussions and meetups in 2022. </p>

<p> Vielfältig waren die Events, Diskussionen und Meetups an denen Jolocom dieses Jahr teilnehmen durfte. Von Debatten über die Zukunft von Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) bis zur Rolle des Vertrauens im Zeitalter von KI (Künstlicher Intelligenz) – Jolocom konnte viel beitragen und viel mitnehmen. Ein kleiner Überblick über die Events, an denen wir 2021 teilnahmen, gibt auch einen guten Einblick in unsere Ziele, Werte und Projekte.&nbsp; </p>



<p></p>



<p>Februar 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bereits im Februar nahm Jolocom an einem virtuellen Meeting der International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) teil. Mit dabei: das Positionspapier der Organisation, das bereits 2020 veröffentlicht worden war:,,<a href="https://inatba.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-INATBA-Decentralised-Identity-001.pdf">Decentralised Identity: What’s at Stake?</a>‘’. Eines der Gründungsprinzipien von Jolocom ist die Mission, die Etablierung und Aufrechterhaltung von offenen Standards in unserer Branche voranzutreiben. Daher freuten wir uns sehr, dass Kai als aktives Vorstandsmitglied der INATBA sowie als Co-Vorsitzender der Identity Working Group der Organisation die Diskussion leitete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gemeinsam mit vier Interessensgruppen diskutierte er die aktuelle Rolle dezentraler Identitäten, und wie sich diese in Zukunft gestalten sollten. Keryl Folwer als DIF Steering Committee Member, Anil John, Direktor des Silicon Valley Innovation Programme, Dr. Loretta Anania, Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin bei der GD Connect der Europäischen Kommission, und Daniel Du Seuil, der belgische Projektleiter für selbstsouveräne Identität (SSI) bildeten die Diskussionsgruppe. Das Positionspapier wurde von INATBA mit dem Ziel erstellt, die Erwartungen an einen offenen und innovativen Markt in dezentraler Identität zu definieren. Es analysiert den aktuellen Stand der SSI-Entwicklungen und eröffnet Diskussionen über die nächsten Schritte, stellt Forderungen an die wichtigsten Anspruchsgruppen und setzt Ziele für die Zukunft von SSI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kai fragte nach den ersten Reaktionen der Teilnehmenden auf den Inhalt des Papieres. Karyl stellte die Rolle und Wichtigkeit von Interoperabilität heraus. Als Interoperabilität bezeichnet man die Fähigkeit zum Zusammenspiel verschiedener Systeme.&nbsp; Wenn zwei Systeme miteinander vereinbar sind, nennt man sie auch interoperabel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anil wiederum sprach sich gegen einen ,,Techno-Utopismus einer selbstsouveränen Identität’’ aus, verdeutlichte jedoch, dass er an persönliche Entscheidungsfreiheit und Kontrolle glaubt. Dies wird auch von Jolocom unterstützt und gehört zu unseren grundlegenden Standards. Anhand einer digitalen selbstsouveränen Identität (SSI) arbeiten wir stets daran, dem Individuum die Kontrolle und Sicherheit zu geben, die eigenen selbstbestimmt verwalten zu können.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loretta lobte den Plan der Europäischen Kommission, das nächste Jahrzehnt zu einem doppelten Übergang zu machen, bei dem Grün und Digital in alles integriert werden sollen. Sie argumentierte, dass es gut und wichtig ist, bereits jetzt, am Anfang, dabei zu sein, insbesondere wenn die Standards festgelegt werden. Gegründet 2014, ist Jolocom sehr engagiert in der Entwicklung von SSI Standards. Wir arbeiten stets daran, mehr Vertrauen in ein dezentrales Netzwerk auszubauen und die digitale Autonomie der eigenen Daten zu schützen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Daniel sah SSI als Antwort auf die neue Forderung nach einer europäischen digitalen ID. Wenn es bei der europäischen digitalen ID um Empowerment, Datenschutz und neue Modelle der Datenhoheit geht, muss sie technologieneutral sein. Am Ende, so Daniël, sei die Frage immer dieselbe: Wie können wir die Bürger stärken?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Diskussion zwischen den Teilnehmenden war sehr angeregt und zeigte, trotz verschiedener Meinungen und Hintergründe, auch gemeinsame Werte auf. Einigkeit herrschte über den steigenden Stellenwert von digitaler Dezentralisierung, die als globaler Trend bezeichnet werden kann.&nbsp; Weiterhin stimmten alle zu, dass dies eine interessante Zeit ist. Sowohl die Industrie als auch der öffentliche Sektor interessieren sich mehr für dezentrale Identitäten und was sie ihnen bieten können. Jolocom stimmte der allgemeinen Meinung zu, dass nur durch enge Zusammenarbeit die dringend erforderliche Interoperabilität entstehen kann.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mai 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seit 2019 gehört Jolocom zu drei von vier Gewinnerteams des deutschen Innovationswettbewerbs zum Aufbau von Sicheren Digitalen Identitäten (SDI)-Projekten. Beim DWeb-Meetup im Mai 2021 wurde Jolocom eingeladen, seine Rolle bei ONCE, ID-Ideal und SDIKA näher zu erläutern, was Kai Wagner gerne tat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seine Kernaussage war dabei: Die Herausforderungen, die vor uns liegen, bieten gleichzeitig große Chancen. Die vier Projekte müssen mit EU-Richtlinien, W3C und generell der weltweiten Gemeinschaft harmonisiert werden; dazu braucht es kohärente Konzepte und Interoperabilitätsinfrastruktur. SSI und dezentrale Identitäten sind am boomen: deswegen gilt es, mit der Marktdynamik Schritt zu halten. Die DWeb Gemeinschaft kann von den Projekten sehr profitieren; Voraussetzung hierfür sind jedoch eine kohärente Infrastruktur und einheitliche Konzepte. So werden auch möglichst viele EU Bürger:innen erreicht, die dann die Chance erhalten, ihre Identität selbstständig zu verwalten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Außerdem präsentierte Kai den Hintergrund zu den Projekten und ihrem Ziel. Offiziell ist der digitale Personalausweis auf dem Markt, wird aber nur von 0.5% der Bevölkerung aktiv genutzt. Deutschland hat, so stellte Kai heraus, keine führende Rolle im Bereich digitaler Identitäten. Ende 2019 wurden dann vier Projekte ausgewählt, die diese Probleme angehen wollen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oktober 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Auch das Thema ,,Digitale Identitäten’’ ist so aktuell wie nie zuvor, besonders vorangetrieben durch die Corona-Pandemie und die damit verbundene zunehmende Digitalisierung in nahezu allen Lebensbereichen. Unter diesem Thema fand auch die online Veranstaltung ,,Digitale Identität’’ des BFM (Betriebswirtschaftliches Forschungszentrum) am 20. Oktober 2021 statt. Während einer angeregten Diskussionsrunde stellten sich vor allem die Themen der Datensicherheit, Umgang mit Skeptiker:innen und Kosten für eine Wallet in den Mittelpunkt. Unter der Expertengruppe befanden sich Irene Adamski als Vertreterin für Jolocom, sowie Fabiane Völter als Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin der Uni Bayreuth, Thomas Ruch als Zuständiger für die Kreditsteuerung der BAUR GmbH und Boris Lingl als Head of Blockchain bei DATEV, welche die Fragen des Publikums zu beantworten suchten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dabei stellte Irene vor allem die Idee einer Wallet vor und präsentierte SSI als einen globalen Trend, der jedoch in Deutschland noch ein Markt im Werden ist. Daher waren die Fragen nach den Kosten einer Wallet nicht konkret zu beantworten, dennoch konnte sicher gesagt werden: Für die Endnutzer kommen keine Kosten auf. Außerdem soll das Nutzen einer Wallet freigestellt werden. EU Bürger:innen müssen aber die Möglichkeit haben, eine Wallet zur Verfügung gestellt bekommen zu haben. Daher kam der Begriff einer Übergangszeit auf, mit der definitiv zu rechnen sei. Die Datensicherheit liegt immer in den Händen der Nutzer:innen. Im Falle einer Anfrage, etwas auszuweisen, können diese selbst an- und abwählen, welche Informationen sie teilen, oder es sogar komplett ablehnen. Die eigenen Daten liegen dabei allesamt verschlüsselt auf der eigenen Wallet. Ähnlich wie bei einer Brieftasche zieht man nur jene Informationen heraus, die man auch teilen möchte.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>November 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ebenfalls im Umgang mit der Zukunft von Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) stellte Irene die Rolle von SSI als möglichen Lösungsweg vor. Die Fachkonferenz ,,Vertrauen im Zeitalter KI-gestützter Bots und Fakes: Herausforderungen und mögliche Lösungen‘‘ am 4. November beinhaltete einige Impulsvorträge über die Themenbereiche Fake Reviews, Deep Fakes, und Lösungsmöglichkeiten. Spannende Beispiele vom Einsatz künstlicher Intelligenz im Alltag verdeutlichten, dass es sich um einen globalen Trend handelt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bei dieser angeregten Fachkonferenz wurden auch die Schattenseiten von KI beleuchtet. Identitätsklau, Manipulation der Politik, Verbreitung pornografischer Inhalte…Gefahren, die durch KI entstehen, sind nicht auszuschließen und führen zu wachsendem Misstrauen in den digitalen Raum. Wie ist hiermit umzugehen? Just an dieser Stelle kommt die Rolle von SSI ins Spiel. Es gehört zu Jolocom’s Grundprinzipien, die Autonomie von Bürger:innen im Netz zu wahren und zu schützen. Irene freute sich, dies näher erläutern zu können.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der Grundgedanke: die eigenen Daten kontrollieren. Aufgeschlüsselt: selektiv auswählen, wer Zugang zu ihren und seinen Daten hat, und ablehnen, wer keinen Zugang bekommen soll. Beim Nutzen einer digitalen Wallet kommt dies gut zum Ausdruck: Ich kann ausweisen, dass ich über 18 Jahre alt bin, ohne mein persönliches Geburtsdatum teilen zu müssen. Diese selektive Weitergabe von Daten bringt auch wieder mehr Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum mit sich. So liefert eine sichere Wallet die Möglichkeit, im beginnenden Zeitalter von KI und automatisierter Bots die Autonomie über die eigenen Daten zu behalten und zu schützen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2021 zeigte erneut, wie aktuell das Thema SSI ist und wie es vielseitig diskutiert wird. Das Team hinter Jolocom freut sich sehr, bei so anregenden Events dabei gewesen zu sein und bedankt sich bei den Organisatoren und anderen Teilnehmenden. Auf das 2022 noch viel weiteren spannenden Austausch bieten wird. –&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a continued focus on decentralized identity and data solutions, Ontology has worked to bring better trust, privacy, and security to the new&nbsp;web</p><p>In a relatively new industry like blockchain, change is a constant state. When Ontology launched at the end of 2017, Bitcoin was putting crypto on the map through continuous price surges, before crashing at the end of 2018. Since this time, in an uncharted landscape that at times seemed dominated by speculation, Ontology strove to be a lighthouse in a sea of confusion, providing clear and reliable blockchain use cases that put users’ interests first.</p><p>As the industry has progressed and the world has increasingly embraced decentralized solutions, privacy and security issues associated with Web2 and Big Tech have been exposed. Looking to facilitate a more secure and private internet in Web3, Ontology has been working hard to build out its public chain infrastructure, decentralized identity, and data solutions to support the transition to the new&nbsp;web.</p><p>As well as a more private and secure internet, Web3 offers the potential for fascinating use cases as the web becomes more integrated. The metaverse, an all-encompassing digital landscape populated by virtual people, places and things, will eventually see separate virtual worlds interlink and overlap the real world. To get there, we need a public chain that puts users’ security and privacy front and center, whilst also allowing for an interoperable virtual world. Over the last four years, Ontology has been working to create an infrastructure for just that and we are delighted to now be facilitating this vision of a better internet.</p><p>As we look to the future, we are excited to onboard new partnerships and make technological advancements that contribute to our vision of Web3, as well as to the growth of our global community.</p> Year 1: Laying The Foundations <p>The launch of Ontology’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ontology-mainnet-ontology-1-0-has-officially-launched">MainNet</a> 1.0 served to position us as a high-performance public blockchain. In a significant move for the wider industry, Ontology 1.0 was the first public chain capable of executing smart contracts with identity, setting the stage for our vision for decentralized identity solutions. To lay the foundations for the open governance model which has become a key aspect of Ontology, we introduced a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-launches-vbft-a-next-generation-consensus-mechanism-becoming-one-of-the-first-vrf-based-91f782308db4">new consensus algorithm, VBFT</a>, for the Ontology framework and the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-introduces-the-triones-membership-system-5211294976bf">Triones Consensus System</a>.</p> Year 2: Building Out Our Infrastructure <p>Year 2 saw Ontology crystallize our vision and mark out our position within the broader blockchain ecosystem. Gaining traction, we were able to supplement our MainNet by building on it with further enterprise projects that were focused on decentralized identity and data privacy. Broadening the technical applications of our chain, we launched <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-v1-8-0-goes-live-with-wasm-fa34e9f7f930">Wasm TestNet in May</a>, as well as the first-ever cross-chain TestNet. We didn’t stop there; in fact, it was a Multi-VM launch that year, with the launch of our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-sharding-design-released-c900331f71fa">Sharding Design</a> launching in October, which provided linear stability and support for cross-shard transaction processing.</p> Year 3: Global Expansion <p>Having made our mark on the industry through technical prowess, the Ontology mission for our third year was to become a cross-chain, global network that would expand our vision of decentralized identity and data through a host of fascinating partnerships.</p><p>Throughout the year, we improved our infrastructure through the roll-out of the Ontology Layer 2.0. Additionally, ONT ID was upgraded, which served to combine users’ decentralized identity with their ONTO Wallet with one single login, while providing a framework that helps users control their identity and data. This was a huge step towards interoperability and provided an interlinked suite of products to our&nbsp;users.</p><p>We introduced a new governance and staking model in July, affecting both our ONT and ONG tokens, complete with a <a href="https://node.ont.io/calculator/node">node and yield calculator</a> allowing users to easily estimate how much they could potentially earn from staking via ONTO. Excitingly, ONG also launched on Uniswap at the end of the summer, bringing Ontology’s token to a whole new user base. As the year developed, we deployed our cross-chain decentralized identity solution on Ethereum, Near, Neo, TRON, Klaytn, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot. We also partnered with Patract Labs in November to accelerate smart contract ecosystem development. Finally, we joined forces with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/daimler-mobility-partners-with-ontology-to-leverage-high-performance-technologies-and-transform-b469aa46e671">Daimler Mobility</a> AG’s Blockchain Factory to develop MoveX, a first-of-its-kind blockchain-based mobility platform for the automotive and mobility industry.</p><p>Towards the end of the year, our focus turned to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). In September 2020, we launched <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing.Finance</a>, a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi lending platform. Since then Wing has seen significant growth, with increased engagement in its DAO, and has also incorporated credit-based lending through Ontology’s unique OScore credit scoring solution. The Wing Inclusive Pool, a first mover in the industry, also allows users to under-collateralize assets and lower their interest&nbsp;rates.</p> Year 4: Web3 and Interoperability <p>This year, Ontology has honed our existing products to match our wider vision of Web3 and position ourselves as the public chain capable of moving towards a better, decentralized, interoperable internet that places user privacy and data security at the heart of its priorities.</p><p>To facilitate this vision, our technical team began developing the Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) at the start of 2021. Now on TestNet, our EVM will help us establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform, offering an inclusive experience to developers and users. This development will also help to cement Ontology’s position as a cross-chain interoperable blockchain, adding to its existing virtual machines; NeoVM, Native (Ontology) VM, and&nbsp;WasmVM.</p><p>Reflecting a major endorsement for decentralized identity, ONT ID surpassed 1.5 million users in September. Companies across the globe have also embraced the application this year, most notably through a social good <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/microworkers-integrates-ontologys-onto-wallet-to-facilitate-additional-payment-options-for-workers-1163291af76c">partnership</a> announced in March with global freelancing marketplace leader, MicroWorkers, where it is being used to assist workers to receive rewards and gain greater access to capital. To facilitate its ever-expanding user base, ONT ID underwent an upgrade that will improve user experience, while also making it easier for developers to build sophisticated applications and real-world use cases through ONT ID. The Ontology products now integrated with ONT ID&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, a new feature that makes trustless universal authentication for websites and applications possible, allowing users to log into multiple platforms without having to remember passwords.  <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, Ontology’s new decentralized solution for online identity verification, which helps applications access users’ verifiable credentials, such as KYC verification, whilst also allowing users to protect their privacy by authorizing information independently.  <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a>, a DeFi credit score, used to measure creditworthiness, which is calculated using different types of on-chain transaction data.  <p>Other partnerships have also contributed to Ontology’s arsenal. Most recently, we partnered with <a href="https://bloxmove.com/">bloXmove</a>, a business-to-business mobility blockchain platform designed to simplify travel across multiple forms of transportation, to bring decentralized identity to urban transport apps. In May, we partnered with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483">ROCKI</a>, a next-generation music streaming service and NFT platform. ROCKI will use Ontology’s decentralized identity solutions to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and peddling inauthentic NFTs. In June, we also <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-zaico-to-empower-its-inventory-management-system-increasing-traceability-29a604bf6123">announced</a> a partnership with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-zaico-to-empower-its-inventory-management-system-increasing-traceability-29a604bf6123">ZAICO</a>, a real-time cloud storage inventory management application based in Japan. We also partnered with AP.LLC, a private Japanese IT consultancy firm and hired a <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1391937705206972419">new</a> Japanese advisor, Matsuyama Kitao Takayuki.</p><p>Ontology’s growth in the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-growing-presence-in-japan-a31d3aaa0eb7">Japanese</a> market has accelerated following a string of announcements, including the news that ONT would be listed on the Japanese registered crypto exchange, <a href="https://www.decurret.com/">Decurret</a>. This marked the first listing of ONT in Japan, a huge milestone for Ontology and our growing Japanese community. The ONT/JPY trading pair went live in July, with over 40,000 ONT trading volume taking place. In August, ONT was listed on <a href="https://www.huobi.co.jp/">Huobi Japan</a>, another FSA-licensed Japanese exchange.</p><p>In January, we were delighted to announce the launch of a <a href="https://medium.com/onto/the-first-cross-chain-web-wallet-onto-web-is-coming-soon-8a9e89ff0e0">web-based ONTO wallet</a> to bring additional accessibility to millions of users through their web browser. Incredibly, this was the first-ever web wallet to support cross-chain assets and dApps while also addressing the growing demand for decentralized identity and data amongst users. We also ​​launched <a href="https://anydrop.ont.io/">ONTO Anydrop</a>, a decentralized airdrop distribution tool, that allows assets to be sent to up to 100 addresses in one transaction in a fast and secure manner across multiple mainstream blockchains. These significant achievements have led to a massive increase in users and community members of ONTO Wallet. The <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">ONTO</a> Wallet Twitter channel now has over 100K followers.</p><p>Wing, Ontology’s DeFi lending platform, also turned one this year. Over the past year, Wing has lived up to its title of a cross-chain platform through launching on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKt9oJxLPs">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/wingfinance/wing-ontologys-cross-chain-defi-lending-platform-now-live-on-okexchain-7c622d78f4ee">OKExChain</a> and most recently, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/wing-ontologys-cross-chain-defi-lending-platform-is-now-live-on-binance-smart-chain">Binance Smart Chain</a>. It also <a href="https://medium.com/wingfinance/wing-finance-launches-any-pool-a-decentralized-lending-pool-for-any-asset-b6eadbf9c4e8">launched</a> a new DeFi product, “Any Pool,” which allows for the contractualization and lending of any&nbsp;asset.</p> Looking Ahead <p>As we have seen, the last four years have been full of incredible achievements. Undoubtedly, our community is the support system that drives this success at Ontology. As we step forward into the next era of our future, we are proud to be a well-established blockchain that has stood the test of time. Moving into Web3, we believe we are the chain that can facilitate the needs of the new web. Not only do we expect our protocols and products to continue to facilitate this shift, but we also look forward to welcoming more people to the decentralized identity and data revolution.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Supercharge your staking with Ontology’s Limited Edition NFT: Multiply your yield by&nbsp;9000X! <p>To celebrate Ontology’s 4th anniversary, we have made 10,000 limited edition NFT’s available for minting. Not only do they look great, but they will also be used to establish a special NFT Ontology Node where NFT holders benefit from the staking&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Minting takes place over four rounds, between December 9th 06:00 UTC and December 10th 00:00 UTC. Any remaining NFTs from each round, will be carried over to the&nbsp;next.</p><p>Round 1: 06.00 UTC, Dec 9th — 1000 NFTs available <br>Round 2: 12.00 UTC, Dec 9th — 2000 NFTs available <br>Round 3: 18.00 UTC, Dec 9th — 3000 NFTs available<br>Round 4: 00.00 UTC, Dec 10th — 4000 NFTs available</p><p>NFTs will be available to mint for ten days, starting with Round 1. Minting ends on 12/19 06:00 UTC or when all 10,000 NFTs have been minted. Each NFT will cost 10 ONT to mint, with a unique ONT address able to mint a maximum of 10&nbsp;NFTs.</p> Stake NFTs and Earn&nbsp;ONG <p>When you mint your first NFT, you have helped to establish special NFT node owners. Congratulations!</p><p>NFT staking has significantly reduced the barrier of entry to establishing a node, by allowing you to do it together with your NFTs. A node owner requires a minimum of 10,000 ONT and pays fees of 500 ONG to establish the node. The special NFT node is established with the ONT used during the minting event and Ontology is covering the 500 ONG in fees as a part of the 4th anniversary celebrations.</p><p>90% of the ONG rewards earned by the node will be distributed between the NFT owners, with the remaining 10% being used, in the first instance, as a fund for those who choose to burn their NFTs (see below). When the NFT burning fund is full, the remaining 10% will be used to fund future Ontology&nbsp;events.</p> Redeem ONT <p>Should an NFT owner wish to do so, they can burn their NFT and redeem 10&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>Burning NFTs does not reduce the size of the stake in the node. Great news for those that don’t burn their NFTs, as their share of ONG rewards increases for every NFT&nbsp;burned.</p><p>Burning NFTs can increase rewards up to 9000 times for the remaining holder. Should all NFTs be burned, the ONG generated by the node will be used by Ontology for future community development.</p> More <p>NFTs feature additional use cases — stay tuned for more&nbsp;details!</p> Guide  1. Download the <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a> and Create an ONT ID&nbsp;Wallet <p>Click on the <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/app-basics/how-to-register-an-account-on-onto-wallet">link</a> to view the relevant&nbsp;guide.</p><p>Skip this step if you already have an ONT ID&nbsp;wallet.</p> 2. Prepare ONT and&nbsp;ONG <p>The minting fee of each NFT is 10 ONT, and all transactions on the Ontology blockchain require a small amount of ONG as fees. If ONG balance is insufficient, navigate to ONTO’s Assets page and click the ONT details page. Here, you can click on the upper right button to swap ONT for&nbsp;ONG.</p> 3. Mint&nbsp;NFT <p>Navigate to ONTO’s Discover page, search “Cyberspace 4 Philosophers” and open&nbsp;it.</p><p>Tap on the “Mint” button at the bottom left of the homepage to open the “Mint” page, then tap on the “Mint” button at the bottom. In the pop-up window, enter the mint number, then tap on the “Mint” button to finish the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Minted NFTs can be viewed and sent on the ONTO Assets — Collectibles page.</p> 4. Stake NFT and Claim ONG&nbsp;Reward <p>To earn ONG rewards, NFTs must be staked. The staking feature will be available shortly after the minting is complete and the node has been established</p><p>Tap on the “Stake/Redeem” button at the bottom right of the homepage to open the “Stake/Redeem” page, then tap on the “Stake” button to stake ONT or the “Unstake” button to unstake&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>ONG rewards are distributed at the end of each consensus round. Tap on the “Claim” button to claim the ONG&nbsp;reward.</p> 5. Burn NFTs and Redeem&nbsp;ONT <p>Only unstaked NFTs can be burned. On the “Stake/Redeem” page, tap on the “Burn” button at the bottom left to burn NFTs. Then wait until the current consensus round ends, and then tap on the “Redeem” button at the bottom right to redeem&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>Please note that, Redeem will only be available when there is enough balance in the NFT burning&nbsp;fund.</p><p>The Ontology team will reserve the final rights of interpretation of this&nbsp;event.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p><a href="https://www.fingerprints.com/">Fingerprint Cards</a> (FPC) is arguing that biometric payment cards can help mitigate some of the anxieties that consumers feel when making contactless payments. The company specifically <a href="https://www.fingerprints.com/2021/11/23/a-right-royal-contactless-card-supporting-uk-consumers-with-biometrics/">looked at the UK</a>, where the contactless payment cap jumped from £45 to £100 in October.</p>



  



<p>A higher payment cap should ostensibly deliver a better customer experience, since it allows people to make more purchases without needing to enter a pin. In practice, however, it can be a source of stress for merchants and consumers alike. Consumers are worried that fraudsters will be able to get away with more money if their card gets lost or stolen. Merchants, meanwhile, are worried about walk-off fraud, which occurs when someone taps to pay and does not realize that a PIN was required for that transaction (the new UK law still requires PIN verification if the cardholder exceeds £300 in consecutive transactions).</p>



<p>With that in mind, some British retailers have indicated that they will not implement the new contactless cap, and will instead stick to the safer £45. That is likely to create more confusion amongst the public, since people will not know whether or not the need to enter a PIN when they take out their card in different stores.</p>



<p>As it stands, 53 percent of the British public were worried about contactless fraud before the limit increase, while 26 percent were worried about confusion at checkout. Some banks are allowing customers to deactivate contactless payments or set their own personal contactless limits to assuage those fears, and to mitigate their own potential losses. Contactless fraud rates are currently low (around 2p for £100), but that number could increase with a higher limit, and banks and card issuers are obligated to refund the victims.</p>



<p>Biometric payment cards offer a potential solution to that problem. The use of fingerprint recognition adds a layer of biometric authentication to each transaction, and it does so while delivering the same level of contactless convenience. That helps guarantee that contactless transactions remain secure, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-cards-can-enable-higher-contactless-payment-caps-fpc/">regardless of the payment cap</a>, and encourages merchants to adopt more consistent contactless payment policies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>FPC noted that contactless payments in the UK went up 90 percent over the course of 2019, and now account for 57 percent of all in-store transactions. There is also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-survey-results-show-strong-interest-biometric-payment-cards-012009/">strong interest in biometric cards</a>, with 62 percent of the British public indicating that they would switch banks to get their hands on a biometric payment card. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/natwest-biometric-card-trial-powered-by-fpc-gemalto-610104/">NatWest</a> and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/natwest-rbs-trials-biometric-payment-cards-804303/">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> have both conducted biometric card trials in the UK using fingerprint technology from FPC.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aratek.co/">Aratek</a> is bringing a slew of biometric solutions to <a href="https://www.trustech-event.com/">Trustech 2021</a>. Most notably, the company will be using the opportunity to unveil the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aratek-hits-road-portable-marshall-fingerprint-scanner/">latest version of its Marshall tablet</a>, and to bring its TruFace facial recognition platform to the European market.</p>



  



<p>“Trustech is one show that Aratek doesn’t want to miss because year after year, the organizers manage to draw the highest quality audience in the digital identify, security and payments industries,” said Aratek International Business Division VP Samuel Wu. “It gathers thousands of end-users who will benefit from seeing Aratek’s biometric identity solutions in action.”</p>



<p>In that regard, the Marshall 8 is a rugged, portable device that can be used for biometric registration and authentication. The device offers fingerprint, face, and iris recognition capabilities, and also supports barcode and NFC communications. The device will perform well in indoor and outdoor environments thanks to its IP-65 rating, with Aratek arguing that the device is well-suited to law enforcement, voter registration, attendance tracking, and border control, amongst other applications.</p>



<p>TruFace, on the other hand, first <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-aratek-expands-portfolio-truface-facial-recognition-terminal-100201/">debuted in October of 2019</a>, though the solution has yet to make a splash in Europe. For Trustech, the platform has been integrated into the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-aratek-show-truface-intersec-2020-010705/">TruFace BA8300 terminal</a>, which is geared primarily toward access control and retail applications. Aratek noted that TruFace is a contactless authentication solution, and can therefore help meet the growing demand for touchless tech during the pandemic. The terminal supports fingerprint, barcode, QR code, and RFID readings in addition to facial recognition.</p>



<p>The TruFace terminal features Aratek’s TrustFace live face detection algorithm, and identifies users with built-in dual HDR cameras. Aratek will also be showcasing its full portfolio of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aratek-a700-m-fingerprint-module-features-large-surface-area7070405/">fingerprint scanners</a>. The scanners are all FBI-certified, and range from a simple FAP 10 scanner to the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aratek-unveils-new-a900-ten-print-fingerprint-scanner-062907/">10-print A900 FAP 60 offering</a>.</p>



<p>Trustech 2021 will run from November 30 to December 2 at the Paris Expo de Versailles. Aratek will be setting up shop at booth&nbsp;5.2 D 051.</p>

<p><a href="https://authid.ai/">authID.ai</a> has announced a slew of new hires and high-level executive appointments. The company is hoping that the new faces will fuel its expansion and accelerate the growth of its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/authid-ai-provides-biometric-onboarding-and-identity-verification-hamilton-reserve-bank-102803/">digital identity verification business</a>.</p>



  



<p>The new hires are Christabel Bugla and Brittney Liburd, who join the company as the new Vice President of Customer Success and the new Senior Product Marketing Manager, respectively. Bulga previously served as the Director of Customer Success at Prove, and has extensive experience in the identity industry following stints with Socure and Jumio. Liburd, meanwhile, has been developing authentication and security marketing programs for over a decade, and will be asked to push authID.ai’s technology to businesses in new markets. Bulga, on the other hand, will manage the company’s relationships with existing clients.</p>



<p>Grace de Fries and Max Umarov are the company’s new internal appointments. de Fries has acted as Chief of Staff for the past five years, and will now be taking on a new challenge as the Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Umarov has been with the company for more than ten years, and contributed to a <a href="http://Vice%20President%20of%20Solution%20Engineering">patent that authID.ai received</a> for a new biometric transaction system. He will be asked to maintain the company’s product pipeline as the new Vice President of Solution Engineering.</p>



<p>Finally, authID.ai Founder and Chief Solutions Architect&nbsp;Tom Szoke will be moving on to a role as Founder Emeritus. Szoke had previously served as Director, CEO, and COO since co-founding Innovation in Motion in 2009.</p>



<p>“To realize our vision of transforming identity authentication, we want to first foster an inclusive, winning culture,” said authID.ai CEO Tom Thimot. “To that end, our leadership team has recruited exceptionally qualified talent in key positions to deliver products based on ethical AI that better serve the marketplace and broader society. I am proud of the global cohort of experts we have built, and I look forward to collaborating with each of them to give our customers a more convenient and secure path to identity verification.”</p>



<p>authID.ai noted that more than half of the new execs are women and/or people of color, which is in keeping with the company’s broader diversity initiatives. The company also added <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/four-new-faces-join-authid-ai-board-directors-062903/">four new people to its Board of Directors</a> in June, while Thimot and President and CTO Tripp Smith signed on to their roles with the company’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ipsidy-rebrands-as-authid-with-new-leadership-at-helm/">rebrand from Ipsidy</a> earlier that same month.</p>

 From open-sourcing our Veriscope travel rule solution to partnerships with industry players like Tether and Panther Protocol, our team has been busy building the future of trust and compliance in blockchain. <p>What a few months it’s been for Shyft Network! We want to extend a big thanks to our entire community and partners who’ve contributed to many of our recent partnerships, updates, and key announcements. We have many exciting things — from long-awaited partnerships to product upgrades, DAO, and community campaigns — that will wrap up the year and take us into the next chapter of our journey building trust and validation into blockchain data.</p><p>To mark the end of the quarter, we’re taking some time to recap what’s happened since the summer, plus a tease of what’s to come. Thanks for being&nbsp;here!</p> The Shyft Federation Deploys the Shyft Bridge — and Signed the Constitution! <p>The Shyft Node Federation, our collective of Shyft Network validator nodes, has been hard at work since its official deployment in July of 2021. In early September, we announced the Fed had officially deployed the Shyft Bridge, a secure and efficient cross-blockchain asset transfer mechanism. The collaboration between the Shyft Node Federation and Chainsafe offers users the ability to deploy the Shyft Bridge between the Shyft Network and Ethereum to support minimal cross-asset transmission and minimal cost cross-chain smart-contract operations. <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-federation-deploys-the-shyft-bridge-65f64afa3cad">Read more about the Shyft&nbsp;Bridge.</a></p><p>Earlier in the month, the Shyft Node Federation, including CoinShares, Maven11, Fabric, ClicketyClack, Connect Capital, AD Node, Staking Team, Merkle Trading, BlockUnity, Paycase Financial, DeFi Technologies, Mempool Partners, Nodebased, NP IR, and others, publicly signed off on voting guidelines and node rights and responsibilities. This document included many of the ground rules that would enable improvement protocols and a framework for new nodes to enter the&nbsp;Network.</p><p>We’d like to again recognize and thank the entire Node Federation member network for their commitment to the highest level of trust in blockchain, our Network, and community.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/read-it-now-the-shyft-node-federation-constitution-is-public-c6b8957492d7">Read more about the Node Federation Constitution.</a></p> Tether Is Testing and Integrating Veriscope — Now Open-Sourced and Free to&nbsp;Use!​​ <p>On November 18, we shared the incredibly exciting news that leading stablecoin Tether (owned by Bitfinex) had begun testing and integrating Versicope. Tether’s integration kicks off the first stage in their trial of Veriscope, which will allow them to offer their customers a privacy-focused experience while also solving global compliance requirements for all participants across the ecosystem. <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-federation-deploys-the-shyft-bridge-65f64afa3cad">Read more&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>Tether’s Veriscope testing follows our announcement (<a href="http://tether">and FATF’s latest regulatory guidance</a>) from earlier in November that Shyft Network has officially open-sourced the Versicope technology, making it free and simpler than ever for people to use. This update, which serves to democratize access to compliance technology for the entire blockchain community, came only two months after we shared the<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf?source=user_profile---------10-------------------------------"> latest list</a> of exchanges involved in the phased deployment of Veriscope on our Network.

In early November, Yahoo News got the scoop about our strategic partnership with the Panther team to accelerate the development of privacy-enhancing technologies, data protection tooling, and mission-critical data attestation services.</p><p>On the Shyft Network side, we’ll provide value to Panther Protocol through enterprise and government compliance and data attestation services, resulting from deploying Panther to Shyft Network’s Layer 1. This update is a direct solution for ensuring that institutional dark pools remain compliant while also private — a significant win for addressing issues of front-running and algorithm obfuscation amidst mass adoption in DeFi. Through this partnership and integrations, Shyft Network and Panther will continuously work together to advance privacy tech and collectively raise the bar on the state of data protection tools.</p><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/panther-protocol-shyft-network-partner-155046978.html">Read the full Panther Announcement.</a></p><p>The Panther news followed August’s <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-partners-with-kylin-network-to-deploy-data-oracles-for-compliant-defi-infrastructure-fcc2c7c3a233">partnership announcement</a> with Kylin Network, who we’re working alongside to deploy data oracles for complaint DeFi Infrastructure for Financial Institutions.

<p>A new study suggests that the American public is quite willing to use biometric technology. However, that willingness is conditional, to the extent that people are more comfortable with certain use cases than they are with others.</p>



  



<p>The findings come courtesy of a study published in&nbsp;<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9576819">IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society</a>. The results reflect the responses of a representative sample of 4,048 US adults, captured over the course of two weeks at the tail end of 2020.</p>



<p>Digging into the details, the researchers found that Americans are <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-fingerprint-authentication-survey-307144/">still most comfortable with fingerprints</a>, though the majority is ultimately ready to embrace any forms of biometrics. 74.8 percent are happy to use fingerprints, while 55.6 percent would submit their DNA. Other modalities fall somewhere in between, with stronger support for voice (66.2 percent) and handprints (63 percent), and less support for face (61.1 percent) and iris recognition (60.6 percent).</p>



<p>The catch is that many people were only comfortable with biometric identification in select situations. Most (67.1 percent) feel fine when using their face or a fingerprint to unlock a smartphone, but a majority are uncomfortable with the thought of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech-mahindra-signs-on-vsblty-smart-retail-project-latin-america-061006/">retailers tracking people in a store</a> to hit them with targeted advertisements. The respondents were similarly wary of biometrics in customer reward schemes and homeowner association monitoring programs.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, respondents are more willing to trust medical researchers, healthcare providers, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idemia-releases-cloud-fingerprint-abis-law-enforcement-091601/">law enforcement</a> and intelligence agencies with biometric data. They were more mistrustful of retailers, tech companies, advertisers, and other government agencies. Having said that, the margins are slim, with just over half of the population sitting with the majority in each case.</p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-technology-rally-testing-showed-racial-bias-worsened-by-face-masks-dhs-708271/">evidence of racial bias</a> in some systems, the researchers did not find any significant correlation between characteristics like race and gender and someone’s attitude toward biometrics. They did notice that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ut-austin-study-familiarity-breeds-comfort-biometrics-505082/">those who were already familiar with a modality</a> were more comfortable with that technology, though they did not know whether or not exposure made people more comfortable, or if people who were more comfortable were simply more likely to give biometrics a shot.</p>



<p>Those who were uncomfortable with biometric tech cited privacy, government oversight, and data storage and data sharing as their primary concerns. In any case, the researchers found that the use case had a bigger impact on the public’s opinion than the specific modality being used.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a> is looking to strengthen its position in the UK market. The company <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idnow-boasts-of-eightfold-growth-in-uk-amid-selfie-onboarding-boom-711117/">reported eight-fold growth</a> in the country earlier this month, and it is now trying to build on that through a new channel partnership with <a href="https://www.sphonic.com/">Sphonic</a>.</p>



  



<p>Sphonic is an established provider of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) solutions. The company’s portfolio is able to monitor transactions in real time to watch for signs of fraud. It can also reference other third-party data sources during onboarding to make sure that a customer’s personal information is legitimate.</p>



<p>Thanks to the partnership with IDnow, Sphonic will be able to supplement that with an extra layer of biometric identity verification. IDnow is best known as a provider of selfie-based onboarding technology, and Sphonic will be offering the IDnow solution to potential customers as part of a comprehensive onboarding and fraud prevention platform.</p>



<p>The joint Sphonic and IDnow solution will be delivered through a single unified API, which will simplify identity verification for client organizations. The two companies noted that the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/maxine-most-warns-about-rough-waters-ahead-surging-idv-marketplace-111903/">demand for digital onboarding solutions has skyrocketed</a> in the past two years, as businesses prioritized digital transformation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In that regard, they cited a Gartner report that suggests that the percentage of organizations that use a single identity vendor will jump from less than 15 percent in 2021 to 75 percent by 2023.</p>



<p>“By partnering with IDnow, we are able to offer an integrated solution that brings all identity profiles into one place for more intelligent identity scoring,” said Sphonic founder Andy Lee. “When combined with its relationships with European regulators, IDnow was the ideal choice as we continue to deliver great customer experiences to the highest standards of compliance.”</p>



<p>IDnow is based in Germany, though it set up offices in London and Manchester back in 2019. The company <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idnow-to-acquire-fellow-biometric-onboarding-specialist-ariadnext-706301/">announced the acquisition</a> of the French onboarding provider ARIADNEXT in June, and then <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idnow-focuses-on-digital-wallets-newest-member-idunion-070901/">joined the IDunion</a> in July.</p>

<p>A new Apple patent suggests that the tech giant could be looking to expand its wearable portfolio. The company already offers AirPods and the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-highlights-bigger-screen-new-fitness-features-with-apple-watch-series-7-091506/">Apple Watch</a>, and is now tinkering with a system that could extend connected utility to a wide range of new devices.</p>



  



<p>The patent specifically details a “wearable loop with embedded circuitry.” In plain terms, the invention is essentially a fabric cord with a wire running through it. The cord would be fitted with a housing unit that contains additional sensors and circuitry, or even a display depending on the device.</p>



<p>That singular concept is flexible enough to be integrated into a number of different designs. For example, the cord could be used to make a smart bracelet or a necklace, or be woven into a key ring or a door knob hoop. The latter two seem like they could be stretching the definition of ‘wearable,’ but nevertheless illustrate the variety of potential applications.</p>



<p>In terms of utility, the system could be used to track someone’s location, or to <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/new-apple-watch-app-can-track-your-reps-at-the-gym/">gather activity and health data</a> in a manner similar to an Apple Watch. That information could be used for biometric identification in some scenarios.</p>



<p>The actual features available in each device would ultimately depend on the hardware in the housing unit. A device with a display and speakers could provide audio and visual output, while others could provide haptic feedback. Some wearables could be used to send and receive messages, while others could allow wearers to interact with Augmented Reality applications. For instance, someone could use their hand to move an object that appears in an AR space, or to select an object in the same way that they would press an icon on an iPhone.</p>



<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that Apple will bring any of those concepts to commercial markets, though it seems likely that the company will advance at least some of these ideas based on its longstanding interest in the wearable space. Apple has already <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-receives-patent-smart-ring-device-101508/">patented technology for a smart ring</a>, and it is also working on an <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-patent-application-details-eye-tracking-solution-vr-headsets-092105/">eye-tracking system for VR headsets</a>. <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/new-apple-patent-explores-silent-voice-recognition-for-future-airpods-111301/">Other patents</a> could <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-airpods-could-use-microphones-track-respiration-081608/">increase the number of biometric features</a> in future AirPod products.</p>

He introduced the guests and talked briefly about the concepts of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, and the role of Affinidi in this&nbsp;space.</p> COVID Verification Solutions by Toby&nbsp;Berger <p>Toby Berger started by reminding us of the COVID pandemic in the early 2020s and how it impacted people and disrupted industries and businesses. He opined that this also pushed businesses to explore new horizons, especially those involved in the travel industry, as the complexity of operations increased with quarantines and vaccinations.</p><p>He explained that this situation also brought up the need for a verification solution that enabled verifiers like government and airport authorities to safely and securely check the vaccination status of travelers, so steps can be taken accordingly to prevent the spread of&nbsp;COVID.</p><p>After detailed discussions with governments and other stakeholder, Affinidi Travel identified a bunch of common considerations that included:</p>  Interoperability across global standards and&nbsp;formats.  A competitive and unified&nbsp;pricing  Ease of integration with existing solutions  A flexible rules engine that supports global safe travel regulations  A simple and intuitive UI  An underlying trust network that connects to a global support group of industry&nbsp;peers.  <p>Based on these inputs, the CommonCheck solution was built, and it offered the following benefits for&nbsp;users.</p><p>With these thoughts on how Affinidi’s verifiable solution is shaping the travel industry, Toby ended his&nbsp;session.</p> Affinidi Travel Demo — Shankar&nbsp;Pillai <p>Shankar started his interesting session by explaining the in-depth architecture of the system to give the audience an idea of how the common considerations mentioned by Toby earlier were integrated into the system to give all users the benefits of a verification solution.</p><p>Here’s a look at the architecture.</p><p>This explanation was followed by a demo of the live&nbsp;system.</p><p>The CommonCheck application of the Affinidi Travel Ecosystem comes with a simple UI that takes information from users and creates a VC that can be shared with anyone as a QR code. This VC is trusted as it is issued by a company that is authorized to test for COVID and also, it is tamper-proof, so the results can’t be changed by the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>Shankar showcased the simplicity and ingenuity of the application and ended his session by saying that this product can be used as an API as&nbsp;well.</p> Walkthrough of the Affinidi Tech Stack — Kamal&nbsp;Laungani <p>The last part of the webinar was handled by Kamal where he walked the attendees through the <a href="https://affinidi.com/api">Affinidi tech stack</a> and how it can be leveraged to build VC-based applications. He also did a demo of <a href="https://schema.affinidi.com/">Affinidi’s Schema Manager</a> and how it can be integrated with any application.</p><p>He even showed the audience how to issue a VC for attending the&nbsp;webinar!</p> Q&amp;A Session <p>The webinar ended with a Q&amp;A session that saw some interesting questions from the participants.</p><p>Some of the questions that were asked&nbsp;were,</p>  Does Affinidi support the Good Health Pass Collaborative standard?  How are you managing integration with Gvt systems for verification / entry /&nbsp;exit  Recently tried issuing a VC via YourEdge app. Aside from Email Addresses, are there any other means to write and deliver a VC to someone without knowing their email&nbsp;address?  Is Affinidi launching any&nbsp;token?  How can we invest in affinidi?  <p>Toby, Shankar, and Kamal came together to answer these questions.</p><p>Overall, it was an insightful session that showed a practical implementation of verifiable credentials. We are confident that this webinar will enthuse more <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/the-journey-of-an-ssi-developer-6ef4f642779c">developers</a> and businesses to integrate a verifiable solution into their operations.</p><p>If you’re a developer or someone who wants to build an SSI application, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> to explore how the Affinidi tech stack can ease your development process.</p><p>Also, <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a> and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a> for more such exciting&nbsp;events.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/webinar-recap-how-digital-credentials-can-help-unlock-safe-travels-beyond-covid-bde49c7ca018">Webinar Recap: How digital credentials can help unlock safe travels beyond COVID?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In partnership with its Slovakian compatriot Softec, <a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/">Innovatrics</a> has implemented its selfie onboarding technology in a new solution aimed specifically at telecommunications companies.</p>



<p>The solution, dubbed “NFINITY” is designed to help telcoms register customers using eSIM cards – next-generation SIM cards whose subscriptions can be managed remotely. Fittingly, NFINITY is meant to facilitate remote customer identity verification, ensuring that eSIM users don’t need to take their physical SIM cards into stores when making changes to their telecommunications subscriptions.</p>



<p>To that end, NFINITY functions in much the same way as the other selfie onboarding solutions that have been booming in popularity in recent years, especially in the financial services sector. An end user is asked to submit a selfie photo along with an image of their official ID (such as a driver’s license), and facial recognition technology is used to match the two together.</p>



<p>The biometric technology in this case was developed by Innovatrics, and the company has made strenuous efforts to ensure that its tech is state of the art. Just a couple of months ago, Innovatrics announced that its Digital Onboarding Toolkit – the core of the NFINITY onboarding solution – <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-selfie-id-verification-solution-can-now-read-all-icao-9303-passports-7102101/">had been upgraded</a> to enable it to read any document meeting the ICAO 9303 standard. The company went on two add <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-adds-two-new-algorithms-passive-liveness-detection-platform-102805/">two new algorithms</a> to its Presentation Attack Detection solution, which backs up DOT’s security by watching for signs that a given end user is attempting to fool the biometric system with synthetic elements.</p>



<p>Softec says its new solution has already been embraced by multiple clients, including O2 Slovakia, whose Head of Segment Marketing, Kristián Baráti, was effusive in praise for NFINITY. “Thanks to NFINITY we managed to create one of the fastest and most streamlined eKYC onboarding processes in the world and successfully continued to challenge the status quo on the market,” he said.</p>



<p>NFINITY is the result of a longstanding collaboration between Innovatrics and Softec, with the two companies having worked together on a digital onboarding solution for Slovakian banking firm Tatra banka back in 2017.</p>



<p>“Thanks to our long-standing technological cooperation and many projects together, we were able to build and launch NFINTY.digital fully in the cloud, navigate the regulatory framework, and deploy it with major banks and telco providers in the SaaS mode,” commented NFINITY Product Owner Andrej Žinka in a statement announcing the solution.</p>

<p>San Francisco-based authentication startup <a href="https://stytch.com/">Stytch</a> has raised $90 million in additional VC funding and has acquired a fellow passwordless authentication startup.</p>



<p>The company has been developing an API and SDK platform to help clients easily implement passwordless authentication into their apps. Notably, it was founded by two former employees of renowned financial IT services provider Plaid – Reed McGinley-Stempel, who served as a Product Manager at the firm, and former Plaid engineer Julianna Lamb.</p>



<p>Stytch raised $30 million in a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/former-plaid-engineers-authentication-startup-raises-30m-in-series-a-80141/">Series A funding round</a> led by Thrive Capital earlier this year. The company said it planned to use the money to fuel R&amp;D activities, and to make important new hires.</p>



<p>Stytch’s just-closed Series B was led by Coatue Management, which also participated in the Series A, and featured contributions from Benchmark Capital, Index Ventures, and, again, Thrive, all of which were involved in the Series A.</p>



<p>“We believe the world of online identity is undergoing a sea change and are impressed with Stytch’s API-driven approach to blending authentication into product experiences,” explained Coatue Management General Partner Lucas Swisher. “We are excited to partner with Stytch as they pioneer us toward a passwordless future.”</p>



<p>In its announcement, Stytch said the funding would be used to enable the company to “continue to build tools and infrastructure” enabling streamlined integration of authentication tools into apps and websites. The company also announced its acquisition of <a href="https://blog.cotter.app/blog/cotter-is-being-acquired-by-stytch">Cotter</a> “[a]s part of the funding”.</p>



<p>Just two years old, Cotter is also a startup <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/features">focused on passwordless authentication</a>, offering tools that enable login via mobile app prompts, One-Time Passwords, magic links, and WebAuthn-based biometric authentication. Stytch explained that the acquisition will combine the two startups’ technologies.</p>



<p>Stytch currently has a user base of over 3,500 developers building solutions using the Stytch platform, according to McGinley-Stempel, who serves as the company’s CEO.</p>

<p><a href="https://loginid.io/">LoginID</a> is getting into the NFT game through a new partnership with <a href="https://nftpro.com/">NFT PRO</a>. As the name would suggest, NFT PRO is an NFT specialist that provides other parties with the tools they need to mint and distribute their own tokens and run their own NFT campaigns.</p>



  



<p>LoginID, on the other hand, is a passwordless authentication specialist, and will be working with NFT PRO to ensure that NFT transactions remain secure. To that end, NFT PRO will integrate the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/loginid-promotes-fido-authentication-with-release-new-sdks-062904/">LoginID SDKs</a> into its own platform to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-loginid-plugin-enables-biometric-login-wordpress-users-75202104/">enable biometric authentication</a> for those participating in NFT transactions. NFT PRO customers will be able to use biometrics to access and recover their accounts, and will also receive a ‘Transaction Confirmation’ whenever they complete a sale. That Confirmation essentially serves as a digital signature that links someone’s biometrics to a transaction and indicates that the authorized individuals were present for the interaction.</p>



<p>The LoginID solution offers <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido2-certified-loginid-announces-several-new-partnerships-071402/">FIDO2 certification</a>, and is compliant with international data protection regulations like GDPR and the PSD2 strong customer authentication standard. In that regard, LoginID takes advantage of the cameras and the biometric scanners that are now built into many smartphones and other IoT devices.</p>



<p>According to LoginID, the added security will help prevent phishing, account takeovers, and NFT theft, which has become a growing concern in light of the industry’s rapid expansion. The NFT market was valued at $141 million in 2019, and passed $1.2 billion in the first half of 2021. It is now expected to climb beyond $2 billion before the end of the year.</p>



<p>“NFTs and their owners are becoming the latest target for hackers,” said&nbsp;LoginID CRO and Co-Founder Jim Brown. “The market is starting to experience more and more of these attacks, and in many cases, the attacks start with vulnerabilities created by the use of weak authentication.”</p>



<p>“Our enterprise clients demand extensive security AND seamless user experience when it comes to their customers buying NFTs,” added NFT PRO CEO&nbsp;Christian Ferri. “LoginID gives our clients the best of both, whether they are selling from their website or the metaverse. This partnership is a natural fit for our white label platform.”</p>



<p>LoginID is currently optimizing its SDKs for use with the Algorand blockchain platform after receiving a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/loginid-gets-grant-develop-authentication-tech-algorand-blockchain-ecosystem-100707/">grant from the Algorand Foundation</a>. Visa has also made an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/visa-pushes-fido-standard-with-loginid-investment-060304/">undisclosed investment</a> in the company.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the 14th interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/a7izaidi">Polaris</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English</a> community.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I have been a Neo supporter, and from the Neo reddit group I found out about Ontology and the airdrop which was given to Neo holders. Unfortunately, I left it very late to sign up for the newsletter, so I missed the 1000 ONT airdrop and only got a small amount of ONT from holding my NEO’s. I was fascinated when I looked at Ontology’s whitepaper, and how they envision an extremely fast blockchain for businesses and identity as the main USP. I think after reading the whitepaper, I was convinced that the way Ontology envision the future is the right way, andthat drew me towards&nbsp;Ontology</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>The ever-evolving blockchain industry is still at an early stage where a combination of many variables make up the whole industry. We have managed to understand how a decentralized distributed ledger works, how to create smart contracts on that distributed ledger, and to create content and immortalize it on the blockchain. However, identity is not something which the industry is fully focused on, instead a more anarchical utopia is often created where no one has a connection to identity and these ideologies iterate that somehow the worlds economy will run fine with a rogue infrastructure. I think the fact that Ontology has focused on identity and decentralized trust from the very beginning gives me a clear indicator that the theme is to bring real use cases from the technology, and that’s what really excites me because real use cases of the blockchain will promote a smart economy, a fairer and more transparent economy, while not having to compromise our privacy. This eventually will translate to an economy which will run on centralized and decentralized platforms, and being part of that future is something I always wanted to do. The fact that my understanding of technology usage is aligned with Ontologies vision, makes me want to be a champion of the&nbsp;brand.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I love the word Harbinger, it means someone who initiates changes. Being given the freedom to bring ideas to the table, while receiving all the support I need, is something I cherish greatly. The key role, from my point of view, is to represent Ontology and bridge the gap between the community and the team. To establish deeper connections with the community. To be able to get the general sentiment from the community about the project and be able to relay that onto the team. To think of innovative idea to further drive user/community engagement. To think of innovative ideas to educate about the industry and the eco system in&nbsp;general.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Being part of any community is something we as humans have been deeply ingrained to do. We have always been very tribal towards our culture, geographical location, genetics etc. Now, we are beginning to realize that those things don’t matter and the only way forward is to be as one. We need to be more integrated towards how we do business and how we interact. Ontology’s vision and global community gives me that feeling of belonging, where my understanding of the future is the same as a lot of others. That is why this community is important for&nbsp;me.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Well, we all want a decentralized future but we all also want our assets to be pegged with real life identity so that there is some sort of legal connection with the asset. If the future will be using blockchain technology, then I cannot see that happening without identity and trust. Without these two factors, future adoption will be halted. I think a lot of members from the community agree on this. So having realistic expectation of the future is what makes this community stand out. They support decentralized identity and having full control of one’s&nbsp;data.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>Currently I am using real life interactions with business owners and corporations. I’m trying to make them understand the benefits of using blockchain, not just as a store of value but as a precursor towards a completely new, fairer industry. I also use telegram, discord, and twitter spaces for my socials. Absolutely I would like to see more educational videos on YouTube and all other platforms.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>I have had many memorable experiences being part of the eco system, I have been part of the community in all the ups and downs and to be honest it’s been a great journey so far. I remember not seeing my tokens on my wallet once and being supported by the community, it was a UI problem which eventually got sorted. Along the journey I have learnt so much from all the other admins/harbingers, and without their support I don’t think I would be a harbinger today. So my advice to all new community members/potential harbingers would be to not be afraid to ask and learn, we are here to support everyone and equip them with the correct knowledge and support so they can resonate on that with&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Global, Passionate, Loyal</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>I am quite happy with the way the current community engagement works. To improve it even further, we might need to think about more innovative ways. Things like a NFT marketplace, where artist and musicians mint their work using Ontology’s blockchain, or having a monthly roundup on twitter&nbsp;spaces.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>The completion of EVM would be a huge milestone for Ontology, and with that the eco system will attract a lot of developers and blockchain enthusiasts. The community needs to be ready to help and educate the new members about the benefits of DID, OSCORE, and cheap transaction costs, all while controlling their privacy. If all the Harbingers and members of the community keep the user engagement high, that will ensure that this technology can be widely accepted by the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>With advancing technology, many companies have switched from orthodox authentication methods to cutting-edge biometric authentication and its components. Fingerprint, facial, and palm recognition remain the most common types, biometric voice recognition has seen a rise.&nbsp;</p>



 What is Biometric Voice Recognition? 



<p>Biometric Voice Recognition is the use of the human voice to uniquely identify biological characteristics to authenticate an individual unlike passwords or tokens that require physical input.</p>



  



<p>Massive advances in neural network technology have led to the development of voice biometrics that are faster and more accurate than other methods. These biometric voice recognition systems have access to larger use cases and can identify an individual with less amount of speech samples.&nbsp;</p>



 Where is the Voice Biometric Market Heading? 



  
  The market size of biometric voice recognition is expected to grow from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/voice-biometrics-market-104503105.html">$1.1 billion USD</a> in 2020 to $3.9 billion USD by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 22.8% during the forecast period.&nbsp;  



  Due to insufficient security features, device interactions in the finance sector are limited. Fraud attacks against financial institutions have increased by <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/voice-biometrics-market">269%</a> over the previous four years, more than most other industries investigated.&nbsp;  



  Financial institutions are likely to employ voice recognition in combination with their speech-recognition applications in the future.  
  



 How Does Biometric Voice Recognition Work? 



<p>Voice biometric recognition works by inputting the the voice of the individual whose identity has to be stored in the system. This input is kept as a print for authentication. The input print is made with software that can split the voice statement into multiple frequencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://imageware.io/behavioral-biometrics/">Behavioral attributes</a> are identified at this stage that work mutually to make up the voice print. Voice recognition is much like iris or fingerprint recognition. Each one is unique to an individual and cannot be duplicated. These prints are stored in the database for further authentication.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a text independent system focuses and matches unfamiliar speech with previously stored voice information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two types of voice authentication:</p>



<p>Text-independent recognition: The system does not keep any pre-recorded audio to compare with the input in this case. It’s a voice authentication approach that doesn’t require any prior speech material to be entered into the biometric system. It is far more practical because it allows for free speech.</p>



<p>Text-dependent recognition: This necessitates the repetition of a previously delivered sentence that has been stored in the system, posing a speech content limitation.</p>



 Voice Biometrics Use-Cases 



<p>Voice biometric recognition has multiple use cases. Some of them are:</p>



 Contact Centre 



<p>The contact center industry is perhaps the most common application of speech biometrics. By avoiding the laborious security questions at the start of every customer service interaction, using voice to verify and authenticate callers saves time and effort for both the consumer and the agent.</p>



 Fraud Detection 



<p>Voice biometrics is a powerful fraud-detection tool. Multi-factor authentication is increasingly being used to prevent unauthorised access to client data or financial resources, since identity theft is on the rise. Voice biometrics offers a safe, spoof-resistant authentication mechanism.</p>



 Financial Services  



<p>In recent years, the global financial services market has seen significant changes. Customers’ lives have been made easier by mobile banking and other FinTech alternatives, but there has also been an increase in danger. Thousands of verifications a day, in many languages, are processed using voice biometrics.</p>



 Digital Signatures 



<p>Voice biometrics can be used to establish voice signatures, which are a legally binding means of underwriting documents like life insurance contracts. Financial transactions can also be authorised using voice signatures.</p>



 Workforce Management 



<p>The use of voice biometrics in workforce management apps is currently commonplace. Speech verification is a secure alternative to badging systems for organisations with a big, scattered workforce.</p>



 Advantages of Biometric Voice Recognition 



 1. Low Operational Costs 



<p>Call centres and even banks can save money by using voice authentication. It saves them millions of dollars by eliminating many of the steps necessary in traditional verification methods. It can recognise the customer’s voice during an end-to-end chat to authenticate their identity without the need for customary inquiries.</p>



 2.Enhanced User Experience 



<p>Another advantage of voice biometric systems that is often neglected is that they have the ability to greatly improve customer experiences. Callers no longer need to offer passcodes, PINs, or answer challenge questions to verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This makes speech biometrics perfect for omnichannel and multichannel deployments, as a customer’s voiceprint can be used across all of your company’s support channels once they’ve been enrolled.</p>



 3. Increased Accuracy 



<p>Voice authentication is more accurate and trustworthy than passwords, which are easy to forget, modify, or guess. It’s similar to fingerprints, which no one else can have. In other words, unlike passwords, you cannot forget or reproduce a voice. Despite the fact that the sound may be impacted by a variety of things, it is far more reliable and convenient.</p>



 4. Easy to Implement Technology 



<p>Many businesses value the simplicity of voice recognition biometrics in terms of use and implementation. Some biometric technology can be challenging to integrate into a business and to get started with. However, voice biometric systems can usually be implemented without additional equipment or systems because they require so little.</p>



<p>Because this technology is so simple to use, companies can often reassign personnel elsewhere in the organisation to boost performance and customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>Voice authentication is a great way to verify a user’s identification since it adds additional layers of protection that manual pass codes might not provide. Voice authentication is beneficial for both customers and the business as it removes frustration associated with cumbersome login processes.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/11/05/a-national-data-privacy-regulation-is-good-for-business/?sh=32473f1b3222">Forbes Technology Council</a>&nbsp;has said a national data privacy regulation could save companies time and money and help them focus on business success and customer satisfaction rather than get lost in the maze of privacy regulation and compliance. 



<p></p>



<p>We completely agree.</p>



<p>Most commentators agree the US data privacy regulatory landscape is shambolic. Only&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-and-why-you-must-still-keep-control-of-your-personal-information/">California</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/07/colorado-passes-consumer-data-privacy-law/">Colorado</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1392">Virginia</a>&nbsp;have passed state laws, while a raft of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">other state regulations</a>&nbsp;are on the table but not yet passed. A national data privacy law was&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">looking promising</a>&nbsp;earlier this year but is now widely considered a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/">way off</a>.</p>



<p>But the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/11/05/a-national-data-privacy-regulation-is-good-for-business/?sh=32473f1b3222">Forbes Technology Council</a>&nbsp;points out the already heavy compliance burden (financial and operational) on businesses will only increase when these laws pass. Compliance with the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/report-finds-organizations-may-spend-55b-in-initial-ccpa-compliance-costs/">CCPA</a>and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cybersecurity-privacy-forensics/library/privacy-reset.html">GDPR</a>&nbsp;is proving hugely costly, according to PwC, since laws worldwide differ just enough to demand businesses stay aware of their obligations and implement the systems they think will be protective enough across all regulations or at least the most challenging one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forbes says the hardest hit will be the mid-market enterprises and non-profit organizations that don’t have the resources to keep up.</p>



<p>Forbes rightly asks: “How will businesses manage the nuanced differences among them, and how much time will this take? Will they face multiple fines for the same incident? What happens if the regulations have conflicting provisions? Does any company really want to restrict business activity while it wastes time in court defending how it struggled to resolve conflicts between different privacy regulations?”</p>



 Everything points to the solution being a unified, national data privacy law, to bring cohesion to an otherwise time-consuming and resource-intensive mess. 



<p></p>



<p>We are seeing some data privacy progress in the US, such as President Biden’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3638750/biden-s-cybersecurity-executive-order-progress-report.html">cybersecurity executive orders</a>&nbsp;and more&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/consumers-could-gain-from-ftcs-stronger-focus-on-data-protection/">privacy-oriented commissioners</a>&nbsp;appointed to the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>Forbes says businesses are suffering dreadful inertia and doing nothing or very little while they wait for a national law, which will hurt both the business and its customers in the long term, especially via major&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;which aren’t reducing in size or frequency. Data breaches not only put consumers at risk; they make consumers doubt companies and governments and increasingly reject the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">data surveillance business model</a>&nbsp;and data access&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers don’t like or trust</a>.</p>



<p>Forbes says businesses that do try to do the right thing pay for it in development costs and legal fees as they flounder around trying to work out which requirements are important to their business.</p>



<p>It’s a no-brainer then when Forbes concludes “… only a sensible national privacy regulation” can help businesses to see which technologies and processes they need to protect both their business and their customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, as we do here at Anonyome Labs, Forbes reminds companies it’s still up to them to stay vigilant and proactive in protecting their customers’ data privacy while the country waits for the national data privacy law saga to come to a successful end.</p>



<p>One of Forbes’ suggestions is for companies to “build a top-down, data-driven culture of privacy based on zero trust, data encryption and the ethical use of data.”</p>

 Highlights <p>The Ontology global community is constantly growing, with membership now close to 110,000. More and more Ontology contributors are working together for the long-term, healthy development of Ontology projects. This week, another Ontology member from the English community became an Ontology Harbinger. We currently have 14 enthusiastic Ontology Harbingers, who come from all over the world and work in different fields. They are active in different language communities of Ontology, including English, Filipino, Hindi, etc. They share their ideas, organize various community activities, and are committed to building a better Ontology ecosystem.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet and are 93% finished with testing. At the same time, a large number of community developers are actively participating in the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Security Vulnerabilities and Threat Intelligence Bounty Program</a>”, launched by Ontology and SlowMist.  We have finalized Ethereum RPC support and have fully completed internal testing. The TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 93% done with&nbsp;testing.  We have completed 100% of Ontology’s Ethereum account system development and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 94% done with&nbsp;testing.  The EVM/OEP-4 asset seamless transfer technical solution, which facilitates the efficient conversion between OEP-4 assets and EVM assets, is complete and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 95% done with&nbsp;testing.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the decimals of ONT and ONG and we are in the process of internal&nbsp;testing.  The ontology-go-sdk and ontology-java-sdk support ONT and ONG decimals&nbsp;updates.  We are 10% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.   Product Development   ONTO App v4.1.1 was released, adding support for the Harmony Chain, wallet switching function for dApps supporting multiple chains, and support for configuration of token&nbsp;unit.  ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://theontoteam.medium.com/60c8fb4fcc08">BabySwap</a>, the first 100 participants, and top 20 participants who stake the most will receive the highest tier of rewards. Voting for ONTO in BabySwap also has a chance to get extra rewards. The event is in progress, and will end at 07:59 (Singapore time) on November&nbsp;27th.    ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-x-mcdex-host-trading-campaign-over-6000-up-for-grabs-7785f0dbabec">MCDEX</a>, the first 300 participants will receive rich rewards.

Participants who meet certain conditions will have the chance to enter a lottery. The event is in progress, and will end at 17:00 (Singapore time) on November&nbsp;24th.   On-Chain Activity   121 total dApps on MainNet as of November 22th,&nbsp;2021.  6,823,269 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 6,162 from last&nbsp;week.  16,733,530 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 26,331 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   1,295 new members joined our global community this week, and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1461272979376160769?s=20">Geoff Richards</a> from the English community officially became a Ontology Harbinger. This excellent community member will bring more new energy to our community, and also welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join&nbsp;us</a>.  Ontology published the next couple of interviews in its Harbinger Series. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-geoff-2cfe6bbc5f2">Geoff Richards</a> from our English community said that compared with other blockchain communities, members of the Ontology community are more willing to help people by sharing their own experiences. The community also attaches great importance to the voice of each member, and can listen to their problems, suggestions and various solutions in&nbsp;time.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1461416416788328448?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He focused on how decentralized identity empowers the metaverse; The metaverse requires the unity and integrity of our identities. Ontology’s decentralized identity solution can be seamlessly integrated into metaverse games to generate a unified identity based on the user’s behavior, which is convenient for users to use in various&nbsp;games.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1460190696451624960?s=20">Telegram weekly Community Call</a>, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about Ontology’s Staking strategy and upcoming 4th anniversary NFT event; Community members expressed their great anticipation for this extraordinary commemorative event.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Forbes — <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seansteinsmith/2021/11/08/crypto-is-the-key-to-the-metaverse/?sh=7ea96ad91e94&amp;utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=5893818776&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesCrypto">Crypto Is The Key To The Metaverse</a></p><blockquote>The promise of the metaverse is that it will provide users an augmented reality experience that — in many ways — might exceed physical reality in terms of the experiences and opportunities therein. What is oftentimes missing from the discussions around the potential of the metaverse is how all of this information will be secured and protected. Specifically, if an individual or group of individuals are going to be engaging with other people in a virtual environment there needs to be some form of assurance that these transactions are&nbsp;secure.</blockquote><blockquote>Hacks and data breaches occur on a frequent basis, but if people are going to be expected to engage in a wholly online and virtual environment, the underlying platform on which they are going to be using needs to be&nbsp;secure.</blockquote><p>After long-term practice, the Ontology Decentralized Identity (DID) solution has been proven to be able to achieve strong privacy protection, and can seamlessly integrate various applications and platforms. This means that applications in the field of Metaverse can make up for their own deficiencies in privacy protection by integrating Ontology DID solutions, and attract more users to join&nbsp;them.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.
