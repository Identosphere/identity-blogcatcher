<p>This article was written by Mike Truppa, a content developer and blockchain expert at Webstacks, a <a href="https://www.webstacks.com/">website and marketing operations agency</a> helping high-growth SaaS, FinTech, and Blockchain startups&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Passwordless authentication is the future of online security, and promises a future where users don’t need to remember username and password combinations, spend time resetting passwords, and worry about the security of their personal and financial information being&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>Passwordless authentication is a fundamental shift in how people will access their tools and information online, and it will provide more security, prevent billions in losses, and create greater transparency.</p><p>Let’s explore the different types of passwordless technology and compare a few companies offering passwordless authentication software.</p> What is Passwordless Authentication? <p>Passwordless authentication is a method for verifying an internet user’s identity without requiring a password.</p><p>Types of passwordless authentication methods in use today including, magic links, one-time passwords (OTP), biometric authentication, and public-private key pairs using blockchain technology.</p>Diagram of how passwordless authentication solutions work. Is two-factor authentication (2FA) passwordless authentication? <p>Because the nature of two-factor authentication (2FA) is to add an additional layer of security to passwords, it can sometimes be mis-categorized as passwordless authentication.</p><p>However, 2FA methods such as <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/building-sms-authentication-c2cabccbd5f8">SMS-based authentication</a> would still be considered a one-time password which is a form of passwordless authentication.</p> 3 Types of Passwordless Authentication that Eliminate Single Points of Failure from Centralized PAP-based Authentication <p>Today’s password authentication protocols (PAP) are designed with centralized intermediaries or organizations that maintain a database of username-password pairs to prove a user’s identity.</p><p>The central point of failure of PAP-based authentication puts people at risk of hacks, data breaches, identity theft, fraud, and leaks, all of which can be mitigated with passwordless authentication.</p> 1. Public-Key Cryptography and Blockchain Authentication <p>Public key cryptography is a form of public and private key authentication, which has been broadly used in the current information world including WebAuthn, machine-to-machine communication, etc.</p><p>Public-key cryptography has exploded in popularity in the last decade in large part because of public blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana that use public-private cryptography to secure blockchain transactions of digital assets and Non-Fungible Tokens&nbsp;(NFTs).</p><p>Because blockchain technology is built on top of public-key cryptography, they can be confused as one and the same. However, public-key cryptography doesn’t necessitate authentication with a blockchain.</p><p>For example, although <a href="https://magic.link">Magic enables Web 3.0 platforms to connect to public blockchains</a> like Ethereum, throughout the entire authentication flow there is no interaction with the underlying blockchain; no consensus is involved or required to prove the user’s identity.</p> How does blockchain authentication work to prove a person’s identity? <p>Instead of using the traditional method of typing in a username and password, blockchain authentication uses public-key cryptography for self-sovereign identity management.</p><p>When a user creates a wallet account on the blockchain, they receive a private key which only they know, and it is paired with a public key that connects them to the wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>To access Web 3.0 applications or complete blockchain transactions, the user signs transaction requests using their private key which authenticates their account&nbsp;access.</p> How are blockchains secured using public-key authentication? <p>Blockchains have a variety of security mechanisms to protect the integrity of the blockchain and secure user’s information.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work and Ethereum 2.0’s soon to be Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms ensure censorship resistant networks that are practically impossible to&nbsp;hack.</p><p>To hack (i.e. modify transactions on a blockchain’s distributed ledger) a malevolent user would need to control 51% of Bitcoin’s hash power, or more than 33% of Ethereum’s stake.</p><p>For example, the top four Bitcoin mining pools which power Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus, control ~60% of the mining power, and to manipulate the network, all four of these independent miners would need to&nbsp;collude.</p><p>As long as someone does not have access to your private key, it is highly unlikely for someone to access your wallet or impersonate the identity tied to your public-private key&nbsp;pair.</p> 2. Decentralized Authentication <p>Decentralized authentication means no single centralized platform, organization, person, or entity is needed to verify your identity.</p><p>While blockchain authentication has proven to be a strong use case for decentralized authentication, the two are not the same. You don’t need blockchains to use decentralized authentication methods.</p> What is an&nbsp;ITF? <p>Identity Trust Fabric (ITF) is a decentralized mechanism for establishing trust between credentialed users. ITFs act as middlemen by interacting directly with a centralized intermediary.</p><p>For example, an ITF could handle all the identification and access requests needed from a centralized party. ITFs decrease the risks of sending your confidential information to an organization.</p> What are the tradeoffs between decentralized authentication and blockchain authentication? <p>The main argument for using decentralized authentication methods like ITFs instead of blockchain authentication is the speed and cost of using blockchains.</p><p>However, with the emergence of lightning fast layer one blockchains like Solana, layer 2 solutions built to help Ethereum scale transaction throughput like Polygon, blockchains are quickly becoming a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional decentralized authentication protocols.</p><p>ETH 2.0 brought Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and sharding to the scaling conversation. These aren’t bad options as they do increase the L1 transaction throughput, but to reach scalability where there are millions of transactions on the network on any given day, PoS and sharding simply aren’t&nbsp;enough.</p> 3. Distributed Authentication <p>Distributed authentication is a collection of hosts interconnected by a single network. While distributed authentication is the leading choice based on the adoption across the industry, it poses a high amount of<a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/common-flaws-of-distributed-identity-and-authentication-systems.pdf"> security&nbsp;threats</a>.</p> Two Common Flaws in Distributed Authentication <p>Two main flaws with distributed authentication are:</p>  Unconstrained delegation  Unbalanced authority   What is unconstrained delegation? <p>Unconstrained delegation allows some entity to authenticate you as an individual and also authenticate on your behalf (i.e. impersonate, act as you) to another&nbsp;party.</p><p>While unconstrained delegation has benefits such as allowing administrators to update database servers from a web server, it creates an area of exploitation where a hacker with access to admin credentials can unilaterally compromise the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Unconstrained delegation can lead to data breaches, exposing millions of confidential usernames and passwords, causing fraud and potentially billions of damages every&nbsp;year.</p> What is unbalanced authority? <p>Unbalanced authority is when a specific centralized party or system has information that identifies specific principles within the system (e.g.&nbsp;users).</p><p>Unbalanced authority occurs between enterprise businesses where an external business partner is trusted inside the system, allowing them to access company resources.</p><p>When the access granted is over-provisioned it allows external companies access to too much sensitive information that can cause harm to the internal organization and their customers.</p> What type of passwordless authentication does Magic&nbsp;use? <p>Magic uses public-private key authentication. While the authentication flow doesn’t involve interacting with blockchain, Magic’s authentication allows users to interact with blockchains after they are authenticated by binding the authentication to 16+ different blockchain key generation schemes.</p><p>Borrowing security principles from blockchain hardware wallets like Ledger, Magic secures accounts using a combination of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0">hardware wallet security and AWS’s Delegated Key Management</a>.</p><p>Software developers can use Magic plug-and-play Software Developer Kit (SDK) to quickly add magic links secured with public-private key authentication to their application.</p><p>A magic link is a special URL that represents a login URL, typically emailed to users at login. This link contains an embedded token that authorizes users without requiring a username or password. Magic also supports other login methods like SMS, Social Logins, WebAuthn and&nbsp;MFA.</p> The Type of Passwordless Authentication You Choose Will Be Different for Each Application’s Security Requirements <p>Passwordless authentication removes the need to remember passwords and for password managers, and improves upon the security benefits of password-based authentication.</p><p>Scalable passwordless authentication tools like Magic help software developers reduce the complexity of securing their applications, while simultaneously hardening security using the best aspects of public-private key cryptography.</p><p>With the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology transforming every business sector, having the option to <a href="https://magic.link/docs/home">bind authentication with 16+ blockchain key generation schemes</a> helps today’s Web 2.0 companies prepare for the future of Web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>Passwordless authentication isn’t a zero-sum game. Every business has different needs, and not every type of passwordless solution will fit within the regulatory and compliance needs of each business.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/types-of-passwordless-authentication-for-web-3-958062e9d265">3 Types of Passwordless Authentication for Web 3.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Look back at our year of product launches, partnership announcements, educational blogs &amp; more as we kick off a new year for our platform and community <p>What a year, Shyftoshis! We’ve come a long way since the official <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/shyft-federation-launches-shyft-network-150000425.html">launch</a> of the Shyft Network Mainnet in July of 2021. It’s hard to believe how much has happened in only four&nbsp;months.</p><p>We find ourselves in an exciting and undoubtedly challenging time for the entire crypto and blockchain ecosystem. As our world experiences growing institutional adoption, regulation will inevitably increase, leading to even more of a need for compliant solutions and frameworks that maintain privacy and trust — and create opportunity out of these&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Crypto markets are experiencing constant turbulence as global economies navigate before unprecedented inflation rates and the continuous challenges of COVID worldwide. At Shyft Network, we’re hard at work bringing on new partners, exchanges, and governmental bodies who will utilize our attestation framework and Veriscope Travel Rule solution and look to the future of compliance across DeFi and NFTs. We’ve got a lot done in the last year since we published our <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-network-roadmap-ee7c78fbc3ac">roadmap</a> back in April and had a massively successful IDO.</p><p>Below, we’ve listed some highlights from this monumental last year for our platform. Best of luck to everyone in these exciting yet uncertain times. We’re all in this together and share the same space and hope for a positive and productive future. Keep building and looking towards the long-term opportunities around us&nbsp;all.</p><p>We’ll see you in&nbsp;2022!</p> Shyft in the&nbsp;Media <p>We always love to see Shyft Network out in the media and on podcasts spreading our gospel! 2021 saw our fearless leader Joseph Weinberg appear on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7sI5oiNpjKN4p4ohwuNJDr?si=iGYjhSUlSJi0DTw28svzNw&amp;dl_branch=1&amp;nd=1">Decrypt Daily</a> and <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/124362/policy-scoop-with-aislinn-keely-unpacking-the-fatfs-guidance-and-its-impact-on-the-global-crypto-landscape?utm_source=twi">The Block</a> to discuss the newly-released FATF Guidance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cln5aD2p0NM">CryptoCoinShow</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpWmgGP_bM&amp;t=2s">Coin Desk TV,</a> and Charlie Shrem’s Beyond the Base Layer for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9r6Gbc0Keg">deep dive</a> on all things Shyft. Joseph also went on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbn9cn_ssJM&amp;t=276s">Bitcoin Stories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkMn1aJAWM">Cryptonites</a> for a look into our platform, compliance, and lots&nbsp;more.</p><p>Joseph was also featured in an article on Facebook’s Meta and the growing issue of “meta-crime” in <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164497/facebook-metaverse-cybercrime-marc-zuckerberg">New Republic,</a> and a stellar op-ed in Cointelegraph on the future of Compliant NFTs and regulation in the space. To wrap up this monumental year, he also shared some 2022 predictions for the crypto industry and what to watch out for on the regulatory front for Cointelegraph. Thanks for reading (and listening!).</p> A Monumental Year for Veriscope <p>​​2021 was the biggest year yet for the rollout of Versiscope, our Travel Rule solution for exchanges, governments, and businesses. In June, Shyft Network &amp; Veriscope <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-day-the-veriscope-secretariat-responded-to-the-fatf-ab37957746b3?source=user_profile---------14-------------------------------">went public</a> with an official response to FATF’s March guidance, responding section by section with their collective thoughts and constructive feedback to how the guidance can be improved. This helped set the scene for what was to&nbsp;come…</p><p>In November, we shared the <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-federation-deploys-the-shyft-bridge-65f64afa3cad">news</a> that leading stablecoin Tether (owned by Bitfinex) had begun testing and integrating Versicope. Later in the month, we announced that Shyft Network has officially <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pnoP22tJSMu7Uo9RDn4Ks3dkHQvtGIeHHBLi2shf2dA/edit#:~:text=Shyft%20Network%20Core%20Team%20Open%20Sources%20Veriscope%2C%20prepares%20to%20enable%20cross%20solution%20discovery%20to%20Make%20Travel%20Rule%20Compliance%20Open%2C%20Free%2C%20and%20Simpler%20than%20Ever%20%7C%20by%20Shyft%20Network%20%7C%20Nov%2C%202021%20%7C%20Medium">open-sourced</a> the Versicope technology, making it free and simpler than ever for people to use. This update came two months after we shared the<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf?source=user_profile---------10-------------------------------"> latest list</a> of exchanges involved in the phased deployment of Veriscope on our Network. Participating exchanges included Binance, Tether, Deribit, Bitmex, and&nbsp;Huobi.</p> Partnerships, Partnerships, Partnerships <p>In 2021, we shared partnership announcements with <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-partners-with-polkamarkets-to-build-opt-in-compliance-primitives-4d3db776dc39">Oasis Network</a>, <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-partners-with-polygon-matic-to-build-opt-in-compliance-infrastructure-2e56b2e93875">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-partners-with-polkamarkets-to-build-opt-in-compliance-primitives-4d3db776dc39">Polkamarkets</a>, <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-federation-deploys-the-shyft-bridge-65f64afa3cad">Tether</a>, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/panther-protocol-shyft-network-partner-155046978.html">Panther Protocol</a>, <a href="https://chainsafe.io/">Chainsafe</a>, <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-partners-with-kylin-network-to-deploy-data-oracles-for-compliant-defi-infrastructure-fcc2c7c3a233?source=user_profile---------12-------------------------------">Kylin</a>, <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-announces-partnership-with-tapmydata-139718235159">Tapmydata</a>, as well as the lengthy<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf"> list of exchanges</a> that began phased deployment of Veriscope.</p><p>We also we’re thrilled to have seen The Shyft Node Federation, consisting of all validators for the Shyft Network, publicly sign off on voting guidelines and node rights and responsibilities via <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/read-it-now-the-shyft-node-federation-constitution-is-public-c6b8957492d7?source=user_profile---------7-------------------------------">the Shyft Node Federation Constitution. </a>The federation included CoinShares, Maven11, Fabric, ClicketyClack, Connect Capital, AD Node, Staking Team, Merkle Trading, BlockUnity, Paycase Financial, DeFi Technologies, Mempool Partners, Nodebased, NP IR, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>From compliant DeFi, to data, deployment of the Shyft Bridge, and Veriscope testing, we’re proud of the new platform who came on board to build with us. On that front, we’re still just getting started. Look out for tons of new partnership announcements on the way in Q1 of&nbsp;2022.</p> Tokenomics — Part 1, 2, and&nbsp;3 <p>For anyone interested in our Tokenomics, we published a three-part series on the topic on our blog over the last year.

 Scores of illicit vendors are capitalising on vaccine scepticism in Europe and North America by selling counterfeit Covid-19 vaccination and test certificates for Bitcoin. Elliptic’s internal analysis, which has identified at least $100,000 in profits for these vendors, suggests that this lucrative business could be making individual criminals around $15,000 a month.

 Redefining the Metaverse — MetaXar by Xarcade — ProximaX Official&nbsp;Blog  Prelude <p>Discovered by an expedition fleet sheerly by happenstance, the mysterious artifact, known as the Nexus — a massive city complex entirely abandoned — appears to be both an isolated pocketverse as well as a gateway to different routes throughout the multiverse.</p><p>As of now, the Nexus is of unknown origin. Investigations will be conducted ascertaining whether it is alien or man-made.</p><p>Scientists posited that the Nexus is not only a gateway to different realities but different times as&nbsp;well.</p>  Could humans have built the Nexus far into an alternate future timeline?  If so, where are the human settlers&nbsp;now?  Did they abandon the city intentionally or under&nbsp;duress?  Did they&nbsp;perish?  Will they be able to&nbsp;return?  <p>The technological benefits salvaged from the artifact are too valuable to ignore. Scientists estimate that only 1% of the dimensional gateway routes have been re-activating.</p><p>Who will discover the rest? The call has gone&nbsp;out.</p><p>Adventure, creative exploration as well as a multitude of yet untapped rewards await those daring enough for such an endeavor.</p><p>The story continues: <a href="https://files.proximax.io/xarcade/Founding_of_Xarnadu_and_the_Genesis_of_MetaXar_20211230.pdf">The Foundation of Xarnadu and the Genesis of&nbsp;MetaXar</a>.</p> Metaverse Autonomous Economy <p>ProximaX has conceptualized a unique tokenomy. It should be born out of creativity and be autonomous and egalitarian, giving everyone an equal opportunity to make it to the pinnacle.</p><p>The MetaXar project will be the first to roll out this autonomous economy. It shall be carried out in phases. The initial phases will involve gamers and game developers coming together with an aggregation of games and activities in a metaverse setting. More complexity will arise as the ecosystem grows, creating a broad spectrum of earning capabilities.</p><p>There will be an announcement for the MetaXar token, MetX, that shall be freshly minted and airdropped to XPX and XAR holders at a specific block height. To be eligible for this airdrop, XPX and XAR holders must stake a claim for it. No MetX will be airdropped to those who missed it or want to make a claim later. About 9.2 million MetX will be minted in this&nbsp;airdrop.</p><p>Find out more: <a href="https://files.proximax.io/xarcade/Metaverse_Autonomous_Economy_20211230.pdf">Metaverse Autonomous Economy</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://blog.proximax.io/en/redefining-the-metaverse-metaxar-by-xarcade/">https://blog.proximax.io</a> on December 30,&nbsp;2021.</p>

   All of us have multiple identities at any point. We are sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, parents, partners, friends, colleagues, and more to different people.  Sometimes, we may want to keep our identities separate from one another.

<p>All of us have <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">multiple identities</a> at any point. We are sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, parents, partners, friends, colleagues, and more to different people.</p><p>Sometimes, we may want to keep our identities separate from one another. For example, we may not want our colleagues to know our personal identities or we may not want our personal information to get mixed with our online identity.</p><p>How can we do&nbsp;this?</p><p>One option may be Trusted Third Parties, where a third-party entity facilitates interactions between two parties, where both trust this third-party. In our above example, it can be your boss who knows your personal information, but will not disclose the same to your co-workers. But since your co-workers trust your boss, they may accept anything that he/she says about&nbsp;you.</p><p>In the real world though, a Trusted Third Party (TTP) is a term that is often associated with online security. Here, a domain or a third-party acts as a facilitator between the owner of an information and the verifier of that information, such that the TTP vouches the identity of the party and this is accepted by the verifier.</p><p>The big question here is — can these TTPs be trusted in a digital&nbsp;world?</p> Are TTPs a Viable Solution? <p>TTPs, in today’s world, are organizations or entities that store and handle your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. Facebook is a company that stores your information, and authenticates you on other sites. The other sites, in turn, trust Facebook and since your data comes from it, they trust your data. Here, you are the owner and the other sites are the verifiers, and Facebook is the&nbsp;TTP.</p><p>While TTP may seem like the perfect solution to create online trust, it is unfortunately ridden with many problems.</p> Security and Privacy Loopholes <p>What happens when your TTP’s database is hacked? All the data stored in it gets stolen and used by hackers. Recent hacking incidents show that such centralized databases are <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">not secure</a> enough to keep your data from falling into the wrong&nbsp;hands.</p><p>Further, this centralized storage is a privacy loophole as well because anyone who has access to the database knows about you! Also, TTPs determine who can access your data and how it must be used. Some of them even monetize your data by targeting you with relevant advertisements.</p><p>So, from both a security and privacy standpoint, TTPs are a loophole.</p> Creates data&nbsp;silos <p>TTPs store data in silos, and this makes the data a lot less effective, both in terms of utility and leverage.</p><p>Data leverage is the degree to which we can use data. A prominent aspect that determines the usability and leverage of a data is its trust. In other words, when verifiers trust a data, it can have greater utility and leverage.</p><p>When a piece of information about an individual comes from a government organization, it is trusted implicitly, and this is an example of trusted data. Some examples of trusted data are passports, Adhar cards, Social Security Numbers, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Utility follows leverage because when the data is trusted, it is widely accepted and can be used extensively for authentication and authorization. In the current business world, most of the data do not come from the government, and hence are not&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Let’s take a practical scenario&nbsp;here.</p><p>Let’s say you go to a supermarket close to your house twice a week to buy groceries. One day, you forget to take your wallet and phone, so they are unable to sell their products to you on credit. Though you have a loyalty card with the supermarket, the data they have about you is not trustworthy enough to give you&nbsp;credit.</p><p>Likewise, a blue collar worker does many part time jobs. When he applies for a new job, he doesn’t have any trusted proof of the part time jobs he has done so far, and hence his potential employer has no way to verify his&nbsp;data.</p><p>In both the above scenarios, the available data is not considered trustworthy, hence it has little leverage and utility. The same can be extended to cross-border rentals, credit history, etc because the data that is generated is not trusted and hence is of little value to its&nbsp;holders.</p><p>Thus, online trust is a major issue and to overcome that, TTP has been in vogue. But this TTP comes with privacy and security issues, and also, it creates data silos that have little utility for its&nbsp;holders.</p><p>Much of this lack of utility stems from the fact that the data is not portable or interoperable and hence cannot be used in all scenarios.</p><p>Now comes the big question. What is the alternative to TTP and the data silos they&nbsp;create?</p> Self-Sovereign Identity <p>One option that can overcome the privacy and security problems of TTP and make the data more usable for its holders is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>, or SSI in&nbsp;short.</p><p>Let’s see how this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/is-ssi-the-disruptor-for-a-better-world-aec34cef6275">framework</a> overcomes the issues related to&nbsp;TTP.</p> Decentralized or Custodial Storage <p>In this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">identity framework</a>, every individual stores his or her own data and is responsible for its security. This may make it difficult for a hacker to steal data, and more importantly, there is little financial incentive for hackers as they would spend too much resources to steal a single&nbsp;record.</p> Ensures Privacy <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/an-in-depth-exploration-of-self-sovereign-identity-and-verifiable-credentials-1a3eb2296004">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> gives complete control to users, so they can decide how their data is used and with whom it is shared. Such granular control reduces the possibility for unauthorized people to peek into an individual’s data.</p> Data Leverage <p>The trust associated with data is greatly enhanced when it is in the form of a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credential</a>. This is a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">tamper-proof credential</a> that can capture even the smallest of details such as volunteering experience, rental history, and more. These small pieces of information can add a ton of value and give you an edge in securing the services you&nbsp;need.</p><p>Since these credentials can’t be changed by anyone, it is more acceptable as a trusted form of data, and hence, has a higher utility&nbsp;value.</p><p>As you can see, SSI can be a good alternative to TTP as it preserves privacy, enhances security, and creates trusted data that in turn can have wide-reaching leverage.</p><p>Do these sound interesting to&nbsp;you?</p><p>Visit Affinidi’s <a href="http://build.affinidi.com">Dev Portal</a> to learn more about SSI and VCs and how you can leverage them to do more with your data in a safe and secure&nbsp;way.</p><p>You can also <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a>, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/trusted-third-parties-vs-self-sovereign-identity-4e96de929b1b">Trusted Third Parties vs Self-Sovereign Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It’s been a big year for reining in big tech, with all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/16/big-tech-critics-mustered-their-forces-2021/">sorts of developments</a>&nbsp;and no doubt more to come in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/agcm-fines-apple-google/">story</a>&nbsp;is that Google and Apple were each fined&nbsp;€10 million by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/PS11147-PS11150">Italy’s competition and market authority</a>&nbsp;(AGCM) for not providing their customers with clear information about how they use their data commercially, and for being “aggressive” in pushing users to accept commercial processing of data. These actions violate Italy’s consumer code.</p>



<p>According to the AGCM, Google didn’t give users relevant information at the account creation stage and when using services so they could make informed decisions about whether or not to consent to their data being used for commercial purposes.</p>



<p>Apple copped the fine for reportedly failing to give users immediate access to clear information about how it uses customer information commercially when a customer creates an Apple ID or accesses digital stores like the App Store.</p>



<p>This news is interesting because let’s face it: we expected it from Google, but Apple is one of the good guys on privacy—or so its careful marketing narrative would lead us all to believe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To us, these sanctions are yet another reason why every consumer needs&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>—secure, customizable digital identities or ‘profiles’ that intentionally differentiate from a consumer’s personal identity and protect their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;Regulators and watch dogs usually don’t intervene in data misuse until after harm has been done.

 A possible solution to the participation problem. <p>a16z, the famous venture capital company, is entering the DAO field through investments into DAO projects, such as the recent investments in social DAO project,&nbsp;FWB.</p>Source: <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/">https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/</a><p>Since 2020, DAOs have become more well-known and have gradually become mainstream players in the blockchain industry. Recently, we have seen major venture capital institutions disclosing their investments in DAO projects, which has attracted the attention of major blockchain media. Therefore, some people think that “2022 will be the first year of&nbsp;DAO.”</p><p>What is it about DAOs that attracts the interest of these market-leading investment institutions and the associated media??</p> Understanding DAOs <p>Human beings have entered the DAO era, and all this cannot be&nbsp;avoided.</p><p>— Stephenson, the Father of the Metaverse</p><p>Everyone has their interpretation of what a DAO is, but they all share a common logic: members vote with tokens, and open-source codes automatically run voting results. This trustless system eliminates human error and members can manage community finances as a collective.</p>Source: <a href="https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw">The DAO landscape</a>.<p>At present, DAOs have developed across many platforms, including social media, agreement platforms, project principles, and so on. Moreover, it is more like a bottom-up management company, where members rely on their personal abilities and subjective wishes to divide labor to build the entire DAO. The DAO will reward members based on their contribution value.</p><p>In the upcoming Metaverse, DAOs may well be at the core of governance models, as it returns the rulemaking and governance power to the public, promoting the complete decentralization of the Metaverse.</p> Still In Early&nbsp;Stages <p>Whilst the vision for DAOs is beautiful, the reality is still working towards fulfilling these goals. It is true that people in the decentralized field are increasingly interested in DAOs, but the development of DAOs still faces difficulties. These hurdles&nbsp;include:</p> Low ​​Member participation <p>Most DAOs use the digital assets of their members as key indicators. For example, voting is based on the number of tokens, and rewards are based on the proportion of digital assets. This approach not only inhibits the voice of DAO members but also makes members with a small proportion of tokens unwilling to invest time and energy in governance, due to the imbalance of investment returns.</p> Centralization crisis <p>The above-mentioned system employed by DAOs can easily lead to the emergence of a mindset that “the rich will always be rich, and the strong will always be strong”. The simple reality is that with the right to speak, comes the right to set rules that are more beneficial to you, and you can get greater benefits. This has pushed many DAOs into an unwanted centralized situation.</p> Decisions are difficult to&nbsp;balance <p>In a fully autonomous DAO system, the decision should be based on the number of votes. But sometimes there are conflicts between the opinions of the development team and the interests of community members. How to maintain a good balance is a headache for many DAO organizations. Sometimes the DAO development team will directly ignore the community opinions, resulting in accusations of centralization. The alternative is to completely follow the DAO community, which may result in constructive opinions not being&nbsp;adopted.</p> Which Brings Us to Reputation <p>The above problems essentially have a key point: what kind of incentives should be set up? The incentives should not only satisfy decentralization and fairness but also promote proactive DAO members that actively participate in governance.</p><p>Based on its own technology and past service experience, Ontology proposes the following solution: Set up a DID with a reputation scoring system for each DAO&nbsp;member.</p> Verification <p>When you enter a DAO, you need to first register/own a DID and submit certain verifications (authorization through encryption to protect privacy), such as on-chain/off-chain assets, whether you have similar experience or capabilities, and so on. After verification, you will be given an initial value and mark to help you better participate in&nbsp;DAO.</p> Record <p>When participating in DAO governance, DID will record the amount time spent in the DAO and your contributions after joining. Contributions would include voting, suggestions, operational work, and so on. If you also use this DID to participate in the governance of other DAOs, those data will also be recorded in the same DID, increasing your data diversity.</p> Reputation Score <p>The reputation system will make a comprehensive score based on the above records. For example, the more DAOs you participate in, and the longer, and the more active you are, the higher your score will be. In addition, corresponding weights can be set when designing the reputation scoring model, such as reducing the weight of digital assets and increasing the weight of participation.</p> Decentralization <p>With reputation value, DAO can dynamically divide rights based on reputation. The higher the reputation value, the greater the power. This power could be manifested in the right to more votes (right to speak) and the right to more DAO dividends.</p> Participation <p>Based on this, we can imagine a completely decentralized DAO organization as:</p>  The acquisition of rights and benefits is no longer difficult for ordinary&nbsp;members.  The development team, like ordinary members, needs to rely on contribution to gain the right to&nbsp;speak.  It has become very important to increase your participation and enthusiasm.   To Summarize <p>Implanting DID in DAOs can eliminate “centralization” based on digital assets to a certain extent. DID can encourage DAO members to become more active, and balanced decision-making between the development team and ordinary&nbsp;members.</p><p>Whilst DID can help to solve some of the current DAO problems, this is still only the beginning.</p><p>In the future, DAOs will inevitably become the organizational form of the decentralized world, with more blockchain technologies being absorbed by DAOs, allowing for the quick and healthy development of ecosystems.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thank you for [joining] the last episode of this year 2021 for Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. We are now talking about how to budget projects, identity and access management projects, and we have very a interesting guest for that.</p>
<p>Originally from New Zealand, Ian Yoxall started Intragen in 2006 after working for several companies in the US and in London. As Principal Consultant and CEO of Intragen, Ian has worked on many of the largest projects in the Netherlands and throughout Western Europe. With a broad experience with small and large scale implementations, both in the private and public sector, he brings a pragmatic approach to problems that arise around identity and access management projects. Prior to joining Intragen, Ian worked for global infrastructure and security vendors and consultancies.</p>
<p>Hello, Ian.</p>
<p>Ian Yoxall: Good morning. Hello. And how are you Oscar?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Nice having you here, Ian.</p>
<p>Ian: It’s great to be here. Thank you for the invitation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Our pleasure. And please tell us a bit more how your career, your life led you to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Ian: Right. Well, yeah, that’s a long train wreck of a story. So let’s start off. Originally, I started in consulting as a DBA working for the various database vendors in infrastructure, and then moved across into business consulting, still with an infrastructural angle and infrastructural projects. And one day I arrived in London and sort of fell into banking security. And after that, I dropped into the gravity well that became identity and access management. And once you start down the career of identity and access management, you can’t escape. That’s it. That’s the end. Yeah, you can’t go anywhere else.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that attracts people to stay in it is it’s got a high failure rate. I have a personal hobby of flying, and when you fly a plane, nobody expects you to do everything perfectly, but it’s about making fewer mistakes and reducing your risks. And with the rapidly evolving industry that we’re in, it attracts plenty of bad actors. We’ve seen just recently the Log4j issues that have come up. And already that’s been weaponised and deployed very, very quickly. So when you’ve got bad actors who are so willing to try and make a profit here and attract businesses it’s an interesting field to work in.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it is definitely. It’s an exciting place to be working in these days, right? There are so many things happening, good and bad, of course, and that’s why we are here to solve the problems.</p>
<p>Ian: Exactly, exactly. And it’s that engaging with businesses to help solve those problems that makes it such an exciting field.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. I know that Intragen works in several industries, education, we are doing projects together in education, but you also work a lot with SMEs, so medium businesses, not known as large corporations, or some of these who are becoming, but still not there. And often we talk about all the capabilities that advance identity and access management have, everything you can do, but of course that costs money. If there is unlimited budget and time, you can, yeah, achieve everything that the brightest minds of identity have delivered until now. But how far you can go when you have more tighter budget, you don’t have enough budget, but you need IAM? So what would you say about that? So what – with some organisations listening to that in, “Yeah, we need IAM but the budget is tight. What can we do?”</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, great question Oscar. And it’s something that we try and engage our clients with on a regular basis, is saying “What sort of budget should you set for the upcoming budget period?” And I think it’s – from a CFO perspective, you don’t want to be throwing money away, but you do want to be covering risk from the CISO perspective.</p>
<p>Let’s take the hospital sector. They want to set a budget that delivers as much patient care as possible, but you can’t ignore the cyber threat, whether it’s fines or whether it’s payments that they’re making to unlock hospital systems. There has to be budget spent here because it’s going to be spent either for the bad actors or preferably to defence against the bad actors.</p>
<p>When you look at a lot of projects in the space, they generally will set themselves a relatively large scope and that they’ll have a budget and a timeframe of years. And we fundamentally feel that that’s not a good way to go. Think, what’s the fastest time to business value? So when you’re replacing the old infrastructure, and it might be that you’ve got an old identity management or access management system. Everybody has one. It’s just a question of, is it automated? Is it good? Is it ugly? Or what have you.</p>
<p>And if you’re doing a rip and replace type project, often the question is, OK, we just want it to do whatever the old system did but then against that, when are you going to get new business value in there? People want to see business value enhanced and more engagement, particularly with end users to make their lives easier. So if you turn the question on its head and say, “Look, I want to get some really nice goal. How do I get there? So what’s my first step? What are the big rocks that I need to put together my whole project breaking those big rocks down?”</p>
<p>So when we take access management, probably the first thing you want to do is make sure everybody loves you. So that’s going to involve making sure that the SSO elements, and the easiest SSO elements are there as quickly as possible. So you’re going to need an MVP, a Minimum Viable Product of your infrastructure around access management, getting the user datastore sorted, and then looking at all the web apps that you’ve got in the landscape. Take the ones that are best suited to the technology, take the business owners there that do want to engage and deliver that.</p>
<p>That small budget – that small initial success will create a bigger ripple effect for the organisation, whereby more business units and more applications will want to engage. And that’s what it is, by doing that, that small delivery, you tipped the scales, you’ve shown people what can be done, and you’re able to go back to the CFO and say, “Look, we did X amount of spend. And we’ve delivered this level of improvement in security. And for example, we’ll remove passwords from 10 or 15 applications, improving people’s productivity, making them happier, and enjoying what you get with SSO and multi-factor authentication.”</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, as you said, minimal viable product in which you mentioned, I think it’s mostly, well, two main features: single sign-on that is the basic, basic has to be there, and yeah, replacing passwords with some type of multi-factor authentication. So those are the very basic that you think has to be always in mind.</p>
<p>Ian: Absolutely, because if you start, I mean, it is the one thing. I just had my family, and we have, we all have devices here. And you know, whether it’s our Wi-Fi passwords, whether it’s the email addresses for school, whether it’s their – getting into the home network, or what have you, they all have different usernames and passwords. And even in my own home, this is something which falls for some reason under my responsibility.</p>
<p>And users who have 5, 10, 15 applications, they don’t really love security. They want to get on with the job. So if we’re able to make their life better, we’re going to affect organisational change. And really, looking at security, it’s not about the zeros and ones, it’s about that organisational change. And you’re only going to be able to do that if you can make people’s life easier.</p>
<p>If you’re going to make it easy for end users to log on with single sign-on they’ll love you for it. Likewise, if you’re an administrator and have access to privileged accounts, if you can use multi-factor authentication, and the same multi-factor authentication for many applications, or step-up authentication, it’s going to make your life easier, not harder. And that’s what we want to be doing in security, improving the security level and making it easy.</p>
<p>And I see passwords as being the one thing that you ask anybody in the street, “Do you hate your password?” And the answer is yes. And of course by proxy, that means that they hate the security team. And it is kind of annoying when you have a project and nobody wants to sit with you at lunch. So we’ve got to make their lives easier and make them want to engage.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And I can imagine, I’m sure you know better how many organisations already at medium level, not so small, don’t have SSO or they have – yeah, not sufficient, maybe they have, if a software just a couple of their systems and all the rest is not covered.</p>
<p>Ian: Exactly. And on that I have a little follow up thought. One of the things that we try and do is make it easy to decide what to do and how do you prioritise these projects? So normally, they’ll say, “Right, let’s take all of our applications.” “Well, do you really want to start there?” So what we try and do is say, if you start colour coding your applications, and say, “I’ve got black applications, which are super-secret, I’ve got red ones which are finance, and I’ve got green ones, and yellow ones, and purple ones, and blue ones.” And you put them in buckets that way, and then you’re not trying to cover your whole landscape.</p>
<p>And what you can report back, as you engage with those businesses, you can report back and say like, “We’ve covered all of our red applications now, all that stuff, which is in the cloud, or on a web server internally, we now have it 100% secured.” And that is something which you can report back to the board. And they get an insight into saying, “Oh yeah, we’ve asked the security to step in, they’ve come back. And we now know a definable metric that would actually improve our security.”</p>
<p>Rather than say, “I’ve done 20 applications out of 400.” If you do that by colour coding, that in itself, it makes sense to people. If you say I’ve done 20% of my applications. Well, is that good? Is that bad? I don’t know. So knowing what good looks like and using that colour coding system, even for something as a simple step, such as SSO, this is a great way to communicate and engage users.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I believe that sounds more tangible and easier to explain with someone, let’s say the IT manager of that company has to convince people, others in the company with, this is important. Yeah, it’s definitely a good way to continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Another thing that implies money indirectly is when time goes long. You plan one IAM project or any project, let’s say for six months, and it goes longer. And that means more money. So how would you go about running over time on an IAM project? I’m sure you have a lot of interesting stories to tell.</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, sadly, both good and bad. You know, every project is always going to give you a new set of challenges. And how do you deal with those challenges? Now, there’s a great quote from the British naval historian and author, Cyril Northcote Parkinson, who said, “It’s a commonplace observation that work expands to fill the available time for its completion.” You know, if you ask somebody to tidy their room, and you give them, I have children so if you give them two hours to tidy their room, they’ll take two hours. If you give them 10 minutes, they’ll do it in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>So how do you again, not just looking at budget but on time, how do you do that with identity and access management projects? I think there was a good report from Gartner a few years back saying that the number one killer of these projects is scope creep. And it’s very, very difficult to rein that in, because there are always things in every project that creep up. So you’ve got to have first off exceptionally strong project governance, not just on the project manager, on the project sponsors, and communicating that.</p>
<p>Let’s say you do increase the project scope for a very good reason, then there is still going to be a delay and will be perceived as a delay. So whether it’s doing things such as saying, “Well, this is the MVP core, and then MVP extra, any way in which you can separate that out and do it as the next step, in the next follow up, absolutely needs to be done.” Because something we talk about is losing the coffee corner argument, where people will talk about a project and about the perception of the project, and particularly around security where even when you’re taking…</p>
<p>Let’s take the passwords example. Up to now people have been using 10 passwords and they knew their 10 passwords. You’re going to replace that with single sign-on. It’s a change. Nobody likes change. And if there’s something that goes wrong, and generally something goes wrong in all projects, they’re going to blame the project. So it’s very important to take small bites at a time, you know how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Small incremental steps that deliver business value for each step and resist the temptation to increase scope. Put that into a tomorrow bucket. Always find a way to define a separate list. And that’s one of the reasons why we really like doing projects in an agile manner.</p>
<p>Again, looking at – let’s take access management. It’s very relevant. You’re going to need to have the relevant service set up, that core infrastructure. But that’s a relatively small part of the project. What’s going to take most of the time in the project is getting the application factory to onboard applications. And by doing that in sprints saying, you know we’ll do five applications this week, or 10 applications this week, depending on how big your factory is, you’re able to deliver business value quickly, and show people that it’s actually progressing.</p>
<p>You can increase the size of the factory by turning the tap up or tap down on funding. And by delivering value in each sprint it’s tangible to the business. They actually get to see from a risk perspective that the attack surface is reduced, you’re reducing costs because you’ve got fewer password resets, and you’re making everybody’s life easier. So step by step, as long as you’re always delivering business value, instead of doing it in three months increments or 12-month increments.</p>
<p>I was talking to a project a few days ago, and they’ve been doing a three-year phase so nothing would be delivered for three years. Now, I don’t know about you, but I can’t remember anything for more than three weeks, let alone in three years. So that sort of approach, we’ve got to move away from these big projects. And let’s be honest, a lot of consultancies like to work this way because it’s got a big budget attached to it. It’s, you know, you can put a lot of people on, it’s very easy to plan resourcing that way.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t really work for clients. And I think we as an industry, we need to make sure that we’re making our clients’ lives easier, not harder. Because the projects do go on, they do become business as usual processes. There will always be new cloud applications coming along. You want to make it trivially easy for the business to say, “Oh, I’ve gone and added a new cloud application. It just came on. It’s fantastic. It does everything we want. Can you tie that in to SSO?”</p>
<p>If that takes you longer than a couple of business days to engage with them, plan it and get it done, you’re doing it wrong. And I think that’s one of the values that companies like Ubisecure bring – standards-based ways to onboard these applications and really integrate the security. I’ve seen so many data breaches from luckily ex-customers, but still they’re data breaches that caused millions of losses and damages, where these orphaned accounts don’t get picked up. And with cloud computing, which is fantastic and great and enables businesses to move quickly, if we as IT security can’t make sure that we’re enabling the business to choose the applications they want, and onboard them so that we’re taking away this problem, we’re really not doing a good job if we can’t do that in a fast and easy way. And make sure that those sprints are done quickly.</p>
<p>So how do you dot on the horizon 100% coverage? Make sure that every single quarter or whatever accounting period you’ve got where you’re reporting progress vs budget, you can actually write down tangible business benefits. And this is what’s been going on. The board needs to know that things are working. And it’s up to us to do a better job of explaining that.</p>
<p>I see a lot of reporting up to the board on these projects where people say the project is now progressing through phase one. But what does that mean? If we can say we have taken out 30 business critical systems and made sure that then there are no simple passwords to be hacked there. They’ve all got password rotation on there, using multi-factor authentication. We’ve got encryption enabled via a single SSO access. This is the kind of stuff that they can say, “OK, I understand that. I can see why we’re funding these things.”</p>
<p>So yeah, sorry about the big rant there. But getting that corporate governance risk framework to match what we’re doing in security, it’s really important to have those communication so that people can see yes, it takes time but that during each of these cycles and time, it’s fixing things and it can’t be words. It’s got to be metrics.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you mentioned scope creep. So that one of the main… yeah, potential cause of problems starting – trying to start with too big scope, trying to put too much and that will very likely become longer and longer. And as you said, getting this what you call the sprints or phases in which you get results, that’s absolutely great.</p>
<p>You mentioned for instance, reporting to boards. So now we’re – if you think of smaller companies, less regulated companies, mid-market companies, organisations that they also are building products or services for their customers. Yeah, how they can – with the investment they are doing – maximise time to value for the services they are building?</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, good question. So when I started this a long time ago, back when my hair was a different colour, it was all very artwork to put these projects together. I remember when the SAML standard started getting released. So this is the days before OAuth or what have you.</p>
<p>So the first thing is you’ve got to base your security vision on a standards-based product. So leveraging scalable products that give off the shelf functionality that matches what you’re looking for. So for example, you know, does it have a uer datastore that can be extended to support the various needs you have? What’s the vision of the company? Does it match your own vision? Using these products that are well-defined and well-understood and have clear standards in them, they’re off the shelf. So it should really be a plug and play type approach.</p>
<p>I’m seeing more and more companies want to move away from bespoke development. They want a roadmap that lets them get to those things as… well, let’s take the Joe Biden quote, you know, he’s been talking about single sign-on and cloud computing and zero trust. So defining those components that, you know, you can’t buy zero trust. Defining those components, means you’re going to need to leverage scalable products off the shelf that can be tied together relatively quickly.</p>
<p>So yeah, that’s the first thing that says choose products that aren’t going to require a massive amount of customisation. And I think some of the organisations that we’ve seen have taken a gated funding approach to say, “Well, here’s a ton of money, go and do X and go and do Y and go and do Z.” You learn as you go along on these projects. Every organisation we deal with, it has a vision on security but as you engage with the business, you discover a whole bunch of issues and challenges that are different. And the company’s vision of what security looks like, and what good looks like will change very quickly.</p>
<p>I’m dealing with a customer right now, who’s about to start their project in January. And they’re clinging on to the belief that they can know every problem that they’re going to face for a two-year project on day one. And the short answer is, just can’t do that. So taking a more agile approach, understanding that you don’t know everything that will be, there will be hiccups. It’s just a safer, easier way to go because you can’t know everything around these spaces. So whether it’s, we talked about the profile database, do you know you’re going to need that? Well, in which case then make sure you’re going to choose a product with that. But there may be other aspects you don’t know yet. So be prepared for those unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>Oscar: And who, as I said, in SMEs, in a medium organisation, who, from that side, from the customer side, from the organisation side, who would lead this project? Who is the best person to lead this project?</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, actually, I’m about to head to a meeting to discuss that. So it’s important, you’ve got to define your stakeholders fairly widely. So of course, IT has a role to play in here. But it can’t be an IT party. That’s the sort of guarantee of failure, I guess. Failure is a strong word, but you’re only ever going to get an initial deployment within the things that IT sees. And IT has a very narrow focus of the business. So it’s important to get – people will say, engage with the business. Well, who is the business?</p>
<p>Whether it’s finance, whether it’s whatever operational units you have that do whatever you do as a business, engage with them, understand their problems. What are the 10 things – if they’re logging on 15 times a day, if they have a problem with people getting access, what are those things? You need to engage with those people. If they’re not with their hands in the steering committee, it’s going to very quickly become a pure IT exercise and that’s, you know, an academic thing which will deliver a project, but it will be, if you will, a successful failure.</p>
<p>You need to engage with the heads of business. If it’s a bank, talk to the head of trading. If you’re talking to a hospital, you want to be talking to the heads of department of the different areas, you know, in radiology or what have you. You need to be talking to those people, what are the real things that happen in their day so that you can match things up.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so it sounds like, there’s not only one single person in the customer side, so this is going to be you as IAM vendor of consulting, selling the solution, the full solution had to convince several of these persons including IT of course to join forces.</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah. Exactly. And getting that ownership of the systems, who then owns that core infrastructure? Should it stay with IT or should those business processes belong somewhere else? I mean, one of the things, whether you’re looking at customer identity and access management, you know, marketing has a huge role here. And it’s important for them to understand what the user journey is, and what we’re delivering there.</p>
<p>I know we’ve all had that experience where we try and buy something online and you know, it’s like, I want your date of birth, and you’re buying a pen, or whatever it is. Like, why do you need to know my date of birth, if I buy it? Make the buying experience as simple as it is when you go into a shop. You go into a shop, you get something off the shelf, you walk up to the counter, you do a financial transaction. Is it really essential to capture all that information of the end user? Make that the easiest, happiest process ever and you’ll get customers back.</p>
<p>Just this week, I was… rather in the run up to Christmas. I was buying things online. And in some of the customer identity and access management sites I was at, were so painful, I just closed it down. I’d already picked everything, put it in the basket. So making sure that you’re engaging with the stakeholders who are going to be using whatever security system you’ve got in place is fundamental.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And we also know that some organisations already have the policy of a gated funding approach for most of their projects, including IAM, that could be one of those. So what would you say about the gated funding approach? What are the problems you have found? And how organisations who are into this have good results?</p>
<p>Ian: When you look at projects, people are obviously very concerned about this scope creep issue. So they’ll try and define a fixed scope with a fixed set of deliverables, with a fixed budget. That sounds like a good idea. However, you’re always going to, you know, and when you baseline that plan, it all looks great and you start on day one. But whether it’s on day two, or day 10, or day 50, there will be changes come along. And how do you then account for that? Do you want to do exception reports, request for additional budget, and so forth?</p>
<p>So you can control a project that way. We find it’s a good approach. But it’s not the best approach. It tends to lead to waterfall type thinking and thinking that there will be a deliverable and then the project will stop. And as we know, security never stops, it becomes business as usual. So whilst it has the best intentions, no project ever completes the scope exactly as it was set.</p>
<p>So then designing a project with a minimal viable product for infrastructure, and then moving quickly to an agile based approach, where you can have a backlog and then vary the pace of the project according to funding, so you’re still controlling the spend. But the deliverables, again, are, this is what we delivered for this budget. We’re learning as we go, and our understanding of the IT security landscape and how it engages the business is evolving as a company.</p>
<p>There isn’t a company out there that wakes up and says, “I’d like to do identity and access management now.” No. Well, we do because that’s our business. But every other company out there is trying to do some other business problem. And they’re trying to solve that for their customers and their employees, or whoever the stakeholders are. And to get that thing delivered, they need to do identity and access management. So then they come to us and are looking for us as the experts in the field for what’s the best approach.</p>
<p>So again, buy a package, leverage what’s in the package, deliver the minimum viable product, learn as you go, educate the business, and it’s about effecting organisational change. And that can have a budget set, but understand that it will vary and you need to make sure you have good progress reporting, good dashboards on what has been delivered, understanding the key metrics around identity and access management. Maybe it’s about how many fewer password reset you’re doing. Or, again, we talked about what scope of systems are covered? Are all the red and yellow and green systems covered? Rather than just saying, you know, “70% of our applications.” What does good look like? We don’t know.</p>
<p>So again, we need to educate people on what those KPIs and measures are, what they need to do to find their big rocks, put the dot on the horizon, and then say, “We would set a budget of around this amount, but monitor progress versus budget, increasing the velocity of a project by adding more expert services in or decrease your spend and your velocity to stay within the budget you need to do.</p>
<p>We saw the zero day attacks come out with this Log4j. Obviously, people would have been very busy that first weekend, getting all their engineers to start scanning all their systems and patching everything as quickly as they can. That’s going to have a big impact on budget. You can’t know these things in advance. So you have to be able to turn the tap up and down in response to the environment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent, excellent. Definitely. Very, very tactically important what you said the importance of reporting, knowing the status and yeah, going step by step, sprint by sprint, being agile as you said.</p>
<p>Ian: When we moved from passwords ourselves, because we were originally we had a little, well, data centre is a strong term for it, but we had a room full of computers. And then we moved to 100% cloud, and then you know, with a complete SSO and MFA solution as well. Getting the base infrastructure in place didn’t take long. What took a long time was tying all the elements together. So being able to report on that we know we’ve eaten our own dog food. We know the challenges clients have. So we have a lot of sympathy, and understand that you can’t pick up everything on day one.</p>
<p>So what’s the easy way to apply a budget to something and then monitor that and deliver that and show people that you’ve delivered it? If it remains a secret, it’s no use. If you’re able to evangelise that throughout the organisation, you’re going to get the organisational change you’re looking for. If you look at it from a security perspective, everybody talks about the X Factor. Today, the bad end user. Getting the X factor to understand, hey, security is not here to make your life bad. We’ve got to engage these end users so that they don’t run in fear and they do want to sit with us at the lunch table.</p>
<p>Oscar: Ian, final question for you. For all business leaders listening to this conversation we are having, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Ian: Talk to me. No, I’m sorry. Joking.</p>
<p>Oscar: Talk to Ian. Write down that.</p>
<p>Ian: Exactly. I’ve got all the answers they need. No, no. That’s a bit facetious there. So if there’s one thing that you need to do as a business, it’s have a plan here, have an actionable plan with actionable insights. So that’s going to comprise of a couple of elements. You need to know where you are. If you don’t know where you are, then you don’t know how far you’ve got to go. If you just say, for example, he has a ton of money to go implement PAM or MFA or what have you, well, where are you and how has the landscape changed?</p>
<p>So you need an assessment of where you are now, which should take a couple of weeks to get done, measuring a number of aspects around identity management, access management, role management, PAM, and so on and so forth, business alignment. And then say, “OK, looking at these measures, which one item do I want to fix first?” You need to have actionable insights come from that.</p>
<p>And that’s the key thing I’d say, if there’s one thing having actionable insights in security that you can say, “I need to do X now.” Not in a month or in six weeks, because cybersecurity can be a nebulous problem. It can feel OK, I read another hacking story on what have you or that company had a data breach or what have you. You’ve got to have actionable insight that say to the CFO, allocate budget, that give the CISO something to talk about and say, “These items need addressing.” So the CEO can then make the decision, “Yeah, that’s good. Let’s go get those things done.”</p>
<p>And then with those actionable insights, what are the KPIs and metrics associated with that, so that when it’s delivered, you can show how you’d move the needle. Now that the needles done and you’ve solved that problem, go back to the list. What’s the next actionable insight? If you’re not able to prove that you’re fixing things, then you’re just spending money and people kind of wonder, what are those security guys doing in the corner there? They’re costing a lot of money and they’re – half the time we can’t even log on. You’ve got to be able to prove those actionable insights and the delivery of them to everybody in the company.</p>
<p>I was at a company recently. In the middle of the lobby, they have all sorts of dashboards on big TV screens. And I was happy to see that they’d now added the security dashboards on there as well. So people could see things going to green, lines trending the correct way, traffic lights being the right colour. That’s exactly what we need to do to show people. “Yeah, IT security is doing what it needs to do.”</p>
<p>So if it’s just one thing I have to say, I know I said a lot there, define actionable insights for your business that will improve your security posture and demonstrate that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and that’s where, for instance, it could be in a visible place in the office. Yeah, that’s something that I like the idea of, what we were discussing today. Well, thanks a lot, Ian, for this very interesting conversation. Please let us know how people who would like to continue the conversation with you, how to find you on the net?</p>
<p>Ian: Well, yes. So please reach out to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-yoxall-690184/">LinkedIn profile</a>, it’s an open profile. I’d love to hear from you. Whether you’ve got problems or you want to agree with me or disagree with me, always happy to engage with people. And I’d like to wish everybody a Merry Christmas and all the best for 2022 and happy security days out there!</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot Ian and for you, Ian, for everybody who is listening there. Happy New Year! Happy New Year 2022 and see you next year.</p>
<p>Ian: Thank you very much, Oscar.</p>

 GiD Report#192 — The SEC v. Ripple, a year later (also, Jack v.&nbsp;Marc) <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-191-what-is-the-metaverse-64d918e7d717">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Happy holidays! See you all in the new&nbsp;year.</p><p>This week:</p>  The SEC v. Ripple, a year&nbsp;later  Tweet of the week — the web3&nbsp;wars  Tweet of the week — web3 incentives  Chart of the week — the other flippening  Chart of the week — welcome to the metaverse  This week in Big&nbsp;Tech  Stuff happens   1. The SEC v. Ripple, a year&nbsp;later <p>About a year ago, the SEC dropped its infamous lawsuit on Ripple just before Christmas and on then SEC Chief Jay Clayton’s last day in&nbsp;office.</p><p>You can check out /gregkidd’s immediate reactions to the lawsuit here — <a href="https://youtu.be/v2gLHm-4qRM">in our first (impromptu) recording of the podcast on Christmas Eve</a>.</p><p>Since then, we’ve seen former MIT professor, CFTC commissioner, and Goldman Sachs alum Gary Gensler take Clayton’s place at the helm of the SEC, but not much has&nbsp;changed.</p><p>Rosalyn Clayton, who’s done <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/09/12/its-time-to-end-the-secs-clarity-charade-on-crypto/">a terrific job covering the lawsuit over the last year</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/12/05/who-will-protect-investors-from-the-sec/?sh=cf77a7f1caec">reported on Gensler and Clayton earlier this&nbsp;month</a>:</p><blockquote>Last Wednesday, the current and previous chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shared what was billed as a “fireside chat” to open the Digital Asset Compliance &amp; Marketing Summit. Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton spoke, took no questions, and agreed that the multi-trillion dollar crypto innovation space is a dark, menacing threat that legitimate crypto entrepreneurs must follow opaque rules or face crippling SEC lawsuits. Gensler made it clear that there is no difference between “fraudsters” and “good-faith actors” in crypto — both are lawbreakers endangering the&nbsp;public.</blockquote><blockquote>Many in the audience of crypto industry leaders, just maligned as crooks, were stunned. Gensler repeatedly said that “platforms need to come in and get registered,” as if everyone knew what he was talking about. Perianne Boring, the head of the Digital Chamber of Commerce tweeted, “People in the room are looking around and asking, “register as&nbsp;what?””</blockquote><blockquote>It’s a fair question given that the exchange Coinbase — the only crypto company to have gone public on the stock market — tried “going in”. Upon sharing to share its lending platform information, the SEC slapped Coinbase with a subpoena and the threat of what Gensler affectionately calls “the enforcement tool.”</blockquote><p>And so a year later, the U.S. continues to find itself in murky waters when it comes to regulatory clarity and crypto innovation.</p>  Jay Clayton’s crypto op-ed: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-future-depends-on-blockchain-crypto-bitcoin-payments-transfers-federal-reserve-11639668586?mod=article_inline">Opinion | America’s Future Depends on the Blockchain</a>  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s response: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/blockchain-crypto-defi-sec-ripple-regulation-lawsuit-access-warren-11640218049">Opinion | Great Potential, Great Obstacles for Blockchain</a>  <p>Some startups such as Open Props have tried to navigate the existing regulatory landscape in earnest — and failed. Here’s <a href="https://ketsal.com/blog/props-for-the-reg-a-reality/">Zachary Fallon’s take on Reg A</a> (via /gregkidd):</p><blockquote>It pains me to say it, but Open Props’ recent announcement of the coming termination of its ongoing Regulation A (“Reg A”) digital asset securities (Props) offering and the cessation of support for its Props Loyalty Program leads me to one stark conclusion:</blockquote><blockquote>While compliant, Reg A is neither a business nor investor friendly or workable regulatory path for cryptocurrency-related companies that intend to offer and sell investment contracts on an ongoing&nbsp;basis.</blockquote><p>Jane Street Capital alum Sam Bankman-Fried is one of the rising stars in crypto. His company, FTX, is domiciled in the Bahamas and doesn’t serve U.S. customers. (FTX.US is a separate&nbsp;entity.)</p><p>As a resident of the so-called financial capital of the world — I’m unable to access most centralized products including Uphold, Crypto.com (the new name of LA’s Staples Center), BlockFi, and FTX.US — just to name a few — thanks to BitLicense, New York’s stringent regulatory regime. (It also meant that I wouldn’t be able to partake in living legend Steph Curry’s NFT drop last week since FTX.US was a requirement as part of the minting and verification process.)</p><p>That’s certainly an opportunity for states like Wyoming and Florida. But it’s also just a bit of a&nbsp;mess.</p><p>But for the U.S., that’s the state of play when it comes to crypto regulation.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/andrew-yang-would-support-a-dedicated-digital-asset-regulator/">Andrew Yang Would Support a Dedicated Digital Asset Regulator — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/15/eric-adams-hopes-for-nyc-bitcoin-boom-blocked-by-backwards-thinking-albany/">Eric Adams’ hopes for NYC bitcoin boom blocked by backwards-thinking Albany</a>  <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/roisman-20211220">SEC.gov | Statement of Commissioner Elad L.&nbsp;Roisman</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-23/pro-crypto-senator-lummis-to-propose-overhaul-bill-next-year">Bitcoin-Owning Senator Lummis to Propose Crypto Overhaul Bill Next&nbsp;Year</a>   2.

<p>Happy holidays to the Magic community!</p><p>Since our last product update, we’ve launched a multifaceted set of capabilities that enable you to do more with&nbsp;Magic.</p><p>In this post, I’ll cover the latest highlights and improvements.</p> Multi-factor Authentication <p>Developers can now enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your users! This capability allows customers to add a layer of security to their end-user accounts. This means a secondary factor is validated along with the existing primary factor to log in to an account. Typically, the primary factor is an email, and a secondary factor is a phone number or mobile device authenticator. The idea is that both factors will need to be compromised to breach an&nbsp;account.</p><p>The benefits of enabling MFA&nbsp;include:</p>  MFA reduces the risk of a compromised account or stolen NFTs by requiring users to provide multiple credentials to access their accounts.  It protects users from theft. By requiring multiple authentication methods, MFA adds a layer of security from a stolen laptop or&nbsp;device.  MFA is one of the most straightforward and robust security methods a developer can enable. Magic makes enabling MFA simple with one click in the dashboard.  It helps your users meet regulatory compliance standards. You should enable MFA if your users must meet HIPAA, PCI, or CJIS compliance standards.  <p>Magic offers MFA through mobile authenticator apps like Authy or Google Authenticator. Email and SMS primary factors are currently supported. Magic will add WebAuthn, and social login primary factors support in the future. To get started, head to the dashboard and enable MFA or read more about the integration <a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-methods/mfa">here</a>.</p> Custom Email&nbsp;Provider <p>Have you wanted to customize the sender of your email magic link login? With Magic, you can now route emails through your Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. Enabling the custom email provider gives you complete control over where your app’s login email is sent from, as well as the name of the&nbsp;sender.</p><p>Magic will send email magic links through your SMTP server as soon as you configure the custom email provider.

 Data: A New Direction — But Which Direction? <p>This is the fifth and final blog in our series about the UK Government’s proposals for data protection reform — “Data: A New Direction”. Previous blogs focused on the thinking behind the proposals. This blog summarises what the main proposals are.</p><p>Stated plainly, the UK Government is planning to end data protection rights for UK citizens. Reforms proposed in its paper Data: A New Direction would shift the core operating principle of data protection regulations from citizen protection (that personal data shall only be collected by organisations “for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes”) to a new principle that organisations should have the right to build and maintain databases about citizens without their&nbsp;consent.</p><p>This Briefing Paper shows how the Government is planning to achieve this radical ‘new direction’ for data. (Paragraphs 57 and 58 of the Consultation, around which this ‘New Direction’ pivots are reproduced in the Addendum.)</p> Background <p>The Government is taking the opportunity of Brexit to ‘reform’ data protection law. “Now that we have left the EU, we have the freedom to create a bold new data regime,” says the Minister in his introduction. The stated intention of this “bold new data regime” is to “usher in a new golden age of growth and innovation right across the UK”. This, to be achieved by creating “​​a better balance between protecting individuals and not impeding responsible data use” [Paragraph 59] — a ‘better balance’ that ends citizen data protection rights in all but name, replacing them with corporate rights&nbsp;instead.</p><p>The Minister’s introduction states that “The protection of people’s personal data must be at the heart of our new regime. Without public trust, we risk missing out on the benefits a society powered by responsible data use has to offer.” But the content of the actual proposals do the opposite.</p> What the law currently says <p>The core principle of existing GDPR data protection regulations is that personal data shall only be “collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes”.</p><p>A key supporting principle is that of data minimisation: that personal data shall be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed”.</p><p>There are six conditions for the lawful processing of personal data but the two central ones are&nbsp;that:</p>  the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;  processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;  <p>Conditions for lawful processing envisage situations where “processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party”. But these legitimate interests come with a ‘balancing test’ to test whether they should be “overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal&nbsp;data”.</p> What the UK Government is proposing <p>On the grounds of addressing ‘consent fatigue’, the Government is proposing to:</p><blockquote>“create a limited, exhaustive list of legitimate interests for which organisations can use personal data without applying the balancing test in order to give them more confidence to process personal data without unnecessary recourse to consent.” [Paragraph 57]</blockquote><p>Paragraph 57 adds that “The processing would still have to be necessary for the stated purposes and proportionate.” But the ‘exhaustive’ list of exceptions to this rule provided in Paragraph 58 is so broad that organisations would have the right to process personal data without individuals’ consent in the vast majority of use cases. In other words, Paragraph 57 renders the safeguard meaningless, leaving it for window dressing&nbsp;only.</p><p>The pivotal clause is Paragraph 58 (i), which makes “Managing or maintaining a database to ensure that records of individuals are accurate and up to date, and to avoid unnecessary duplication” a ‘legitimate interest’ where organisations need not seek individuals’ consent for the processing of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>This deft wrecking amendment turns the current rule — that personal data should only be processed for specified, explicit purposes — on its head, promoting organisations’ right to collect data about individuals without their consent instead. No limit or restriction to organisations’ right to collect data for their databases is mentioned.</p><p>The rest of the consultation extends the exceptions to cover most uses to which organisations put data, including for research, business innovation, web analytics, AI training, use of cookies, and data sharing. For example, Paragraph 58 (i) is supplemented by Paragraph 58(h) which includes “Using personal data for internal research and development purposes, or business innovation purposes aimed at improving services for customers”. No definition for ‘internal research’ or ‘business innovation’ is provided, making them vague enough for Cambridge Analytica to claim that its activities were entirely&nbsp;lawful.</p><p>Paragraph 58(c) has another exception. “Monitoring, detecting or correcting bias in relation to developing AI systems” would now also be a ‘legitimate interest’ where individuals’ consent for data processing is no longer needed. This might seem innocent. Desirable even. But practically speaking, the best way to use data to eliminate the risk of bias is to have as comprehensive and complete a database as possible — which means this clause could (and will) be used by some corporations as good reason to collect all possible data about every individual: it opens the door to total data surveillance. (It is also based on a false premise: that the main cause of bias in AI deployments is lack of access to data. This is not true. The main cause of bias in AI is poor management of the processes for testing and deployment: a people thing, not a data&nbsp;thing.)</p><p>That this is the direction of travel intended by the Government is confirmed by other proposals which include unspecified measures that would “permit organisations to use personal data more freely, subject to appropriate safeguards, for the purpose of training and testing AI responsibly” [Paragraph 81] and to ‘disapply’ individuals’ current right to object to automated processing [Paragraph 48]&nbsp;.</p><p>The Government continues in the same direction with its proposals to reduce ‘consent fatigue’ as it relates to cookies. Paragraph 195 proposes to “permit organisations to use analytics cookies and similar technologies without the user’s consent.” (The term ‘analytics cookies’ is used in a variety of different ways without a single, clear definition.)</p><p>Paragraph 197 would “permit organisations to store information on, or collect information from, a user’s device without their consent for other limited purposes” where ‘other limited purposes’ “could include processing that is necessary for the legitimate interests.” (In other words, the free-for-all created by Paragraph 58).</p><p>Question 2.4.4 simply asks “To what extent do you agree that the requirement for prior consent should be removed for all types of cookies?” Again, a door opener to total data surveillance.</p><p>Meanwhile Paragraph 43(b) seeks to expand the grounds for lawful processing of personal data to include ‘research purposes’, with no stipulations on what may be included or not included in the definition of ‘research’.</p> Implications <p>The purpose of these ‘reforms’ seems to be to create a completely ‘free market’ for the trading of UK citizens’ data, without their consent. The Ministerial introduction talks of “secur[ing] the UK’s status as a global hub for the free and responsible flow of personal data” (Note the word ‘responsible’ again. See&nbsp;below).</p><p>To this end, Paragraph 51(g) (part of an extended discussion on lifting restrictions on the ‘further processing’ of personal data) notes that “Innovative data uses may involve sharing personal data sets between different controllers”. This opens the door to corporations trading peoples’ data without their knowledge and behind their backs. To this end, the Government intends to clarify “When personal data may be re-used by a different controller than the original controller who collected the data, and whether this constitutes further processing.” If this ‘clarification’ is based on the new definition of ‘legitimate interest’, it could make UK citizens’ data a globally traded commodity over which they have no&nbsp;say.</p><p>In sum, the net effect of the new regulations would be to turn data protection regulation on its head, effectively removing all main citizen rights and giving organisations carte blanche to collect and use personal data as they wish, without individuals’ consent, thereby opening the door to unrestricted data surveillance and value extraction. All in the name of ‘innovation and&nbsp;growth’.</p> The regulatory environment <p>As part of this ‘New Direction’ for data, the Government is also seeking to compromise the independence of the regulator — the Information Commissioner’s Office. Key elements of the extended discussion on this subject are the proposals [Paragraph 326] to “place a new duty on it [the ICO] to have regard for economic growth and innovation when discharging its functions”.</p><p>The absurdity of this concept becomes apparent if it is applied to other areas of regulatory enforcement. Should the Health and Safety Executive or Trading Standards Officers ‘have regard for economic growth and innovation when discharging their functions’, ‘balancing’ the requirements of health and safety and honesty in trading against the ‘needs’ for economic growth? What such rules and regulations do is create boundaries that channel innovation and economic growth in a certain direction: a direction that protects health and safety rather than undermines it.</p><p>Likewise with data protection. When it comes to data, the Government wants to compromise rules and regulations that channel innovation and economic growth in a direction that protects citizens’ data to take the nation in “a new direction” (the title of its Paper) — one that exploits citizens’ data instead. Should the ICO have held back on fines on Cambridge Analytica on the grounds that it was promoting innovation and&nbsp;growth?</p><p>This overt political interference in the enforcement of law is confirmed by [Paragraph 319] which introduces “a power for the Secretary of State for DCMS to prepare a statement of strategic priorities to inform how the ICO sets its own regulatory priorities”.</p> The nature of the consultation process <p>At 146 pages and over 50,000 words of dense, technical (and often obfuscatory) commentary, the consultation seems designed not to be read, the purpose being to hide its true intent, made possible by carefully chosen wrecking amendments that are hidden in a welter of often irrelevant detail. How many people have had the time or energy to read and inwardly digest the full document to grasp its implications?</p><p>One of the stated justifications for the proposals are that current regulations are “unnecessarily complex or vague” and continuing to “cause persistent uncertainty”. Yet the consultation itself is both unnecessarily complex and&nbsp;vague.</p><p>Its use of the word ‘responsible’ is a good example. The consultation highlights the difficulty of defining terms like ‘the public interest’ and has an extended discussion of the meaning of ‘fair processing’, concluding that “Comprehensively defining ‘outcome fairness’ in the context of AI within the data protection regime may [therefore] not be a feasible or effective approach”. But with the word ‘responsible’ it introduces a term new to data protection regulations, using it 52 times&nbsp;… without ever defining&nbsp;it.</p> Rationale for&nbsp;reform <p>The Government’s main justification for these ‘reforms’ (other than to rectify ‘confusion and vagueness’) is to address ‘consent fatigue’ and “unleash data’s power across the economy and society for the benefit of British citizens and British businesses” thereby “ushering in a new golden age of growth and innovation right across the&nbsp;UK”.</p><p>Neither of these justifications stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>‘Consent fatigue’ is mainly caused by the widespread gaming of consent systems, compounded by lax regulator oversight. The problem can be better addressed without any changes to the law, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-need-to-talk-about-consent-480f6087a0fe">as we show&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>The ‘innovation and growth’ envisioned by the Government in this Consultation represents a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">deep misunderstanding of what makes data valuable</a>; <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">misconceptions about where the biggest opportunities for innovation</a> lie and how to enable them; and a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and potential of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>In short, because it is intellectually incoherent and flawed, it will not achieve its stated goal: to “unleash data’s power across the economy and society for the benefit of British citizens and British businesses”. In fact, it is almost certain to do the exact opposite.</p> This blog&nbsp;series <p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is Data Valuable?</a> Exposes misconceptions about the value of data, and therefore where its biggest economic potential lies.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">Five Myths about Data, Innovation and Growth</a> Explains why the Government’s claims that its ‘reforms’ will promote innovation and growth are without foundation.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">AI: The Emperor’s New Clothes?</a> Examines common misconceptions about AI, which the Government repeats and uses as justification for its proposed ‘reforms’.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-need-to-talk-about-consent-480f6087a0fe">We Need To Talk About Consent</a> Explains why ‘consent’ to data processing got to be a problem and how to address it — without having to change the&nbsp;law.   Addendum: Paragraphs 57 and 58 in&nbsp;full <p>57. The government therefore proposes to create a limited, exhaustive list of legitimate interests for which organisations can use personal data without applying the balancing test in order to give them more confidence to process personal data without unnecessary recourse to consent. The processing would still have to be necessary for the stated purposes and proportionate. For those activities not on the list, the balancing test would still be applied. The balancing test could also be maintained for use of children’s data, irrespective of whether the data was being processed in connection with an activity on the list. The government is mindful that Article 6(1)(f) of the UK GDPR recognises that particular care should be taken when data controllers are relying on the legitimate interests lawful ground to process data relating to children.</p><p>58. Any list would also need to be sufficiently generic to withstand the test of time, although the government envisages it could be updated via a regulation-making power. In that respect, the list would be similar to the approach in Section 8 of the Data Protection Act 2018 for the public tasks processing condition. For example, it could cover processing activities which are necessary for:</p>  Reporting of criminal acts or safeguarding concerns to appropriate authorities  Delivering statutory public communications and public health and safety messages by non-public bodies  Monitoring, detecting or correcting bias in relation to developing AI systems (see section 1.5 for further&nbsp;details)  Using audience measurement cookies or similar technologies to improve web pages that are frequently visited by service&nbsp;users  Improving or reviewing an organisation’s system or network&nbsp;security  Improving the safety of a product or service that the organisation provides or&nbsp;delivers  De-identifying personal data through pseudonymisation or anonymisation to to improve data&nbsp;security  Using personal data for internal research and development purposes, or business innovation purposes aimed at improving services for customers  Managing or maintaining a database to ensure that records of individuals are accurate and up to date, and to avoid unnecessary duplication   <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-a-new-direction-but-which-direction-da547b886ac0">Data: A New Direction — But Which Direction?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 SHR Staking and Swap are coming soon: make sure you’re #ONETHELIST for early access 



<p>Part of our mission at ShareRing is to enable frictionless access. By giving people control of their digital assets, identity, and economic freedom, we empower individuals to engage and move in-and-between industries with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital assets and earnings play a big role in this mission. In the centralised finance environment we exist in, transparency and control of your own assets are highly restricted and monitored. This inability to wholly manage your assets without a third party overseeing all movements impersonates characteristics of distrust and restriction. ShareRing can help overcome this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/df41607cfe7e/ddhhw9cnal">Sign Up Here</a> for your chance to be selected for our pre-release early access.</p>







<p>Today, we’re announcing new features to the ShareRing app, Staking and Swap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staking will offer our users the choice to delegate their $SHR to our masternodes, and earn $SHR rewards in return. Staking also helps facilitate the economic security of ShareLedger (our blockchain), ensuring that our ecosystem runs at its optimum level at all times.&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://mailchi.mp/df41607cfe7e/ddhhw9cnal"></a>



<p>Swap has long been a feature in our roadmap. Initially we created $SHR as BEP2, however as we have matured we too see the need to develop a BEP20 token. Although this is still in development, you are now able to swap your $SHR with other ERC20 wallets, as well as those native to ShareLedger.</p>



<p>Available Swaps:</p>



<p>SLP3-SHR &lt;–&gt; SLP3-SHR&nbsp;</p>



<p>SLP3-SHR &lt;–&gt; ERC20-SHR</p>



<p>(SLP3-SHR is ShareToken native to ShareLedger)</p>



<p>Developing Community</p>



<p>Staking and Swap will be core features of ShareRing. With a lively, vibrant, secure community of masternode holders and stakers (delegators), we all share the belief and recognition that ShareRing enables a frictionless digital future, whether it be engaging with businesses, or managing your own digital assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://oosto.com/">Oosto</a> is encouraging businesses to embrace contactless access control as they prepare to bring employees back to the office during the pandemic. To illustrate the point, the company has sponsored a new study that identifies some of the most contaminated surfaces in a standard office setting.</p>



  



<p>The actual study was carried out by Bio-Lab Ltd., and looked at multiple surfaces to figure out which ones had the most microbial activity. Oosto noted that many viruses can live on a surface for up to 48 hours, so surfaces with more microbial colonies create a greater risk of transmission for visitors and staff alike.</p>



<p>In that regard, Bio-Lab found that the lobby light switch was the most contaminated surface in the office, with 280 microbial colonies per gram. Other areas of concern include the chair handle in a private office, interior door handles, and shared printers, with microbial counts of 280, 130, and 120, respectively. Couches (60), tables (40), coffee machines (30), and exterior front door handles (30) were other surfaces with high viral activity.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, the problem areas fell into one of two categories. Some (like the lobby light switch and the meeting room door handle) are common touchpoints that are used by many people throughout the day. Others (like chair handles) are used less frequently, but are not cleaned as often as more obvious areas of concern. Oosto also warned about shared <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-report-suggests-fingerprint-market-will-continue-grow-despite-covid-19-070305/">fingerprint sensors</a>, which are used by many people and not sanitized as often as they should be. Fingerprint sensors were the 16th most-contaminated surface in the Bio-Lab study.</p>



<p>The study was conducted in an office with roughly 100 regulars. Though it was commissioned in response to COVID-19, the study examined many common pathogens, including Listeria, Salmonella, and E. Coli. Oosto argued that its facial recognition technology can enable <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tel-aviv-residential-complex-turns-oosto-access-control-111502/">contactless authentication</a>, and that computer vision can be integrated into surveillance cameras to monitor social distancing and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-strengthens-mask-detection-surveillance-capabilities-vision-ai-platform-110401/">enforce occupancy limits and mask mandates</a>.</p>



<p>“Pre-Covid-19, employee safety was mostly about security, allowing only authorized people to enter and alerting the presence of people on a watchlist such as shoplifters or casino cheaters,” said&nbsp;Oosto Sales VP and Americas GM Paul Witt. “A growing number of organizations are turning to touchless technologies such as facial biometrics to minimize risks associated with COVID while maintaining the health of employees and visitors.”</p>



<p>Oosto will be discussing the benefits of contactless access control during a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/live-webinar-10-reasons-to-switch-to-touchless-access-control-712169/">FindBiometrics webinar on January 13</a>. The company has also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-applauds-australian-information-commissioners-clearview-ruling-711118/">spoken out against Clearview AI</a> and advocated for the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-calls-ethical-facial-recognition-guidelines-fordham-conference-120804/">ethical use of facial recognition technologies</a>.</p>

 Part 2 of our discussion around Decentralized Identification solutions, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) <p>In the previous article, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/why-ens-does-not-spell-end-for-did-1d2ef9f197c">Why ENS does not spell END for DID (part 1)</a>, we mentioned that ENS domain names are essentially also decentralized identifiers. So the question is whether there is any difference between ENS and&nbsp;DID?</p> Performance logic <p>The identifier of ENS is the domain name, namely “xxx.eth”. This identifier is readable for users, which is also the most basic goal of ENS, to make unreadable Ethereum addresses resolve to user-friendly identifiers ENS domain names through&nbsp;ENS.</p><p>For DID, its identifier is “did:method:xxxxxx”, for example, the DID identifier provided by Ontology is: “Did:ont:AMQoUFjwjVNNSejomUPRmGrkQDyvmujDt5”, which is a string of “did”, DID Method name “ont” and the address on the Ontology, which is unreadable to&nbsp;users.</p><p>However, the identifier of DID is not fixed but can be designed according to requirements. The DID Method rules give the designer the ability to define DID specifications, and the designer of the DID scheme can also design it as a readable address, such as “did:ont:iris”. This means that designers can take greater initiative in the readability of DID identifiers.</p> Implementation logic <p>In addition to identifiers, ENS and DID are also very different in their implementation logic.</p><p>1. Focus</p><p>For now, ENS itself pays more attention to the associated address. For users, ENS associates the user’s Ethereum address with the domain name through the functions of resolution and reverse resolution, and realizes the binding of the domain name and the internet account. This is then realized as a single sign-on in&nbsp;Web3;</p><p>The information that DID pays attention to is more extensive, and it is also biased towards user personal&nbsp;data:</p>  Contains user’s on-chain data, such as multi-chain addresses, content hashes, on-chain interactions, etc.;  Follow users’ off-chain information, in addition to internet information such as Twitter and mailboxes, they will also follow users’ actual data through third-party authoritative institutions. These sensitive data will be encrypted to generate verifiable credentials, which are saved by the&nbsp;user.  <p>2. On-chain&nbsp;storage</p><p>For user data (on-chain and off-chain), ENS and DID have different storage&nbsp;methods.</p><p>ENS is recorded through the Ethereum smart contract (parser), for example, the content identifier in the IPFS network is recorded through content hash; centralized information such as Twitter, Github, and Email is recorded through text. This means that ENS-based accounts are more open and can be&nbsp;checked.</p><p>According to a survey conducted by <a href="https://blog.sismo.io/a-survey-on-ens-id-and-privacy-management-e8fcd6723316">DAOrayaki</a>, nearly 70% of Sismo respondents indicated that they were unwilling to associate ENS with their private address because the account information was too easy to be&nbsp;queried.</p><p>But in general practice, the DID can be designed by the designer according to the needs. The usual design is for insensitive information to be stored on-chain, and sensitive information being verified through off-chain verification to generate VC and other forms for users to save in their own DID. This method better protects users’&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>3. Permission control</p><p>In the management of ENS, there are two&nbsp;roles:</p>  The registrant, who is the real owner of the domain name and can appoint an administrator or resell the domain&nbsp;name.  The administrator, who has only the authority to manage the domain name, such as the transfer of the administrator and the setting of the domain&nbsp;name.  <p>*If a new administrator is set, the registrant can no longer set the resolver and resolution record of the domain name. These operations must be performed by the administrator.</p><p>DID has a more refined write permission control. According to the description of the W3C DID document, a DID can have multiple verification methods. These verification methods have the rights to change the DID file, authenticate DID entities, and designate agents, including creation, verification, update, and deactivation. Therefore, in terms of access control, the management role of DID appears to be more refined and specific.</p> Application logic <p>The creation of ENS is based on Ethereum. As such, regardless of whether it is created or held, it is necessary to pay on-chain fees on Ethereum. According to the setting of ENS, holding an ENS domain name requires the payment of a rental fee. The fewer the number of words, the higher the rental fee. The annual rental fee for a domain name within three words is as high as $640&nbsp;USD.</p><p>At the same time, ENS is also an NFT, which means that ENS can be resold in NFT markets such as Opensea. These can meet the needs of users for unbinding and monetization.</p><p>For the creation of DID, the user can choose which blockchain to be based on, and it will also incur a certain fee. Moreover, once the DID is created and bound with the user’s identity, it cannot be transferred or destroyed. Therefore, users need to be careful when creating a DID, because DID grants data and identity independent management rights, but also gives users responsibility for their identity. As such, users need to improve their identity and data usage awareness and use their data more securely.</p> Summary <p>In summary, ENS has successfully demonstrated the utility of decentralized identity and helps to highlight the potential of DID. There are opportunities for collaboration and integration between the two, to provide a suite of identity solutions for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Decentralized identity remains an evolving landscape, and although ENS can also be used as a decentralized identity at the application level, it is still quite different from DID in terms of the underlying implementation logic and&nbsp;details.</p><p>Perhaps in the future, ENS will have more refined upgrades, such as KYC and other methods to achieve interaction with off-chain data, adding verifiable credentials to meet the needs of users, including privacy.

<p>Today, we live in a world connected by technologies and devices, and this is called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0">Web 2.0</a>. It is a leap from Web 1.0, where businesses could only broadcast information to&nbsp;users.</p><p>Web 2.0 is also called a social web because social media platforms are one of the biggest drivers of the Internet today closely followed by e-commerce companies. If you look closer, at the heart of these companies’ operations is user&nbsp;data.</p><p>To elaborate, these Web 2.0 companies collect and analyze the data that belong to users, and use it effectively to market their products and services through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-disrupt-surveillance-capitalism-5c8cd6b50278">targeted advertising</a>!</p><p>On the face of it, all of these may seem fine because we are able to find the things we want easily, we get everything delivered at our doorstep, and life is convenient. But what about our most valuable asset — our data, and with it our identity?</p><p>Why is it that a company should store your personal information, analyze your browsing patterns, and make money out of something that defines you and makes you unique? Add to it, the possibility of hackers stealing your data and selling it on the dark&nbsp;web!</p><p>In all, your data is being used by everyone except you! And worse, they thrive off&nbsp;it!</p><p>If all this sounds unacceptable, you’re definitely a part of the revolution called Web 3.0 that is looking to fundamentally change the way your data is owned and&nbsp;used.</p> What is Web&nbsp;3.0? <p>In simple words, Web 3.0 is the next revolution in the world of the Internet and one that can put you in control of your data. It is a world of open and permissionless networks that protect your privacy and empower you to determine how your data is stored and&nbsp;used.</p><p>It is built on three important pillars: decentralized networks, edge computing where data resides in the hands of users rather than in a centralized repository, and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Now that you have an idea of web 3.0, let’s delve a bit into consent management and its current implementation.</p> What is Consent Management? <p>Consent management is a platform or process by which a user determines what must be shared with a business.</p><p>The last few years have seen a greater focus on consent management, thanks to growing awareness about privacy and the emergence of legislation like the&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>That said, the best way to enforce consent management in the current web 2.0 environment is through cookies. Unfortunately, it is a far cry from empowering users to control their data as it focuses more on implied consent buried in unwieldy terms and conditions.</p><p>Here’s a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02479">study</a> that shows how cookies don’t offer any meaningful choices for users and never put them in control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>When you put it all together, it’s clear that the existing consent management practices are not geared for Web 3.0. In fact, it requires a complete shift in mindset as the control has to move away from organizations and into the hands of&nbsp;users.</p><p>But is this even possible? What should a consent management system for Web 3.0 look&nbsp;like?</p><p>To get answers to these questions and more, <a href="https://build.affinidi.com/">download our whitepaper</a> titled, “Building a Consent Management System for Web&nbsp;3.0”</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/consent-management-in-web-3-0-29f9c46767cf">Consent Management in Web 3.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 NFT staking is now&nbsp;live! <p>To celebrate Ontology’s 4th anniversary, we have made 10,000 limited edition <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/cyberspace-4-philosophers-5ab849544879">Cyberspace 4 Philosophers</a> NFT’s available for minting which were all sold out. Not only do they look great, but they will also be used to establish a special NFT Ontology Node where NFT holders benefit from the staking&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>We are delighted to inform all NFT holders and our community members that the node is now all set, and ready for you to stake your NFTs to start earning rewards. NFT holders will also start receiving ONG staking rewards from the next consensus round.</p> Rules of NFT&nbsp;staking <p>Rewards will start generating at the beginning of the next Ontology consensus round (168). At the end of each consensus round, 90% ONG rewards for the node owner are distributed among NFTs that have been staked during this&nbsp;round.</p><p>The amount of ONG distributed as rewards to an NFT is calculated from (X*t)/T. Where X is the total ONG reward available in the consensus round. t is the length of time an NFT has been staked during the round. T is the total time of all the NFTs staked in the current&nbsp;round.</p><p>Therefore, it’s suggested that NFT holders start staking NFTs anytime before the end of the current consensus round.</p><p>Each Ontology consensus round contains 60,000 blocks. Ontology blocks, which contain data of transactions, are generated one by one at time intervals of 1–30 seconds. Therefore, the length of time of each consensus round varies from about 17 hours to about 21&nbsp;days.</p><p>View estimated end time of the current round (167): <a href="https://node.ont.io/stake">https://node.ont.io/stake</a></p> Other information of the&nbsp;node <p>The node’s own initial stake is 100,000 ONT, which is the total amount of ONT spent to mint&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>The node is available for other users to stake with and the maximum amount of other users’ stake is 1,000,000 ONT, which is 10 times the node’s own initial&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Total stake = node’s own initial stake + other users’&nbsp;stake</p><p>The fee sharing ratio of the node is 10%/95%, which is from the other users’ perspective. The first ratio refers to the sharing percentage of the ONG rewards from the node’s own initial stake, and the second ratio refers to the sharing percentage of the ONG rewards from the other users’&nbsp;stake.</p><p>The table below shows how the ONG rewards for the node owner vary according to the amount of other users’&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Under current circumstances, the amount of A, B, and C would be almost the same. Therefore, the higher the other users’ stake, the higher the rewards for the node owner. This also means higher rewards for NFT&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>In summary, for NFT&nbsp;owners:</p>  Welcome other users’&nbsp;stake  Don’t forget to stake&nbsp;NFTs   Guide  Stake NFT and Claim ONG&nbsp;Reward <p>Tap on the “Stake/Redeem” button at the bottom right of the homepage to open the “Stake/Redeem” page, then tap on the “Stake” button to stake NFT or the “Unstake” button to unstake&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>ONG rewards are distributed at the end of each consensus round.

Deepu:
<br>
I’m so thankful for Linux accepting Rust as another language for the Kernel and I’m thankful for all the backing it is getting from big names. I’m sure this will lead to Linux becoming more secure as more and more code might be written in Rust.
<br>
I’m also grateful for great communities like <a href="https://foojay.io/">Foojay</a> and the awesome contributors of JHipster and Rust.


	  
	
Matt:
<br>
I’ve focused on tools in past holiday posts. This year, I’d like to focus on people. I’d like to focus on a couple folks who have really helped me move things along in JHipster and other projects:
<br>
- Marcelo Shima (@mshima on GitHub, no Twitter): for Micro Frontends, migrating Ionic and Quarkus to JHipster 7, and for being an awesome developer. He’s been cranking out code like mad and is now our #4 contributor! https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/graphs/contributors
<br>
- Vishal Mahajan (@vishal423 on GitHub and Twitter): for all his help with OAuth and OAuth-related issues with JHipster.
<br>
- Pascal Grimaud (@pascalgrimaud on GitHub and Twitter): for managing JHipster’s CI and release process. It’s a thankless job and he often does it on weekends, outside of work.
	


	  
	
Brian:
<br>
Like Matt, I’m feeling grateful right now for some individuals who really stand out in my communities. 
<br>
- Benjamin Marwell (@bmarwell on GitHub and Twitter): Awesome developer, he has been helping to push the latest updates to the @ApacheShiro project.
<br>
- The Apache Infra Team (@TheASF on Twitter), some of the unsung heroes of the open-source world. They are always helpful and quick to respond to questions, #HugOps
<br>
- The OktaDev Team. The Great Tech Exodus of 2021 shook up the team a bit, but everyone on the team, new and old, has been a joy to work with!
	


	  
	
Tanay: 
<br>
- The OktaDev team. Joining new teams can be stressful, but my last few weeks have been just amazing! I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for being so kind and helpful 🤗
<br>
- Shawn Wang (@swyx on Twitter): I have been enjoying his writings, and he has inspired me to delve into topics that I didn’t know I cared about as well as think things from a different perspective 👨‍🏫
<br>
- We would all have a tough time learning new things if it weren’t for all the documentation and support teams. Thank you for your hard work in making sure that everyone in the community succeeds 🙌 
	



	  
	
	
Alisa:
<br>
The JavaScript ecosystem is huge and constantly evolving - it’s almost impossible to keep up with changes and new frameworks. But luckily, we have a community of people who share their knowledge, help lower the barriers for each other, and advocate for safe learning environments. I appreciate the bravery and tenacity of code newbies and 100-days-of-coders who share their learning journey so freely, friendly spaces such as dev.to so we can learn from each other, and the voices of established developers who foster a welcoming culture to better the community. 
<br>
As an Angular developer, I also appreciate the contributors and maintainers for awesome OSS libraries that make up the Angular ecosystem. Their hard work power enterprise software systems, usually without any pay or recognition. I am thankful for their continued support of their libraries, inspired by their passion to contribute, and grateful for the time they spend on their projects. 
	



	  
	
edunham
<br>
I share Alisa’s appreciation for the OSS developers who make the DevOps ecosystem, and indeed most of the internet, possible. 
<br>
There’s another group of volunteers that I’d like to highlight this year, too: I’m thankful for all the conference organizers around the world who’ve had to make the hard choices about the best ways to keep their events and communities alive! I’ve seen them making hard choices to cancel and modify events this year, and it’s pretty thankless work right now to keep their communities going. But due to their dedication, I’m able to look forward to reuniting with old friends and making new ones at community events. 
	



<p>Happy holidays from the Okta team!</p>

<p>In 2020, Onfido held its first remote Hackathon event. We called it “The 2020 Effect,” and invited participants to help shape the impact 2020 would have on Onfido. No one on the committee had planned a remote Hackathon before then. Here are a few of the questions we encountered and how we approached them.</p> How do we help people organize&nbsp;teams? <p>Casual office interactions have traditionally been a huge driver for organizing teams before a Hackathon. 2020 was the first remote Hackathon for most of our participants, so we wanted to help foster team formation.</p><p>Our first attempt to resolve this issue was a major fail. I organized a Google Form and asked all Hackathon participants to fill it out. In the form, they indicated whether they wanted to form their own team or be placed onto a team. For those interested in being placed on a team, I also requested additional information about the type of team they wanted to be a part&nbsp;of.</p><p>Then, I played match-maker. I carefully reviewed the responses and hand organized teams based on their preferences. I created Slack channels for each team and invited members to&nbsp;join.</p><p>About half of the people who were originally interested in being placed on a team ended up either finding a team they wanted to join instead, or dropping out of the Hackathon. I reorganized the teams several times. It was painful for myself and nearly everyone involved.</p><p>We found a better way to address this question in 2021: a pre-Hackathon idea&nbsp;share.</p><p>This was the most casual 70-person zoom event I’ve ever hosted, and it was so much fun! After a short introduction about the Hackathon, we had two rounds of small-group interaction, where I organized people into Breakout rooms. Then, back in the big group, people had the opportunity to pitch their ideas to the whole group to attempt to gain teammates. I can proudly say that one of the winning teams was formed during this&nbsp;meeting.</p><p>This second approach of providing a pre-Hackathon event allowed participants to have more autonomy in choosing their groups, while still providing a space to interact and exchange&nbsp;ideas.</p> How do we encourage participation from all&nbsp;geos? <p>The UK-based engineering lead who organized the Hackathon committee in 2020 made sure to include representatives from various geos on the committee. As a US representative, I was able to promote the event with excitement and investment during US team meetings.</p><p>When planning the 2020 event, we also decided that we should allow cross-continental teams. It certainly offered some additional challenges to teams, but if people had interest, why stop them? Both years, we have had cross-continental teams win&nbsp;prizes.</p><p>To address the time difference for presentation events, we tried two different formats in 2020 and 2021, and I would say that they were about equally successful.</p><p>In 2020, we organized multiple presentation times, and allowed teams to select which one to present at. This way, US teams, or teams with US members could select the later&nbsp;time.</p><p>In 2021, we held one presentation event, which was in the morning in the US time, but allowed flexibility on which days teams did their Hacking that week. Overall, I would say I had a slight preference for this version, as it provided more flexibility for everyone.</p> How do we make it feel different from routine&nbsp;work? <p>It’s all about how you&nbsp;Slack.</p><p>In 2020, our internal communications director created an entirely new Slack Workspace. This allowed participants to be present in a completely distinct virtual environment than they usually would be. The downside of the new Slack Workspace was the additional friction it created to get participants added to&nbsp;it.</p><p>In 2021, we tried staying in our usual Slack Workspace, but with channels dedicated to the Hackathon with the prefix “hack”. We had #hack-home, #hack-idea-share, and #hack-banter. Admittedly, it didn’t have the same fresh feeling as the 2020 Hackathon Workspace.</p> What do we do about SWAG? Shall we mail everyone stickers? <p>We decided not to mail everyone stickers. After talking to a few individuals at Onfido, there were some expressed feelings that it wasn’t particularly carbon-conscious.</p><p>We decided to offer “digital swag”, and with help from our design team, we found several entertaining examples.</p><p>In 2020, we offered Hackathon-themed zoom backgrounds, Google presentation slides, Slack images, and Slack emoji responses. In 2021, we added a Hackathon trailer, which was presented at a company-wide meeting.</p><p>The digital swag was a fun way to express the company’s investment in the Hackathon. It was a priority to our e-team that people participate in the Hackathon, and themed digital swag helped communicate that.</p> What do we do about snacks and&nbsp;pizza? <p>We have not figured this one out yet. We have some events where we offer the opportunity for participants to expense snacks to the company… but it just doesn’t have the same feel as walking into a break room and finding a pizza&nbsp;box.</p><p>New Idea! Maybe next year, we create a #hack-snacks channel where people can post photos of their Hackathon snacks.</p> Is it possible to hold a successful cross-continental remote Hackathon? <p>Yes! Even with the match-making flub of 2020, both Hackathons yielded inspirational projects. Planning any Hackathon, including a cross-continental remote Hackathon, is about giving participants an opportunity to shine. As long as a few basic Hackathon needs are&nbsp;met:</p>  The ability to form&nbsp;teams  Time reserved to spend on&nbsp;projects  A way to submit or present&nbsp;projects  <p>Hackathons can be a great way to surface new and inspiring ideas.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/tips-for-planning-a-remote-hackathon-a3caae463ec0">Tips for planning a remote Hackathon</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Holochain is co-hosting the Web3 room again at FOSDEM 2022. I’d love to see up-and-coming Holochain-projects give talks there!</p><p>But first, some Holochain release notes.</p> Holochain 0.0.120: build info <p>Last week’s release saw a new flag for the Holochain conductor: <code>holochain --build-info</code> &nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1163">#1163</a>). This outputs a JSON blob of the context in which the conductor was built, including — most importantly — the HDK version it’s compatible with. This is important, because as I mentioned in last week’s Dev Pulse, HDK version numbers are now <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/thanks-for-hammering-holochain/#wait-where-s-hdk-0-0-119">decoupled</a> from conductor version numbers.</p> Holochain 0.0.121: macOS build issue fixed <p>This week’s release fixes a build issue on macOS involving OpenSSL (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1169">#1169</a>). If you use macOS and build your own conductor from source, this will probably be good news.</p> FOSDEM 2022: see you there! <p>Once again, the Holochain Foundation and Fluence Labs are co-hosting the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/web3_infrastructure/">Web3 room</a> at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/">FOSDEM 2022</a>, Europe’s largest open-source conference. And once again, thanks to a stupid virus, FOSDEM is being held online. The positive side is that everyone on the internet can attend!</p><p><a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/beyond_blockchain_distributed_web/">Last year</a> we saw excellent talks from a number of different and interesting projects — not just Holochain and Fluence, but many other sister projects in the DWeb space. <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a>, <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/">Beaker Browser</a>, and others were represented.</p><p>We’d love to see you present your project at FOSDEM! The call for talks closes soon — December 29th — so please <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22">submit your proposal</a> soon. (Talks should be recorded and submitted by January 16th.) If you want to get a feel for how long the talk should be, and what it can be about, <a href="https://github.com/lekanova/Web3-FOSDEM/blob/main/README.md">read this readme</a>.</p><p>If you’d like to attend FOSDEM, it happens on the 5th and 6th of February. Attendance costs nothing!</p> Holochain and hApp CI matrix <p><a href="https://github.com/harlantwood">Harlan Wood</a>, a long-time supporter of the project and more recently a very active hApp dev, produced a table of <a href="https://holochain-ci.github.io/matrix/">all the most active Holochain-related projects</a>, including hApps and the conductor itself. It shows the continuous integration (test and build) status for all these projects in one place.</p>A recent screenshot of the Holochain CI matrix.<p>Previously, it also showed the HDK versions the hApp projects were currently using. This was based on an older format for the Nix file, however. Since Harlan is no longer maintaining this project, he’d love for someone to add this feature back in. This is a pretty useful feature, because it will help power users find out whether a given hApp is compatible with the version of Launcher that they currently have. If you’re interested in taking over maintenance of this project, you can find the repo at <a href="https://github.com/holochain-ci/matrix">https://github.com/holochain-ci/matrix</a> and talk to Harlan there.</p> Reflections on the year <p>For the end-of-year meeting, the core devs were asked to reflect on the progress made during 2021. The positivity of their comments reflect the hugely improved state of our little project, compared with September 2020 before we <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/new-holochain-rsm-released-to-public/">unveiled</a> the rewritten Holochain. I also appreciate their deep insights into the nature of the project itself and the way it reflects the world as it exists and as we’d like to help it become.</p><blockquote>The SQLite transition has gone pretty well, we still have some optimization-level things to take care of, but [...] we've already realized a lot of benefits over the LMDB implementation. We're starting to get the performance we need out of our networking / P2P / gossip, and we need to keep working on that to really nail it for upcoming scales of testing. One thing we haven't yet done on that front is security hardening. We've started down that path with the lair key management [...]<br>— David B</blockquote><blockquote>I've been very impressed by our demonstrated strive for balancing individual wellbeing with the pursuit of our common goals, and that there is a habit of inviting everyone to exchange their experiences. I'm looking forward to continuing the path we are all on together; that is to realize, continuously refine and advocate for the new paradigms that we came together for.<br>— Stefan</blockquote><blockquote>At the start of the year it wasn't clear to anyone how to build happs on Holochain; I think now it is very clear to anyone paying attention. While we still have a long list of "todos" we also have two hApps operational on Holo (not just Holochain) and scaling steadily with each release. Both of these hApps represent 'impossible' ideas on blockchain that seem not just possible, but moving towards inevitable on Holochain. [...] By this time next year I hope to see more developers, communities and businesses look at holochain and see not just how to build 'a hApp' but how to build 'their hApp'.<br>— David M</blockquote><blockquote>We saw the great SQLite refactor, which [led to a lot of] opportunities for improvement. Tom really shone here, diagnosing and fixing these problems in a steady stream of PRs. [...] This was a huge step forward for networking too, with sharded gossip finally approaching viability. [...] David B built a really solid networking library almost single-handedly, and it's been relatively easy to jump in and contribute to it.<br>— Michael</blockquote><blockquote>I joined Holochain because I wanted to work for an ethical tech company that would be developing in Rust. I didn't know much about distributed systems; however, I have discovered the beauty and complexity in a system that runs spread throughout space and time. This reflects how humans work, distributed around the world, each with our own frame of reference, attempting to operate as a larger organism. [...] Another big highlight is actually seeing Elemental Chat running on a non-trivial sized network. I'm excited to be able to actually use Holochain for a hobby project and get some of my developer friends excited about it.<br>— Tom</blockquote> Milestones we’ve passed <p>It’s encouraging to see what the core dev team has accomplished since they started rewriting Holochain.

<p>Air travel was one of the industries hit hardest during the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sita-publishes-18-month-plan-digital-transformation-air-travel-070202/">Traffic plummeted</a> as countries closed their borders to control the spread of the disease, and lockdowns limited the appeal of most destinations for anyone who could get on a plane.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there are signs that the industry is starting to recover. Travel volumes have steadily picked up in the second half of the year, and the increased availability of vaccines (and vaccine boosters) has created cause for optimism despite the ongoing spread of COVID variants.</p>



<p>Recent technological advancements are also playing a key role in that recovery. Improved screening technologies help airports process passengers more quickly, and (more importantly) allow them to do so while still keeping people safe during a pandemic.</p>



<p>Many of those technologies were on display at the Future Travel Experience (FTE) Global conference earlier this month, and we were able to get a look at many of the highlights from the show floor. With that in mind, here are four key trends that will shape the future of air travel for people all over the world:</p>



<p>Identity is the Future</p>



<p>Identity was the leading topic of conversation at FTE. From document readers to self-service kiosks to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/walking-through-airport-future-fte-global-121603/">gates outfitted with facial recognition cameras</a>, air industry stakeholders are trying to come up with faster and simpler ways to identify people getting onto flights.</p>



<p>In that regard, a complete end-to-end identity system is made up of several disparate parts, all of which were represented at FTE. HID Global and Regula were focused primarily on document scanners, while Corsight and Paravision were showing off contactless facial recognition systems. Meanwhile, companies like IDEMIA, NEC, Vision-Box, and SITA are trying to put all of the pieces together to link a passenger’s biometrics to their identity document and deliver a more streamlined passenger journey.</p>



<p>Regardless of the specific use case, the goal remains the same. The air travel industry wants to process more people in a shorter amount of time, and it is taking steps to do that while traffic volumes are still down during the pandemic.</p>



<p>The results of those efforts should become more evident in the next few years. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nist-report-suggests-facial-recognition-reliable-airport-screening-tool-072001/">Facial recognition</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sita-develops-biometric-kiosks-ahead-eus-enhanced-border-protocols-102103/">self-service stations</a> will become even more widespread than they are now, and there will be more and more mobile apps (such as <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vision-box-partners-airside-enable-mobile-travel-screening-020409/">Airside’s identity platform</a>) being integrated into the passenger experience. Those apps will allow people to start the identification process at home, which will speed things up even more when they do get to the airport.</p>



<p>Clear the Path</p>



<p>While most of the identity technologies on display at FTE can make airports more efficient, most of them also still fit within the parameters of a more traditional passenger journey. In plain terms, that means that they still ask people to stop at <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/airport-biometric-touchpoints-to-increase-320-by-2030-report-7410181/">obvious high-friction checkpoints</a> (such as self-service kiosks or boarding gates) to complete either a face or a document recognition scan. Each one of those stops could become a potential chokepoint if enough people are trying to get through at the same time.</p>



  



<p>With that in mind, it’s worth calling attention to the high-throughput facial recognition solutions that could transform the way that people move through airports. Both Corsight and Paravision are trying to replace more traditional gates and turnstiles with completely frictionless corridors that are so unobtrusive that the people walking through them would not even know that they are being scanned.</p>



<p>In practice, that means that airports would be able to mount small cameras on the walls of a hallway, and those cameras would authenticate passengers (and match them to their flights) as they walk down the hallway in real time. Those passengers would need to be registered in the system before getting to the airport or at check-in. However, they would not need to stop for any secondary inspections as they walk through the airport and board their flights.</p>



<p>The Paravision and Corsight tech is fast enough to identify dozens of people simultaneously, and robust enough to generate matches at challenging angles, and when people are wearing masks. That’s why it has the most potential to completely upend the legacy airport experience. Frictionless facial recognition would theoretically allow airports to remove some of their physical security hardware, without creating any new vulnerabilities in their security posture. The technology probably won’t be deployed at scale for a few more years, but its presence at FTE is a telling indicator of where the travel industry is headed with regards to screening.</p>



<p>Rules and Regulations</p>



<p>One of the recurring themes at FTE was that most of the technology on display is already good enough to deploy. The document scanners can read documents. The cameras can read faces. And if it is all integrated properly, it will create a dramatic improvement for most travelers.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that scenario is unlikely to play out anytime soon. Most of the technologies still need to get certified by organizations like the TSA and other government agencies around the world, and the vendors selling those technologies still need to persuade airports and airlines to invest in next-generation infrastructure.</p>



<p>In other words, technological development is not going to be the biggest challenge for air travel stakeholders in the next few years. Rather, the challenges will be working with regulators to get the technologies that already exist certified and approved for use at scale. Developers also need to convince buyers and the general public of the value those technologies bring to airport operations. Overcoming those obstacles will take time, and will <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sita-highlights-urgent-need-digital-transformation-air-travel-102004/">slow the rate of digital transformation</a> as new technologies make their way through that regulatory bureaucracy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Running a Temperature</p>



<p>One of the other noteworthy takeaways from FTE is what wasn’t there. While many vendors were showcasing some kind of passenger processing technology, none of them were pushing any kind of thermal screening tech. Many companies <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nec-provide-biometric-temperature-screening-hawaii-airports-071707/">introduced temperature detection</a> systems in early 2020, in most cases pitching them as an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/dermalog-pushes-fever-detection-camera-stop-spread-coronavirus-040306/">effective COVID-19 detection method</a>. However, the technology was entirely absent from the FTE show floor in 2021, and it did not even come up in most discussions about the future of air travel.</p>



  



<p>Of course, that’s not all that surprising now that doctors know more about the coronavirus. While fever is a common symptom of COVID-19, it can also be a symptom of many other diseases. More importantly, thermal scanners will not catch infected people who are either pre- or asymptomatic, which limits their utility as a COVID-19 screening measure.</p>



<p>That fact that the world’s leading air travel stakeholders are so totally disinterested in temperature screening suggests that the tech was a fad rather than a trend. Airlines and airports are still trying to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, but are much more likely to rely on actual COVID-19 test and vaccination results rather than spurious temperature scans.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>The technologies on display at FTE Global should help restore trust between travelers and travel stakeholders, which should in turn make consumers feel more confident the next time they want to book a trip. That shift will be vital to the long-term recovery of the industry. If FTE Global is any indication, the industry will be ready when the world decides to return to the skies.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.facephi.com/">FacePhi</a> is looking to increase its business activity in its home country thanks to a new partnership with NewThink.</p>



<p>The latter is a consultancy and systems integrator focused on helping companies with their digital transformations. And its work covers a number of technological areas, including app development, analytics, AI assistants, and digital identity management.</p>



<p>The firm also has “extensive knowledge of biometrics”, according to FacePhi CRO Jorge Sanz. Commenting in a statement, Sanz explained that for FacePhi, the partnership “represents an important opportunity to incorporate our technology within the extensive portfolio of clients that NewThink boasts.”</p>



<p>Sanz added that the partnership will help FacePhi to “reinforce [its] position on a national level” in areas including travel, transportation, and finance, among others. </p>



<p>As a pioneer in the selfie-based onboarding boom – and a vendor of a wide range of additional biometric solutions – FacePhi is already one of Spain’s most prominent tech firms. The identity specialist was designated as <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/spain-lists-facephi-strategic-company-country-111605/">a strategically important company</a> by the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism last month, enabling it to offer special visas to Highly Qualified Professionals from outside of the country.</p>



<p>For NewThink, meanwhile, the partnership will allow it to enhance its identity verification offerings for the companies it works with.</p>



<p>“NewThink is proud to work with the most advanced technology for user identity verification, and to contribute to promoting the digitisation process in different business sectors,” commented NewThink co-founder and CEO José Vicente Hernández.</p>



<p>News of the partnership comes shortly after FacePhi’s announcement that it will be participating in a government-led initiative to assess the potential benefits of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-to-shift-to-four-day-work-week-in-2022-712172/">a four-day workweek</a> in the new year.</p>

<p><a href="https://tech5.ai/">TECH5</a> has teamed up with Chile-based IT engineering consultancy Solem on a biometric solution aimed at helping to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>The solution is designed to tie an individual’s face biometrics to their COVID-19 test results, enabling a kind of biometric health credential that can be used to trace the virus and manage infections through quarantines. The biometric matching is facilitated via T5-Face, TECH5’s flagship facial recognition solution.</p>



<p>“The solution is fully inclusive even for those workers who do not have a smartphone, as onboarding can be done in the clinic prior to testing,” explained Solem Product Manager Victor Parra. “The same solution can be used in cases when symptoms are suspected to make sure that the person has taken a rapid test, avoiding in this way the entry of a person with positive virus detection into a worksite.”</p>



<p>TECH5 and Solem say their joint solution has already been tested in Chile, and that it “will now be implemented for the active search of COVID-19 cases,” according to a statement.</p>



<p>The Solem project helps to illustrate the breadth of TECH5’s technological portfolio, which also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-enables-contactless-fingerprint-capture-via-mobile-solution-709301/">features fingerprint biometrics</a>. Commenting in a statement, TECH5 VP Jeremy James said the collaborative effort “is a great opportunity to introduce [TECH5’s] technologies and solutions to a wider range of customers, as well as prove its effectiveness in various use cases across Latin America.”</p>



<p>It’s an ambitious application of TECH5’s biometric technology, but one that is adjacent to the company’s ongoing efforts in the realm of large-scale biometric digital ID programs. On that front, TECH5 announced that its T5-IDencode solution was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-increases-support-mosip-identity-program-090905/">compatible with the MOSIP Foundational Identity Platform</a> for national ID in September, and soon after that launched <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-invites-partners-trial-digital-id-solution-092105/">a pilot program</a> revolving around its T5-Digital ID solution for organizations in its partner network.</p>

<p>We live in a digital age in which technology is advancing at an exponential rate, our world is becoming digitized, and our personal information is linked to more and more apps, devices, and services. &nbsp;Our digital identities are increasingly prone to data breaches and misuse as our personal information is shared with every service provider we wish to engage with. &nbsp;Decentralized identity is an emerging concept becoming more popular for online consumers by eliminating the need to pass personal identifiable information (PII) to an ever-increasing number of companies. However, in practice, decentralized identity has only existed for a handful of years, and its potential is still being discovered. So how did we get here?<br></p><p>Conventional Centralized Identity<br></p><p>Online identity has evolved since the creation of the internet and taken many forms in its relatively short lifespan. &nbsp;Initially, we saw the rise in popularity of conventional siloed identity, in which a centralized authority (service provider, retailer, government agency, university, etc.) gathers and stores PII for every user account in its system. &nbsp;The problem here is that as we created more and more online accounts, each with their own usernames and passwords, more of our personal data was being dumped into these massive databases. &nbsp;<br></p><p>As these centralized identity models continued to increase, so too did the size of the target on the siloed databases. &nbsp;Hackers recognized that these stores of data were ripe for the picking and it became apparent that the more accounts you had spread across the web, the more likely it was for your personal identity information to be compromised in a data breach. &nbsp;Centralized identity is still one of the most common digital identity models in use today, which has unfortunately opened the door to a continuous onslaught of data breaches. &nbsp;Even today, data breaches are up 17% since 2020 and our email address, social security numbers, bank account information, and more, are all vulnerable to exposure.<br></p><p>In addition to being risky, keeping track of dozens of usernames and passwords made digital identity management incredibly inconvenient. &nbsp;Let’s face it, when it comes to the security of our digital identities, and the manner in which data is exchanged, efficiency and urgency are key. &nbsp;Wouldn’t it make sense to be able to reuse one identity account with multiple sites and services? &nbsp;Thus, a new identity solution was created: federated identity. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Federated Identity<br></p><p>Even if you’ve never heard of federated identity (FID), chances are you’ve encountered a federated identity solution before - anytime you’ve been asked to “Log in with Google.” This identity movement gave users the ability to reuse an account across multiple services and put a certain amount of control back in the hands of the user, especially with the rise of Facebook, Google, and other social media platforms. Beyond that, this approach helped usher in the paradigm shift from physical wallets to digital wallets, as our identities became increasingly linked to our mobile devices. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Apple Pay and Google Pay are two examples of this contact-less, mobile payment technology that placed identity credentials directly on a user’s device. &nbsp;Reducing the need to carry and use credit cards definitely added a level of security to the everyday transaction process, and was arguably more convenient, but it did not prove to be the best solution for protecting our digital identities. &nbsp;For one, it required users to place a tremendous amount of trust in the identity provider (Facebook and Google, for example, both of which have had major data breaches), taking control out of the hands of the users. &nbsp;Furthermore, reliance on a centralized service provider means acquiescing to the security and privacy policies implemented by that federation, which could be limited by device type or Terms of Service, for instance. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Decentralized Identity</p><p>The natural solution to the security and privacy issues associated with a centralized digital identity is a decentralized identity. This identity solution has taken off in recent years as personal privacy and cybersecurity becomes even more important. Real-world credentials such as email address, social media accounts, government-issued ID, bank account and more can now be attested to, verified, and stored tamper-proof on a user’s device, and potentially shared and reused at the discretion of the user. Moreover, a user only needs to prove their identity once, establishing a verification that acts as a cryptographic key with each company they interact with. &nbsp;<br></p><p>A future built on decentralized identity opens the door for an ecosystem in which digital interactions are transparent, interoperable, and efficient. &nbsp;From proving your identity on a dating site to allowing businesses to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, all while reducing the chances of identity theft and fraud, decentralized identity will continue to play a major role in our daily lives.</p><p>The Bloom Solution</p><p><a href="https://bloom.co/">Bloom</a> offers a solution for digital identity, user privacy, and risk assessment. &nbsp;In fact, Bloom was founded in response to the 2017 Equifax scandal, in which hackers gained access to the private information of 147 million US citizens. &nbsp;By developing the BloomID, Bloom gave its users the ability to create and control their own digital identities. &nbsp;More recently, with the release of <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a>, our latest business-focused product, we are securely connecting enterprises to users by offering reusable, verifiable credentials to help enable compliance and risk assessment. &nbsp;This means that your personal information and financial data, used in risk assessment, are available to use on a decentralized platform without sacrificing your privacy.</p><p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all with one simple app. No more centralized data storage. No more selling off your data to the highest bidder. It’s time to take back control of your data and unlock the power of a secure identity today. <a href="https://bloom.co/download?utm_source=twidb&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=download">Download the Bloom mobile app</a> to build a digital identity, monitor your credit, and get free data breach alerts with Radar! &nbsp;And then watch as new opportunities start to present themselves for use with businesses you interact with. &nbsp;Subscribe to our newsletter to keep abreast of the latest companies integrating with Bloom's mobile app.</p>

<p>2021 was another strong year for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">The FIDO Alliance</a>. The organization remains committed to its primary mission, and celebrated many successes as it works to end the world’s reliance on password-based security.</p>



<p>Most notably, the Alliance was finally able to host its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-releases-authenticate-2021-agenda-081702/">first in-person Authenticate conference</a> after its inaugural event was disrupted by COVID-19. The organization used the opportunity to introduce a new <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-alliance-certification-program-authentication-pros-810191/">Certified Professional Program</a>, which is geared toward engineers, technology architects, and security professionals working in the authentication space. The certification program attests to an individual’s technical expertise, and indicates that they are qualified to help implement FIDO authentication systems.</p>



<p>The Alliance believes that its certification programs will create more consensus about best practices for the cybersecurity industry. On that front, the organization also introduced a new <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-introduces-iot-device-onboarding-standard-042006/">Device Onboard protocol</a> to help enterprises add new IoT devices to a network without exposing themselves to new security threats, and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-promotes-passwordless-authentication-with-user-experience-guidelines-062403/">new user experience guidelines</a> for customer-facing businesses that want to transition to passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>In other news, FIDO handed out its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/germanys-information-security-office-achieves-fidos-first-level-3-authenticator-certification-040706/">first Level 3+ Authenticator certification</a> to Germany’s Office of Information Security, which speaks to the growing acceptance of the FIDO standard. The Alliance would later start tracking that progress with the release of its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fidos-first-authentication-barometer-tracks-growing-support-biometrics-101806/">first Online Authentication Barometer</a>, and run its first <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-announces-winners-developer-challenge-111501/">Global Developer Challenge</a> to push international teams to come up with new applications of FIDO2 technology.</p>



<p>Taken together, the Alliance’s accomplishments suggest that passwordless solutions are gaining ground in the public and private sectors. Let us know your thoughts on the state of passwordless authentication in our <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/take-the-findbiometrics-year-in-review-2021-survey/">2021 Year in Review Survey</a>!</p>

<p>Governments were forced to take cybersecurity more seriously in 2021. Though the attack happened before the start of the year, January opened with conversations about the hack of SolarWinds, an incident that was at least partially <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/solarwinds-hackers-guessed-passwords-cisa-701081/">attributed to password vulnerabilities</a>. That was followed by a separate ransomware attack against the Colonial Pipeline in May.</p>



  



<p>Those incidents (amongst several others) served as a wakeup call for many governments. President Biden <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biden-seeks-establish-clear-cybersecurity-standards-with-executive-order-051807/">issued an executive order</a> mandating US federal agencies to implement multi-factor authentication, and public agencies all over the world are <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nsw-government-starts-search-digital-wallet-facial-recognition-solutions-112403/">increasingly turning to biometric technologies</a> to provide better digital services while minimizing the threat of fraud.</p>



<p>However, that shift toward biometrics has not been without some controversy. Privacy advocates have argued that governments cannot be trusted to protect people’s biometric information. That stance gained greater urgency after the Taliban reportedly <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/policy-experts-raise-concerns-about-afghanistans-biometric-databases-090105/">seized biometric devices</a> left behind by the US in Afghanistan.</p>



<p>Such incidents are now driving a broader debate about what information should be stored in government biometric databases, and about privacy more generally. President Biden, for instance, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biden-reverses-trump-order-expand-dhss-biometrics-collection-070802/">reversed a Trump order</a> that would have expanded the Department of Homeland Security’s biometric data collection powers. At the same time, multiple federal agencies have <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/gao-finds-broad-support-facial-recognition-clearview-ai-among-federal-agencies-082701/">expressed open enthusiasm</a> for Clearview AI’s facial recognition platform, even though several countries have forced the company to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/canadian-provinces-issue-further-injunctions-against-clearview-ai-121504/">suspend its operations</a> due to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-ai-could-face-17-million-fine-privacy-violations-uk-120301/">data privacy violations</a>.</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that those questions are going to be resolved any time soon. If nothing else, 2021 simply revealed that international governments need to update their security practices to shore up the gaps in their current systems, and that they need to be cognizant about how they go about doing it to make sure they don’t end up doing more harm. </p>

<p>As we approach the end of 2021, facial recognition is more ubiquitous than ever. The technology has become an increasingly popular remote and in-person authentication option, especially as COVID-related health concerns have pushed people away from contact-based modalities like fingerprint recognition.</p>



  



<p>However, that rise has not been without some controversy.&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/momentum-builds-facial-recognition-laws-united-states-052801/">International lawmakers</a>&nbsp;(and&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-parliament-speaks-out-against-automated-identification-systems-101304/">European lawmakers in particular</a>) are finally starting to crack down on some of the more invasive applications of the technology, and in doing so have advanced a broader debate about the ethical implications of facial recognition. Privacy advocates all over the world are expressing their concerns about&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/privacy-watchdogs-sound-alarm-about-secret-nypd-surveillance-fund-081303/">large-scale surveillance programs</a>, and the potential for abuse that arises from&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-technology-rally-testing-showed-racial-bias-worsened-by-face-masks-dhs-708271/">biased facial recognition systems</a>.</p>



<p>Clearview AI sits at the center of that storm. The company has&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-raises-30-million-in-series-b-funding-despite-legal-troubles-707221/">continued to grow</a>&nbsp;in 2021 despite&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-applauds-australian-information-commissioners-clearview-ruling-711118/">pushback from other facial recognition developers</a>, and despite the fact that&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/canadian-provinces-issue-further-injunctions-against-clearview-ai-121504/">several countries</a>&nbsp;have now ruled that the company’s data collection practices&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-ai-could-face-17-million-fine-privacy-violations-uk-120301/">violate their privacy laws</a>.</p>



<p>That battle will carry over into 2022 as the legal environment takes shape, and as industry stakeholders work to make the public&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ibia-white-paper-aims-make-public-more-comfortable-with-facial-recognition-082705/">feel more comfortable</a>&nbsp;with facial recognition technology. Some have pushed for a&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/interview-aware-ceo-bob-eckel-mobile-biometrics-success-712159/">consent-based model</a>, while others continue to promote more sweeping&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-radarapp-expand-surveillance-network-mexico-city-121604/">surveillance applications</a>.

<p><a>Wondershare</a> is trying to make things simpler for video editors with the latest iteration of its DemoCreator platform. DemoCreator 5.4 comes with a slew of new video editing tools, including an automatic caption generator and an improved face detection system.</p>



  



<p>Of those, the auto caption generator may be the most immediately impactful because it will help make videos more accessible and make it easier to search for videos based on their text. The feature uses speech recognition to create captions for any video that has been uploaded to the platform. DemoCreator customers can then go in afterward to edit and customize those initial captions to make sure everything is accurate before sharing a final video.</p>



<p>The face detection tool, meanwhile, is capable of identification, though it seems to be designed primarily to speed up the editing process. The tool can literally recognize faces, which is to say that it can distinguish a face from a background and any other objects that add clutter to the screen. It can then separate the face in the video from that background, so editors can replace that background with something more desirable.</p>



<p>On that front, DemoCreator 5.4 comes with a collection of new backgrounds to place behind the talking heads. The release also introduces new video effects (such as stickers, borders, and caption effects), and allows users to convert a PowerPoint file into various video file formats.</p>



<p>“We are excited to unveil DemoCreator with several added utility tools and features that will help educators, freelancers, gamers, students, and other professionals in seamless idea&nbsp;sharing,” said&nbsp;DemoCreator Product Director Patrick Yu.</p>



<p>Of course, DemoCreator is not the only tool that can isolate faces in a video feed. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/realnetworks-releases-biometric-video-products-identify-celebrities-060302/">RealNetworks</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/amazon-updates-rekognition-to-tag-faces-of-celebrities-708303/">Amazon</a> have booth released tools that can identify and sort the faces of celebrities. D-ID, on the other hand, uses face identification technology to ensure privacy with an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-d-id-solution-removes-identifying-features-peoples-faces-082102/">algorithm that strips identifying features</a> from photos and video footage.</p>

<p>Governance Orchestrators</p>
<p>The orchestration required to bring together decentralized identity ecosystems is today’s biggest gap for Commercial SSI. By this I mean the Trust over IP Level 4 governance authorities that are required to make something commercially real.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A youth league soccer referee governs the various elements within a rulebook.</p>
<p>We have the approaches, the principles, the technologies and the standards down. There is also clear market demand for data ownership and privacy-preserving digital interactions. We’ve have also seen great enhancements on mobile devices for authentication methods such as biometrics and continuous authentication.</p>
<p>So the question is: how we make decentralized identity more of a reality in our day-to-day lives?</p>
<p>How can we create a place in which a bank, a gig economy company or a start-up can all simply plug-in and begin using verifiable credentials? </p>
<p>There is a glaring need for Commercial SSI Governance Authorities.</p>
<p>As we know, half of the battle in decentralized identity, especially in government regulated industries, is governance. We require governance entities to help in the formation of ecosystems, the setting of rules, the making of markets, the monetization strategies, the dispute strategies, etc. </p>
<p>More entities are required to manage the bits of a trust framework that are commercial decisions.&nbsp;</p>

On-Chain Activity   122 total dApps on MainNet as of December 20th,&nbsp;2021.  6,838,307 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 3,014 from last&nbsp;week.  16,853,206 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 25,525 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1471563278023217152?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, led by Ontology Harbinger Polaris. He focused on “what is trust?”. Since there is no authority to guarantee trust in Web3, we need to re-define it. We believe that a “Trustless” decentralized network should be able to protect the privacy of users through DID, and achieve anonymous and secure interactions by integrating the reputation system on the&nbsp;chain.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/DeIDSummit/status/1469454043437223940?s=20">DeID Summit</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He invited bloXmove CEO Sophia Roediger and CTO Harry Behrens to discuss the application of DID technology in the field of mobile travel. The fragmentation of the urban transport industry means there is a great need to fortify user security and data through decentralized technologies. By integrating Ontology’s DID and data solutions, the whole ecosystem of bloXmove will be made more private, more secure, and will be easier to navigate.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1470679965591121925?s=20">Telegram weekly Community Call</a>, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about Ontology’s 4th anniversary NFT event, the development of the Internet, the development goals of Web3, and the role of Ontology in the construction of Web3. Community members expressed their opinions enthusiastically.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.

Yet, the current systems for authenticating users and establishing trust online are inconvenient for users and onerous for business. More importantly, the current approach forces users to surrender their privacy, while the security and trust of online transactions barely clear the bar of “good&nbsp;enough.”</p><p>In the face of the advent of decentralized networks, redefining trust and reshaping the network system is a top priority. The decentralized identity solution launched by Ontology is a key part of this: Users can use DID for one-click login. Secret key authorization meets the needs of privacy protection, and simplifies the process of login authentication and authorization. The reputation system protects user information while giving users trust in anonymity.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>Attarius Network and BOTLabs GmbH, initial developer of KILT Protocol, today announced that Attarius will incorporate principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI), by adopting DIDs and Verifiable Credentials using KILT Protocol. KILT will be integrated into the Attarius Network ecosystem products including the Attarius wallet which has already launched, and the NFT marketplace for in-game items that is launching soon.</p><p>Attarius Network is building an all-in-one NFT ecosystem for the gaming industry, with a core focus on developing blockchain gaming in the Middle East and Asia. Attarius Network and KILT are Substrate-based blockchains; KILT is an identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous, verifiable credentials.</p><p>When gamers are onboarded to the Attarius platform, they will be able to add their purchases, achievements and levels as credentials to their KILT identity. The user will then determine how and when to share these credentials, while keeping this data in their possession. As Attarius and KILT add new partners, users can verify and download their assets and skills acquired in these partner games and tournaments. KILT will also be used for tracking user performance across multiple game platforms and networks.</p><p>Users and players on the Attarius Network chain will be able to quickly form gaming guilds and DAOs that match each other in terms of level and skills, using KILT credentials to verify these parameters. This will dramatically accelerate the creation of guilds and DAOs focused on individual games and championships, or with a regional focus in the UAE, Vietnam, Singapore or Northern&nbsp;Europe.</p><p>Fundraising for gaming guilds and indie studios could also be accelerated by incorporating KILT credentials into the Attarius wallet and marketplace. Currently the wallet is designed to hold Attarius Network (ATRN) tokens, game tokens and NFTs of in-game items. In the future, the wallet will offer a decentralized onboarding process utilizing KILT and KYC providers, where users would share only the necessary elements of their identity, without creating centralized data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Quote from Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH:</p><p>“Attarius Network offers multiple use cases for KILT Protocol. Gaming communities and NFT marketplaces are at an inflection point that will be accelerated by blockchain applications. We’re excited to be part of this experimentation and innovation.”</p><p>Quote from Oleg Kotlyarov, CEO and Founder of Attarius&nbsp;Network:</p><p>“Attaruis Network is very pleased to work with BOTLabs GmbH because they make a great product in the SSI field in our opinion. We really want the onboarding of our users to be the fastest and easiest procedure for them, so that in an instant they can immediately start the game or upload assets to our marketplace or find like-minded people and create a game guild. We see an avalanche-like growth of interest and growth of players in blockchain games, and believe that our cooperation with BOTLabs and the use of KILT Protocol will help us accelerate this&nbsp;growth.”</p> About BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH <p>BOTLabs GmbH is a Berlin-based research and development company focusing on blockchain. It was founded in January 2018 by Ingo Rübe and German publishing house Burda GmbH, for whom he served as CTO from 2012 to 2017; Swiss publisher Ringier AG later joined as a shareholder. BOTLabs is the initial developer of KILT Protocol, now a decentralized blockchain network. The SocialKYC identity verification service, Sporran wallet and Stakeboard platform were developed by a subsidiary of BOTLabs called B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH. BOTLabs is a founding member of the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) and a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and Blockchain for&nbsp;Europe.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s open-source Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy.

  <p>GraphQL’s popularity has grown among frontend and backend developers alike. It allows frontend teams to request only the data they need while preventing an explosion of backend endpoints, since all operations can go through one simple endpoint for all models being worked on.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a GraphQL API with Laravel, a free open-source PHP web application framework. You’ll then secure the API so that it’s only accessible to authorized users logging in with Okta.</p>

 Building the project 

<p>The recommended way to create a new Laravel project is to use Laravel Sail, a command-line interface designed for Laravel’s Docker environment. First, create a directory to hold both sets of code for this project—one set for the backend and one for the frontend. Make sure you have the latest versions of Docker and Docker Compose set up as well. If you need help, check <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/">Docker’s guide</a> as well as the documentation for <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</a>.</p>

<p>To bootstrap the Laravel project for this tutorial, you can get a script from <code>laravel.build</code>. It isn’t advisable to pipe scripts from the internet into Bash, so check the script first. If you navigate to <a href="https://laravel.build/graphql-demo?with=mysql">this demo code</a>, you will see the generated script. You can change “graphql-demo” to whatever you want to name the project. If it looks okay to you, paste it into your terminal or pipe it directly to Bash using <code>curl -s "https://laravel.build/graphql-demo?with=mysql" | bash</code>.</p>

<p>This will create a new directory, named whatever you used as the path parameter (graphql-demo, in this case), and will set up Laravel for you. Once the script is done downloading Docker Image for Sail, it will prompt you to run <code>cd graphql-demo &amp;&amp; ./vendor/bin/sail up</code>. Since you’ll be calling Sail repeatedly, make an alias for it. You can use <code>alias sail=./vendor/bin/sail</code>.</p>

<p>After running the <code>up</code> command, you’ll find Laravel running at <code>http://localhost</code>.</p>

 Laravel models 

<p>Next set up your Laravel models and migrations. For more interesting data to work with, create some interconnected models. This is similar to building an issue-tracking system. The system will have the following models:</p>

 
   user 
   issue 
   comment 
 

<p>If you’d like to copy the files from the public GitHub repository, the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-graphql-laravel-backend-example/tree/main/app/Models">models can be found here</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-graphql-laravel-backend-example/tree/main/database/migrations">migrations can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d prefer to make these models yourself, execute a command with Laravel’s Artisan CLI            tool. Because you’re using Sail, execute with <code>sail php artisan &lt;command&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Then run the following:</p>

   <code>sail php artisan make:model -m Issue
sail php artisan make:model -m Comment
</code>   

<p>The user model and migration already exist by default.</p>

 Laravel migrations 

<p>The above commands also created the necessary migrations thanks to the <code>-m</code> flag. Update them by following the steps outlined here.</p>

<p>User:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
// database/migrations/2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php

   public function up()
   {
       Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
           $table-&gt;id();
           $table-&gt;string('name');
           $table-&gt;string('email')-&gt;unique();
           $table-&gt;timestamp('email_verified_at')-&gt;nullable();
           $table-&gt;string('password');
           $table-&gt;rememberToken();
           $table-&gt;timestamps();
       });
   }

   public function down()
   {
       Schema::dropIfExists('users');
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Issue:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

class CreateIssuesTable extends Migration
{

   public function up()
   {
       Schema::create('issues', function (Blueprint $table) {
           $table-&gt;id('id');
           $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger('author_id');
           $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger('assignee_id');
           $table-&gt;string('title');
           $table-&gt;text('description');
           $table-&gt;timestamps();
       });
   }

   /**

    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function down()
   {
       Schema::dropIfExists('issues');
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Comment:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
// database/migrations/2021_11_14_030557_create_comments_table.php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

class CreateCommentsTable extends Migration
{
   /**

   public function up()
   {
       Schema::create('comments', function (Blueprint $table) {
           $table-&gt;id('id');
           $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger('issue_id');

           $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger('author_id');

   public function down()
   {
       Schema::dropIfExists('comments');
   }
}
</code>   

 Relationships 

<p>Next define some relationships on the models to tie everything together. Your models should look like the ones here.</p>

<p>User:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

 Factories and seeders 

<p>Add seeders and factories so you have some data to work with. This allows you to generate as many instances of your models as you like, as well as the pre-populated relationships you just defined. Run the following:</p>

   <code>sail php artisan make:seeder SimpleSeeder
sail php artisan make:factory IssueFactory
sail php artisan make:factory CommentFactory
</code>   

<p>Each of these classes will need tweaking to ensure they are generating the correct data. Modify them as shown below:</p>

<p><code>database/factories/IssueFactory.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace Database\Factories;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\Factory;

class IssueFactory extends Factory
{
   /**
    * Define the model's default state.
    *
    * @return array
    */
   public function definition()
   {
       return [
           'title' =&gt; $this-&gt;faker-&gt;sentence,
           'description' =&gt; $this-&gt;faker-&gt;sentence,
       ];
   }
}
</code>   

<p><code>database/factories/CommentFactory.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace Database\Factories;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\Factory;

class CommentFactory extends Factory
{
   /**
    * Define the model's default state.
    *
    * @return array
    */
   public function definition()
   {
       return [
           'content' =&gt; $this-&gt;faker-&gt;sentence
       ];
   }
}
</code>   

<p><code>database/seeders/SimpleSeeder.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use App\Models\Comment;
use App\Models\Issue;
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;

class SimpleSeeder extends Seeder
{
   /**
    * Run the database seeds.
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function run()
   {
       User::factory()
           -&gt;has(
               Issue::factory()
                   -&gt;for(User::factory(), 'assignee')
                   -&gt;has(
                       Comment::factory()
                           -&gt;for(User::factory(), 'author')
                           -&gt;count(3)
                   )
                   -&gt;count(5)
           )
           -&gt;count(10)
           -&gt;create();
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Once you have updated those classes, update <code>DatabaseSeeder.php</code> to call the new <code>SimpleSeeder</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
// database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
   /**
    * Seed the application's database.
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function run()
   {
       $this-&gt;call(SimpleSeeder::class);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>To make sure that everything is working as expected, run the migrations and seeders you just created. This will populate your database with records that can be used by the GraphQL API. Execute the following command:</p>

   <code>sail php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
</code>   

<p>Next you’ll install the GraphQL server.</p>

 Installing Lighthouse 

<p>There are a few different packages for GraphQL with Laravel. This tutorial will focus on <a href="https://lighthouse-php.com/">Lighthouse</a> since it has minimal boilerplate and allows you to get going quickly with GraphQL. As with the <code>php artisan</code> commands above, add the <code>sail</code> prefix if you want to install composer dependencies with Sail.</p>

<p>Install the GraphQL dependencies:</p>

   <code>sail composer require nuwave/lighthouse mll-lab/laravel-graphql-playground
</code>   

<p>Lighthouse will create the server for you, while the Playground allows you to test your schema without an external tool.</p>

<p>Once both dependencies are installed, run the following commands to publish the schema and config file from Lighthouse:</p>

   <code>sail php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lighthouse-schema
sail php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lighthouse-config
</code>   

<p>Add the GraphQL API route to the CORS config file. Navigate to <code>config/cors.php</code> and update the <code>paths</code> array to include <code>'graphql'</code>, like this:</p>

   <code>'paths' =&gt; ['api/*', 'sanctum/csrf-cookie', 'graphql'],
</code>   

<p>Finally, update the Lighthouse schema at <code>graphql/schema.graphql</code>. Change the contents to the following:</p>

   <code>type Query {
   users: [User!]! @all
   user(id: Int! @eq): User @find

   issues: [Issue!]! @all
   issue(id: Int! @eq): Issue @find
}

type User {
   id: ID!
   name: String!
   issues: [Issue!]! @hasMany
}

type Issue {
   id: ID!
   title: String!
   description: String!
   author: User! @belongsTo
   assignee: User! @belongsTo
   comments: [Comment!]! @hasMany
}

type Comment {
   id: ID!
   content: String!
   issue: Issue! @belongsTo
   author: User! @belongsTo
}
</code>   

<p>This file describes which types are accessible via GraphQL and which attributes they expose, as well as the relationships they can follow.</p>

 Demoing without auth 

<p>Navigate to the playground site at <code>http://localhost/graphql-playground</code>. The interface will allow you to try out GraphQL with the backend you just made. Enter the following query on the left and click the Play button:</p>

   <code>query GetIssues {
  issues {
    id
    title
    description
    author {
      name
    }
    assignee {
      name
    }
    comments {
      id
      content
      author {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>You should see your seeded data on the right, in the shape you specified in your query.</p>

<p>Next you’ll add authentication to your GraphQL API and allow users to log in via Okta.</p>

 Adding authentication 

<p>To add auth to your API, you’ll need to do some configuration. Go to <a href="https://developer.okta.com">the Okta Developer Portal</a> and sign up for a developer account so you can create an application for your frontend. To do this, navigate to Applications &gt; Application in the sidebar and select Create App Integration. Select OIDC as your sign-in method and set your application type as “Single-Page Application.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the next page, give your app integration a name like “Laravel GraphQL Demo,” keep the grant type as “Authorization Code,” and change the sign-in redirect and sign-out redirect URIs to port 3000 instead of 8080. For “Controlled Access,” select allow everyone in my organization to access since access levels aren’t important for this tutorial.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll be given your client ID—make sure to note it. You’ll be able to see your Okta domain, which you should note as well. Before you leave the Okta site, navigate to Security &gt; API to see your issuer URI. Note this and go to the Trusted Origins tab. Click Add Origin, set the origin URL as <code>http://localhost:3000</code>, select the CORS and Redirect checkboxes, and click Save. This will avoid problems with the frontend.</p>

<p></p>

 Installing packages 

<p>Go back to your terminal and run <code>sail composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt</code>. This will install the packages needed to verify the Okta access tokens. Then run <code>sail php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwt</code> to create a new class for your middleware. Open it and set its contents as follows:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;

class VerifyJwt
{
   /**
    * Handle an incoming request.
    *
    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
    * @param  \Closure  $next
    * @return mixed
    */
   public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
   {
       $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
           -&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
           -&gt;setAudience('api://default')
           -&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
           -&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
           -&gt;build();

       try {
           $jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());
           return $next($request);
       } catch (\Exception $exception) {
           Log::error($exception);
       }

       return response('Unauthorized', 401);

   }
}
</code>   

<p>Once this is attached to Lighthouse’s middleware config, it will allow you to protect your GraphQL API from requests that don’t have valid tokens. The client ID and issuer are coming from environment variables, which need to be set in your .env file. Open that file and append the following:</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID=&lt;the client ID you noted earlier&gt;
OKTA_ISSUER_URI=&lt; the issuer URI you noted earlier&gt;
</code>   

<p>Open <code>config/lighthouse.php</code> and update the ‘middleware’ array to add the middleware to Lighthouse:</p>

   <code>...
'middleware' =&gt; [
   // Verify BearerToken from Okta
   \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyJwt::class,

   \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Support\Http\Middleware\AcceptJson::class,

   // Logs in a user if they are authenticated. In contrast to Laravel's 'auth'
   // middleware, this delegates auth and permission checks to the field level.
   \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Support\Http\Middleware\AttemptAuthentication::class,

   // Logs every incoming GraphQL query.
   // \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Support\Http\Middleware\LogGraphQLQueries::class,
],
...
</code>   

<p>You could instead add the JWT verification to the API route guard, but the above method is fine for this tutorial. The <code>graphql-playground</code> shouldn’t be able to reach your API because it doesn’t have a token. To get a token, you’ll configure a simple frontend application to log you into Okta, then use that token to call your API.</p>

<p>If you just want to make sure your API is working, you can clone the frontend from the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-graphql-laravel-frontend-example">public GitHub repo</a>. You’ll need to insert your client ID and issuer URL in the <code>App.js</code> file, but it should work out-of-the-box. To build the frontend, read on.</p>

 Building the frontend 

<p>Since this is for testing purposes, you’ll build a simple frontend with React, the official Okta React library, and Apollo Client.</p>

<p>If you don’t have Node.js and npm, you can get up and running with <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">nvm - node version manager</a>.</p>

<p>From the parent directory (that contains your Laravel project directory), run <code>npx create-react-app graphql-demo-frontend</code>.</p>

<p>This will create a minimal React application for you to build your frontend. To install dependencies, run <code>npm install @apollo/client graphql @okta/okta-react @okta/okta-auth-js react-router-dom@^5.1.6</code>.</p>

<p>The React app will have files in the <code>src/</code> directory, but most of them aren’t needed. Delete them all and create the following files instead.</p>

 index.js 

<p>The <code>index.js</code> file mounts your React application onto its root DOM node, but it also handles the creation of Apollo Client, and fetches the Okta JWT from local storage.</p>

<p>Note: Using local storage is fine for this tutorial, but don’t take this approach in production, because changes to the underlying libraries and how they store the token might break it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider, from, createHttpLink } from '@apollo/client';
import { setContext } from '@apollo/client/link/context';

const oktaTokenStorage = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('okta-token-storage'));
const accessToken = oktaTokenStorage?.accessToken?.accessToken;

const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: 'http://localhost/graphql',
});

// inject the access token into the Apollo Client
const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) =&gt; {
  const token = accessToken;
  return {
        headers: {
          ...headers,
          authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : "",
        }
  }
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: from([authLink, httpLink])
});

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
        &lt;ApolloProvider client={client}&gt;
          &lt;App /&gt;
        &lt;/ApolloProvider&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
</code>   

 App.js 

<p>This file houses the main body of the application and sets up the Okta client. Use your issuer URI and client ID here:</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { SecureRoute, Security, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import IssueTracker from './IssueTracker';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: &lt;your issuer URI&gt;, // issuer URL
  clientId: &lt;your client ID&gt;, // client id for SPA app
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
});

const App = () =&gt; {
  const history = useHistory();
  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
      history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
  };

  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home} /&gt;
      &lt;SecureRoute path='/issue-tracker' component={IssueTracker} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/login/callback' component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
};

const AppWithRouterAccess = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Router&gt;
        &lt;App /&gt;
  &lt;/Router&gt;
);

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

 Home.js 

<p>This component acts like a dashboard, prompting the user to log in via Okta if they’re not authenticated, and giving them the link to the issue tracker if they are:</p>

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

const Home = () =&gt; {
    const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

    const login = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
    const logout = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signOut('/');

    if (!authState) {
        return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
    }

    if (!authState.isAuthenticated) {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Not Logged in yet&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;button onClick={login}&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }

    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Logged in!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;a href="/issue-tracker"&gt;go to Issue Tracker&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;button onClick={logout}&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
};

export default Home;
</code>   

 IssueTracker.js 

<p>This component uses the query you tried earlier in the graphql-playground to fetch data in its desired shape. Because the access token is injected into Apollo Client, the frontend is able to query the backend despite the middleware you put in place. When the data returns, the component renders it as a list.</p>

   <code>import * as React from 'react';

import { useQuery, gql } from "@apollo/client";

const ISSUES = gql`
query GetIssues {
  issues {
    id,
    title,
    description,
    author {
      name
    },
    assignee {
      name
    },
    comments {
      id,
      content,
      author {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
`

export default function IssueTracker() {

    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(ISSUES);
    
    console.log({ loading, error, data })
    
    if (loading) {
        return &lt;div&gt;loading...&lt;/div&gt;
    }
    
    if (error) {
        return &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;error.message&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    }
    
    return &lt;ul&gt;
        {data.issues.map((issue) =&gt; {
            return &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;title: {issue.title}&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;description: {issue.description}&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;author: {issue.author.name}&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;assignee: {issue.assignee.name}&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        })}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
};
</code>   

 Running the frontend 

<p>With these components in place, run <code>npm run start</code> and the frontend will launch at <code>localhost:3000</code>. Navigate there, and when you click Log In you’ll see the Okta login screen. Log in using your Okta Developer account credentials and you’ll be redirected to the Home component. You should see a link to take you to the “issue tracker.” Clicking this link will show you the page populated by data from your GraphQL API.</p>

 Go deeper with Okta 

<p>You should now have a Laravel GraphQL API secured by Okta which, as you’ve seen, is easy to integrate with your projects and can provide secure, extensible authentication to your applications with minimal configuration.</p>

<p>Laravel, React, and GraphQL are not all that Okta can offer you, however. Check out the huge list of <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/">supported integrations</a>, and you’ll be sure to find something that suits your needs.</p>

<p>Facial recognition and computer vision “will occupy a central and primary place as a biometric security solution” going forward, according to SoftBank advisory (and former head of Mossad) Yossi Cohen.</p>



<p>Cohen was speaking at a recent conference of security consultants organized by Oosto, the Israel-based computer vision specialist. In so doing, he highlighted the prospects of “Vision AI” technology, and praised the offerings of Oosto in particular as being “very sophisticated software”.</p>



<p>That bullish stance is no surprise in the wake of SoftBank’s investment in Oosto earlier this year. The VC investor’s SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led a financing round in collaboration with Eldridge that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/anyvision-raises-235m-in-softbank-led-funding-round-707071/">raised $235 million</a> this past summer, and Oosto went on to use that funding to fuel <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-strengthens-mask-detection-surveillance-capabilities-vision-ai-platform-110401/">further enhancements to its Vision AI platform</a>.</p>



<p>Going forward, Cohen wants SoftBank to continue to play an important role in helping to drive Oosto’s success.</p>



<p>“I intend to expand and accelerate the day-to-day collaboration between Softbank and Oosto,” Cohen asserted, adding that SoftBank has “a portfolio of over 300 leading companies in their field that are in constant contact with governments and huge corporations,” and that these companies can act as “ambassadors” to promote Oosto’s solutions to their partners.</p>



<p>For Oosto’s part, CEO Avi Golan said he “had the privilege of serving as an operating-partner at SoftBank and getting to know firsthand the exciting vision of SoftBank founder Masa San, regarding the AI revolution we are in the midst of.”</p>



<p>The company’s executives will shed further light on Oosto’s role in this AI revolution in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/live-webinar-10-reasons-to-switch-to-touchless-access-control-712169/">their next webinar</a>, which will present “10 Reasons to Switch to Frictionless Access Control.” Slated for January 13, 2022, at 11AM Eastern Time, the webinar is now open for registration, free of charge.</p>

 GiD Report#191 — What is the metaverse? <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-the-age-of-daos-ffcb708c5f9">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The metaverse is already&nbsp;here  What people are&nbsp;saying  Tweet of the&nbsp;week  The 6 web3 use cases people care about the most (small&nbsp;survey)  Stuff happens   1. The metaverse is already&nbsp;here <p>There’s a lot of buzzwords these days. Blockchain, NFT, DeFi, web3. But the metaverse, thanks to Facebook, is not only the buzziest but also the fuzziest of them&nbsp;all.</p>Image: Mojang<p>In a lot of ways, the metaverse has existed for some time. Games like Second Life, Eve Online, and World of Warcraft have been around for decades. More recently, kids (and adults) have been spending more and more time in the worlds of Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite.</p><p>Premier eSports title Counter-Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) is fully funded through in-game transaction fees from the trading of in-game items on the Steam marketplace, netting game developer Valve billions of dollars each year. (You can <a href="https://media.steampowered.com/apps/valve/2014/gdc_2014_grimes_csgo_econ_content.pdf">check out Valve’s original slide deck for how they came up with in-game skins&nbsp;here</a>.)</p><p>You could say that all of that is already the metaverse. People living, playing, and working (yes, working) in a fully digital world with rich communities, cultural norms, and its own built-in economics.</p><p>The one thing you could argue is that all of this up to now has been built under the guise of&nbsp;web2.</p><p>For instance, the only difference from those CSGO skins versus what we know as NFTs today are the fact that they’re centrally managed (by Valve through Steam) rather than through a decentralized blockchain.</p><p>What happens then with the arrival of web3? What happens when items and inventories are interoperable? What happens when we have self-sovereign identity? What happens when characters can seamlessly move from one world to&nbsp;another?</p><p>What happens when that NFT you bought as a collectible is now a character or item you can use in a&nbsp;game?</p><p>What happens when the metaverse is more than just a&nbsp;game?</p><p>I’m not sure we have a clear sense as to what those answers are just yet. But what has gotten people excited is that they’re starting to see the building blocks — NFTs, DeFi, identity — and the possibilities for building a more open and interconnected digital universe.</p><p>We’ve seen the rise of Axie Infinity. (Here’s a fascinating tweetstorm on <a href="https://twitter.com/larsiusprime/status/1459191090100244483?s=21">how the in-game economics are working out</a>.) We’re seeing <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/metaverse-real-estate-piles-up-record-sales-in-sandbox-and-other-virtual-realms-11638268380">record land sales in metaverse games</a> such as The Sandbox and Dcentraland — just as big numbers were thrown around during the early dotcom domain land grab days. Michael Jordan will <a href="https://decrypt.co/88393/michael-jordan-jumps-into-web3-solana-app-athletes-nfts-tokens">probably sell you digital basketball sneakers</a> tied to the Solana blockchain.</p><p>Facebook has gotten plenty of flack for their Meta rebrand. But Mark Zuckerberg deserves credit for actually making a big, bold bet — whether or not it pans out, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse">committing $10 billion to the metaverse and&nbsp;web3</a>.</p><p>There are early, early days. There’s going to be a lot of hype and noise. There will be a lot of losers and a couple big winners. And where we end up probably won’t be what we necessarily expected.</p><p>Anyway, here’s Wired on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-the-metaverse/">what the metaverse actually&nbsp;is</a>:</p><blockquote>Mentally replace the phrase “the metaverse” in a sentence with “cyberspace.” Ninety percent of the time, the meaning won’t substantially change.</blockquote><p>Like I said, very&nbsp;fuzzy.</p> 2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Axios:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: Nike <a href="https://news.nike.com/news/nike-acquires-rtfkt">just</a> acquired RTFKT, a developer of digital goods, including virtual sneakers and NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Meanwhile, <a href="https://metaversemeals.io/">Applebee’s</a> is launching a new NFT every Monday this month, following White Castle’s <a href="https://decrypt.co/87991/white-castle-goes-crypto-scoops-ethereum-name-seahams-nft">move</a> into&nbsp;crypto.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>What they’re saying: Companies are speeding to the finish line because “there’s the first-mover advantage for the buzz&nbsp;… signaling to a very valuable audience that you’re a brand that gets it,” says Robert Davis, head of innovation at&nbsp;Ogilvy.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>What to watch: Adoption is still low. Less than 20% of the U.S. population will have used virtual reality at least once per month this year, according to eMarketer.</blockquote><p>Goldman Sachs <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/17/goldman-sachs-says-blockchain-is-key-to-metaverse-and-web-3-development/">via Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>Blockchain technology is central to the development of the metaverse and Web 3, Goldman Sachs said in a research&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>It is the only technology that can “uniquely identify any virtual object independent of a central authority,” and this ability to identify and track ownership will be crucial to the functioning of the metaverse, analysts led by Rod Hall wrote in a note published on Dec.&nbsp;14.</blockquote><blockquote>For Web 3, blockchain allows for the “partial elimination of centralized control,” the note says.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_xG2un5WaI">Trust Registries Webinar</a> (Sept. 2021) 
 Darrell and Drummond discussed what we got wrong (and right) in The Wallet Report, some key points:
 
 Single use wallet apps took off because they solve a single business problem. While Darrell notes that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGdQWuZC-oY&amp;feature=youtu.be">DIDComm</a> is slow to take off, Drummond doubles down and says they’ll be the killer of what we now know as SSI and that next year they’ll be doing the DIDComm update! 
 Darrell’s forecast for Cloud/Custodial Wallets was wrong, he notes that the demand is there but security remains a problem and SSI principles are compromised, but solutions are beginning to form. They discuss portability and how it remains a current problem. 
 We discussed how Standards and Interoperability are still in the very early stages and remain elusive. He also touches on stacks and how governments and industry around the world are starting to pick this technology. Check out Ian Bremmer’s Article: <a href="https://www.ge.com/news/reports/ian-bremmer-3-risks-poised-to-disrupt-a-fast-changing-world-by-2021">3 Risks Poised to Disrupt a Fast-Changing World by 2021</a> 
 Darrell touches on the Trust Registries section of the Wallet Report and its public and private version. He talks about how the trust triangle isn’t enough. How does the verifier know that the issuer is authoritative? Is the Public DID anchored to a real institution? Does the holder trust the verifier? 
 
 
 
 QUESTIONS!? 
<p>Our Question Period started at about <a href="https://youtu.be/fMstQmIwsbM?t=3022">50:23</a> – though some questions did come in earlier and were touched on through the presentation. We had so many questions an couldn’t answer them all, here is a run down of what we covered:</p>
 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/fMstQmIwsbM?t=3030">How do you allow for an appointed governance authority to manage things? </a> 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/fMstQmIwsbM?t=3129">How can one attest the cryptographic health of a remote wallet? </a> 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/fMstQmIwsbM?t=3439">How do you reconcile centralized governance authority in a decentralized world? </a>

<p>On November 10, 2021, KILT became a decentralized blockchain network. This means that decisions on running the network are now made by you, the community of KILT Coin holders, using a sophisticated system of governance similar to that of Kusama and Polkadot. Here we give an introduction to how it&nbsp;works.</p> Overview <p>In brief, governance on KILT involves everyone who owns KILT Coins, a Council, and a Technical Committee. The Council is elected from members of the community (KILT Coin holders). Council tasks include proposing referenda, vetoing dangerous and malicious referenda, voting on Treasury proposals, and electing the Technical Committee. The Technical Committee exists to fast-track any critical upgrades needed, and consists of developers with experience developing and maintaining KILT Protocol.</p><p>Any KILT Coin holder can submit a proposal, which then goes through a formal, transparent online procedure that usually ends in a referendum that goes to community vote. You can also vote on existing proposals and referenda. Of note, coins that are locked for staking can also be used to&nbsp;vote.</p><p>As in Kusama and Polkadot, when a referendum on KILT is successful, the upgrade will be automatically enacted by the blockchain, following the enactment period of one day on&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>Thanks to the design of the Polkadot ecosystem, upgrades do not require a “fork” in the blockchain, as often found in older blockchain networks like Bitcoin. KILT upgrades can simply be carried out by changing the code on-chain, also known as a runtime&nbsp;upgrade.</p> Treasury <p>KILT has a Treasury, a store of on-chain funds that can be used for supporting and maintaining the network. As outlined in the updated<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19_KILT_Token_Metrics_Revised_Version.pdf"> KILT Coin Metrics</a> document, this Treasury will receive around two million newly-minted KILT Coins per year for the first five years. After this time, it will always receive an amount equivalent to around 10% of the maximum collator rewards as newly-minted coins. Bonded funds from rejected proposals and referenda also go to the Treasury.</p><p>In addition to providing potential funding for a parachain if governance decides to move to Polkadot in the future, Treasury funds are available for infrastructure or initiatives that benefit the network. Anyone can make a proposal for Treasury&nbsp;funding.</p><p>Information on Treasury proposals on KILT can be found on the <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/post/1">Polkassembly</a> platform and proposals can be viewed on Polkadot-JS under the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.kilt.io%2F#/treasury">Governance →Treasury tab</a>.</p> Proposals <p>Proposals can be simple proposals, such as the transfer of funds in the case of a Treasury grant, or more complex proposals such as a complete upgrade of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Treasury proposals for grants on KILT are approved or disapproved by the Council with a super majority (60% of&nbsp;votes).</p><p>Proposals from the community of KILT Coin holders will generally be made after discussion with others. This can be done via community channels such as the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kilt-direction:matrix.org">KILT Direction</a> channel on Element, or on Telegram and Discord. In this way, the proposer can get feedback and see if their idea is something that would be supported. Although any KILT Coin holder can make a proposal, there are several systems in place to deter anyone from making a malicious proposal and then leaving the&nbsp;network.</p><p>When submitting the proposal, the proposer must bond a minimum of 1 KILT for a general proposal, and 5% of the amount requested for a Treasury proposal.</p><p>Once the proposal is made it needs to be seconded by others in the community. This involves bonding KILT Coins: the amount is set by the proposer (minimum 1 KILT). One account holder can second the same proposal multiple times, with coins bonded each time. The most seconded proposal automatically becomes the next referendum unless the slot is needed for a motion by the Council. Of note, coins are reserved for the lifetime of the proposal, so if there are multiple proposals, this would lead to an extension of the bonding&nbsp;time.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances if a proposal or referendum is considered uncontroversially malicious or dangerous for the network, it can be cancelled by the Technical Committee or Council. In this case, the proposer and all who seconded the proposal lose their bond, which goes to the KILT Treasury.</p><p>Once a proposal moves to referendum the community has seven days to vote on it. If successful, the result is automatically enacted after one day, and those who seconded the proposal receive their bond back. If the referendum is not accepted, the proposer loses their&nbsp;deposit.</p> Voting in Referenda <p>Like Polkadot and Kusama, KILT has conviction voting. This means if you feel very strongly about a proposal, you can lock up coins for longer periods to increase your voting power up to a maximum factor of 6. The longer you lock your coins, the stronger your vote will be weighted.</p><p>The times range from no lockup to a period of around 224 days, with the lockup time beginning after the voting period ends. Coins used for voting will always be locked until the end of the voting period, no matter what conviction you vote with. Of note: the lock time is based on the standard block time of 12 seconds per block and hence may vary due to differences in the real block&nbsp;time.</p><p>If you choose not to lock any coins, your vote only counts as 10% of the coins that you commit to the voting (vote value), while the maximum lock up of around 224 days means you can make your vote count for 600% of the vote value. You can choose to lock all or some of your coins for any range between 0.1x and 6x, with a lockup time as outlined&nbsp;above.</p><p>As an example, you have a wallet with 1,001 KILT Coins. This could include staked or vested&nbsp;coins.</p><p>Example 1 — minimum</p>  You want to vote but don’t want to lock any&nbsp;coins.  You enter 1,000 into the “vote&nbsp;value”  You choose “0.1 x voting balance, no lockup&nbsp;period”  This gives you a voting power of 100 KILT&nbsp;Coins  Note that all your 1,000 coins are locked for the time of the voting period (7&nbsp;days)  Note that in this example you have 1 KILT left to pay the fees. Currently the transaction fee on KILT is around 0.017&nbsp;KILT.  <p>Example 2 — maximum</p>  You strongly believe in the referendum and want to vote with your full balance and maximum conviction  You also enter 1,000 into the “vote value” and leave one KILT to cover the&nbsp;fees  Choose “6 x voting balance, locked for 32x vote locking period (224.00&nbsp;days)”  This will give you a voting power of 6,000 KILT Coins, if you use your full amount, or 6 times the voting power of the amount you chose. The chosen amount will be locked for a period of around 224 days after the voting period ends (7&nbsp;days).  <p>While coins locked for staking can be simultaneously used for voting, the transaction fee needs to be from a usable, unlocked&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Conviction voting allows users with a small amount of coins to increase their voting power, and deters a token holder from creating and voting on a malicious proposal and then leaving the&nbsp;network.</p><p>If the referendum is successful, your voting coins will remain locked for the time specified (which means that you will be unable to transfer them, but they will still be usable for staking during that time). If unsuccessful, your coins will be unlocked after the referendum has finished.</p><p>KILT also uses an algorithm to adapt the amount of “aye” (yes/agree) votes needed to pass depending on voter turnout: the greater the number of voters, the lower the threshold required to pass. Therefore, when voter turnout is low a supermajority is generally required; with a high turnout a simple majority is sufficient.</p><p>Of note, BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developers of KILT Protocol, currently own around one third of the existing KILT coins as outlined in KILT’s <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19_KILT_Token_Metrics_Revised_Version.pdf">updated tokenomics</a>. To ensure democracy and decentralization, BOTLabs will abstain from voting on all proposals and referenda. The only exception to this would be a critical situation where a malicious proposal threatens the technical security of the network. Due to features built into the governance mechanism, such as the need to lock coins to create a proposal, this is unlikely to happen. The percentage of coins owned by BOTLabs is designed to decrease over time, due to inflation in the&nbsp;network.</p> Active Engagement <p>Before voting on any proposal or referendum, you are advised to read more about it and join the discussion in <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/post/1">Polkassembly</a> (under the “On-chain” section). Polkassembly is an open source platform for providing information, context, and a discussion forum for proposals and referenda in the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Tech savvy KILT community members may check the changes to the runtime that are being voted on. This can be done by going to the KILT GitHub page where the open-source code of KILT Spiritnet is hosted, and <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/mashnet-node/compare/1.1.1...1.2.0">comparing the changes</a> in the raw code. Afterwards, you could potentially <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/srtool">build the WASM runtime yourself from the source code using the SR-Tool</a> that prints out the hash of the WASM blob. If this is the same as the codeHash on Polkassembly and the corresponding extrinsic on the KILT blockchain, you could verify that the authorized changes are in line with the description of the referendum. The following screenshots show the codeHash on Polkadot.js and the log of the WASM&nbsp;build.</p> Democracy in&nbsp;Action <p>KILT Protocol has been designed to enhance privacy on the internet for decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Governance is key to KILT, allowing it to run as a decentralized blockchain with the facility to evolve and be self-sustainable.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Mike Small</a></p><p>Over the past few weeks since this vulnerability was made public much has been written by many on what your organization should do about it.&nbsp; This is not the end of the story; Apache has already released 3 patches for related vulnerabilities, and you need to be ready for the next one when it arrives. With the beginning of 2022 now is the time to step back and review how well your organization met the challenges that this posed.&nbsp; What will your new year’s resolutions be? In this blog, I will outline some of the questions that you should ask yourself.&nbsp;</p>
 How well did your cyber incident plan work?&nbsp; 
<p>New vulnerabilities are discovered all the time – you need to be prepared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Were you able to assemble the incident response team in good time?&nbsp; 
 How did you decide on the business risk that this posed?&nbsp; 
 What was the business objective of your response and was it achieved?&nbsp; 
 
 Could you identify systems at risk?&nbsp; 
<p>You can only protect what you know you have: do you have a complete inventory of your IT assets?&nbsp;</p>
 
 How easily were you able to identify the applications, systems and devices that could have this vulnerability?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Did your software vendors inform you of the status of their components and provide recommendations?&nbsp; 
 Did your vulnerability scanning program identify the systems at risk in a timely manner?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 How easily were you able to identify the business criticality of the applications, systems, and devices affected to make an informed decision on the next actions to take?&nbsp; 
 What action did you take for vulnerable components (remove, block, suspend, patch, or ignore), and how well were these actions implemented?&nbsp; 
 Did you involve any partners and if so, how well did they perform?&nbsp; 
 
 How well did your SOC perform?&nbsp; 
<p>Your SOC should be able to detect threats – how well did it perform?&nbsp;</p>
 
 How well did your SOC perform – did you detect any active threats or exploits of this vulnerability?&nbsp; 
 Was your SOC able to monitor for evidence of traffic indicating the existence of the CVE?&nbsp; 
 Did you actively hunt for evidence that this CVE existed and was being exploited?&nbsp; 
 Did your SOC discover any at-risk applications, systems, and devices that were not otherwise known?&nbsp; 
 How well were you able to contain, recover, and restore impacted services?&nbsp; 
 
 Do you need to Review your Policies?&nbsp; 
<p>Most organizations are using third-party components – what are your policies around the risk associated with these?&nbsp; These include the use of Open-Source software, the use of common libraries as well as bespoke software developed just for you.&nbsp;</p>
 Do you need a software dependency catalogue?&nbsp; 
<p>Having a catalogue of software dependencies helps to quickly identify which systems are at risk when a new vulnerability is discovered.&nbsp;</p>
 
 For internally developed software, do you have an up-to-date software dependency catalog that includes a clear record of all software components?&nbsp; 
 For vendor-provided software and services, does the provider:&nbsp; 
 State which external (such as Open-Source) components form part of their product?&nbsp; 
 State the level of support that they provide for these components?&nbsp; What action they will take when vulnerabilities are discovered and within what timescales?&nbsp; 
 Note that these include IaaS, PaaS (such as managed databases) and SaaS?&nbsp; 
 State their liability for damage caused as a result of these components?&nbsp; For example, insurance against cyber damage caused through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in these components.&nbsp; 
  
 
 What level of Software assurance do you have?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>What level of software assurance is right for your business-critical applications? Depending upon the business criticality of the system/application/devices, consider the level of assurance required.&nbsp;</p>
 
 For critical applications require <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/50341.html">ISO/IEC 15408</a> Software Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Other forms of independent certification (such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, ISO, etc.)&nbsp; 
 
 Do you implement Secure Software Development?&nbsp; 
<p>Does your internally developed or commissioned software process identify and remove common vulnerabilities based on at least those catalogued by <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK®</a>, <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">CVE</a>, and <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks</a>?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which of the following best matches your internal software development?&nbsp;</p>
 
 Use Secure Software Lifecycle Development Methodologies&nbsp; 
 Use code scanning tools – including code from Open Source&nbsp; 
 Use dynamic vulnerability scanning – including for externally provided libraries&nbsp; 
 Use external penetration testing&nbsp; 
 Use formal evaluation based on ISO/IEC 15408

 Why ENS does not spell END for DID&nbsp;(1)  Part 1 of our discussion around Decentralized Identification solutions, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) <p>It has been a busy year for Blockchain projects, with plenty of attention being given to&nbsp;ENS.</p><p>Since its release, ENS has become a widely used and integrated blockchain domain name standard. In particular, the campaign to manage the airdrop of tokens has generated widespread discussion in the community. Currently, more than 200,000 users have used ENS and created more than 510,000 domain names. Furthermore, ENS has been integrated into more than 300 applications.</p><p>Broadly speaking, ENS domain names also belong to a kind of decentralized identifier. The identity of the domain name is formed by a collection of attributes, identified by a certain domain name. As a domain name system, ENS conforms to the three characteristics of the Zooko triangle, namely security, decentralization, and human readability. So some people think: as a veteran blockchain project, backed by Ethereum, ENS will become an alternative to decentralized identities (hereinafter collectively referred to as DID) and unify DID‘s application scenarios.</p><p>This article will analyze from the perspective of practical applications whether ENS can really replace&nbsp;DID.</p> What exactly is&nbsp;ENS? <p>ENS, the full English name of Ethereum Name Service, is translated as Ethereum Domain Name Service. It is a decentralized, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>In Web2, the original IP of a website is actually a string of numbers. For example, the IP of Google’s homepage is “142.250.4.100”. But when we open Google, we usually only enter “google.com”. This is because through DNS technology, the computer resolves the “google.com” we input into the network IP address “142.250.4.100”, and then links to Google’s server for us to&nbsp;use.</p><p>ENS is to Web3 what DNS is to Web2. The difference is that in Web3, the domain name resolved by ENS does not map the website IP, but the user’s Ethernet address. For example, Vitalik’s ENS domain name “vitalik.eth” maps to his Ethereum address “0xd8….45”. When you choose “vitalik.eth” for interaction, the underlying logic is that the computer resolves the domain name and links it to the corresponding Ethereum address, and then you can exchange data with this Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p> ENS reverse analysis&nbsp;function <p>Why can we directly use “google.com” instead of “142.250.4.100”? This is because through DNS, the computer associates the domain name “google.com” with this string of IP&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>Similarly in Web3, the website IP becomes the Ethereum address (42 characters). For us, memorizing this long list is unrealistic and anti-human. ENS provides the function of reverse resolution, which is to associate a short and readable domain name with this long sequence.</p><p>When you have an ENS domain name, you only need to tell the other party “My domain name is ‘xxx.eth’”, and the other party can directly search and interact with you to perform on-chain interactions..</p><p>This feature also makes ENS one of the DID solutions in Web3. Once the application integrates ENS, users who already have an ENS domain name can directly use the private key of the Ethereum address to authorize login, without creating an account and password. At the same time, the system will use the ENS name as the account name by&nbsp;default.</p><p>In addition, ENS can also support domain name resolution for other types of resources, including content hashing. Simply put, the domain name can be linked to content stored on distributed storage systems (i.e. IPFS, Swarm, etc.), which can contain the user’s historical data, such as account avatar, NFT,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Based on this, ENS can further realize the function of decentralized accounts, not only providing account login, but also saving user data for application retrieval.</p><p>As mentioned at the beginning, there are already many protocols and applications connected to ENS. Because of the decentralized login method provided by ENS and the overlap of some services with DID, coupled with the backing of Ethereum, the claim that “ENS can replace DID” is&nbsp;made.</p><p>But is this really the&nbsp;case?</p> What is&nbsp;DID? <p>Before comparing ENS and DID, let’s take a brief look at&nbsp;DID.</p><p>According to the W3C DID standard, DID can be used to identify any entity, including people, institutions, organizations, devices, etc., and is decoupled from traditional centralized organizations such as centralized identity registration agencies, identity providers, and certificate authority centers. They allow the user (identifier control/owner) to fully control the decentralized identifier without the permission of a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>At the same time, DID has global uniqueness, high availability, resolvability and password verifiability, and is usually associated with cryptographic technology (such as public and private keys). DID has a wide range of uses, such as establishing a secure communication channel between decentralized data clients and&nbsp;servers.</p><p>The decentralized identity system constructed with decentralized identifiers mainly includes two components: the decentralized identifiers described above, and Verifiable Credentials (VC).</p><p>Take Ontology’s decentralized identity solution as an example. When a user creates a decentralized identity, DID will verify the user’s true identity through a third-party authority and generate a verifiable voucher VC. Users can save the VC in their own decentralized data client, and during future login and verification, the application can be authorized to verify their&nbsp;VC.</p><p>This kind of authorization is not a full verification, only allowing access to the relevant data, other data is not open to the application, and the other party cannot view it. For example, when you rent a car, the car rental platform can view only the driver’s license and historical car rental records that you have authorized to release, and other data cannot be&nbsp;viewed.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>KuppingerCole Analysts pay close attention to all topics at the intersection of identity and security. Decentralized technologies often cross paths with these domains and, since it is a dynamic and potentially disruptive influence on “business as usual”, we have compiled a few predictions about developments in 2022:</p>
 The decentralized identity market segment will continue to grow:  
<p>Decentralized identity solutions are one of the strongest use cases with solutions already on the market. There have been some interesting <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/bailey/avast-to-acquire-evernym-consumer-cybersecurity-meets-decentralized-identity">acquisitions</a>, <a href="https://northernblock.io/bridging-ssi-to-iam-partnership/">partnerships</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/security/business/identity-access-management/verifiable-credentials">investments</a> over the past two years, which promise interesting product releases in the future. Use cases include both consumer and workforce IAM, with a focus on enabling the individual to hold and consent to sharing identity info, while still enabling organizations to manage the access policies for credentials that they did not issue themselves. If you’re curious about this market space, then read <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80064/decentralized-identity-blockchain-id-self-sovereign-identity-solutions">this Market Compass</a>.</p>
 Overlap between identity fraud prevention and decentralized technology will continue to develop:  
<p>An increased interest in identity verification solutions was clear this past year, as integrating identity verification into onboarding and authentication processes can mitigate risks of several different identity fraud attacks. Decentralized technology brings some unique capabilities to identity verification, especially the ability to create a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity">reusable, verifiable identity</a>. As both trends for reusable identities and verified identities grow, these two market segments will become more tightly-woven. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80521/providers-of-verified-identity">This report</a> goes into more depth, but you can expect more research on this in 2022.</p>
 The potential of Life Management Platforms will become more lucrative:  
<p>Personal security is as important as ever, and was sometimes a heavier burden to shoulder over the past two years as people worked from home on personal devices and networks, and enterprises were not always quick to secure these dynamic environments. Privacy and management of personal information is essential from the enterprise perspective as well, and enterprises do have a vested interest in handling information of employees, customers, consumers, and partners with extreme care. Decentralized technologies have always held privacy as a priority, and have had the technological methods to back it up. The market is ripe for interesting vendors to meet these needs, but will take time for the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/bailey/privacy-seekers-are-really-looking-for-life-management-platforms">Life Management Platform</a> market to mature.</p>
 Decentralized finance will have another bumpy year or rapid growth:  
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the natural home of decentralized technology, beginning with Bitcoin and continuing to the current investment for future use cases. Use cases like transacting, proving ownership, and storing digital assets are all made possible in a peer-to-peer setting, managed with decentralized technologies. But governing them to mitigate the unwieldly side effects of anonymous Ransomware demands, unregulated cryptocurrency trading and speculation, and exchanges with insufficient KYC procedures will continue to pose challenges next year. This market already has a high value which will continue to increase at a rapid pace, with concepts such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/bailey/the-future-of-exchanging-value">Central Bank Digital Currencies</a> learning from DeFi projects.</p>
<p>Overall, 2022 will see increasing maturity in some markets like decentralized identity, and volatile growth in others like DeFi. However, decentralized technologies will continue to capture the attention of individuals and collaborative communities, which we hope will lead to more published and agreed upon standards to propell promising use cases forward.</p>

<p>When it comes to security, there seems to be a disconnect in gaming. Where other industries have embraced an all-for-one and one-for-all approach to combating security threats, most gaming and entertainment companies seem largely happy to go it alone.</p>
 
 
<p>This isn’t just conjecture. At Okta, we were curious about how developers and gaming companies approached security, so this past autumn we decided to take advantage of the return of PAX West, Penny Arcade’s iconic gaming conference and game culture exposition.</p>
 
 
 Voices from the lobby track at PAX 
 
 
<p>We went to the show to get a feel for developer attitudes towards protecting not only the development and content of the games, but also their customers' experience and data. We wanted to know how gamers felt about the handling of their information and how they play games. We interviewed developers and gamers, passed out surveys, and live-streamed the entire event in order to get a person-on-the-street perspective.</p>
 
 
<p>What we heard is directly reflected in the opening lines of the report you’re looking at now. Among gamers and developers, there’s no clear consensus on who is responsible for security. Among the developers we spoke to, there’s no clear standard for how to handle security, or even a common bar for the importance of security in development.</p>
 
 
<p>This report is by no means an exhaustive omnibus of the problems the game development world faces, and isn’t meant to be a hands-on guide to fixing the problems we discussed. Instead, it’s an attempt to pull back the curtains and say: "Hey, we all see these issues. We need to think about them, discuss them, collaborate, and work towards solving them."</p>
 
 
<p>So before we jump into the findings, I’d like to thank you, the reader, for taking the time to explore. I believe it’s an important first step to bringing the games community together, and making the work we love and the games we love to play safer for everyone.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Welcome to the wasteland 
 
 
<p>Let’s start by exploring a set of questions aimed at sussing out the answer to one overarching question:</p>
 
 
<p>How confident are you that gaming, from development to gameplay, is secure?</p>
 
 
<p>While answers varied, this single quote from the survey responses sums them up nicely: "It’s a free-for-all wasteland."</p>
 
 
<p>Overwhelmingly, respondents were neutral at best. Almost half of the answers reflect that when it comes to security in developing and interacting with games, confidence isn’t high. An additional 14% said they’re not very confident, and 6% had little-to-no assurance that the systems they use every day are secure. More importantly, every game developer who answered the survey felt neutral or negative about the security of their development process and the end product they create.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>For gamers, part of that lack of confidence may correlate to the responses we received to another question: Who is responsible for gaming security?</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Anecdotally, many of the developers we talked to both on- and off-camera felt that security was the responsibility of the platforms hosting their games or of the players themselves. In contrast, most of the attendees we spoke with felt that security was the responsibility of gaming companies, developers, and regulatory bodies. That split is reflected in the survey results, too, where respondents were able to select who they felt was responsible for security from a list.</p>
 
 
<p>Developers gave three common reasons for the lack of confidence in game security:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>I don’t have access to the tools I need to secure my development and my code.</p>
 
 
<p>I don’t have the budget I need to get those tools.</p>
 
 
<p>There are no standards that I can look to as a baseline to build from.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In reality, we’re all responsible for security, from company executives to gamers themselves (or if they’re young enough, their legal guardians). According to our survey data, and validated by our conversations on the ground, both producers and consumers (players) of games are concerned about a lack of control, an ongoing lack of security, and little consensus on how to address these issues.</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>As a gamer you have to put a lot of trust into the developers and publishers because there is limited control by gamers.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
— Gamer
 
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>I feel like there’s not a whole lot I can control on my end if someone picks a bad password for their account.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
— Game Developer
 
 
 
<p>A key takeaway: It’s a little bleak out there in the gaming ecosystem. No one is happy with the way things are right now. Gamers know there’s only so much they can do on their end to secure their data. They’re frustrated by a lack of common standards for accessing the games they play, and they’re scared of throwing their personal information into a dark well of EULAs that leave them with little to no recourse if something goes wrong. From their perspective as builders, developers too are frustrated by the lack of standards, from authentication and security methodology to common toolsets.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Steps to secure the future of gaming 
 
 
<p>In the end, our findings from PAX West this year suggest that everyone is feeling the pain, and looking to others for the solution. Game developers and players alike would benefit from an open discussion of the security features and standards the industry aims to evaluate and implement. Here at Okta, we care deeply about security and identity. With this report, we’d like to jumpstart a dialogue, and engage all industry participants in a conversation around making gaming better and more secure for everyone.</p>

 Mobility as a Service—Your One-Stop Traveling Shop 



<p>Enter Mobility as a Service (MaaS)—a one-stop shop, which takes every type of transportation into account and provides its users the best optimized route to their destination. A fairly new concept focusing on a “bundled service model”, consumers are in a sense buying into mobility, instead of investing in transport equipment.</p>



<p>But what does this mean exactly for users and operators? Well, for one it means the importance of data. In order to provide what consumers are looking for data must be shared. However, according to a study from Intelligent Transport, 57 per cent of respondents would not mind sharing their personal data in order to get a better transport service.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite this optimistic percentage, security concerns arise from both the consumer and operator and could keep MaaS from growing. Consumers fear the attractiveness this service would be for fraudsters, while also doubting the legitimacy of ID verification platforms. On the other hand, operators worry about the challenge of proper driver’s license verification and preventing minors/fraudsters from using their services.</p>



<p>In a way, the root of the problem is the lack of security on both ends and the possibility of the mishandling of data, which would put the fate of MaaS in jeopardy. But there’s really no need to worry because there is a solution.</p>



 The Missing Link: Security through Identification 



<p>The key to this new service is what connects the various modes of transportation and their service operators in order to support MaaS and provide a smooth multi-leg and multi-modal journey for customers. But what exactly is the key? Simple. Digital identity verification.</p>



<p>With all transportation options listed in one area, having a digital identity is crucial so providers know who is using their services. Plus, providers want to offer the best service to their customers (in hopes that you will use them again) and can do that by way of having the digital identities of its users. But consumers also benefit by seeing the digital identities of the providers and what they can offer them. Basically, it’s a two-way street where both parties can be satisfied.</p>



<p>But why exactly is digital identification necessary? Not only does it provide consumers and companies the benefits of this two-way street, but it offers trust, which is the foundation of any relationship.</p>



<p>Because MaaS is a platform displaying various modes of transport, there are some services that will need to know if a customer possesses a valid driver’s license. Additionally, any leasing contracts for car-sharing also can require a qualified electronic signature or proof of bank account. But no matter what they may require, a one-time, less than 10-minute verification is all that is needed.</p>



<p></p>







 Convenience is the Goal 



<p>Though still a new concept, MaaS will become more popular in the future due to its main function. It provides convenience for all its users. Mobility doesn’t need to be a hassle or stressful and people don’t want it to be. Instead, it should be easy and smooth. MaaS provides exactly that with the assistance from digital identity verification.</p>



<p>Not only is MaaS convenient, but so is proving your identity. IDnow offers solutions such a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> which requires only a quick photo snap of your ID or driver’s license. Even a qualified electronic signature can be added when necessary. With a process that only requires a few minutes, users can do so from on-the-go, wherever they may be. IDnow is the solution for knowing customers’ true identities.<br><br>Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-fueling-demand-convenience-mobility/">ID Verification—Fueling the Demand of Convenience in Mobility</a></p>



 A Partnership Leading Us into Tomorrow 



<p>In today’s growing mobility sector, having a digital identity is essential for both consumers and businesses. Both want to authenticate the other and feel secure in their relationship. Thus, these digital identities are at the core of MaaS since it is a one-stop shop. It truly is a partnership that will lead us into the world of tomorrow’s transportation.</p>

 A Metaverse built on privacy and trust — with&nbsp;Nuggets <p>The Metaverse represents a new frontier for privacy, trust, and identity. A persistent virtual world where communications, finance, and personal profiles coalesce under one interoperable platform. In the rapidly approaching world of Web 3.0 applications and services that underpin the Metaverse, it’s more important than ever to have a portable and composable digital identity that preserves privacy and provides security. One that won’t just offer proof of who you are and what you can access but also serves as a non-custodial cache for your virtual&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Nuggets delivers on that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>A multi-award-winning, self-sovereign verified digital identity and payment platform, Nuggets provides a persistent, interoperable, and verified digital identity for Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and the Metaverse. Nuggets facilitates trusted transactions through verified digital identities, a personal cloud vault, and auditable nuggets of&nbsp;data.</p> New world. New&nbsp;standard <p>The Metaverse is already upon us. People are working and building in virtual reality; billions are being spent on virtual land and rare avatars to establish a base for new online identities.</p><p>Identity authentication will be as crucial in the Metaverse as it is in the meatspace — if not more so. As such, regardless of the virtual form you take, you’ll still need to demonstrate that you are who you say you are behind the&nbsp;avatar.</p><p>Moreover, an unavoidable consequence of an open metaverse is that problems on Web 2.0 — such as fraud, data breaches, social engineering, and theft — will also exist in the Metaverse. To verify identity and avoid becoming a target for malicious actors, users must embrace the privacy and security of Self Sovereign ID (SSI). The stakes in the Metaverse will be too high to allow for today’s poor standards of privacy and security. Nuggets eliminates the attack vectors inherent in Web 2.0, protecting against fraud and ensuring that users can’t even send funds if it’s not to the correct person or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Nuggets Identity achieves this by implementing real-world identifiers that can be trustlessly linked into the virtual world through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKProofs). A core of Nuggets’ technology (and philosophy), ZKProofs allow one party to verify data to another party without revealing any information beyond the ability to verify the data in the first place. Leveraging this novel tech alongside other protocols, such as W3C verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and the encrypted communication standards of DIDComm, Nuggets provides an SSI that is fully interoperable and can be utilized globally — both in the Metaverse or the meatspace.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity is intrinsically tied to underlying ideals of Web 3.0 and the broader Metaverse. While Web 2.0 can be neatly summarized as a centralized monopoly of big tech firms harvesting user data, Web 3.0 turns that model on its head. Instead, the next evolution of the internet — and indeed, the Metaverse — is one where participants can tangibly claim ownership to digital assets, inclusive of their personal data and identity.</p><p>Within the current Web 2.0 environment, it’s impossible to use your Google identity in an Apple-owned service; the same rings true for numerous other centralized services. The Nuggets platform entirely bypasses this issue by providing a non-custodial and platform-agnostic identity solution. This means you no longer have to input personal information, time and time over, to access different spaces and services.</p> More than just a digital&nbsp;ID <p>Beyond its use as an SSI, Nuggets also offers a multi-asset wallet. Users can carry their non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital collectibles across to other realms or even sell them on a myriad of secondary markets. This also allows users to prove their age, or that they have sufficient credit to afford a tract of virtual land, take out a loan — all without having to reveal their actual balance, or disclose personal information.</p><p>Nuggets digital vault ties cryptocurrencies, bank accounts, and digital collectibles directly to a user’s digital identity, rendering an unfalsifiable and comprehensive payment&nbsp;method.</p><p>Purchases can be made through any retailer or peer in just one click, and you’ll only have to enter your information once, and that data can be kept entirely private. This level of privacy is crucial in a transparent by-design system, where anyone can see a time-marked history of every transaction ever made via a public&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>By employing trusted identifiers, users can securely transact in the digital economy, creating, buying, and selling goods without compromising data. With Nuggets, you can attach a single, persistent portable identity to various avatars and inventories, no matter the platform or&nbsp;realm.</p><p>The Metaverse promises to entirely transform how we interact, rendering a more streamlined method of sending and storing value and information. To succeed, however, this new frontier needs to be safer and more empowering than its web 2.0 predecessor — and that’s precisely what Nuggets stands to offer the coming Metaverse.</p><p>If you share our vision for a safer and more private webspace and want to get involved or learn more about our SSI solution, we’d love you to <a href="http://nuggets.life/">get in&nbsp;touch</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/a-metaverse-built-on-privacy-and-trust-with-nuggets-c6c78627800e">A Metaverse built on privacy and trust — with Nuggets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="http://trent.st/">Trent McConaghy</a>, Co-Founder of Ocean Protocol on the structure of Data Marketplaces, the evolution of Data NFTs and&nbsp;DAOs</p><p>In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we candidly talked with Trent McConaghy, Co-Founder of Ocean Protocol. During this discussion, he explains how Data Marketplaces work, the concept of Datatokens, Data NFTs, and the road ahead with OceanDAO and Ocean V4. Here are edited excerpts of the full&nbsp;<a href="https://anchor.fm/dataeconomy/episodes/Trent-McConaghy--Data-Tokens--NFTs-and-DAOs-e1boc8i">podcast</a>:</p><p>The rabbit hole of Data Economy and Data Marketplaces</p><p>At a high level, the aim or ideal situation for people and organizations is to reclaim their data sovereignty where they can own, control and manage their data while preserving privacy. To facilitate this, you want to have a data economy that facilitates buying and selling of data. If you can have platforms that connect possible buyers with sellers, these platforms are marketplaces- but that, of course, on its own would be centralized. But different marketplaces would deal with different verticals or shapes or sizes of data. Trent&nbsp;says,</p><blockquote>“We saw that instead of one data marketplace, what if there were 1000 different data marketplaces? What does it take to get to 1000 different data marketplaces to bloom? We already have the ‘web’ for pure open data sharing where there aren’t any permissions or anything. The World Wide Web is a data-sharing protocol itself. But it doesn’t have anything about the buying and selling of&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p>What if you could layer on top of that? This brings us to the concept of blockchain.</p><p>The four benefits of blockchain</p>  It’s decentralized: Instead of being controlled by a single entity (for example Facebook). Thousands of people can control&nbsp;it.  It’s immutable: You have the provenance trail of buying and selling- and all of that is on the blockchain. It’s immutable.  You can own assets: If you own one Bitcoin, you own a private key, just like a password. Ownership is the possession of that private key. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin or&nbsp;data.  It offers incentives: Bitcoins are a piece of software that initially, one team or one person wrote. This somehow grew into a global phenomenon with 1000s of people running nodes. It is worth more than a trillion dollars now and spawning a whole new industry. And that was just with one chunk of code that evolved over time. And the core of this is that its growth is based on incentives.  <p>What are Datatokens?</p><p>How does one rewire the world for new rules around data? How do we let NFTs in the marketplaces bloom? How do we make the data marketplace even more interoperable with other blockchain tools out&nbsp;there?</p><blockquote>“When we began building Ocean V3 (about a year and a half ago) crypto was already a huge industry but hadn’t really hit a trillion yet. There were all these tools such as crypto wallets: Metamask, Trust, etc. Then there’s also a bunch of tools around, DAOs, groups of people managing assets, and exchanges, buying and selling these assets, whether centralized or decentralized. We thought about how we can leverage some of these concepts to make Ocean more interoperable? And we realized something very straightforward in the world of data. If I publish a data set, then there might be thousands of people who want to license that data set; they want to use it. So that’s a fungible concept.”</blockquote><p>The vast majority of tokens follow the standard. Let’s say you published a dataset for your DNA. What if that DNA got its own datatoken? Its own ERC 20 tokens? So it’s following the standard. Basically, that is the idea of a datatoken. An ocean datatoken is a fungible token following the ERC 20 token standard, and with benefits in terms of interoperability and simplicity. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">Read Trent’s blog post on datatokens.</a></p><p>Ocean market is a data marketplace, where people can publish their data assets to create these fungible token contracts. They can buy and sell data sets and under the hood — it’s using decentralized exchange technology from Balancer.</p><blockquote>“We’re able to leverage off-the-shelf technology that has been developed for crypto, and we are leveraging it to solve long-standing problems in the world of&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p>Use cases of Ocean Marketplace and Ocean V4: Rug Pulls, Data NFTs, and Monetizing the Community</p><p>Ocean V1 solved data sovereignty; Ocean V2 solved data privacy through privacy-preserving AI and Ocean V3 solved a few things at once. It said: How do we make things simpler? How do we have really crazy interoperability for custody and management of data? How do we automatically price&nbsp;data?</p><blockquote>“What we are doing for Ocean V4 is solving rug pulls and getting into data NFTs. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-posts-413b2dd33e8f">Ocean V3 </a>added better data management with sovereign data with wallets, automatic data pricing, and simplicity. Ocean V4 adds three specific things: solving rug pulls, Data NFTs, and help the community monetize.”</blockquote><p>The target for Ocean V4 is mid-January 2022.</p><p>What are Data&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>A pragmatic definition of ownership is having a “bundle of&nbsp;rights”.</p><p>What was the motive of<a href="https://www.ascribe.io/"> ascribe?</a> The idea behind it was to give everyone more control over their work: for the first time in history, creators could break the lock on content, distribution, and licensing of the entrenched players. When you publish your initial digital art, you’re claiming that you have all the rights around it– either copyright, which is the main thing you get as a creator, which means all other rights derived from that baseline copyright, or all the rights to sublicense. It’s a similar thing for&nbsp;data.</p><p>Say when you publish a CSV file holding your DNA, you are claiming that you have copyright on that. For example, you publish the DNA data that you own– you should have all the rights — it creates a fungible datatoken. This means everyone gets a license whenever you send them the&nbsp;license.</p><blockquote>“What Ocean V4 does is, when you publish just this claim initially, that is a single NFT. It’s a non-fungible token because you can’t make copyright fungible; there’s only one entity that has control of it. So we’re going to explicitly have it where it’s represented as a token, rather than implicitly with whoever published the contract, and that’s what Ocean V4 does. But what that also does, you can still have the sublicenses against that, the fungible&nbsp;tokens.”</blockquote><p>Trent adds&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“In 2021, NFTs took off, mostly entities for digital art, which makes me very happy, like artists are getting paid. Hurray. Artists are getting paid and tooling around NFT’s is exploding too. There are way more wallets that have really good support for these NFTs. More exchanges are buying and selling NFTs. If we actually explicitly represent ‘copyright’ as an NFT, then now there’s really great wallet support for this too. So Data NFTs, thanks to the explosion of NFTs, have great support for wallets, exchanges.”</blockquote><p>OceanDAO</p><p>OceanDAO is a critical piece and is the foundation of a fully decentralized Ocean ecosystem.</p><blockquote>“Over time, we keep iterating, with our users and with their community and learning about what makes sense and what doesn’t make sense. As we were going on the path of designing V3, we saw that we also had an opportunity, not just to simplify how we did data sharing but to improve the macro-level token design of Ocean itself towards long term sustainability”</blockquote><p>This is where <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO</a> comes into the picture. That is how Ocean itself gets more and more decentralized. Teams can get grants, but also people that are in the teams, as well as others in the community can participate in these working groups to help to grow the Ocean ecosystem in various ways that suit their skills and&nbsp;passion.</p><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>2.00 to 10.38: Trent’s journey from AI research to Founder of Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>10.38- 27.28: What is a Datatoken?

             December 2021   
	 
		 
			<p>Towards the end of the year, we’d like to thank you on behalf of Tokeny for your continued support throughout 2021. Without you, we would not be where we are today. We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watch our video and meet the team behind Tokeny:</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We are frequently asked what our predictions are for 2022. Naturally, we tend to answer quickly that it will be the year for institutional adoption of digital assets. However, that already happened this year in many ways, for example:</p>
 
 El Salvador accepted a cryptocurrency as a legal tender; 
 The European Investment Bank issued a tokenized bond on a public blockchain; 
 Large custodians (e.g. State Street) and banks (e.g. Citi) launched digital assets divisions and are now hiring hundreds of people; 
 Institutions tried to leverage DeFi lending protocols to beat low interest rates and inflation; 
 More than $30B of securities have been compliantly tokenized. 
 
<p>Do we think that 2022 will be the year of DeFi, Metaverse, NFTs, cross-chain protocols, stablecoins or decentralized identity? Our answer is that it will be the year for all of these “keywords” and trends, because we are now dealing with a complete blockchain ecosystem, with the Web 3.0 revolution.</p>
<p>With financial institutions, governments, and millions of daily users now recognizing the industry, the upcoming year will bring even more innovation and, for sure, the acceleration of the mass adoption of crypto-assets will continue.</p>
<p>I hope that market standards for tokenized assets and self-sovereign identities will soon be recognized by large players so that we can address one of the major challenges of the next decade: guaranteeing ownership of digital assets.</p>
<p>And you, what are your predictions for 2022?</p>

<p>Two-factor authentication has become the de-facto method for authorization. Currently, the best-known and well-used second-factor authentication methods&nbsp;are:</p><p>1. Email 📧 (proof of email ownership)</p><p>2. SMS 📞 (proof of phone number / SMS ownership)</p><p>3. Time-based one-time passwords TOTP 🕐 (mostly through Authenticator mobile applications, as Google Authenticator, Duo Mobile,&nbsp;etc).</p> How do TOTPs&nbsp;work? <p>In the third option, a server creates a secret for your account. When your device connection is established, it shares that secret set of numbers/characters (usually in the form of a QR code or as a URI) with the Authenticator application. In turn, this application uses that secret and timestamp-based counter to generate the&nbsp;OTP.</p><p>When a user enters the OTP generated by the Authenticator application, the app that is authorizing the user sends this OTP to the server to verify it. This is the same as the application (since both have the same shared secret) and it just checks if the result is the&nbsp;same.</p><p>SMS, in the current state, is considered to be deprecated due to several weaknesses (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/questionsand-buzz-surrounding-draft-nist-special-publication-800-63-3">NIST post on&nbsp;this</a>).</p><p>While the authenticator applications may seem like a better alternative to SMS, they also have many limitations, not to mention the potential for attacks as well: Also, there’s a possibility for the secret generated by the server to get hacked or&nbsp;leaked.</p><p>Further, the backup option services often offer backup codes instead of requiring saving that secret and this means that accessing the backup codes can compromise the authorization process.</p><p>Given these limitations, DID could be a good option as a second factor of authentication instead of SMS and&nbsp;TOTPs.</p> DID as a Second Factor Authentication <p>You can use your DID as second-factor authentication.</p><p>How?</p><p>First off, you can provide your DID instead of disclosing your phone number or email ID as the second factor of authentication. In the second step of verification, you will have to prove that you are the owner of that DID provided during the initial&nbsp;setup.</p><p>To make this happen, the service on the second step of verification can provide a challenge for your user/did using the URI structure.</p><p>For example, it can be something like&nbsp;this.</p><p>didauth://signature?challenge=auth_pmhibhlsjqfjaorz4ja9&amp;ttl=30&amp;callback=https://github.com/multifactor-auth-did</p><p>Where:</p><p>1. `didauth` is the name of the protocol/standard (so an app/wallet will know what to do and accordingly, support&nbsp;it).</p><p>2. `signature` is the type which the Client/Wallet has to&nbsp;prove.</p><p>3. `challenge` — is the challenge for the Client to use (in this case — sign). `auth_` prefix value is designed to prevent a possible&nbsp;misuse.</p><p>4. `ttl` — is the “time to live” of this challenge and is expressed in&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>5. `callback` — is the server endpoint to which the proof must be&nbsp;sent.</p><p>This URI could be presented as the URI itself or as a QR code for the user on the web verification step&nbsp;screen.</p><p>In your identity wallet app, you can scan this QR/post the URI, so the wallet will be able to recognize the protocol, sign the challenge, and send it back to the server callback URL. The server will verify if the signature for the challenge is done by the proper public key of did, and if yes, it lets the web user log into the&nbsp;system.</p><p>That’s it!</p><p>With this approach,</p>  You can use your one digital identity/DID as the second factor auth for any service. (no need to setup/add each service separately)  The services are not storing your secrets (It is only keeping your web3 wallet safe at your end&nbsp;device).  No secrets are shared to set up the connection.  No backup OTPs (In this case you need to backup only your&nbsp;DID).  Low cost to add support at the service side and become crypto/web3 friendly at the same time (potentially to get even more traction from&nbsp;users).  <p>Thus, a simple, yet effective way to authenticate your&nbsp;users!</p><p>What do you&nbsp;think?</p><p>Reach out to us in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">discord </a>if you have any questions.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://denispopovengineer.medium.com/">Denys&nbsp;Popov</a></p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/using-did-as-a-second-factor-authentication-198630db4a1c">Using DID as a Second-factor Authentication</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Aside from promoting innovation and growth (for which read ‘business models based on data surveillance’), the UK Government is justifying its proposed data protection ‘reforms’ on the need to address ‘consent fatigue’.</p><p>It’s quite right to raise this issue. Consent in relation to the collection and use of personal data is in a mess, which needs sorting, most visibly and annoyingly with cookies. The question is, how best to sort this&nbsp;issue?.</p><p>The UK Government’s cynical solution is to simply abolish consent in all but name; to replace citizen rights over their data with corporate rights. But a different, better solution is possible.</p><p>This, the fourth blog in our series prompted by the Government’s proposed data protection ‘reforms’, explores how the consent mess came about and how to clear it&nbsp;up.</p> How we got&nbsp;here <p>Our current problems with consent are caused by a combination of philosophical, regulatory and administrative factors. We need to understand them all to see a way&nbsp;forward.</p> Philosophical differences <p>Two philosophical differences underlie the great consent debate: what sort of thing is personal data, and what’s the most appropriate way of treating&nbsp;it?</p><p>What sort of thing is personal data? Some simply see personal data as a ‘resource’ like any other: to be mined, extracted, processed and monetised. Others see personal data as something that is highly personal — an extension and expression of a human&nbsp;being.</p><p>The heart of the UK Government’s approach is to treat personal data as a thing — a resource whose value is to be extracted and maximised by ‘innovating’ corporations: treated like rats in a lab, to be observed and manipulated, and like sheep in data fields, to be herded and shorn of their valuable data wool. Hence the Government’s goal of ‘securing the UK’s status as a global hub for the free flow of personal data’ where personal data is treated as a commodity like any&nbsp;other.</p><p>Others, including Mydex, see personal data as an extension and expression of a human being, which therefore needs to be treated with the respect that we would afford another human&nbsp;being.</p><p>This isn’t just a warm, fuzzy sentiment. It has practical implications. It means operationalising, in rules and processes, respect for human beings’ agency (the desire to pursue goals), their autonomy (their freedom to do so), and their dignity (their right to have their views and feelings taken into account rather than being treated as a thing and therefore ridden over roughshod). Ultimately, it boils down to the Golden Rule: Treat others as you would wish to be&nbsp;treated.</p><p>In each case, these different forms of respect should manifest themselves in two key areas: having rights a) over how our data is collected and used (which includes ‘consent’), and b) over what it is used&nbsp;for.</p><p>What’s the most appropriate way of treating it? Current data protection law (e.g. GDPR) opts for a rights based approach (a plus point). But it muddies the waters by mixing the pure assertion of rights with treating personal data as a subject of a contract negotiation.</p><p>At one level, consent as a contract negotiation fits with the notions of human agency, autonomy, dignity and mutuality as above. People agree to contracts if there is mutual benefit in&nbsp;them.</p><p>But contract law is based on an absurd fiction: that there are two equal parties negotiating with each other. That an individual citizen and a global titan such as, say, a Google, Facebook or Nation State are both equals in the negotiation.</p><p>Contract law is also based on the mythologies of ‘rational economic man’ that underpin modern economics, which tell us that individuals are (or should be) ‘rational’ in their decision-making. This may sound harmless, but economists use the word ‘rational’ to mean something completely different to its meaning in everyday language.</p><p>In economics-land&nbsp;, a ‘rational’ decision maker always assesses every detail of information there is about their decision, weighing pros and cons that ricochet indefinitely into the future with exact probabilities, and does so with every decision, big and small, in an instant, without any cost in terms of time or&nbsp;effort.</p><p>According to this view, 60 pages of small print legalese to accompany an attempt to access a service is entirely ‘rational’: to make a rational decision the individual has to be ‘fully informed’.</p><p>And, thanks to the mythology behind contract law, it is assumed that an individual presented with 60 pages of small print legalise when seeking to access a service is perfectly free to sign the contract or not. They are free to walk away if they want&nbsp;to.</p><p>And if they sign it, it is their responsibility to face the consequences because they freely decided to agree to&nbsp;it.</p><p>But as we all know, in the real world, fully understanding acres of small print is a burden and interruption that gets in the way of our doing the things we want to do. We don’t always want to be ‘fully informed’ — often, we would simply prefer not to have to think about it. And we’re not really free to walk away if we want to access the service in question. So we end up signing contracts we have not read — signing our rights away, in a way which is deemed perfectly lawful.</p><p>This is how consent became a stick to beat citizens with — where ‘consent’ is used to get citizens to ‘agree’ to all manner of things that they don’t really want, and where they are blamed for the result because ‘you agreed to&nbsp;it!’</p> A regulatory mess <p>Once the regulations were set up in this way, with this unclear mixture of rights and contracts, three things happened. First, risk averse corporate lawyers started using ‘consent’ as a blanket protection for their corporate employers.</p><p>Aside from consent, European data protection laws established five other grounds for lawful processing of an individual’s data: Contract (e.g. use of data for performance of a contract e.g. delivering a service), Legal obligation (e.g. to comply with the law), Vital interests (e.g. to protect someone’s life), Public task (e.g. in the public interest) and Legitimate interests (a vague area which the UK Government is seizing on to deny citizens their data&nbsp;rights).</p><p>Practically speaking, virtually every use of data by bona fide service providers can be, and is, covered by the first five. But ‘consent’ could cover anything, so the lawyers added it in, just to be on the safe side. Very soon, it became the main practical legal ground for the processing of personal data&nbsp;… which was never the intention.</p><p>Second, wily operators on the make saw the opportunity to game the consent system, and game it they did. Knowing full well that the ‘fair contract between free and equal parties’ was a myth, they deliberately constructed terms and conditions and ‘privacy policies’ by which individuals could be asked to consent to all manner of things. Knowing that a) most people wouldn’t read or understand the small print and b) that even if they did, they didn’t have much choice but to agree if they wanted to access the service in question, they used ‘consent’ to open up a data free-for-all.</p><p>The third thing that happened was that with ‘consent’ now being gamed to unleash a tidal wave of abuse, the regulators&nbsp;… did nothing. What else could they do? The law was clear: if someone had freely consented, that was it; they had consented. It was lawful. End of&nbsp;story.</p><p>Finally, recognising this had become a problem, with the introduction of GDPR and related legislation, they sought to tighten the rules surrounding consent. But they did so by going even further down the contract negotiation route, thereby compounding the problem. Hence the ultimate absurdity of cookie pop-ups with mountains of manipulative small print getting in the way of us every time we want to visit a&nbsp;website.</p> Badly designed processes <p>To turn the car crash into a fully fledged motorway pile up, law makers and regulators based the processes by which consent would work on the organisation-centric assumption — that organisations are and always should be the ones controlling individuals’ data.</p><p>Two things followed. Individuals were presented with small print written by the organisation for the organisation. (It never entered anybody’s minds that organisations could or should agree to terms set by the individual.) And individuals had to deal with each organisation separately (because each ‘contract’ was separate), thus multiplying the burden of reading and understanding obscure small print potentially hundreds of times&nbsp;over.</p><p>Result? The ‘consent fatigue’ that the UK Government talks&nbsp;about.</p> A positive way&nbsp;forward <p>The Government’s cynical solution to the problem of consent fatigue is to simply abolish it by expanding organisations’ right to collect and use data without consent so widely that consent becomes irrelevant.</p><p>A different approach is needed, one&nbsp;which:</p>  fully embraces the notion of personal data as an extension and expression of a human being (the philosophy bit)  interprets and enforces the law in a way that practically supports this approach (the regulatory bit)  does so in a way that is safe, easy and efficient (the administrative process&nbsp;bit).  <p>There is a way to do this. Here it&nbsp;is.</p> Getting the philosophy right <p>On the philosophical front, we need to recognise the power imbalances that lie at the heart of contract negotiations between individuals and organisations and discard the fiction that humans are ‘rational economic agents’. We need to design systems that take account of how the real world works and respect the ways that real people&nbsp;behave.</p><p>We humans are ‘cognitive misers’. We don’t want to invest huge amounts of time and effort turning every transaction into a contract negotiation. We don’t want to invest hours of our precious time trying to understand small print unless it’s really necessary. When we buy something in a shop or online, we don’t enter into a contract negotiation about honest, factual descriptions about the product concerned, the safety of its materials and construction, and liability if something goes wrong. We don’t have to worry about these things because we are more or less ‘safe by default’, thanks to a web of protection legislation that was painstakingly constructed over&nbsp;decades.</p><p>We need the same for personal data. When a citizen shares data with a service provider, the citizen should have a right to feel confident that their data (and therefore they) will be kept safe. The philosophical approach that should be adopted is ‘Safe By Default’.</p><p>In this case, there should be a standard (not individually negotiated) assumption that any data that is collected will only be used to provide the service in question; that it will not be shared with anyone not needing to be involved in this service provision; and that the service provider won’t collect more data than is needed to provide the service and won’t hold the data longer than is needed for its provision.</p><p>All of this is already enshrined in European data protection law, and the processing of data on these grounds is already deemed lawful as ‘necessary for the performance of a contract. There is no need to change the law for Safe By Default to become the default. It is already there. It just needs to be enforced.</p> Enforcing the regulations <p>For Safe By Default to work one simple thing needs to happen. Regulators need to stop being spineless: they need to interpret and enforce the law as it was originally intended.</p><p>This would require three things. First, regulators should interpret existing law relating to the six lawful grounds for processing (outlined above) so that ‘consent’ should only be used when there is an exception to the first five. In particular, consent should only be required if an organisation wants to use data for something other than for performance of a contract. Organisations should be punished for using consent unnecessarily — because if the data is genuinely being used in performance of a contract then consent is unnecessary.</p><p>Second, if consent is used, organisations should be required to keep to the spirit as well as the letter of the law. For example, they should not be allowed to bundle different things into the same contract, so that individuals have to agree to things they don’t want in order to access the things they do&nbsp;want.</p><p>Third, the law needs to be enforced. Organisations should be punished for any breaches of data beyond the boundaries of Safe By&nbsp;Default.</p> Reforming processes for&nbsp;consent <p>The processes by which consent is managed need to be reformed.</p>  Individuals should be able to present their own terms and conditions for access to data, which organisations should be able to agree to (thus turning current processes on their head). (This does not require every individual to become a data lawyer. The vast majority of use cases for data sharing fall into a small number of categories (e.g. for insight and research, for advertising, for rent or sale, etc) which can be covered by a small number of standard contracts.)  Individuals should be provided with their own consent management dashboards where they can see and manage all consents from one place (including revoking consents or exercising their rights under data protection law). Organisations should be required to connect to and operate their processes via these dashboards.  These processes should be automated as far as possible. Think of a direct debit. You spend some time setting it up in the beginning (knowing that its subsequent operation will be Safe By Default). Then, once it is set up, it just happens automatically, with the individual remaining in full control because they can always revoke it if they want to. This is how data sharing, and any consent that is needed for such data sharing, should&nbsp;work.   Conclusion <p>The UK Government is right on one thing. The operations of consent and ‘consent fatigue’ are real problems that need sorting. But its cynical ‘so let’s abolish consent’ response is unacceptable. Citizens did not create this problem. Policy makers, regulators and organisations did.</p><p>A positive solution is possible: one that protects citizens’ rights, respects their dignity and makes data sharing and use Safe By Default. It does this by developing new infrastructure that simplifies, standardises and automates data sharing and consent processes, stripping out unnecessary complexity (and the abuses that go with this complexity).</p><p>This is infrastructure that positively empowers citizens rather than denying them their rights and it is all perfectly do-able. Mydex CIC is already building it — the rest boils down to ‘where there is a will there is a way’, especially on the part of regulators.</p><p>There is no need to reform data protection law to address the challenge of ‘consent fatigue’. There is a pressing need to empower citizens with their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is Data Valuable?</a> Exposes misconceptions about the value of data, and therefore where its biggest economic potential lies.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">Five Myths about Data, Innovation and Growth</a> Explains why the Government’s claims that its ‘reforms’ will promote innovation and growth are without foundation.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">AI: The Emperor’s New Clothes?</a> Shows how the Government’s claims that these ‘reforms’ are needed to promote Artificial Intelligence are without foundation, and based on deep misunderstandings of AI&nbsp;itself.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-need-to-talk-about-consent-480f6087a0fe">We need to talk about consent</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The term “Metaverse” may ring a bell to some. With Facebook rebranding itself as Meta, the term Metaverse has gained immense popularity, attracting many technology companies to further explore the concept. But what exactly is metaverse?</p>



<p>Metaverse is an Augmented Reality (AR) technology that allows an individual to interact with another individual virtually. The term “metaverse” has been around for a while, appearing in Neal Stephenson’s book ‘Snow Crash’ in 1992,&nbsp; which showcased a 3D virtual world where humans interacted via their avatars. Over time the term has developed from Sci-fi into a real-life experience.</p>



<p>The expansion of metaverse covers virtual reality from audio, video, 3D holographic avatars to augmented reality glasses. Essentially, the metaverse is an endless virtual community with possibilities that can adapt to real-life activities, resembling the actual—for instance, daily activities from working, playing, meeting, studying and many more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Big technology companies such as Apple and Microsoft have indulged the advancement of the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take Microsoft as an example: the technology company has experimented with holograms, and the development of augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and the real world with its Microsoft Mesh platform. Other companies such as Epic Games, Nvidia &amp; Roblox are also developing devices to support the realization of metaverse.</p>



<p>One of the leading online gaming companies, Epic Games, who created Fortnite, recently collaborated with Balenciaga (luxury fashion brand) to develop high-end fashion in the virtual world. The partnerships feature Balenciaga apparel to be worn in Fornite to allow players to choose their avatar looks in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Socially, the metaverse opens up the possibility of space’s limitations that can exceed even time. No more time-consuming long-distance travel, it enables individuals to do different activities in different places and ease everyday activities such as online shopping and transactions by using cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShareRing is dedicated to being involved in this ever-evolving space. Recently ShareRing Lab (a division of ShareRing) closed our first ever scholarship grant in Thailand, with applicants submitting their research plans and ideas on the metaverse, and functionality of NFTs beyond the art sector. As a company we are committed to the development of talent, and welcome this gradual transition of day-to-day regular activities into the digital sphere.</p>

<p>2021, and what a year it’s been. Between all the hustle and bustle of pre-Christmas, we took a step back not to send you another flashback article, but to look ahead at what’s coming next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the pandemic taught us anything, it’s that sometimes we cannot plan things. BUT Jolocom has plans and projects for 2022 that are as certain as can be. Let us introduce you to some exciting news as we finish this year and look forward to the next one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Projects&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ve heard a lot about our SDI projects, and they will keep us busy next year too. The two short acronyms of ONCE and IDIdeal are our main projects in bringing the SSI world to the individual here in Germany. The key focus is interoperability and following the same technical standard. In addition to that, we work on different SSI based projects in the public sector as well. Be sure to check in again in a few weeks, when we can tell you more. We also expanded the role of consulting at Jolocom in case you might think of implementing SSI at your organization: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/">https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently we are talking to potential developmental partners about financial and public projects. As our connections and projects are expanding, so is our team. We are happy to see the first real life users and customers for our use cases in 2022 and look forward to bringing the SSI work to the people. This would not be possible without the engagement of a highly motivated team behind Jolocom. If this sounds interesting to you and the outlook of 2022 seems like something that you would like to contribute to, check our open positions: <a href="https://jolocom.io/hiring-product-designer/">https://jolocom.io/hiring-product-designer/</a> . We are hiring and looking forward to getting to know you! Read more about our work in the next Tech paragraph:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tech&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SDI projects will most likely be the focus (from a tech perspective) for the next year. A number of use cases will be piloted as part of these projects (mostly public administration / mobility) as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a tech perspective, in order to satisfy the SDI requirements we are building new features on a few fronts, but the core is the next iteration of our Jolocom SDK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For us, interoperability will remain a very present topic for the next year (<a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/can-we-avoid-a-ssi-babel/">https://jolocom.io/blog/can-we-avoid-a-ssi-babel/</a>). In the context of the SDI projects we have been working (also across consortia) on defining and documenting a set of SSI specifications we can all implement around. This would allow Wallets / use cases developed in different consortia to be interoperable / used with each other. We have shared and refined these efforts together with the wider SSI community (e.g. at IIW 33, as well as the DIF Interoperability Working group, among the SDI consortia, and the German Begleitforschung) on a few occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Events&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2015, Jolocom took part in the Internet Identity Workshop. Since 2018, we also sponsor it. Now we are happy to announce that the next IIW will take place from 26th – 28th April 2022. Jolocom is happy to take part in solving identity issues at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW #34</a>, and, what’s even more exciting, the event is planned to be in person in Mountain View, CA. What exactly is happening at the IIW? As the name suggests, we discuss all things identity with amazing partners from around the world. In dozens of sessions and lunches we have the opportunity to engage with new professional international connections, discussing, working on and learning about Internet Identity today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, that is not the only event we can look forward to. Connecting to like-minded people and organizations is an important part of our work. Therefore, we are happy to join the DWeb Camp, date yet to be announced. Moreover, Berchain is also awaiting us next year. As long time contributors to DIF, we are looking forward to 24th February 2022, when the next DIF event takes place. Since 2021, Jolocom is member of the Steering Committee as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That being said, let us tell you that we are here for you next year, too. Be sure to hear from us on our communication channels. We have exciting stuff planned and already look forward to bringing back our #Wednesdayfacts amongst other. Give us a follow on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/GETJolocom">https://twitter.com/GETJolocom</a> and LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/18169128/admin/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/18169128/admin/</a> if you don’t want to miss out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the Advent Calendar of #JolocomAdvent coming to a close, we would like to thank everyone on twitter who participated in our daily posts and polls. If you have any feedback or wish to see something new regarding the communication campaign, reach out to us on hannah@jolocom.com.&nbsp;</p>

			 Barbel van Spreeuwel is Accounting Administrator at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m Barbel van Spreeuwel, born and raised in Flanders – the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. And I’ve already been working and living in Luxembourg for more than 20 years now…time flies. When I decided to come to Luxembourg to join my fiancé at that time, who is now my husband, I was already working as a Financial Reporting Officer for the Investment Fund Industry in Brussels, so the professional switch to Luxembourg was not too hard. We have two wonderful daughters who keep us entertained at each age, for the moment we are enjoying their teenage period immensely ;-).</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was contacted by Tokeny when they were in need of an extra team member. They had managed to attract a big institutional investor, new internal reporting needs popped up, extra follow-up of the accounting needed to be set up and there are, as always, the day-to-day administrative tasks to take care of.</p>
<p>Daniel and Luc managed to trigger my curiosity about working in a start-up environment (completely out of my comfort zone !) and they kind of immediately gained my trust in their view on the new business opportunities related to tokenization and blockchain technology. It looked like an exciting adventure, and it turned out to be so.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was immediately immersed in Tokeny’s digital way of working, thanks to the support of my (younger) colleagues, I managed to transform smoothly into my new, digital “me”.</p>
<p>Remote working was already possible at Tokeny before COVID messed up our lives, and I really enjoy the combination of remote work and office work.</p>
<p>Even though I don’t have a day-to-day relationship with other departments, thanks to the communication tools and efforts made by our management, I do feel connected to what is happening despite the almost 100% home office experience for the last 18 months.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Healthy food, having a good dinner/lunch in any type of restaurant, interior decoration, fashion, traveling, meeting up with family and friends, music… All the simple things in life (but sports are not in my list I’m afraid :))</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>A very personal one….</p>
<p>It would be fantastic if the eternal Flame of Hope – located in London, Ontario, in Canada – could be extinguished, preferably still in my lifetime, because this means that a cure has been found for Diabetes and people suffering from Diabetes will no longer be dependent on external insulin injections.</p>
<p>My family actively contributes to this search for a cure through our participation in a European research project called INNODIA. Fingers crossed for some great outcome……</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would say that many topics remain to be addressed, but in general, I believe that through technological and scientific advances we will continue to overcome the major problems that we will encounter as human beings.</p>
<p>And on a more emotional/mental level: let’s all be as much open-minded as possible and try to stick to a positive and constructive attitude.</p>

<p>Introduction:2021: A Year Of Progress And Productivity</p>AERGO Has Risen Exponentially In Monetary Valuation And Public Exposure And There Are Many Reasons&nbsp;Why<p>Over the course of 2021, AERGO has made numerous strides in association to garnering partnerships, improving upon technology and consolidating mutual understanding and collaboration with South Korean governmental and media entities. Since the beginning of 2021, AERGO has been on the frontlines from a technological standpoint surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic, as AERGO’s incubated project CCCV has been utilized in South Korea to verify vaccination status among the Korean populace. The project CCCV, develped by Blocko XYZ, a technological partner of AERGO, has allowed for the anchoring of vaccine data on the AERGO public mainnet and this will assist South Korea in a variety of&nbsp;ways.</p><p>As of today, confirmation stickers of vaccine status only exist for people over the age of 65, which creates a huge population gap on understanding who is vaccinated and who isn’t, this is where CCCV comes in. CCCV will target ages under 65 in an effort to monitor the vaccination status of the South Korean population, a major feat that proves AERGO’s technological prowess. Since CCCV’s inception, over 2 million subscribers have joined the platform which not only include vaccination status protocols, but provides users with blockchain digital identity and NFT access as well! In fact, CCCV had their first NFT Exhibition in 2021 which was a huge success, leveraging metaverse technology and NFT’s in a virtual exhibition because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Digital identity in particular has been of great benefit in the ongoing attempt to rectify election fraud and the tampering of the democratic process, which AERGO has been attempting to nullify in South Korea through digitized blockchain voting through its application, Pikkle.</p><p>Pikkle: By The People, For The&nbsp;People</p>Pikkle Has Revolutionized The Notion And Ethos Of Blockchain Voting, Spearheading A New Era Of Blockchain Democracy<p>It is not the voters who decide the election, the counters to; this age old phrase has put the democratic process not only into question, but into jeopardy. Since the inception of democracy in Athens and ancient India, there has been no possible method to nullify and minimize the effects of election tampering; even in the 21st century, we have seen election tampering throughout the entirety of the world. It has become evident that democratic-republicanism is under-threat by tyranny, despotism and elusive election tampering. Throughout the globe, voter fraud has become a prevalent topic of discussion from major political entities to the citizenry. Blockchain technology however, is an immutable system that is immune to fraud and provides users with an innovation that is highly secured, decentralized and anonymized with audible chains of records. Blockchain technology has revolutionized and transformed numerous different industries and now it is time for blockchain to perpetuate the ethos of democracy as the catalyst of the collapse and end of voter fraud. AERGO understood this notion, and knew that it must be stopped, so Pikkle was&nbsp;born.</p><p>Pikkle was created by Blocko and built on the AERGO platform, Pikkle has become a standard application utilized by the Korean Broadcaster’s Association who signed an MOU with AERGO on April 23rd and Pikkle’s inception occurred to prevent a variety of dilemmas that plague election processes because of malicious intent. Pikkle assists in inefficient election costs, resolving voter processes that create substantial costs coinciding with identity verification, voter fraud, ballot lists and check counts. Pikkle aims to mend the public trust of voting paradigms which. Unfortunately, since the advent of social media, it has become evident that votes can be easily manipulated and influenced for the platforms own self-interest, and this is true for all social media platforms, it is not an exclusionary issue.</p><p>The Korean Broadcasters Association aims to utilize Pikkle as the standardized go-to platform for reliable voting services for all users involved. Pikkle collects users information and views and assists in decision making through an application service rather than traditional cold-calling and text voting spams. Pikkle resolves voter fraud by storing data-components of voters such as identification of voters and voting results utilizing blockchain technology; an immutable digital ledger that cannot be hacked, tampered with or corrupted, unlike traditional voting systems. Convenience has become a crucial component of almost every single part of our daily lives so Pikkle encourages the seamless usage of QR codes to participate in voting actions, insured by the public and private trust of blockchain technology. The app’s identity verification service, which eliminates the need for a physical ticket, enables efficient and easy entry into cultural events and festivals, a hallmark of South Korean tradition. Fun fact, the word Pikkle derives itself from two words “pick” and “people”, the people pick the electoral incumbents, not the despots and politicians. AERGO aims to be a progressive company in a variety of ways, and AERGO has recently joined the Cryptocurrency Climate Accord in an attempt to nullify pollution created by blockchains.</p><p>Forward Thinking: Net-Zero Carbon Output Blockchain</p>Prominent Figures Have Criticized Blockchain Because Of The Immense Pollution Output Proof Of Work Systems&nbsp;Create<p>Many powerful and prominent figures within our world, specifically Elon Musk, has shown huge interest in blockchain technology, but have pulled back on their stance because of the unfortunate carbon output many blockchains create. Resulting from this, companies like AERGO joined an organization in 2021 known as the “Crypto Climate Accord”, whose aim is to reach net-zero emissions for their respective blockchains. This organization, including AERGO, has some of the most prominent blockchain projects within this initiative which include Enjin, Ripple, Polygon and Terra. One of AERGO’s fundamental goal for this decade is to be carbon-zero by the year 2030, a forward thinking approach in a backward world surrounding energy consumption. In essence, a healthier planet leads to mainstream adoption through the acceptance from not only the populace, but the environment as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Klaytn And Aergo: Blockchain Partnerships</p>In 2021, AERGO Was Listed On Klayswap, A Decentralized Crypto Asset Finance&nbsp;Protocol<p>AERGO hasn’t stopped in its resolve to garner partnerships and expansion within the private, public and blockchain sectors and their partnership with KLAYswap this year emphasizes such a notion. KLAYswap is a complete and automated on-chain swap protocol that operates and leverages on-chain liquidity pools. Liquidity is guaranteed through automated market making mechanisms. KLAYswap enables on-chain swap services for any KLAY or KCT-type token cryptocurrency to become a liquid provider and earn passive income from transaction fee commissions. For AERGOnauts, this enables AERGO token holders to participate in a passive income paradigm simply by utilizing the KLAYswap platform, which in return can earn them AERGO tokens in a decentralized environment. Resulting from this partnership, AERGO has garnered increased liquidity and immutability, which, in conjunction with passive income mechanisms, is a force to be reckoned with. Not only has AERGO garnered partnerships specifically oriented to blockchain companies and MOU’s signed with government entities, but venture capital firms have taken notice of AERGO as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The Great Noticing: Venture Capitalists Take Notice Of&nbsp;AERGO</p>Notice AERGO In This Diagram With Some Of The Most Well Known And Prominent Projects In All Of Blockchain?<p>AERGO has garnered backing from numerous VC’s within the web of blockchain, and the above chart proves the notion of how far AERGO has come, specifically in 2021. One of the largest blockchain VC firms, Sequoia Capital, invested in AERGO, and Sequoia has invested in other companies you may just be familiar with: Google, Apple, PayPal, Instagram and YouTube are to name a couple. Since AERGO’s inception, other contributors have backed AERGO which include, FBG, GBIC, Arrington XRP, Dekrypt, Rockaway, Neo Global as well as many more traditional VCs.</p>Early Investors Of The AERGO Project, Listed&nbsp;Above!<p>Venture capital investment is one of the prerequisites in searching for a promising project that could revolutionize numerous different aspects of an industry. Since the beginning of 2021, AERGO has proven itself as a dominance blockchain platform through the realization that many of these VC firms see promise, potential and a future for the AERGO project. It would be of a logical conclusion to make that venture capital firms only invest in projects that they believe have not only monetary promise, but a grandeur vision within its own industry, making AERGO an outlier within the blockchain web. One of the latest partnerships, in December, has also been announced as well with a company known as TrustVerse; the emphasis on the inception of partnerships and the expansion of AERGO cannot be overstated.</p><p>TrustVerse And AERGO: Partnerships Upon Partnerships, Expansion Upon Expansion</p>TrustVerse And AERGO On December 2nd, Agreed To Sign A Business Agreement That Will Assist In the Expansion Of The AERGO&nbsp;Platform<p>Even in the final weeks of 2021, AERGO is making numerous strides to garner business agreements and partnerships to expand upon its reach within our world; one recent business agreement that was announced just ten days ago was the AERGO TrustVerse agreement. TrustVerse is a digital financial solution company, and TrustVerse has agreed to add AERGO token and NFT features on TrustVerse’s digital wallet. Simultaneously, TrustVerse will be a representative 3rd Party Wallet of the AERGO project, an outstanding feat. Through this agreement between these two corporate entities, AERGO will be provided with TrustVerse’s MarS Wallet as AERGO’s representative 3rd Party Wallet, which will in return increase its blockchain ecosystem utilization and flexibility. MarS Wallet will add AERGO ERC20 token, AERGO Mainnet token, and AERGO Mainnet NFT assets storage, transmission, and viewing functions, providing AERGO with increased expansion, exposure and availability to expand even further. It is evident that TrustVerse trusts AERGO’s future vision and the scale in which they which to&nbsp;grow.</p><p>Conclusion: Token Valuation Increase Through Corporate Expansion</p>Valuation Increases When Utility And Corporate Expansion Occurs<p>2021 is a year in the history book of AERGO that will be remembered for years to come. Government MOU’s were signed, AERGO’s liquidity increased through Klayswap, CCCV has assisted with COVID certification vaccines and NFTs, Pikkle has conceived of a democratic paradigm that assists in the rectification of voter fraud and election tampering, and this is only the beginning. VC firms have noticed the expansion of AERGO, the Korean Broadcaster’s Association is now familiar with the project and utilizes Pikkle, which proves that AERGO has garnered respect and partnerships in the public, private and blockchain sectors, and this is only in 2021 alone. If 2022 is anything like 2021 for AERGO, it is evident that this blockchain project will become one that will be reckoned&nbsp;with.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>Searching for the best open banking network, or what historically people referred to as financial account aggregators can mean combing through a ton of choices. In fact, when you search for financial data APIs on review site <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/finicity/reviews">G2</a>, you’ll see a whopping <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/financial-data-apis">92 options</a>. How do you parse through so many companies to find the one right for your fintech company’s needs?</p>
<p>Because it can be a difficult decision for fintech companies, we’ve put together this guide to define financial data aggregation and to help identify the features to look for.&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding Financial Data Aggregation 
<p>Account aggregation, also known as financial data aggregation, is a process that collects a person’s financial data in one place. This data can include checking and savings accounts, transactions, investments, credit and tax data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having this data in one place benefits many parties, not only consumers. It also benefits banks, lenders, investors and financial advisors. A lender, for example, can use account aggregation to see all the relevant financial information for a consumer applying for a loan, including their transaction history, employment history, income, assets and more. Individuals and families can use the aggregated data to make better financial decisions and small and midsize businesses can use it to better run their operations or access critical capital. Fintech companies can use it to make better apps for their clients.</p>
<p>At Finicity, a Mastercard company, we believe that true empowerment of consumers comes from giving them full control of their data. Consumers should have total control over how their data is used, how frequently it’s accessed and how long it will be retained. The steps to manage data permissions should be easy, quick, and intuitive. Aggregators and ecosystem participants can work together to ensure the highest level of clarity and accessibility, making it easy for consumers to understand and manage their data permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to pure convenience, financial data aggregation through open banking eliminates the need for each party to update this data manually. This saves time and minimizes mistakes for both companies and their clients. It’s all part of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-banking.asp">open banking</a>—allowing consumers, financial institutions, and third-party providers to access consumer-permissioned data for empowering consumers and small businesses through new and innovative financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does it work? Historically, data has been collected through screen scraping with a secure login. Much of today’s innovation has been built on the foundation of screen scraping. Recently, however, more data aggregators are using direct API connections with a financial institution. Finicity, for example, pulls the majority of its data through direct API connections in the United States. This method provides cleaner data and is more secure because it uses tokenized access instead of consumers’ login credentials.</p>
<p>Data aggregators use bank-level encryption, which safeguards the personal and financial data of consumers. Finicity operates its aggregation platform with a transparent, consumer-first ethos. Consumers should be explicitly informed in plain language how their data will be used and who will be using it.</p>
 What to Look For in Open Banking Providers of Financial Data 
<p>&nbsp;When you’re searching for financial data aggregation services, you’ll want to find one that has wide coverage, core provider capabilities and specialty products for your company’s needs. It should also maintain a good price point, with a user-friendly platform and the assurance of accurate data.</p>
 Coverage 
<p>Does the aggregator have a wide breadth of access to financial institutions, or do you need a depth of coverage in one area? Finicity maintains its connections, which cover more than 95% of financial accounts. This means that anyone who uses our services can be confident that they will get the best possible insights into their client’s financial situation.</p>
 Core Provider 
<p>While there may be many companies that offer data aggregation solutions, many of them are simply reselling data from another aggregator. Finicity is one of a select few aggregators who maintain all of their connections to banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. When errors arise, you want to be dealing with the actual provider of the data, who can make changes. Otherwise, you may be consuming data they’re getting from somewhere else, and never have the ability to make essential adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also want to know where your data is coming from for traceability purposes. Knowing how many different companies touch the data can also be an important piece of the puzzle.</p>
 Specialty 
<p>Does the aggregator specialize in your industry? Whether you’re a lender, financial advisor, investor or private individual, it’s important that your financial data aggregation software be tailored to your company’s needs. For example, if you’re a <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">lender</a>, you’ll need to see assets, income, employment, cash flow, statements, transactions and scoring attributes to ensure that you are making the right decision. Where the data comes from is also important. Does the aggregator connect with the largest investment brokerages or stick to simply banks and credit unions? The source of the data is also an important component of an aggregator’s specialty.</p>
 Cost 
<p>What’s your budget? Where’s breakeven from a revenue and cost perspective? Many financial aggregation companies offer pricing on a <a href="https://www.finicityreports.com/plans?_ga=2.112862980.1461598282.1625012380-386745331.1624463991">tiered</a> basis by volume, which may be something like free trial, pay-as-you-go or enterprise. Determine what your needs and priorities are—maybe you need verification of assets but not verification of income. See which tiers or packages offer your highest priority data and what your expected volumes would be.</p>
 User Friendliness 
<p>Are the APIs readily available for you to use? If fintech companies can’t test out APIs before making a commitment, it’s hard to know if the features and user experience will fulfill their needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The industry has been around for more than 20 years and technologies vary when it comes to working with a modern development team,” said Michael Deleon at <a href="https://tearsheet.co/data/a-buyers-guide-for-data-aggregation/">Tearsheet</a>. “You’ll want to find a match between your firm’s capabilities and the UI/UX of the data aggregation industry.”</p>
 Data Accuracy 
<p>Is the data they’re pulling cross-verified with multiple data sources and bank-validated deposit streams? You want to be confident in the quality of the data. That way you won’t have to do any further cleaning of the data and can plug what you receive directly into your current workflows.</p>
 Why Finicity is One of the Best Financial Data Aggregators 
<p>If you’re one of the many fintech companies looking for a financial data aggregator, Finicity is a great option for you. <a href="https://tearsheet.co/data/a-buyers-guide-for-data-aggregation/">Tearsheet did a handy comparison</a>, and if you’re here you’ve probably already heard about our competitors.</p>

<p>As we near the end of another year it seems like a great point to reflect on what has come to pass. In today’s fast-paced world, the emphasis tends to be focusing on future plans; what deliverables are in our roadmap, what partnerships are on the horizon, and how we can best structure our team for future success. However, finding time to reflect is also essential as it helps us to understand and analyze what worked well, what didn’t, and our general direction and velocity of travel. With that in mind, this post will look back at what 2021 had in store while offering a brief glimpse into our plans for 2022.</p><p>Rather than give a blow by blow account of each month as it happened, because that would be very boring and tedious, we’ve identified some broad themes that developed throughout the year, these were:</p>  Tech delivery  Shift from engineering to adoption and partnerships  Team scaling  <p>Tech Delivery</p><p>To use a soccer commentator's cliche, 2021 was a “game of two halves”. The first 6 or so months represented a heavy focus on feature development and several upgrades for the Dock Blockchain. The start of the year saw Dock finish what it started in late 2020 with the completion of the token migration, we even <a href="https://blog.dock.io/migration-extension-announcement/">extended</a> this to ensure we brought as many token holders with us from the Ethereum Network over to Dock’s new chain. Approximately, 97.2% or all tokens were migrated (circa 972M) and those that migrated within the first 5 weeks were awarded a token bonus by the Dock treasury. Looking back, we’re delighted with this result. Migrations are highly complex and involve multiple third parties (security auditors, exchanges, legal, etc...), and completing this securely while also keeping other aspects of the roadmap on track is a testament to the dedication and commitment of the team and the support of our amazing community. And the result is certainly worth it, as we describe later in this post the utility the Dock ecosystem derives from our native token is evident in several areas.</p><p>Network upgrades</p><p>Network upgrades continued just as the migration was drawing to a close, and at the end of March, we integrated our mainnet with Parity’s <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier">Frontier project</a> making it possible to deploy smart contracts written in Solidity on Dock. Our specific requirement for this addition was to enable us to integrate Dock’s mainnet with Chainlink’s price feed, enabling network services to be provided to issuers in USD. However, in addition to our initial use case, the integration significantly increases what can be created on Dock, such as; the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which we created a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/eth/tutorials/src/tutorial_evm.md#dao">tutorial</a> for, the issuance of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and decentralized application development.</p><p>Around this time we also released a feature that had come up several times in calls with organizations that were considering using Verifiable Credential platforms, and that is the ability to make Dock’s credentials <a href="https://blog.dock.io/delegatable-credentials-now-available/">delegatable</a>. For example, a government may want to allow private test centers to manage issuance of certain licenses on its behalf. Or a professional organization may delegate the credentialing authority to online learning platforms, so that the members who complete courses on the platforms can receive verifiable credentials that are officially recognized by the organization. This feature was extended a few months later by enabling delegators to publicly attest delegations by adding details of delegation to their Decentralized Identity documents on the Dock blockchain while also enabling credential Verifiers to search for delegation details publicly posted on-chain. Delegatable Credentials is a feature that continues to come up in our partnership discussions and is utilized in pilots, a worthy addition to Dock’s product suite.</p><p>As summer descended on western Europe, Dock released arguably the biggest milestone of our year when we moved from our Proof of Authority network to Proof of Stake. This achievement took many months of planning and execution from the entire team. While Dock engineers worked with security auditors to ensure the upgrade was being carried out securely and successfully launched a testnet before the mainnet upgrade, the operations team recruited and worked with more validator teams as our validator count rose from 11 to 50 during the transition. Quality was certainly the focus and the Dock ecosystem is fortunate to be supported by a number of validating partners including; Ovrhd, Everstake, Stakin, MyCointainer, Ryabina along with a host of independents.</p><p>We also worked with exchange partners to ensure they had updated their wallets to run on our upgraded chain, which is in essence an entirely different network to what we had before. It was not possible to keep the previous chain state and roll it into the new network and we, therefore, had our block explorer, Subscan, host both our <a href="https://dock-poa.subscan.io/">PoA chain</a>, frozen after 7.6M blocks, and our new <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/">PoS chain</a>. &nbsp;At the time of writing the new chain has been running for 160 days uninterrupted and has produced over 4.5M blocks at the time of writing, while 12.4% of circulating supply is currently staked.</p><p>The upgrade to PoS was so important for the network as it further decentralized control by not only increasing the number of validators, as mentioned previously, but also it meant that the Dock Association no longer had any control over deciding who the validators were. Under PoS, Network algorithms now determine who becomes one of the 50 active validators based on the amount of stake they hold. The validator elections take place continually and are held every 12 hours. In addition, we now also have community governance features in place as a result of this upgrade, and recently our first referenda was <a href="https://blog.dock.io/referenda-1-approved-network-rewards-split-to-adjust-to-50-50/">successfully passed</a> increasing the rewards received by the validators and stakers.</p><p>Adoption, growth, and partnerships</p><p>The second theme that emerged through 2021 was adoption and growth. Essentially, now that we have a network in place, how do we maximize its use? The approach we have taken is two-fold, first, what technical things can we build to make the consumption of our network as easy and efficient as possible. The second aspect is operational, what relationships can we build and what processes can we put in place for technical teams to start to build on Dock. In fact, 2021 was a busy year for partnerships, we concluded the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-awarded-contract-to-advise-german-development-agency-on-professional-profile-data-wallet-for-global-learners/">work we had started</a> with German development agency Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), assisting them with the technical architecture and features for a professional profile data wallet for their learning platform. As a slight aside, those who follow Dock closely will know that we released our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/launch-of-the-dock-wallet-app/">mobile wallet</a> into the app stores this month. Not only can community members now store, send, receive, and manage Dock tokens from their mobile device, it will serve as an important gateway to several planned Dock innovations.</p><p>We also <a href="https://blog.dock.io/hackathon-winners-ovrhd-build-solution-on-dock/">worked with Ovrhd</a>, a startup that was using Dock to not only win a Hackathon, but also work with the Dutch Government in the Hague to use Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity to create a tokenized urban ecosystem, in which tokens are used to manage crowds and enable voting procedures within the community.</p><p>Ease of use</p><p>As the year progressed, and the basic features were in place, we started to think about how we can make the network easier to use and the tools we could provide to encourage adoption within this very new yet exciting world of verifiable credentials and decentralized identity. &nbsp;This thinking was developed in conjunction with companies like international identity verification provider, Credenxia, who are <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-leaps-into-the-future-with-docks-api/">collaborating</a> with Dock to build a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials. Our answer was to <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-to-release-verifiable-credentials-api/">build an API</a> (Application Programming Interface) that simplified the development process by taking care of key management and hiding the requirement for Dock tokens to process network transactions (this is managed by Dock) enabling payment for API usage to be made in $USD. Essentially, the API enables less complex and faster integrations and is certainly desirable with almost all companies we have spoken with. This includes <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-partners-with-digital-credentialing-platform-xertify/">Xertify</a> who is integrating with Dock’s blockchain infrastructure and tools to facilitate issuance of their healthcare credentials. At present, Dock has had around 2,500 signups to our API with around half of these identifying themselves as developers, product, and business owners. So demand certainly seems to be strong and as we prepare to enter 2022 we’re very optimistic the volume of issuer partners will grow rapidly.</p><p>It is important to note that the partnerships formed during the year were not just issuers of Dock, growing adoption can take many forms, and late in November, we co-sponsored the world’s <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-co-sponsor-dao-hackathon/">biggest Hackathon</a> focussed on utilizing decentralized tech stacks. At the time of writing over 2,500 participants have signed up and we\re all looking forward to seeing the outcome of the event with Dock’s challenge to participants focussing on; Self-Sovereign Identity, Workforce Training, Know Your Customer (KYC), Learning &amp; Academia, and Health &amp; Safety. &nbsp;We also recently <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-collaborates-with-transak/">completed an integration</a> with leading fiat on/off ramp, Transak, whose service enables the purchase of DOCK via bank transfer and/or card payments in multiple international currencies in over 60 countries.</p><p>Team growth</p><p>It was clear at the start of 2021 that in order to support our aggressive roadmap and ambition we had to increase the number of team members, as well as acquire some additional skills. During the course of the year, the team has grown by around 42% up to our current complement of 14. We have already hired another blockchain engineer who will start in January but we’ll introduce him when the time comes.</p><p>This year we have added a Mobile (React) Developer, Head of Business Development, Solution Architect, Content Marketer, QA and Test Automation Specialist, Project Manager, Support Rep, and a Cryptographic Advisor. Moving forward, we will be looking to add to our mobile development team to increase our development velocity. We have a lot of plans here and we want to bring them to market as quickly as possible, while we will also be increasing our marketing team.</p><p>It is worth noting that on the whole recruitment has been very challenging this year and certainly it is a seller's market. Any blockchain experience in development roles certainly carries a significant cost premium and with many projects with large treasuries and funding pools to draw from the market is very fast-moving and highly competitive. As a result, it took longer than anticipated to recruit for certain roles, even working with professional recruiters. There is no indication that 2022 will be any different.</p><p>Looking forward</p><p>While this is a reflective post, it would also be remiss not to consider what can be expected for 2022. We will continue our drive to keep making Dock easier to use, for issuers but also for the token holder and staking community. We know that the user experience of staking through our <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/explorer">front-end app</a> certainly has room for improvement and we’re going to be improving this in several ways. Our integration with the hardware wallet, Ledger, is at the final stage, and certainly staking through Ledger reduces some of the complexity and the number of steps involved. We’re also going to be integrating staking into our newly launched mobile wallet and soon-to-be-released web wallet. And of course, for those who prefer the simplicity of centralized, custodial staking, this will be available with some of our existing exchange partners soon.</p><p>We’ll also be working to continue our blockchain innovation with features like traceable credentials, range proofs, and we’ll be working to build bridges between Dock and other blockchains to increase utility of the DOCK token while also adding other options for blockchain developers. And finally, we plan on continuing our effort to engage the Dock community through our forums, our governance process, as well as through projects like our newly launched Ambassador program and our up and coming Grants Program. Watch our social channels for more details.</p><p>We’re hugely proud of what we have been able to achieve this year, particularly as a small yet growing team. None of this would be possible without the amazing support of our partners and of course, the Dock community, many of whom give our team members, and the project, backing above and beyond the call of duty.</p><p>Thanks for an amazing year and best wishes to everyone for a healthy and prosperous 2022!</p>

<p>As we increasingly move towards a digital world, there are many hurdles that emanate from this increased adoption, such as privacy violations, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">security breaches</a>, and data ownership concerns.</p><p>These challenges stem from the perspectives of seeing an entity’s identity as a mechanism of control and a means of monetization, instead of seeing it as something that defines a particular entity and belongs to&nbsp;it!</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">Self-Sovereign identity</a> or SSI, in short, has the potential to change these existing perspectives and to put an entity completely in control of its information.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity — Principles and&nbsp;Benefits <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> is a new framework that enables an entity to control where and how one’s data is stored and with whom it is shared. If you look closely, there are many principles involved in it and they&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602">Selective disclosure</a> — You disclose only the information you choose to share with&nbsp;others.  Decentralized identity management — Since every entity is responsible for its identity, there is no more centralized storage and management of digital identities.  Control — The user has complete control over his/her information and can determine where and how it must be&nbsp;shared.  Transparency — There is complete transparency for the user on how his/her data is being used and by&nbsp;whom.  Interoperability — SSI supports interoperability across different systems  <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</a> — This is a process by which one entity can prove if a statement is true by revealing as little information as required.  Portability — SSI supports the use of data formats that are portable across&nbsp;devices.  Secure — Since it uses cryptography and blockchain, the information tends to be&nbsp;secure.  <p>These principles provide a ton of flexibility and benefits for both individuals and organizations, and the society at&nbsp;large.</p> Benefits for Individuals <p>For individuals, it is a safe and secure way to store and share their information with others, all the while being in control of what is happening with their data. This is a big shift from the existing <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">federated identity</a> and other centralized systems where organizations store and control the way users’ data is shared and&nbsp;used.</p> Benefits for Organizations <p>SSI is beneficial for organizations too, as it streamlines the customer onboarding process and at the same time, enables the organization to comply with the growing privacy and security legislation.</p><p>With SSI, organizations no longer have to spend resources in protecting and managing users’&nbsp;data.</p> Benefits for the&nbsp;Society <p>SSI helps society as a whole by reducing the number of data hacks and by providing a framework for governance. It can provide the much-needed privacy and security that are necessary to enhance the trust factor among&nbsp;users.</p><p>Now that you know the benefits of SSI, how can you leverage&nbsp;it?</p><p>While there are many ways to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/do-you-need-blockchain-for-enabling-ssi-452d62b34890">implement SSI</a>, we will focus on its implementation through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p> Elements of a Verifiable Credential <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> are open standards to represent digital identities. These credentials are expressed using JSON and are digitally signed, thereby making them tamper-proof and machine verifiable.</p><p>Here’s how a VC looks&nbsp;like.</p> {  “@context”: [      “https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",      “https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"  ],  “id”: “http://example.edu/credentials/58473",  “type”: [“VerifiableCredential”, “AlumniCredential”],  “issuer”: “https://example.edu/issuers/565049",  “issuanceDate”: “2010–01–01T00:00:00Z”,  “credentialSubject”: {      “id”: “did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21”,      “alumniOf”: {          “id”: “did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1”,          “name”: [{              “value”: “Example University”,              “lang”: “en”           }, {      “value”: “Exemple d’Université”,      “lang”: “fr”      }]    }  },    “proof”: { … }  } <p>Source: w3.org</p><p>If you look closely at the VC, it contains the following elements.</p> Context <p>The context provides a background to what’s coming and in the case of a VC, it always starts with “@”. This is an ordered set where the first is always the URI — <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1">https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1</a>. This lets the other systems know that this is a VC and will process it accordingly.</p> ID <p>This element helps to identify a particular object or credential and is unique for every VC. Since this ID doesn’t change, it can be used across devices and platforms to represent the thing. This element can take only one&nbsp;value.</p> Type <p>Type is a mandatory field that identifies whether the rest of the JSON code is a verifiable credential or not. Also, it must mention what kind of a credential it is, such as a passport, university degree, driver’s license, and&nbsp;more.</p> Issuer <p>The issuer is the entity issuing the credential and along with the holder and verifier, it forms what’s called a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>.</p> Credential Subject <p>This is the core part of the VC and describes the VC itself. It talks about the holder and can have many properties such as id, name of the attribute, its value, etc. There is no defined format for this part of the VC as it depends largely on the VC&nbsp;type.</p><p>For example, if the VC is a university degree, its attributes would be the name of the university, the degree of the holder, year of passing, etc. On the other hand, if the VC is the holder’s passport, it will contain information such as first name, last name, address, date of birth,&nbsp;etc.</p> Proof <p>This is the last element of a VC and is a mandatory one as it contains the digital signature of the issuer. This is the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">cryptographic part</a> that authenticates the rest of the information in the VC, and this is the attribute that makes the VC tamper-proof and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>You can explore different VC types with <a href="https://schema.affinidi.com/">Affinidi’s Schema&nbsp;Manager</a>.</p><p>Also, visit the <a href="https://build.affinidi.com/">Dev Portal</a> to learn more about SSI and VC, and how you can leverage our tech stack to generate and issue VCs and to build SSI-based apps.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/an-in-depth-exploration-of-self-sovereign-identity-and-verifiable-credentials-1a3eb2296004">An In-Depth Exploration of Self-Sovereign Identity and Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This enables eligibility in upcoming Funding Rounds. Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p><p>Funding Tiers</p><p>To continue incentivizing completion and outcomes we are continuing Funding Tiers, which can be achieved by Teams delivering on their grant promises.</p><p>The funding tiers&nbsp;are:</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>4. Veteran&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $35,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 5 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>Above are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects for OceanDAO Grants Round 13. The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  24,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  12,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  134,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>A total of 200K OCEAN is available.</p><p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core Tech Working Group</a> has prioritized these this core tech, integrations, or applications. Items on the list for a round have a special earmark in that grants round. Here are some&nbsp;items:</p>  Enhance Ocean’s Fine-Grained Permissions to support <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (vs. just Ethereum addresses) in allowlist and&nbsp;denylist  First-class integration with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSockets</a> as a data&nbsp;service.  First-class integration plus community engagement with data science tech communities like <a href="https://huggingface.co/">HuggingFace</a>, <a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/">eLeuther</a>, <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fastAI</a>, <a href="https://www.openmined.org/">OpenMined</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">Scikit-learn</a>, <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>, <a href="https://www.openml.org/">OpenML</a>,&nbsp;Kaggle.  Build comments &amp; ratings into Ocean&nbsp;Market  Decentralized social media. E.g. email, messaging, twitter-like, FB-like.  <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Round-13-Tech-Earmarks">This wiki page</a> has a full list, and details of each&nbsp;item.</p><p>If you would like to influence lists for future rounds, then please come join the Core Tech WG. <a href="https://discord.gg/dJU7x76f">Here’s the&nbsp;discord.</a></p><p>Unleash Data&nbsp;Category</p><p>In Round 13 we have revised the Unleash Data Category to have the same rules as the rest of the Funding Categories. They can qualify again for funding up to 35,000 OCEAN conditional that Unleash Data projects:</p>  “Unleash data” has actually always had a broad intent, towards driving Data Consume Volume. It is intended for projects like: becoming a data broker to get data owners’ data into Ocean Market, networking / “hitting the phones” to increase consumption on Ocean Market, integrating Filecoin &amp; publishing data on Ocean Market, etc. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#3-unleash-data">Here are further examples</a>. It was never meant to be solely for constructing / maintaining a small number of datasets.  Whatever is proposed should be high value-add to the Ocean ecosystem.  Example of poor value-add: requesting a lot of OCEAN to construct / maintain a small number of datasets to sell with expectation of profit. We expect and encourage OceanDAO voters to downvote such proposals.  <p>Burning becomes Recycling</p><p>Starting Round 13, any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the Treasury.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">For intuition on how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>Funding Rules</p><p>Starting in R13, burning and earmark rules have been updated. Burning has been disabled, remaining funds in Earmarks are made available in General Category, and any final remaining funds are returned to the treasury. You can find all the steps&nbsp;below:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  Any remaining funds inside an Earmark, are then moved towards [General&nbsp;Grants]  [New &amp; Core Tech] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Categories].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds inside the [General Grants] Category are moved back to the treasury.  <p>Voting &amp; Ballot&nbsp;Design</p><p>We have continued with the use of Weighted Ballots which has improving voter representation. In this model, OCEAN can only be used once to support or downvote projects.</p><p>This will continue to be the voting method until Quadratic Voting is released. For further information on Single Ballot and Weighted Ballots, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Voting">please visit our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>Working Groups &amp;&nbsp;Stewards</p><p>Head to the <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> and dive into each Working Group. There you will find each Working Group’s respective documents, stewards, members list, meeting times, and&nbsp;more:</p>  Project Guiding Working&nbsp;Group  Parameters &amp; Roadmap Working&nbsp;Group  Core Tech Working&nbsp;Group  OceanDAO Engineering Working&nbsp;Group  Data Consume Volume Working&nbsp;Group  <p>Working Group&nbsp;Legos</p>  Each Working Group has its own public discord sub-channel. Then, each Working Group can leverage real-time discord channels (voice/video).  Each Working Group has its own membership + working&nbsp;process.  Each Working Group has a weekly or bi-weekly call.  Each Working Group has Stewards (who’s accountable to run the group), and Members (people who participate and contribute).  <p>Town Hall</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Town-Hall">Town Hall</a> has been running weekly since the beginning of OceanDAO. Currently the DAO is expanding and with this growth so will the Town&nbsp;Hall.</p><p>Town Hall will be a structured presentation and expand its scope to include the entire Ocean Ecosystem where each Working Group presents slides on their current progress and&nbsp;updates</p><p>Deadlines</p>  Proposals Submission Deadline is January 4th at midnight&nbsp;GMT.

<p>One reason the UK Government wants to abolish citizens’ rights to data protection is to create conditions for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to blossom. This, it says, will “bring incredible benefits to our lives”. This third blog in our series prompted by the Government’s proposed reforms (‘Data: A New Direction’) examines the flaws in the Government’s arguments.</p>  You need lots of data to ‘do’ AI. But it doesn’t have to be personal data. It can, and should, be anonymised data. So there is no need to reform data protection law to promote AI’s potential.  Most of the hopes (and fears) pinned on AI, along with many of its mis-uses and abuses, stem from a basic misconception about what AI is. AI does not replicate or substitute for human intelligence. Calculation is not the same as perception. Computation is not the same as intelligence. The real power of AI comes from its ability to do things that humans can’t do, rather than replace what they can do. Unfortunately, the Government is compounding the misconceptions.  <p>We think AI has great potential&nbsp;… to do what it is good at. But in perpetuating misconceptions about AI, the Government risks compounding the damage done by mis-applications of AI’s potential while distorting policy decisions (including those relating to data protection law and investment priorities). This blog examines these misconceptions.</p> AI and personal&nbsp;data <p>The Government is proposing to abolish citizens’ rights to data protection in all but name. Its main justification for doing so is the “incredible” benefits it believes AI will bring. But it does not need to ‘reform’ data protection law to realise these benefits.</p><p>Many AI-based services such as driverless cars or automated online translation services don’t need any personal data at all. Others, like facial and voice recognition, may generate new personal data about the person whose face or voice it is but they don’t actually need personal data to work. Yes, they need huge amounts of data to identify the patterns needed for recognition. But they don’t need to know whose faces or voices they are: they need anonymised data, not personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Many other AI-based services such as medical diagnoses or predictive modelling also need huge amounts of data to generate their insights and predictions and often this data starts out as personal data (e.g. about identifiable people). But again, AI does not need to know who these people are to work. The data can and should be anonymised.</p><p>Of course, there are many technical questions relating to how data should be anonymised. Can it be easily de-anonymised, for example? But this doesn’t alter the underlying fact: these applications don’t need personal data to work, so rules about the collection and use of personal data aren’t relevant to it and shouldn’t be allowed to be made relevant by using personal data when they shouldn’t.</p><p>The only time when personal data does become important is if an organisation acts on the outcomes of AI’s number crunching when dealing with an identifiable individual. But this has got nothing to do with AI itself. This is about service provision, when normal rules and safeguards relating to the use of personal data in service provision should&nbsp;apply.</p><p>In short, the Government’s proposals for data protection reforms as they relate to AI are without foundation.</p> Misunderstanding AI <p>Unfortunately, there’s more: the Government’s proposals are based on a definition of AI that is confused, at least partially wrong and potentially highly damaging.</p><p>Here is how its ‘Data: A New Direction’ paper defines artificial intelligence.</p><blockquote>“The use of digital technology to create systems capable of performing tasks commonly thought to require intelligence. AI is constantly evolving, but generally it involves machines using statistics to find patterns in large amounts of data, and the ability to perform repetitive tasks with data without the need for constant human guidance.” [Paragraph 63&nbsp;(a)]</blockquote><p>This definition has three parts. The middle part — “using statistics to find patterns in large amounts of data” — is spot on. The third part — “performing repetitive tasks with data without the need for constant human guidance “— is simply wrong. That’s what all computer software does. Automation and AI are not the same thing, and to suggest they are is a fundamental misunderstanding.</p><p>But the real dangers lie in the first part: the implication that AI is replicating human intelligence, which it is&nbsp;not.</p><p>It’s true: AI can be trained (with great difficulty) to do some things (like recognise faces) that we commonly associate with human intelligence. But AI doesn’t undertake these tasks in the same ways as humans (calculation is not the same as perception), and it can only do a very small proportion of the things that human intelligence can&nbsp;do.</p><p>In fact, far from being different versions of the same thing, AI and human intelligence are near opposites. AI is really good at doing some things that human beings are really bad at (such as using statistics to find patterns in large amounts of data, which is what makes it powerful and useful). But it is terrible at performing most of the “tasks commonly thought to require [human] intelligence”.</p><p>Promoting AI in the hope that it can become a substitute for human intelligence is a recipe for disaster. Many of its errors and abuses stem from this mistake. Unfortunately, the misconceptions on which this mistake is based are now extremely common — which is why we take time out in this blog to explore&nbsp;them.</p><p>AI finds it really difficult to ‘see’ things which we humans see instantly and automatically This is called the ‘bundling problem’. When we see a cup of tea on a saucer with a spoon on the side, that’s what we ‘see’: a cup of tea on a saucer with a spoon on the&nbsp;side.</p><p>AI doesn’t see anything of the sort. It ‘sees’ a jumble of thousands of different pixels represented by different data points. A complete blur. (To see what AI ‘sees’ when looking at a picture of a panda, take a look <a href="https://medium.com/@ml.at.berkeley/tricking-neural-networks-create-your-own-adversarial-examples-a61eb7620fd8">at this article</a>.)</p><p>To see anything in this blur, AI has to do an enormous amount of computation, comparing one data point to another. It takes an immense amount of effort and training for AI even to ‘see’ an ‘edge’ (because that implies it can see some ‘thing’ which has an edge that separates it out from other ‘things’).</p><p>It’s almost impossibly difficult for it to understand that the spoon and the saucer are different things to ‘the cup’. This is because, to it, they are all part of the same bundle of data points and it has no reason to unbundle them with no logical basis for doing so. Also, it does not have any ‘history’ or experience outside of what it has been fed by AI engineers or has already computed. It does not have the cultural or experiential history to understand the concepts ‘cup’, ‘saucer’ or ‘spoon’. We humans can do these things so quickly, automatically and effortlessly that we don’t even realise we are doing them. This is testimony to billions of years of evolutionary history — which AI does not&nbsp;have.</p><p>AI does not have ‘general’ intelligence Much has been made recently about AI’s ability to ‘learn’ using things like neural networks. These feats are indeed impressive. But they are tightly constrained, because AI cannot apply what it has learned in one task to another. When Google’s Deep Mind project announced that its AI could beat a human expert at the game of Go it provoked a flurry of excited speculation. What next? But Google’s AlphaGo only works on a board of 19 x 19 squares. If it is asked to work on a board of 18 x 18 it is stumped, having to start all over again. It cannot ‘apply’ what it has learned from one board to another, never mind from one complex situation to&nbsp;another.</p><p>This is no real problem for humans whose evolutionary survival rests on the flexibility and adaptability that the ability to apply lessons ‘learned’ from one experience to another brings. An ability that AI doesn’t&nbsp;have.</p><p>AI cannot use analogy or metaphor Humans are instinctively able to see likenesses in things that are very different, and use this capability to aid their understanding. If I say “March came in like a lion and went out like a lamb”, you instinctively understand the implied references to ‘roaring’ and ‘fierceness’ as opposed to ‘gentleness’. For AI, this is a massive barrier. Because AI doesn’t work in the currency of concepts, only in correlations between data points, it cannot use analogy and metaphor to&nbsp;reason.</p><p>AI cannot imagine or create Humans don’t only think about what is. They also think about what is not but could be. They use these imaginings to better understand their current situation and to see ways to change it. Because AI can only work with the data it has been fed with (it cannot crunch data it hasn’t got) it cannot imagine what could&nbsp;be.</p><p>It is indeed possible for AI to give the impression that it is being ‘creative’ by acting on an instruction to generate new, random combinations of data. This can be useful. But it is mimicking the outputs of imagination, not recreating the processes behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>AI cannot distinguish between correlation and cause and effect Humans instinctively reason by linking causes to effects (to the point when often they see causes or effects that aren’t actually there). But AI, which has no experience of living in a world where ‘causes’ have ‘effects’, can only identify correlations. (And, by the way, the bigger the data set, the more ‘correlations’ it will identify, most of which will be meaningless).</p><p>AI cannot ‘level jump’ AI cannot stop to think. It cannot ‘step outside’ of what it has been programmed to do to ask: “hang on, am I asking the right question?”, or “hold on, does this really make&nbsp;sense?”.</p><p>This is what makes ‘adversarial examples’ so dangerous in AI training. Adversarial examples can happen when someone changes just one pixel in a series of images to interfere with the correlations that are being computed. If one pixel is changed in a picture, humans see the same picture. But AI might see something entirely different: a computer instead of a cat; <a href="https://medium.com/@ml.at.berkeley/tricking-neural-networks-create-your-own-adversarial-examples-a61eb7620fd8">a gibbon instead of a panda</a>. Crucially, AI has no way of knowing that it is making this mistake and carries on regardless — which can be incredibly dangerous.</p><p>AI cannot switch attention to something more important AI cannot stop to think “hold on, should I really be focusing on this right now? Shouldn’t I be doing X instead?” Because AI doesn’t understand concepts (and has to be trained through millions of trials and errors to even ‘see’ a cat), and because it can only see correlations but not their relative significance, it cannot understand that one task may be more important than another — or even be aware that another, different task may exist. (It may be trained by human beings to allocate scores to things within a task, but it cannot make judgements as to the value or importance of different tasks.)</p><p>AI cannot sense or respond to anything outside of the data sets it is provided with Humans have multiple different senses which are ‘always on’ — such as sight, sound, smell, touch, taste and so on. Our brains are monitoring our environments all the time to see if anything ‘out there’ needs paying attention to. If there isn’t, our brains relegate this vast inflow of information (billions of bits a second) to the unconscious so we can focus our attention on the task at hand. Psychologists are still at a loss as to how we process multiple incommensurate senses (such as sight plus sound) to create single experiences.</p><p>This ability to sense a background environment, to make constant judgements as to its significance, and to switch attention to another task is way beyond AI. Instead, for AI to work its wonders, it has to be fed with huge amounts of data by human beings, separately, task by task — by human beings who choose what data to feed it with, and who pre-empt the calculations that AI can make in doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>AI does not have an experiental ‘history’ to draw upon like humans do. Take that cup of tea, for example. We humans know that if we turn a cup of tea upside down, the tea will pour onto the floor. AI doesn’t know this because it has never experienced gravity — a piece of knowledge that we humans simply take for&nbsp;granted.</p><p>But, you might say, AI personal assistants such as Siri and Alexa are ‘always on’, listening for the words that will ‘wake them up’. But that confirms the key point: they have been carefully trained to do this one, small, particular task.</p><p>It’s testimony to the brilliance of AI engineers that they have managed to create driverless cars. But no piece of AI has the ability to decide that the car should change its destination, on the basis of new, external information (say that a friend has just been taken ill). It needs a human being to tell it to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>AI cannot feel emotions and or display human empathy It goes without saying that, as a machine, AI does not have emotions. It cannot feel pleased, excited, or hurt. It cannot use such information to modulate its&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Ai cannot use norms or values to assess situations or decisions As a piece of software, AI is not like a human being who is embedded within a society and culture and acutely aware of the norms or values by which this culture operates. For this reason, AI cannot make human decisions which are always, to some degree or other, value judgements. It can only make logical decisions, based on criteria programmed into it by human&nbsp;beings.</p><p>But ‘Ah!’ you might say, feeling emotions or making value judgements have got nothing to do with how a piece of computer software goes about its business. But that is precisely the point. Real life human intelligence is embedded within and awash with emotional impacts and ethical and moral judgements. They are an essential part of how humans make decisions about what to do and what not to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Indeed, when humans put their intelligence to work, much of the information they are dealing with is about other people’s actions, intentions, attitudes, beliefs, motivations, concerns and so on. Human intelligence is recursive (‘I know that you know’), not linear; social, not abstractly logical. As soon as the task at hand requires any assessment of any of such human factors, AI systems are at a&nbsp;loss.</p><p>AI can only solve a tiny proportion of the problems human intelligence has to deal with AI works by making calculations, which means it can only find solutions to questions that can be computed. But a surprisingly small proportion of real world problems are actually computable.</p><p>AI can only work with problems that are ‘algorithmically compressible’. That is, with problems that can be finally and completely solved by a finite series of logical ‘if-then’ questions. But the majority of the most important issues that humans have to apply their intelligence to are not ‘algorithmically compressible’: they do not have a definite answer that can be calculated. They involve judgement.</p><p>In fact, for AI to be able to come up with its clever answers, the questions it is asked and the ways of addressing them must display key criteria that makes them calculable: e.g. with a clearly defined goal, a clear end point for the calculation, and a clearly defined way of getting there. That’s why AI promoters use games like chess and Go to sell their&nbsp;wares.</p><p>Yet many of the issues taxing human intelligence have neither clear goals, nor clear end points, nor clear rules for reaching them. They are ‘wicked’ ‘infinite’ (i.e. forever unfolding) problems where, for example, it’s not actually clear whether we are asking the right question in the first place, whether we can rely on the information we’ve got, where the people involved have different perceptions, motives and goals, and where the ‘rules of the game’ may suddenly change half way through. AI cannot answer the question “what is the best way to implement AI?” because this is a ‘wicked’ problem, not a computable one.</p> Artificial stupidity? <p>For hundreds of years, in their quest for immortality Chinese alchemists sought to perfect the art of embalming — because, they believed, the closer they got to mimicking the appearance of life they closer they were getting to life itself. Today, AI is being used in many clever ways to mimic the appearance of human intelligence. But that doesn’t mean it is intelligent. It is as close to intelligence as embalming is to&nbsp;life.</p><p>If we put all the limitations discussed above together, AI is actually quite stupid. When it comes to things like understanding common sense (meaning, significance, cause and effect), social relationships, or the physics of gravity it is much less intelligent than a toddler (or <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-does-it-mean-for-ai-to-understand-20211216/">what some AI researchers call infant metaphysics</a>), which is why it makes so many awful mistakes.</p><p>The fact that it is now common practice to equate AI with human intelligence, as the Government does in its proposals, does not mean these claims are right. It simply means many people are repeating a mistaken conventional wisdom, just as centuries ago millions of people sincerely believed they were at risk of harm perpetrated by witches’ use of black&nbsp;magic.</p><p>Fact is, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ is not a description. It’s a marketing slogan designed to sell a product. After all, would people talk about AI in hushed tones of awe if it was simply called ‘large scale number crunching’ or ‘Artificial Stupidity’ (which it often&nbsp;is)?</p><p>Don’t get us wrong. We like AI for what it can do. As a means of deploying clever statistical methods to find patterns in large quantities of data, AI can be extremely useful in tackling a wide range of tasks. We at Mydex are embracing AI to help individuals make better decisions and manage their lives better. But we like it for what it can do, not for what it&nbsp;can’t.</p><p>The AI hype we see today is more of a sociological phenomenon than a technological one — similar to the railway mania that gripped Britain in the 1840s. At that time, this awe-inspiring new technology seemed to promise spectacular social and economic opportunities — and financial returns. Soon, every hairbrained venture with the word ‘railway’ in it was attracting huge amounts of money, only for thousands to lose their fortunes when the bust came. The same is happening now, except that the trigger word is ‘AI’ rather than ‘railway’.</p><p>AI mania is dangerous. Precious time and money are being squandered on inflated dreams and expectations. Vested interests stoking the bandwagon for their own purposes. People are using AI to make bad decisions. And policy is being distorted to fit the hype (e.g. dreams of unprecedented <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">‘innovation and growth’</a>), not the&nbsp;reality.</p><p>That is what the UK Government is doing now, with its proposal to abolish the existing citizen right to object to automated processing of their data “if this processing significantly affects them”. Which raises the issue of consent: the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is Data Valuable?</a> Exposes misconceptions about the value of data, and therefore where its biggest economic potential lies.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">Five Myths about Data, Innovation and Growth</a> Explains why the Government’s claims that its ‘reforms’ will promote innovation and growth are without foundation.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">AI: The Emperor’s New Clothes?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and welcome to a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity and the focus of today, this conversation, is going to be about trust frameworks. For that we have an amazing guest who knows a lot about this, who is Titi Akinsanmi.</p>
<p>She is a Public Policy thought leader on the digital economy focused on shaping an enabling environment for innovation. A thought leader, coach and mentor, Titi has served as a Berkman Klein Fellow, the Faculty of Law at Harvard University from 2018 to 2020; an advisory and a steering committee Board member at GoodID, with the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on the Digital Economy and on the strategy and advisory team on Digital Identity.</p>

She is the Global Policy team lead for Google Assistant and Hardware and having previously led the cluster for the global tech giant as the Government Affairs and Public Policy Lead for West &amp; Francophone Africa.</p>
<p>She is a Mama of three and a wifey to one. Hello Titi.</p>
<p>Titi Akinsanmi: Hello.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very welcome. It’s nice having you. It’s a pleasure.</p>
<p>Titi: Thank you very much. Thank you for having me. It’s a real pleasure to be able to join this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent, Titi. So let’s talk about digital identity. I would like to hear more, a bit more about you. So please tell us about yourself and what was your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Titi: Thank you very much again. Telling about my journey in itself is a podcast I think. But the short, short, short version of it is this. I recall that in my final year of university, of my very first degree, my very first university degree, I was in a situation where I realised that yes, I was graduating with a first degree. But I had absolutely no idea how to use technology or navigate the world using technology. At least not at the level I thought I needed to be able to do it.</p>
<p>That fuelled a passion in me to one, build up my capacity. When building up my capacity, it became even more obvious that there were a whole lot more people like me who didn’t have the right technical skills and yes, there were a lot more people who didn’t have the right technical skills but there was an endless array of end users who had absolutely no idea around what technology could – you know, the difference technology could make in their life. But more so that there where governments in place that were approaching the adoption, deployment and growth of technology without having the right regulatory environment in place that ensured the user was consistently in the middle of it.</p>
<p>So that’s well quite a bit of work. I ended up in the policy space, the public policy space, the regulatory space, whichever label you want to put on it. And increasingly I began to see for me that you as a user, because of the “non-geographical nature” of the internet and I say that with a caveat. I can hear the technical folks going, “What do you mean it’s non-geographical?”</p>
<p>You could literally adopt a variety of persona, a variety of identities and, you know, concurrent with that was an increase in shift or growth in the use of new technologies that more or less was pulling the world as we used to know it into the digital space. So there was increasing measures around securing your existing personal information, increasing measures around being able to port your data, your personal data so to say, as well as there are human beings who are deciding I’m going to be X, Y, Z in this space but I will be X, Y, Z in that space.</p>
<p>That for me is at the core of all the conversations around data, around privacy. It’s the end user and into the digital space and what they choose to adopt and use it for.</p>
<p>So to some extent, if you are asking, “OK. Tell me about yourself,” I’m a policy wonk. Everything I do resonates and returns to the place of putting in the right structures whether they be policies, regulations, laws, legislations. Find whatever label you want to find for it but ensuring that the digital world cannot just grow and continue to innovate. But that the end user, the consumer, the human being, at least for now, the human being behind it or making use of it does not get lost.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. I think it’s super interesting that even though I think you didn’t study technology, right? But you graduated and you had this interest about knowing more on technology and having this edge. You know, an interest for the ultimate use of end user. So …</p>
<p>Titi: Yes, absolutely. My first degree that I was referencing is not even in technology at all. My first degree is in English, English language with two minors in French and literature. So you can imagine the kind of educational system I was in where yes, I was getting this first degree and I could do amazing things with it. But nobody had thought it was important for me to be equipped, right, with the technological skills that will enable me or create in the years post Y2K and I’m dating myself by saying Y2K.</p>
<p>But that gives you some context. But part of what I did, I am an entrepreneur also. Yes, policy wonk first but I – I’m a Nigerian by birth. So I have the hustle spirit in me.</p>
<p>When that incident happened, kind of what I did was deliberately brought my skills to bear. I made a snack that is very ubiquitous across West Africa – chin chin. I sold those to a plethora of people and I sent myself to evening computer school, which was my first foray formally, post high school where you had to take computer science as part of your course.</p>
<p>So I spent the next what – plus or minus about 18 months in the evenings while working during the day, learning everything I could about the computer – from computer language all the way through to how to be a good hacker, all the way through to the many uses of it. It was in this process that I got connected to what was the World Summit on the Information Society and I actually then led that process from a youth angle and ensured that while policies were being written at the UN level, they were not leaving out – they actually had been. But then they were not leaving out young people who are actually at the forefront of innovating with technology and adopting it and making use of it. Then that’s what has led more or less to this space now.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, I can see. It’s also entrepreneurial from the very beginning of your professional career.</p>
<p>Titi: Oh, yes. It’s a very deliberate choice. I grew up in an environment with parents, and I’m appreciative of this, they were perfectly imperfect – that consistently demonstrated to us that yes, have an education. But more importantly, and this is the way it’s put in my culture, have skillsets that you can make use of your hands, make use of your physical being, right? To be able to deliver and make sure you can earn and that has paid off for me. So if for any reason this policy side does not really work, I can open up a hair salon. I’d do great with that or I can actually open up a restaurant. I cook great African food.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow. You have a lot of backups for career.</p>
<p>Titi: Oh, yes. I do.</p>
<p>Oscar: And I’m sure you would enjoy that.</p>
<p>Titi: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: The way I hear you.</p>
<p>Titi: Don’t worry. When we do eventually meet in person, I owe you a meal.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow.</p>
<p>Titi: Invite me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you very much. Fantastic. Well, fast forward to these times, I know now you are based in Canada and you work with different global initiatives and a lot of it is related to the trust frameworks. So – and these trust frameworks are being developed across the world. So tell us a bit of some insights into what you are seeing right now in terms of trust frameworks.</p>
<p>Titi: I will start by saying this, right, that digital identity has “become increasingly mainstream” over the last what – plus or minus seven years. The conversation has moved away from purely technical spaces or policy-oriented spaces to featuring more in day-to-day conversations and that has meant that there is a plethora of – what do we call it? Digital identity systems that have been developed from Australia to Canada to Sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa, Nigeria, all the way through to Estonia as well.</p>
<p>There have been leaders at the governments or even industries that have developed trust frameworks that enable digital identity. But not all of them have always come from the point of entrenching trust, right, in the digital economy. But before I go here, first, I can hear the listeners going, “OK. So what are you talking about first? What is digital identity? What is a trust framework?”</p>
<p>Digital identity is a set of potentially credentials, things that can be presented in the digital space that helps confirm that you are who you are. So in light of that very simplistic definition, right, we’ve only got so many minutes, a trust framework typically describes a set of auditable, technical or even legal rules that apply to the identification, authentication and authorisation of accessing resources across organisations or across a network, right?</p>
<p>So that such a framework then enables that these systems and the services that they offer can be trusted and ultimately mass adopted, and that’s on the side of those offering particular services.</p>
<p>On the side of the end user, trust frameworks are in place to be able to verify, authenticate that you are who you say you are when you want to access those services. So I will talk real quick around the kind of trust frameworks that we are finding in general, starting with my current home here in Canada.</p>
<p>There’s the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework which is very user-centric in the kind of requirements it has, choosing choice, control. All of it yield on the notion of privacy by design, right? A deliberate inclusion in the design of technology that is privacy focused. Privacy first so to say, which is a foundational element for anything that you’re doing on the platform.</p>
<p>If you look at the PCTF website, that’s the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework website. It says it’s designed for it to be suitable for digital identification, authentication, credential, online credential, authorisation systems, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera and they have put it in place to be used by government entities, citizens or business partners.</p>
<p>So that’s for Canada and I will be very deliberate about not mentioning the likes of the US which has digital identity guidelines and the Federation and Assertions framework, which you can refer. I’m being very deliberate about speaking to other spaces that are not seen as digitally dominant in the digital economy space, right?</p>
<p>We also have the European Union which historically included the UK but, you know, we’re talking Brexit this morning and the EU has what it calls the eIDAS, the electronic identification, authentication and trust services regulation, which has been put in place particularly to regulate electronic signatures, transactions and embeds the processes that provide a safe way for users to conduct business online.</p>
<p>I do know that it was June this year. I believe it was the third of June particularly that they proposed a trusted and secure digital identity which will allow all EU citizens, residents and businesses to be able to link their national digital identities with proof of other personal attributes. So think of your driver’s license, bank accounts, and also be able to access services online without having to use private identification methods or even necessarily sharing any extra personal data.</p>
<p>This is one of the things I’m really gung-ho about when it comes to digital identity and the trust frameworks, is the ability for those who are on the design end of things to put in place technology that then means that I as an end user can pick and choose what credential I’m sharing at any point in time.</p>
<p>The UK has developed its own digital identity and attributes trust framework. Australia has a really advanced one, the trust and digital identity framework. So those are a few that are in place. There are two or maybe three parts of the world I haven’t really spoken to. But there are – so think Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. What’s happening in these spaces around digital identity?</p>
<p>Digital identity is very much at the core of a lot of the adoption of technology that’s happening, a lot of the start-up ecosystem for example that we’re seeing emerge out of Africa. The fintech space is very much built on being able to have what I have defined as the technology behind authentication, verification, access of service, etc.</p>
<p>However, they have not necessarily framed it as, oh, we have a trust framework in place. But the critical elements are being put in place and that for me is really heartening and maybe we will get to it a bit later around being able to ensure interoperability and all of that.</p>
<p>But so far, lots of identity registries have been set up in Sub-Saharan African, which is my heritage where I am from. I always say that I’m a Nigerian by birth but an African by choice and global citizen. Then in Latin America as well because this is central to a lot of the “solutions” that are in place and of course there are flags around from the privacy folks which includes myself, around if we have this ubiquitous collection of data, digital identity, what does it mean for privacy. But I will hand it back to you and let’s take the conversation forward.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. It’s interesting to- You have mentioned particularly some countries there but let’s say more advanced than others but you also have said that in other countries, the governments don’t mention the words, “this is a trust framework” but there are the elements of that.</p>
<p>What about most of the trust frameworks are seen in a – maybe with exception of the European Union, most of them are just one country. One country completes the project. So now that we are in a time when there’s a lot of business across borders, how will these trust frameworks interact with each other?</p>
<p>Titi: OK. So I will start from this. I’m putting on my Canadian hat now. Yes, the European Union is not one country. But if you look at Canada, for example, which is a provincial system of governance, the provinces actually operate relatively independent of each other, right? If you dig deep, Ontario has its own work ongoing around digital identity, as does the British Columbia, and these are all provinces within Canada. So in as much as you know one is a collection of countries, the approaches being taken in Canada is very similar to what’s being done in Europe, in that these are independent governance structures coming together and actually looking to put in place an interoperable trust infrastructure that backs all of the digital identity being put in place.</p>
<p>The same in Sub-Saharan Africa, the approach is riding off of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, the digital aspect of it, to ensure that there’s actually interoperability to put the structures, the legal structures in place to ensure that there’s interoperability, even with the basic identity document that you need to be able to carry to move around across the continent.</p>
<p>So, how would they be able to operate so to say? This is where it is important that conversations are not happening in silos, right? And there are trust frameworks that are being put in place reflective of a common agreement. And this is where the question mark is. I know 2020 has been what it is, but part of the proposals that had been put on the table was that there needed to be more conversations, particularly around what you would call the G20 countries, around digital identity, and the tenants that were being put in place that would ensure that if I have a set of verifiable credentials coming out of the EU, they should be presentable when I come to North America. And the same if I come from Sub-Saharan Africa, or even North Africa, I can present it in Asia.</p>
<p>Now if you allow me, I’ll take a quick pause and say that this would have gone a bit slower. But one of, and this is not in any way good or a sign of that the pandemic has been great, but one of the things the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic, has forced us to do is not just sit as individual countries and figure out how you can ensure people are safe and steady while not violating their privacy rights, but also for us as humans on this earth to interact and connect a whole lot more.</p>
<p>So borders are finally opening. And as part of that process, I can take my vaccination certification, right, whether it’s a QR code, or you know, it’s just a PDF document, and I can actually present that in other spaces in other countries. And I’m able to- you know, it’s verifiable, because a set of standards have been agreed. And there’s a saying that there’s nothing new under the sun, right?</p>
<p>And it’s not that this has not been done before. I’ll give you an example particularly around the “contentious” vaccinations certifications, or proof of vaccination. As a West African, as a Nigerian by birth, all my traveling life, which now is almost going to 30 years, I have had to carry with me something called a yellow card, a yellow fever card that actually shows my vaccination history, right, helps identify that I am free of yellow fever, right? And I have had to present this for me to be able to either apply for visas, or even get into certain countries, not just on the African continent, but in Europe, in the US, et cetera. Now, that has been put in place. That is a form of physical identity that I believe precedes what we now see with the COVID vaccination. And that’s on the one hand of digital identity.</p>
<p>On the technical side is the ability to be able to connect with particular services, right? If you’re thinking, OK, I want to be able to access XYZ service being offered, or I want to be able to access on the organisational side XYZ users’ data. The ability to be able to then verify this is very much dependent on a set of standards, right, and a common framework that enables interoperability, right? And that can be a really tough call, because, you know, the interpretations around trust really differs across borders.</p>
<p>So yeah, to finalise, I must say that any institution that’s looking at any institution, or even the end user, and you’ll notice I’m speaking a lot from the perspective of the end user, because again, I don’t want us to lose the conversation around trust frameworks, just around the infrastructure, the digital infrastructure that needs to be in place. It’s that for any institution, you know, there are predictions that by 2023, any organisation that wants to be able to instil digital trust and wants to participate at the very least a 15% more ecosystem will need to sign up in one way or the other to a digital trust framework. But I do think the technology is in place, we just need to be able to agree.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. I think with the examples you have you have mentioned, yes, technology, most of technology is available already. It’s a matter of agreeing between the trust framework between the countries. Something else I would like to – jumping a bit off topic but something I like to hear from you is, as you work closely with data privacy, you have mentioned a few times, and now you are sitting on the board on the Good ID please tell us, tell us more what is Good ID and yeah, how is it spreading the word about this project?</p>
<p>Titi: Yes, I must say, I will start from when I first got the call Oscar that when I was told, you know, “Would you please join the advisory board for Good ID?” The first question I had for them is what do you mean by Good ID? How do you define Good ID? Good ID in one context could be terrible ID in another context, right? But you know it was a good way to step forward. And I will tell you this is why I am open and consistent about supporting and continue to be a part of Good ID.</p>
<p>It is, at the very core of it, best practice with respect to identity management, which promotes the principle of privacy and security. So it’s a practice, it is a movement, a series of conversations, a series of standard setting that pushes for the centrality of privacy and security, either on the infrastructure building side, the digital infrastructure building side, on the end user side, or on the governance side, whether the governance from government or from elsewhere.</p>
<p>GoodID is a valuable identity management approach that allows everyone without restrictions to not just participate, but to play an important role in their own identity management. And I think it’s important to emphasise that each one is able to play an important role, a critical role in their own identity management. So you can think of the gamut of being able to fully grasp as an end user, what digital identity is, and how you can manage it as an end user all the way through to the one who is looking to innovate, to provide some services at any of the parts of digital identity for them to have a full understanding of how they can participate.</p>
<p>GoodID uses the principles of inclusion, transparency, and accountability in entrenching public trust in ID management. And some would ask, “Why is this necessary?” Because you know, there has been the biggest fear is that Nineteen Eighty-four by George Orwell will come to pass, meaning Big Brother will constantly be able to control. Some would say that’s already in place. But I would argue that actually it’s not in place, where we have the biggest concern is that we don’t have enough people who care enough to make informed choices. Most people just want to be able to get along with it, just get it done, right?</p>
<p>So that’s what GoodID is. It’s been around for about three, maybe slightly, like three-and-a-half, four years now. And it’s at a phase right now where we are looking to be able to grow further knowledge on the folks who are doing great work around GoodID. But more importantly, also [unknown] around the adoption of laws that enable digital ID across board. And also, just promoting those who are doing great work in terms of organisations or even individuals.</p>
<p>Oscar: As you said, part of this is educating end users how to take control of their good practices of their identity, whichever tools services are using today. And then it goes to, for instance, helping how to design, how to design application services based on data privacy, correct?</p>
<p>Titi: Yes, correct. And all of this is informed by the fact that, you know, context always differs, such that, the design and the development of one technology is not ubiquitous for the entirety of the world, but that adoption and adaptation would need to happen across different spaces. And that’s part of what makes the conversation really tough around the adoption of a trust framework, right, on digital identity. But because it’s tough does not mean it’s not doable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Like with trust frameworks, every country has different reality in terms of the services, both public and private. So it’s… Yeah.</p>
<p>Titi: Yeah, it certainly does. It certainly does. And you know, for those who have an interest I would say that they should go spend a bit more time, just walking through what the Pan-Canadian trust framework speaks to as well as the Australian model, I think those are really interesting models that could be potentially adaptable across various economic environments. Nothing against the eIDAS actually, but it can be quite onerous. That’s the EU trust framework.</p>
<p>Oscar: And GoodID – where is it operating the most nowadays? I guess the idea is to be global, correct? But right now where it has more presence?</p>
<p>Titi: Oh, GoodID is definitely global. You cannot go to a particular office and identify “Oh, this is where GoodID is.” And that’s why I said it’s also a movement. And one of the things I’m really appreciative of is that we’ve had the privilege of being able to curate conversations and influence conversations across the world. So you know, you will find GoodID, if you go to the <a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/">website GoodID</a>, you will find conversations, you will find articles. You will find resources for Asia, for Sub Saharan Africa, for Europe and for North America, and also for Latin America.</p>
<p>And that’s one of the things that I think demonstrates the need for us to be able to take this conversation and not just have it amongst ourselves, but also help guide those who make the laws, right? I mean, as much as the private sector or even the civil society can be at the forefront of conversations, if we don’t have the requisite laws and regulations in place, or the institutions that are tasked with guarding this, you know, we’re still all just having a conversation and operating outside “the law”. So yeah, you will find GoodID online, you will find GoodID everywhere.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Just one more thing about trust frameworks, how important are the trust frameworks to ensure data privacy?</p>
<p>Titi: Right. That’s a really good question. A key reason why you would set up a trust framework, right, is to protect data, right? To put privacy practices at the core of it. The goal is to be able to protect the personal information of individuals across boundaries, across digital ecosystem. So if digital identity systems are being designed without an agreed set of standards or principles, right, an agreed set of processes that specify how data should be handled, then we are going to have the big brother state, right?</p>
<p>So I’ll go back to the PCTF. It’s again around instilling confidence of end users that there is protection in the disclosure use of the identity and personal information, while ensuring that secure and privacy enhancing services are readily available, right? So the trust framework is around ensuring that there’s efficiency, that effectiveness is happening, meaning you can do what you exactly you set out to do, either as a service provider, an authenticator in the process, and that, you know, there’s ongoing confidence in digital services being provided. It’s an ongoing work. I don’t think it’s one that you start. It’s about having the right processes and systems in place to ensure that this does not change, and being able to state in really simplistic terms, not just in technical terms.</p>
<p>Oscar: A final question for all business leaders listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Titi: Amazing, all business leaders, meaning across sectors not specific to one, it’s this. And you know, this is known, you know, there’s the – it’s not an idea or a thought that they – I assume they would not have had. If you’re going to write anything into your agenda, it’s this: Privacy, data privacy, particularly around personal information is not an issue that will go away. So if there’s any actionable thing you can do, it’s this. The core of innovating either an idea, or a new technology, or delivery of a service, that you put privacy first. That’s one.</p>
<p>How do you put privacy first? It means that you need to be able to sit in the seat of the end user. And that end user could be an individual or actually be another organisation or an institution, and design in a way that trust is strengthened. Meaning I am confident enough as an institution or an individual that when we are having this transaction, when I’m giving you my data, it will only be used for what it’s meant to be used for. It will only access what it needs to access. That’s actionable.</p>
<p>So innovate, design with privacy first in mind, not by design only, but that it’s consistently, iteratively checked against how personal information is being used. Don’t design just for your local context, design in a way that anybody anywhere across the world would be looking to be able to engage with what you’re designing or what you are looking to sell or what you are offering in terms of service or platform. The world is global. There are physical boundaries. But remember, with the internet, the boundary is only as much as we set it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more, Titi. Fantastic and I agree that privacy first, of course. Thank you so much for this super interesting conversation, knowing more about you, your fascinating stories and the work you are doing about trust framework and privacy. For people who like to continue the conversation with you or learn more about your work, please let us know how we can find you.</p>
<p>Titi: Oh, yeah, you can find me – I will say that for the longest time I hid from the rest of the world behind pseudonyms. But you can find me across all platforms <a href="https://twitter.com/titiakinsanmi">@titiakinsanmi</a>, so that’s @ my first and my surname. And I will tell you, I am a policy wonk. Yes, you will find me speaking of policy but you will also find me sharing about the totality of who I am in different spaces in different ways. You can also find me if you want to have a chat a bit more professionally, yes on <a href="https://titiakinsanmi.com/">www.titiakinsanmi.com</a>. Thank you, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. It was a pleasure talking with you, Titi, and all the best.</p>
<p>Titi: Thank you very much, Oscar. Have a really great one. Thank you, listeners.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking">Mastercard’s The Rise of Open Banking study</a>, security, privacy, and trust are at the center of innovation. Open banking technology is paving the way for hundreds of millions of people to enter the digital economy. Three-quarters of U.S. consumers have already linked their bank accounts to automate financial tasks. They’re confidently adopting digital apps, products and services to make everyday financial tasks easier and quicker. Consumers are looking for more secure and simple ways to pay bills, send money to friends and open online accounts.</p>
<p>The study also revealed an accelerating demand for more complex needs, like financial forecasting, crypto investing and crowdfunding. This isn’t a surprise. Open banking is shifting and elevating what consumers can expect and demand from their financial apps and services. Payments are instant and automated. Adding financial data to boost credit scores is available. Buying and selling cryptocurrencies or stocks are immediate on many digital platforms. Banks, financial institutions and fintechs are connecting financial data securely and seamlessly to make these services a reality.&nbsp;</p>
 Convenience is Paramount, and Open Banking Offers It 
<p>Time is our most precious resource. The consumers surveyed made that abundantly clear. Of all the respondents, 59% cited the time and work saved by speed and ease of use as the reason they’re adopting financial technology. Nine in 10 consumers in the U.S. utilize technology to manage their finances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top use cases are financial task automation and peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. One of the major P2P platforms saw a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2021/paypal-venmo-volumes-grow-58-pct-yoy-to-58b/">58% year-on-year increase in pure volume</a>. Everyone loves being able to pay their friends quickly for dinner and drinks, or being able to send funds to a family member in need. These services continue to grow, quarter by quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers are also happily automating payments for rent, bills, gym memberships and streaming service subscriptions. The average consumer in the U.S. is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/average-consumer-spending-273-per-month-on-subscription-services-report/">spending $273</a> per month on various subscriptions. For each consumer, this could mean initiating a multitude of relatively small payments on a monthly basis. If that’s done manually, it would needlessly soak up extra time and create tedious work. Open banking provides consumer-permissioned data to facilitate these real time payments simply and easily.</p>
 What the Future Holds 
<p>The survey also revealed a rising appetite for more complex needs like crypto investing and crowdfunding. As the adaptation of these tasks grows, this does not come as a surprise. In our hyperconnected world, consumers are used to tapping a few buttons on a screen to complete any task instantly. This expectation of immediacy has been groomed for years by other digital habits such as social media apps, email services and SMS text messaging. Until recently, those expectations haven’t moved into the financial arena, but now consumers are finding the same convenience in finances.</p>
<p>Alleviating pain points and privacy concerns for consumers would significantly boost adoption of open banking apps and services. Respondents wanted more control over their data. They want to own it, control it and benefit from it. They want financial institutions and payment networks to keep it secure. Twenty-nine percent of U.S. consumers and 28% of Canadians said they’d be willing to adopt digital financial apps and services if they knew what financial details are being shared, how often they were being shared, and if tools to revoke sharing access were offered. Mastercard’s data principles around consumer data ownership, control and security are aligned with these desires. They’re a key foundation to driving more consumer adoption of open banking.</p>
<p>With privacy and security being a leading concern for digital finances, control over data and protection from fraud is the way forward. Seventy-five percent of consumers actively try to protect their private data and 54% of U.S. consumers think additional authentication steps can help ease concerns when it comes to linking financial accounts.</p>
<p>The critical elements of the success and promise of open banking are access, control and trust. By turning more control of their financial data over to the consumer, they will reap more benefits. In turn, banks, financial institutions and fintechs will have greater opportunity to create new financial products and services for these consumers.&nbsp;</p>

				  Indicio’s newest workshop is designed to provide the business community with the knowledge and confidence needed to make informed decisions about adopting and investing in the transformative power of trusted data ecosystems  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Scott Harris, COO, SSI Trainer</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to offer the <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/executive-education-ssi-workshop/">Executive Education SSI Workshop</a>. This two-hour, instructor-led workshop will provide a business and technical grounding in self-sovereign identity (SSI) technology. Participants will walk away with an essential understanding of how SSI works, the pain points it solves for, the risks it mitigates, the use cases currently in deployment, and the opportunities that are created by being able to build Trusted Data Ecosystems (TDEs).</p>
<p>Self-sovereign identity can be confusing. SSI involves new technologies, standards, and infrastructure to solve fundamental problems in Web 2.0. These include:</p>
 
 The absence of an identity layer 
 The vulnerabilities of user profiles, logins, and passwords 
 The burden of data privacy compliance 
 The need to adopt zero trust security approaches to prevent data breaches. 
 
<p>TDEs bring together the components to solve these problems and are available in off-the-shelf products that are easy to integrate with existing systems.</p>
<p>The Executive Education SSI workshop from Indicio is designed to show a business audience how decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials, and all their associated applications and infrastructure make it possible to verify data without having to check in with the source of that data—and in a way that solves the problem of privacy.</p>
<p>This training session is designed as a deep but manageable dive into a new and rapidly advancing technology. We’ll answer questions such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 What is identity as defined by the technology? 
 Why was this technology developed? 
 What problems does it solve? 
 What is the business value of implementing a Trusted Data Ecosystem? 
 What is required to make SSI work? 
 What is machine-readable governance? 
 How to implement a trusted data ecosystem? 
 How do you integrate SSI with existing IAM systems? 
 How does a business make and save money with this technology? 
 
<p>We’ll also discuss use cases — using verifiable credentials to communicate between different systems and sectors, such as between healthcare providers and the travel industry. Learn how, by solving even the smallest critical trust issue, you can mitigate all sorts of data and identity risks while generating new revenue and opportunities.</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/how-covid-19-catalyzed-digital-identity/">Indicio’s workshops</a> are interactive and instructor-led to provide the very best experience in small meeting groups of up to five people. This provides a setting to discuss specific use cases, answer questions and explore different types of high value data that needs to be verified as trustworthy.</p>
<p>Each session will conclude with Q&amp;A and each participant will be provided with course materials for their personal use. This workshop is particularly suitable for business executives and investors seeking to understand how this new technology works, how it is currently being implemented, and what we, as a leading developer in this field working with dozens of enterprises, see happening in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registration for this workshop is open now. Interested participants can purchase a session <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/executive-education-ssi-workshop/">here</a>&nbsp;.</p>

Learn about how you can jump-start your decentralized identity transformation with trusted data ecosystems to achieve powerful, measurable, and sustainable results.

 GiD Report #190 — The age of&nbsp;DAOs <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-189-crypto-takes-over-art-basel-ca301127e133">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The age of&nbsp;DAOs  The billionaire v. the&nbsp;DAO  Could DAOs replace corporations?  DAOs in&nbsp;action  This week in&nbsp;web3  Stuff happens   1. The age of decentralized autonomous organizations <p>Or DAO for&nbsp;short.</p><p>Over the summer, the sole copy of WuTang album, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html">acquired by PleasrDAO</a> (from the U.S. government via Martin Shkreli).</p><p>Some DAOs, like <a href="https://www.fwb.help/">Friends With Benefits</a>, are purely&nbsp;social.</p><p>Other DAOs, like many of today’s DeFi platforms, are powering tomorrow’s finance.</p><p>Could Fortune 500 corporations one day be set up as DAOs? (More on that&nbsp;later.)</p><p>Chris Dixon believes that networks should <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-187-what-is-a-dao-and-why-does-it-matter-d3fa4cf2a6c0">inherently be run as DAOs</a> (rather than corporations). It’s about incentives.</p><p>DAOs are “the ultimate combination of capitalism and progressivism,” <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1399498071873134592">says Mark&nbsp;Cuban</a>.</p><p>In many ways, DAOs represent the spirit of web3. When provided the proper tools — digital money and non-custodial wallets, governance, smart contracts, decentralized identity — we can start to reimagine the future and challenge the old ways of doing&nbsp;things.</p> 2. The billionaire versus the&nbsp;DAO <p>And the billionaire’s son.</p><p>I’m not sure if you could paint a more fitting&nbsp;picture.</p><p>On one end, you have hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, worth an estimated $20 billion — the poster boy for traditional finance. On the other, ConstitutionDAO, a loosely organized crypto community on Discord started by two Atlanta-based Millennials working in finance, Austin Cain and Graham, who collectively raised $40&nbsp;million.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/ken-griffin-s-son-told-him-you-have-to-buy-the-constitution">It wasn’t&nbsp;enough</a>:</p><blockquote>Why did Citadel founder Ken Griffin buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution last month for $43.2 million? His son told him&nbsp;to.</blockquote><blockquote>“I was sitting at home in New York and my son calls me to say, ‘Dad, you have to buy the Constitution,’” Griffin said in an interview after a luncheon hosted by the Palm Beach Civic Association at the Florida city’s Four Seasons hotel. Griffin didn’t give his son’s specific reason for wanting his father to make the purchase.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“I told myself, ‘I am going to own this,’” he said. “I don’t do that very&nbsp;often.”</blockquote><p>Goliath wanted to win, and he&nbsp;did.</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/ken-griffin-s-son-told-him-you-have-to-buy-the-constitution">Billionaire Ken Griffin’s Son Told Him ‘You Have to Buy the Constitution’</a>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution">From a meme to $47 million: ConstitutionDAO, crypto, and the future of crowdfunding</a>   3. Could DAOs replace corporations? <p>There’s <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/dao-llc">still a lot to figure&nbsp;out</a>:</p><blockquote>DAOs could be another way to form LLCs, but can they really replace companies? Crypto-friendly Wyoming passed a law in July allowing people to create an LLC with a DAO that has an Ethereum address. If a conflict arises in a DAO, a judge in Wyoming could rule on a dispute. But this wouldn’t work if one of the parties is outside of Wyoming, Jackson said: That aspect of the law hasn’t been&nbsp;tested.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s not either/or. Some DAOs need to register as LLCs and have done so. The LAO is a Delaware-registered LLC that is “primarily administered via an online application (a ‘DApp’) and related smart contracts,” its website says. In other words, the DAO structure provides coordination and voting, but sits on top of the LLC structurally.</blockquote><blockquote>One group, CityDAO, purchased 40 acres of land in Wyoming under the law seeking to build a blockchain city. However, after Wyoming recognized another DAO, American CryptoFed, the SEC in November blocked the DAO’s token registration due to a “materially deficient and misleading registration form.” In other words, even if a state recognizes a DAO, it may still need SEC approval to register its&nbsp;tokens.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The biggest challenge for DAOs may be their legal status, which is still unclear. “As with many ‘innovations’ in crypto, the primary novelty here seems to be ignoring laws,” Thompson&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/dao-llc">Crypto advocates want to replace the LLC with&nbsp;DAOs</a>  <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/do-daos-work">Do DAOs&nbsp;work?</a>   4. DAOs in&nbsp;action <p>The EOS community isn’t satisfied with Block.one, the company that created the network (co-founded by Brock Pierce). Now <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/126801/eos-community-halts-payments-worth-250-million-in-eos-to-block-one-and-brock-pierce">they’re taking&nbsp;action</a>:</p><blockquote>The EOS community today elected to stop ongoing payments to Block.one — the company that originally designed the network — over claims that it is no longer acting in the network’s best interests.</blockquote><blockquote>Those running have stopped the issuance of 67 million EOS ($250 million) that was set to be distributed over the next six to seven years. This will also affect Brock Pierce — a co-founder of stablecoin issuer Tether and co-founder of Block.one — since Block.one said he would have received around half of the&nbsp;tokens.</blockquote><blockquote>“Through a super majority consensus, the EOS network has taken its future in its own hands by voting to fire Block.one and stop vesting tokens to them. This begins a new era for EOS and highlights the power of the blockchain to enable a community to stand up against corporate interests that don’t align with theirs,” said Yves La Rose, leader of the EOS Network Foundation.</blockquote><p>But DAOs in action can also mean inaction. Democracy <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/sushiswap-infighting-exposes-pitfalls-of-decentralized-crypto">can be&nbsp;messy</a>:</p><blockquote>SushiSwap, the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that started with a scandal, is facing a crossroads as infighting among developers has investors seeking to reorganize the supposed autonomous organization.</blockquote><blockquote>Two large owners of Sushi tokens, which gives holders governance rights over how the protocol operates, submitted a proposal to restructure the project that may be considered for adoption as early as this week. The plan suggests establishing a more formalized entity to manage the effort, and checks and balances to ensure the proper spending of&nbsp;funds.</blockquote><blockquote>SushiSwap was supposed to be “a community-built open-source ecosystem,” in which users could trade directly with each other, without intermediaries, and make operational decisions. But it turned out to be largely controlled by a handful of mostly anonymous developers, who sometimes bypassed community votes and have been seeking to increase their compensation.

<p>This fall, we started our <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/verified-by-civic-pass/">Verified by Civic Pass</a> program to build trust within the NFT community. Today, we’re beyond thrilled to announce that we’ve verified our 50th creator and confirmed they will use Civic’s Ignite Pass to protect their NFT drop from bots.</p>



<p>Please join us in welcoming <a href="https://proleague.gg/">ProLeague</a> to the Verified by Civic Pass club!  ProLeague is fostering the growth of the next generation of esport professionals by offering an engaging platform that uses blockchain, NFTs, and their own unique cryptocurrency to reward and incentivize competitive play.</p>



<p>To be Verified by Civic Pass, team founders went through identity verification that included identity document scanning and limited-scope document verification; a 3D face scan; facial match comparison between the 3D face of the live user to their 2D photo identity document; and screening for sanctions, PEP and adverse media listings. Control of their project Twitter handle and project domain were also verified as part of the process.</p>



<p>Now that ProLeague has been Verified by Civic Pass, the project’s nascent community will continue to accumulate trust, the most essential building block of a strong community. As Aristotle once said “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” With Civic Pass, we’re helping lay a stronger foundation for the whole.</p>



<p>ProLeague will also be using Ignite Pass, which will protect their NFT drop from bot manipulation. Ignite Pass is just one of the features that we’ve added to our suite of Civic Pass products for NFT creators. Other features to make minting easier will soon be available on CandyMachine v2.</p>



<p>Since our first verifications of <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1447383173420052480">Metasaurs by Dr. DMT</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1453031075265929223">Flux Art Project</a> with Civic Pass, we’ve grown the Verified by Civic Pass program by leaps and bounds.

<p>DECEMBER 14, 2021 | NEW YORK</p>
<p>Report finds more than 80% of consumers in the U.S. – and 90% of younger consumers – are already connecting their bank accounts to technology apps.</p>
 
<p>Mastercard released a new report today,&nbsp;<a href="https://openbanking.mastercard.com/the-rise-of-open-banking">The Rise of Open Banking</a>, demonstrating the mainstream adoption of technology to power smarter, more meaningful digital experiences. Open banking puts consumers at the center of where and how their data is used to more effectively provide the services they want and need. Fintech companies and banks use this consumer-permissioned data to provide easier and more inclusive access to credit, personal financial management, digital wallets and payments services.</p>
<p>Open banking is already embedded in several areas of our daily lives, including personal financial management tools, linking of financial accounts and account opening. According to the report, nine in 10 consumers in the U.S. and Canada use online and mobile financial applications to manage money, with paying bills (82%) and banking (80%) as the most popular use cases.</p>
<p>“Open banking gives consumers choice by enabling them to use their own data to obtain financial services solutions quickly, simply and securely,” said Chiro Aikat, Executive Vice President, Product &amp; Engineering, North America. “Mastercard plays a central role in this ecosystem as a trusted intermediary and secure data network that powers smarter, more meaningful experiences and empowers consumers to practice good financial habits that enhance their day-to-day lives.”</p>
<p>Accelerated Shift to Digital</p>
<p>The survey uncovered that over the past year consumers have increasingly conducted common transactions digitally including:</p>
 
 Sending money to friends, family and businesses, with 59% of consumers using digital apps, products and/or services to do so and 36% in the U.S. using this technology for the first time in the last year 
 Securing or refinancing a loan (28% of consumers) 
 Emerging use cases like buying or selling cryptocurrency and crowdfunding 
 
<p>Open banking is at the foundation of many of these applications, where fintech companies, banks and financial institutions are connecting financial data securely and seamlessly to enable a wide range of financial products and services.</p>
<p>Willingness to Connect Financial Accounts</p>
<p>Critical to driving many, if not all, of these transactions is the ability for consumers to securely link their bank or payment accounts and authorize their financial data to be used in online financial applications. The report found that:</p>
 
 74% of consumers in the U.S. (65% of Canadians) have, or would, consider connecting their bank accounts to financial apps and services to automate financial tasks 
 68% in the U.S. (69% of Canadians) would do so to easily send money to someone 
 
<p>Trust in Fintech</p>
<p>Consumers are already connecting their data via multiple platforms to manage finances, and thus make their data work harder for them. Of those surveyed:</p>
 
 59% of US respondents (55% of Canadians) feel very confident using technology to manage money 
 Convenience is a top driver for using financial technology, with 59% of consumers in Canada and the U.S. saying fintech saves them time and is less work. 
 
<p>Putting consumers at the center of how and where their financial data is used ensures greater transparency and in turn helps fintech companies, banks and financial institutions gather feedback, scale faster and create new financial products and services more efficiently. Mastercard is a trusted partner and provides the highest levels of security and protection in every interaction and data transfer, adhering to its own data protection principles and standards: Consumers own the data they produce every day — and have the right to understand and control how it is shared and used.</p>

<p>On November 10, 2021, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXoEq7Za4Sw">KILT reached the final phase of decentralization</a>. Until that day, any changes to the KILT blockchain could be made using the Sudo key which was under control of BOTLabs GmbH, the company that initially developed KILT Protocol. This Sudo module allowed KILT’s developers to initiate staking and introduce governance and a Treasury. Once these were tested, KILT functionalities such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials were added and audited, and the Sudo key was&nbsp;removed.</p><p>Governance of KILT Protocol now belongs to the community of KILT Coin holders, which has the power to decide on the future of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>This decision-making power comes with responsibility. To encourage active participation in the democracy of the network, this step-by-step guide was created by BOTLabs GmbH to help the community fully understand the process and use their&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Before voting on any referendum, you can read more about it and join the discussion in <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/onchain">Polkassembly</a> (under “On-chain” → “Referenda”). Polkassembly is an open-source platform for providing information, context and a discussion forum for proposals and referenda in the Polkadot ecosystem. Of note, coins that are locked for staking may also be used to&nbsp;vote.</p> Casting a Vote on Polkadot.JS   Go to <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/democracy">KILT Spiritnet</a> on Polkadot.JS  Under the “Governance” → “Democracy” section you will see active referenda and proposals  Scroll to the referendum you wish to vote&nbsp;on  Click “Vote”  <p>5. This opens a separate pop-up. Enter the amount of coins you want to lock (1 in the image above). The minimum required to vote is 1&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>6. You can vote with multiplier 0.1 (up to 10% of your voting coins) and your coins are only locked for the duration of the referendum.</p><p>If you wish to increase your voting power by selecting a period of time to lock your coins, click the arrow next to conviction (2 in the image above). Choose your conviction in the drop-down menu.</p><p>Please note: if the referendum is successful, your coins will remain locked for this period; if unsuccessful, your coins will be unlocked when the referendum has finished. Also because voting happens transparently on-chain, it requires a small transaction fee (around 0.017 KILT). While locked coins or coins used for staking can be simultaneously used for voting, a usable, unlocked balance to cover this fee is required.</p><p>7. Vote “Aye” if you agree with the proposal and “Nay” if you disagree.</p><p>8. Click “Sign and Submit” in the&nbsp;pop-up.</p><p>9. Sign the transaction by entering your password (Sporran or Polkadot.JS, depending on where you are connected.)</p><p>10. That’s&nbsp;it!</p> Backgrounder: Conviction Voting <p>Like Polkadot and Kusama, KILT Protocol has conviction voting. This means if you feel very strongly about a proposal, you can lock up coins for longer periods to increase your voting power up to a maximum factor of 6. The longer you lock your coins, the stronger your vote will be weighted.</p><p>The times range from no lockup to a period of around 224 days, with the lockup time beginning after the voting period ends. Coins used for voting will always be locked until the end of the voting period, no matter what conviction you vote&nbsp;with.</p><p>Of note: the lock time is based on the standard block time of 12 seconds per block and hence may vary due to differences in the real block&nbsp;time.</p><p>If you choose not to lock any coins, your vote only counts as 10% of the coins that you commit to the voting (vote value), while the maximum lockup of around 224 days means you can make your vote count for 600% of the vote value. You can choose to lock all or some of your coins for any range between 0.1x and 6x, with a lockup time as outlined&nbsp;above.</p><p>For example: You have a wallet with 1,001 KILT Coins. This could include staked or vested&nbsp;coins.</p><p>Example 1 — minimum</p>  You want to vote but don’t want to lock any&nbsp;coins.  You enter 1,000 into the “vote&nbsp;value”  You choose “0.1 x voting balance, no lockup&nbsp;period”  This gives you a voting power of 100 KILT&nbsp;Coins  Note that all your 1,000 coins are locked for the time of the voting period (7&nbsp;days).  <p>Example 2 — maximum</p>  You strongly believe in the referendum and want to vote with your full balance and maximum conviction.  Choose “6 x voting balance, locked for 32x enactment (224&nbsp;days)”  This will give you a voting power of 6,000 KILT Coins, if you use your full amount, or 6 times the voting power of the amount you chose. The chosen amount will be locked for a period of around 224 days after the voting period ends (7&nbsp;days).  <p>Of note: rounded numbers are used as an example only — make sure that you always leave enough free, usable balance to cover the transaction fees.</p><p>Conviction voting allows users with a small amount of coins to increase their voting power, and deters a KILT coin holder from creating and voting on a malicious proposal and then leaving the&nbsp;network.</p><p>If the referendum is successful, your voting coins will remain locked for the time specified (which means that you will be unable to transfer them, but they will still be usable for staking during that time); if unsuccessful, your coins will be unlocked after the referendum has finished.</p><p>KILT also uses an algorithm to adapt the amount of “aye” (yes/agree) votes needed to pass depending on voter turnout: the greater the number of voters, the lower the threshold required to pass. Therefore, when voter turnout is low a supermajority is generally required; with a high turnout a simple majority is sufficient.</p> How to Remove a&nbsp;Vote <p>If you change your mind and want to remove your vote from an open referendum, you will need to find the index of the referendum you voted on, remove your vote from that index, and unlock the coins locked for&nbsp;voting.</p> Find the referendum index   Go to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/democracy">democracy tab in the Polkadot&nbsp;Apps</a>  Note the number next to the referendum you voted&nbsp;for   Remove the&nbsp;vote<a href="https://dev.kilt.io/docs/chain/Governance/remove_vote/#remove-the-vote">​</a> <p>Go to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/extrinsics">extrinsic tab in the Polkadot&nbsp;Apps</a></p>  Select the account you used for&nbsp;voting  Select the “democracy” pallet  Select the “removeVote” extrinsic  Enter the index of the referendum  Sign and send the extrinsic  <p>6. Unlock the expired voting lock using the guide&nbsp;below.</p> Unlocking Coins After Lockup&nbsp;Expires <p>After the lockup time has been reached, a transaction is needed to clear the lock. Of note: this will also require a transaction fee.</p>  Go to <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/democracy">KILT Spiritnet</a> on Polkadot.JS  Click the three dots on the right of your account. This opens up a&nbsp;pop-up.  Click “Clear expired democracy locks”  <p>Confirm the transaction. This will clear the&nbsp;lock.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/how-to-vote-on-a-kilt-referendum-2a9e167a24f0">How to Vote on a KILT Referendum</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What is Affinidi’s Digital&nbsp;Wallet? <p>Wallets are an important accessory that we carry at all times. Besides money and debit/credit cards, it also holds our <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/protecting-your-drivers-license-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-25d22aeac05b">driver’s license</a>, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/accessing-medical-records-anywhere-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-81a248f9b746">health insurance</a>, and other documents that identify you and authenticate you to access certain services.</p><p>As we transition to a digital life, the physical wallet is giving way to a digital wallet that contains all the information related to our identity, but in a digital&nbsp;format.</p><p>In this sense, a digital wallet is an encrypted storage for <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">securely storing</a> your verifiable credentials, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public and private keys</a>, or any other secure information related to your identity.</p><p>Now that you have an idea of what a wallet is, let’s learn more about the Affinidi&nbsp;wallet.</p> What is the Affinidi&nbsp;Wallet? <p>The <a href="http://wallet.affinidi.com">Affinidi Wallet</a> is a web-based responsive <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> wallet application for holders to request, store, share and manage their <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">digital identity</a>.</p><p>Specifically, you can do the following with Affinidi’s wallet.</p> Store Verifiable Credentials <p>Affinidi wallet is a single repository of all your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">verifiable credentials</a> obtained from different issuers.</p><p>You can imagine this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a> to be something similar to your physical wallet where you carry your driver’s license, credit cards, and other IDs. Except that in this wallet, everything is digital, so it is safe from thefts and accidental losses.</p> Share Verifiable Credentials <p>You can share your VC with anyone on the Internet with just a click. Simply click the share button and copy the link that the Affinidi wallet generates for that&nbsp;VC.</p><p>You can share the link with anyone or you can even choose to share the link directly through social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Whatsapp.</p> Control your&nbsp;VCs <p>One of the key tenets of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> is to give you complete control over your data and credentials.</p><p>With Affinidi wallet, you can choose to accept or reject any VC, and can decide whom you want to share it with. Also, you can choose to select only some part of the VCs, based on how the VC is implemented.</p><p>Additionally, you can view the VCs issued to you at any time and delete the ones that you think are <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">revoked</a>, expired, or not applicable for you&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>Thus, these are some things you can do with the Affinidi&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Next, let’s look at the workflow of the wallet, right from the time a VC is issued to a new&nbsp;user.</p> Workflow of Affinidi&nbsp;Wallet <p>The Affinidi wallet is simple to use, thereby making it ideal for all scenarios and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use-cases</a>.</p><p>Here is the step-by-step workflow for a new&nbsp;user.</p> Step 1: Create a VC and send an&nbsp;email <p>When an issuer issues a new VC to a holder who is not already signed up for the Affinidi wallet, an email is sent to the holder with a link to create the Affinidi&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>When the user clicks the “Add to wallet!” button, the onboarding process&nbsp;begins.</p> Step 2: Create a new&nbsp;account <p>The user is directed to an onboarding screen. Here, the user is prompted to enter a new password and confirm&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, there is a two-factor authentication check in place, and the user has to enter the OTP sent to the associated email&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Please note that the password must contain a minimum of eight characters with one lowercase, one uppercase, one special character, and one number respectively.</p> Step 3: Accept or Reject the&nbsp;VC <p>Once the user logs in, he or she can choose to accept or reject the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>As you can see, all the pertinent information about the VC is displayed, so the user can make an informed decision.</p><p>This is an important step as it gives the user complete control over what he/she wants to do with every VC. If the user rejects the VC, the same is discarded and not stored in the wallet. On the other hand, if the VC is accepted, it is stored in the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Step 4: View the&nbsp;VC <p>After accepting the VC, the same is stored in the wallet and is displayed to the&nbsp;user.</p><p>During subsequent logins, the user can see all the VCs stored in the wallet and can click on them for specific&nbsp;details.</p><p>When the user clicks on a particular VC, all the information contained in it is displayed.</p> Step 5: Share the&nbsp;VC <p>Sharing the information contained in the VC is&nbsp;easy.</p><p>There are two ways to share the VC, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Entire VC, where all the information such as your first name, last name, email ID, etc. are&nbsp;shared.  <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602">Selective disclosure</a>, where you choose to share only some information from the&nbsp;VC.  <p>To do this, choose a VC and click on “Selective Share” at the top right-hand corner and a pop-up will appear showing all the&nbsp;details.</p><p>You can select the information you want to share and click the “Update”&nbsp;button.</p><p>This will create a shareable link that you can send to anyone. You can even share it through Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, and LinkedIn.</p><p>Please note that the “selective share” option will be displayed only if the VC supports selective disclosure that’s implemented through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signatures</a>. If the VC doesn’t support selective disclosure, you will see only a “share”&nbsp;option.</p><p>In this case, you can share the entire VC&nbsp;only.</p> Step 6: Delete the&nbsp;VC <p>An important pillar of self-sovereign identity is to give you control to do whatever you want with your information, including deleting&nbsp;it.</p><p>Affinidi wallet gives you the option to delete any VC at any time. Simple click on the three dots on the right-hand top corner and choose “delete”.</p><p>You will be asked for confirmation.</p><p>When you select “yes”, the VC will be&nbsp;deleted.</p><p>Thus, these are the things a user can do with the Affinidi wallet, right from the time a VC is&nbsp;issued.</p><p>Moving on, let’s dwell a bit on the technical implementation.</p> Technical Implementation of the&nbsp;Wallet <p>The key API of our tech stack that supports wallet implementation is&nbsp;the</p><p>Cloud-wallet-api</p><p>This API interacts with the user and enables this entity to securely store, access, and share&nbsp;VCs.</p> Functionality <p>This API supports the following functionalities.</p> Onboarding   DID/key creation  Recovery flow   Storage   Backup of&nbsp;VCs  Key Recovery  Key Rotation  VC Revocation   Exchange   Claim a&nbsp;VC  Share a&nbsp;VC  Share a&nbsp;VP  Selective disclosure   User management   API for signup — This API will create DIDs and&nbsp;keys.

<p>If you would rather watch a video, <a>Micah Silverman</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJlfrAicVtc&amp;start=1000&amp;end=1262">JWTs for CSRF &amp; Microservices</a> (at 16:42) talk covers some of these topics too!</p>
 
 

 
 
 1. Checking secrets into source control 
 
 
<p>Checking a secret into source control is a mistake that’s easily made. This is an anti-pattern that most of us have done in error at some point, even if we don’t want to admit it. Once a secret is in your source control, it’s there forever; and can easily be found by doing a <a href="https://github.com/search?q=removed+password&amp;type=commits">a quick history search</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>If you find a secret in your source, remove it and revoke it. Of course, it’s best if secrets are never checked in to begin with! Watch out for them in code reviews and scan your code bases to ensure this doesn’t happen: <a href="https://www.gitguardian.com/">GitGuardian</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets">git-secrets</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Secrets often enter source trees by accident, usually because you temporarily typed one into a config file. When secrets are mixed in with other application properties, they become harder to spot and easier to forget about. Keep secrets out of your source entirely by using an <a href="https://12factor.net/config">external configuration</a> provider like <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">HashiCorp Vault</a>, using environmental variables, or by keeping secrets in a separate file outside of your source tree (or one that is explicitly ignored in your <code>.gitignore</code> file).</p>
 
 






Check out the <a href="https://github.com/paulschwarz/spring-dotenv">spring-dotenv</a> to use <code>.env</code> files with your Spring projects.



 
 
 
 
 2. Conflating encoding with encryption 
 
 
<p>They are not the same! Many folks are confused about the difference between encoding and encryption; they are distinct operations and cannot be interchanged.</p>
 
 
 Encoding 
 
<p>Data that is encoded is transformed into another format, usually to make transferring between systems possible. An encoded value may or may not be human-readable, but it needs to be treated the same way as the original input source.  The following examples show a string encoded in two common encoding schemes: URL encoding and base64 encoding.</p>
 
 
 URL encoded: 
 
 <code>String text = "Can you still read this text?";
String encoded = URLEncoder.encode(text, UTF_8);
// encoded: Can+you+still+read+this+text%3F
String decoded = URLDecoder.decode(encoded, UTF_8);
assertThat(decoded, equalTo(decoded));</code> 
 
 
 
 Base64 encoded (not human-readable): 
 
 <code>String text = "Can you still read this text?";
String encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(text.getBytes(UTF_8));
// encoded: Q2FuIHlvdSBzdGlsbCByZWFkIHRoaXMgdGV4dD8=
String decoded = new String(Base64.getDecoder().decode(encoded.getBytes(UTF_8)));
assertThat(decoded, equalTo(decoded));</code> 
 
 
 






In both cases, the encoded data can easily be reversed, and the encoded string must be treated the same way as plain text.



 
 
 
 Encryption 
 
<p>In contrast, data that’s encrypted can only be read by authorized parties (anyone with the correct cryptographic key). When data is encrypted, the resulting value is indistinguishable from random data. Because of this, encrypted data is often also encoded to make it easier to transport. For example, in the case of JSON Web Encryption (JWE), the JSON payload is encrypted and is then transformed to a base64-encoded string.</p>
 
 






Encryption is a complex topic and not suitable for a quick example. If you want to see a follow-up post covering common encryption use cases, leave a comment below!



 
 
<p>If you are using Kubernetes, make sure your secrets are encrypted. By default, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Kubernetes Secrets</a> store data as base64-encoded strings, as shown above. This isn’t any better than plain text. The good news is there are a few alternatives: use HashiCorp’s Vault, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/amazon-eks-supports-adding-kms-envelope-encryption-to-existing-clusters/">AWS KMS</a>, or <a href="https://dev.to/stack-labs/store-your-kubernetes-secrets-in-git-thanks-to-kubeseal-hello-sealedsecret-2i6h">Sealed Secrets</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 3. Using the bytes of a string for your key 
 
 
<p>Many of us confuse the terms password and secret key. Generally speaking, passwords make poor cryptographic keys. People often choose memorable words for passwords, making them easy to guess.  Even good passwords that are long and randomly generated have less entropy (the measure of the randomness) than a byte array of the same size.</p>
 
 
<p>To illustrate this point, think of a password of eight characters. (To keep the math simple, limit the characters to displayable ASCII.) There are 95 displayable ASCII characters, which means an eight-character password has a total of 958 = 6.6×1015 possible combinations. A random array of bytes doesn’t have this displayable character limit; each byte in the array has 256 possibilities, so a byte array of the same size has 2568 = 1.8×1019 total possible combinations!</p>
 
 
<p>Instead of getting the bytes directly from a <code>String</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>String secret = "password";
byte[] secretBytes = secret.getBytes(UTF_8);</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Use random bytes that are base64 encoded. The example below was generated by running: <code>openssl rand -base64 8</code></p>
 
 
 
 <code>String secret = "JJsm0MaRPHI="; // 8 random bytes base64-encoded
byte[] secretBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(secret.getBytes(UTF_8));</code> 
 
 
 







Did you notice that I hardcoded secrets into these examples?
 
 
 

 
 
 




 
 
 
 
 4. Failing to restrict access to secrets 
 
 
<p>It’s hard to keep secrets, well…​ secret. Do you know who has access to each secret used by your application? Secrets kept in environment variables can be viewed by anyone who has access to the running process on the system <code>ps e -ww -p &lt;pid&gt;</code>, or access to the Docker daemon <code>docker inspect &lt;container&gt;</code>.  Even "hidden" secrets used by your build server are <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/GitHub-Actions-Secrets-Example-Token-Tutorial">easy to leak</a>. Most popular CI services will filter build logs of passwords, but it’s easy to work around filters. For example, this GitHub Actions script adds a space between each character to bypass the filtering.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>steps:
- name: Not So Hidden Secret
  run: "echo ${{secrets.TEST_SECRET}} | sed 's/./&amp; /g'"

# output: C a n   y o u   s t i l l   r e a d   t h i s   t e x t ?</code> 
 
 
 






I’m not suggesting you do this; doing so may get you fired. Just be aware that it can happen and treat your secrets accordingly.



 
 
 
 
 5. Building your own crypto 
 
 
<p>As the old saying goes, "Don’t roll your own crypto." You are probably aware that you shouldn’t implement crypto algorithms yourself, but there’s much more to it. Knowing how the output will be used and understanding the protocol involved are just as important as the actual algorithm choice. Different algorithms have been developed for different use cases; many protocols or formats are designed with these specific use cases in mind.</p>
 
 
<p>Instead of cobbling together lower-level primitives, use a high-level library.  This suggestion may be obvious for protocols like TLS/HTTPS, but it also applies to simple formats; a lot can go wrong when a <a>JWT is parsed without a quality library</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Bonus: Be ready to rotate your secrets 
 
 
<p>If history has taught us anything about secrets, it’s that they will leak. In the last year there have been a few notable cases of secrets exposed: <a href="https://travis-ci.community/t/security-bulletin/12081">Travis-CI</a> and <a href="https://about.codecov.io/security-update/">Codecov</a>. After these issues were disclosed, teams scrambled to update secrets that may have been affected, which often resulted in broken builds.</p>
 
 






When people leave your project, any secrets they had access to must be updated.



 
 
<p>Be aware of how your project uses secrets, and practice rotating them before the next leak or personnel change.</p>

				  As you build, as you implement decentralized digital health credential systems, keep these broad points in mind  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio is a leading developer of decentralized digital health credentials and leads the <a href="http://cardea.app/">Cardea </a>community group at Linux Public Health Foundation. When it comes to building and using decentralized digital health credentials for managing Covid testing and vaccination, there’s a lot to consider. We want to share what we’ve learned through successful development and trials, and hope these eight rules will be a useful guide if you’re a policy or decision maker thinking about implementation and a helpful reminder if you’re an engineer focused on building a system.</p>
<p>1. The thing just has to work — This may sound like a no-brainer, but from our experience, this can be often overlooked. Want broad adoption? Your application must be fast and functional. If it causes too much friction people either won’t use it or they’ll look for ways around it.</p>
<p>2. When in doubt throw it out — Don’t include a data point unless you have a strong use case for that information. This keeps the data to a minimum, requiring less load time and storage, and provides fewer chances for the information to be misused or data lost.</p>
<p>3. Don’t reinvent the wheel — If you are making a passport, driver’s license, certification, or form, make the credential a digital twin of that form so people will find it easier to recognize it and adopt.</p>
<p>4. Go with open source over proprietary — Open-source products lead to easier fixes, upgrades, and competition to keep the price down. There’s a community of expert developers backing the product — and interoperability is built in. Proprietary often means expensive upgrades or expansions, or obsolescence and replacing an entire system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. There must be a backup plan — Ideally you have multiple backup plans. If the technology isn’t available what happens? You need to maintain some kind of offline option or option for people without access to a phone or unable to use a phone.</p>
<p>6. Test across a wide range of devices — Compatibility and accessibility go hand in hand: What works on Apple might not work on android — or any other phone people might have access to. The same goes for internet browsers. The best thing you can do is break it first—so you can fix it before people rely on it.</p>
<p>7. Partner with businesses for the rollout — To drive adoption, people will need some sort of incentive to use the credential along with places to use it. People will go with the option that requires the least amount of effort; but if they are turned away when trying to use your credential, they will be unlikely to use it again.</p>
<p>8. Start now — No technology is perfect; some bugs will always need to be worked out; but those who build early will see the most benefits. Implementation is a teacher. They will be able to improve their systems, learning from experience, while everyone else is still working on their first attempt.</p>

<p>13 December 2021, Grand Cayman and Berlin — SpiderDAO and BOTLabs GmbH, the company that initially developed KILT Protocol, today announced that identities composed of DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials) using the KILT Protocol will be integrated into SpiderDAO’s range of&nbsp;routers.</p><p>KILT is a decentralized blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous verifiable credentials. KILT provides a way to represent your identity without revealing things you prefer to keep private. KILT brings the old process of trust in real-world verifiable credentials (passport, driving license) to the digital world, while keeping your data private and in your possession.</p><p>KILT can also be used for machine identity to create identifiers for machines, services and anything that identities can be built on — such as routers. SpiderDAO’s developers will be working closely with BOTLabs GmbH to enable integration of DIDs into the firmware of their military-grade VPN routers. The combination of a world-class VPN router and a fully decentralized way of issuing, holding and verifying credentials, all in one piece of hardware, will create a powerful tool for consumer protection and privacy. This integration will also combat identity theft and loss of control of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>SpiderDAO has developed a multi-layered governance setup based on hardware and software tools built on Polkadot, providing a “one router one vote” approach. Users could verify themselves via a combination of the MAC address and serial number of the router, and the DID that uses the KILT Protocol. The DID would be implemented as an additional middleware layer, bonded to the hardware, making it difficult to copy or spoof a user’s identity and governance votes.</p><p>Quote from Nathan Vary, CEO SpiderDAO:</p><p>“SpiderDAO is delighted to work with BOTLabs GmbH as they build out their extensive roadmap. We look forward to being able to provide our clients with industry-leading security and offer further protection of their online privacy by utilizing KILT Protocol within our SpiderVPN routers. As more and more users demand decentralized and secure personal data ownership, we anticipate an exciting long-term collaboration.”</p><p>Quote from Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH:</p><p>“We were interested in collaborating with SpiderDAO due to their unique approach to governance through machine identity. SpiderDAO has the potential to democratise internet access and we are happy to be part of this journey. KILT Protocol became a fully decentralized blockchain in November, and we look forward to testing new tools that advance governance initiatives in the Polkadot ecosystem.”</p> About BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH <p>BOTLabs GmbH is a Berlin-based research and development company focusing on blockchain. It was founded in January 2018 by Ingo Rübe and German publishing house Burda GmbH, for whom he served as CTO from 2012 to 2017; Swiss publisher Ringier AG later joined as a shareholder. BOTLabs is the initial developer of KILT Protocol, now a decentralized blockchain network. The SocialKYC identity verification service, Sporran wallet and Stakeboard platform were developed by a subsidiary of BOTLabs called B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH. BOTLabs is a founding member of the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) and a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and Blockchain for&nbsp;Europe.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s open-source Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy. KILT Protocol was initially developed by BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH.</p><p>Reach KILT Protocol&nbsp;on:</p><p><a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/">Medium</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/">Website</a></p> About SpiderDAO <p>SpiderVPN provides a decentralized router-based VPN service for its users by using a dual-governance model which brings together hardware and software tools with on-chain elements.

<p>Wylie is a large suburb in Collin County in northeast Texas. Located just shy of 25 miles from downtown Dallas, there’s nothing particularly striking about this relatively small community (by American standards) of around 50,000 people. Named after Col. W.D. Wylie, a railway engineer who, according to historians, was rather keen on having a town named after him. His wish was granted in 1887.</p>

 What is the SmartWallet 2.0 and what does it do?&nbsp; 



<p>The main purpose behind Jolocom’s SmartWallet, first and foremost, is to give the user more control over his or her data in a privacy preserving way. In a nutshell, the SmartWallet therefore merges the SSI world in one single application. Compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the SmartWallet 2.0 is unique because it is built off the blockchain, giving EU citizens the right to opt-out of companies collecting personally identifiable information. In this way, SmartWallet 2.0 is&nbsp; the first of its kind because it represents a successful GDPR-compliant self-sovereign identity solution.&nbsp;</p>



 Planning and Creating&nbsp; 



<p>Planning started back in 2019. The previous Smartwallet 1.x.x. was in need for a remaking; especially the camera and settings screen needed improvement. It was soon to be decided that instead of a new update, what the SmartWallet actually needed was a complete new refactoring. So, instead of amending changes, the Wallet should be build from scratch as something new. July 2021 saw the first release of the new SmartWallet 2.0. The main focus hereby layed on the improvement of user experience, visual aspects and also functionality. Some aspects of the previous Wallet were kept, however, if only a few, for instance the first screen images and parts of the onboarding. Overall, a new SmartWallet was created.&nbsp;</p>



 Why it’s special&nbsp; 



<p>It is often overlooked, the way we share identity data. Jolocom’s SmartWallet 2.0 therefore wants to ensure that the data that we store today remains safe tomorrow. By this forward-looking approach to identity management, Jolocom helps individuals, enterprises, and governments to employ identity solutions for a digitally native world. Moreover, the SmartWallet 2.0 is adaptable to fit future use cases like eID, Covid passports, or gym memberships, for example, by being GDPR-compliant. No one – not even Jolocom – can access the info with out permission from the holder.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Avast, a cybersecurity and privacy company, announced on December 9th 2021 their intent to acquire Evernym.</p>
<p>Founded in 1988 in Prague, Czech Republic, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response">Avast</a> focuses both on meeting both consumer and enterprise use cases. On the enterprise side it offers endpoint protection such as patch management, internet/email/web gateway, and content filtering. For consumers, Avast provides a range of security protections and privacy measures for individual devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80521/providers-of-verified-identity">Evernym</a> was founded in 2013 in Salt Lake City, UT, USA. It provides blockchain-based decentralized identity solutions that enable organizations to issue and request Verifiable Credentials, and individuals to establish identity wallets and personal control over identity information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/avast-to-acquire-evernym-301440885.html">Avast CEO’s statements</a> have centered primarily on the consumer aspect: “Consumer trust in the online world has been critically compromised...Our vision for a digital freedom is to enable people to manage and retain control over their personal data so that they can interact and transact safely, privately and with confidence. Decentralized digital identities are a key component of that vision.” This seems to indicate a focus on the individual with future products based on the Evernym technology, perhaps to further interrupt digital tracking, online surveillance, and identity fraud. Indeed, a stated goal at this time is to enable a secure, portable, reusable identity that are universally and globally available.</p>
<p>The acquisition is projected to close in mid-December with products based on Evernym technology to be available in 2022.</p>
<p>A Promising Pairing</p>
<p>There is a natural pairing between the goals of a consumer cybersecurity company and a decentralized identity company: they both work to empower the individual to take control of and protect their online presence.</p>
<p>Avast’s product suite ranges from VPNs, antivirus, anti-tracking, monitoring of personal information potentially affected by data breaches, and so on. Evernym enables user-centric identity, where the individual user holds, controls, and shares their identity data in a privacy-preserving way.</p>
<p>Adding a decentralized identity function to Avast’s arsenal of personal privacy tools is a natural step to empower individuals to keep their information from being stockpiled in the many siloes of the many service providers they interact with.</p>
<p>The Pathway to Mass Adoption?</p>
<p>Decentralized identity has been striving for adoption beyond flashy Proof of Concepts for a few years now. Acquisitions like Avast of Evernym could be the way to product maturity and mass adoption. Since the inception of decentralized identity, its biggest selling points have been the capacity to protect the privacy of individuals and put control into their hands (literally, by storing their identity information in the secure element of their mobile devices and with proofs stored in the blockchain instead of in enterprise identity siloes). Combining the privacy aspect with user-centricity, a company like Avast who serves individual consumers could equip their customers with exactly that.</p>
<p>But there is the other perspective to consider. Individuals, equipped with identity wallets and Verifiable Credentials will need service providers who accept this type of credential; in addition to individual buy in, enterprises need to participate as well. Decentralized identity has been thus far unsuccessful in gathering a large, consolidated following of individual users to create the draw that enterprises need to build support for decentralized identities into their systems. A continuing challenge of decentralized identity is that although individuals can create a secure, validated, and reusable identity, there are very limited places to use this identity – the enterprise side has not yet provided the opportunities to issue, use, transact, verify, authenticate, exchange these identities on the sites and with the service providers that users interact with most. That is to say, decentralized identity will need a place to be used before it becomes useful to individuals. It is possible that Avast’s ability to create a cohesive decentralized identity user base may bring enough attention and attractiveness for other service providers to integrate such capabilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This acquisition has piqued the curiosity of KuppingerCole Analysts, and we will certainly be watching how Avast’s decentralized identity products evolve in the coming months. Closer integration with their anti-tracking and monitoring of exposure in data breaches may be vehicle enough for end users to find utility in their decentralized identity solutions, without relying on enterprises to adjust their onboarding procedures to accept decentralized identity credentials. In any case, it is a promising time in the evolution of decentralized identity.</p>

<p>In Europe, the rapid trend toward digitalization in daily life and banking has maintained pace with the rest of the world. Remote verification services such as IDnow provide a primary entry point to remote account opening, online banking, robo-advising, InsurTechs, and other products and services. Such digital trends represent a natural and organic disruption of traditional market offerings and services.</p>



<p>FinTech research revealed that nearly 71 percent of users prefer digital financial products over traditional banking. Such trends show no sign of slowing. McKinsey consultancy suggests that the COVID -19 pandemic pushed us seven years ahead in digital transformation.</p>



<p>The European verification ecosystem has developed a distinct flavor that favors customer privacy, security/trust and convenience. It is clear to all parties that new identification methods have the potential to increase risks of fraud as traditional processes are expanded. Knowing this, regulators mandate that electronic verification processes must be “at least or more secure than a traditional face-to-face procedure.”</p>



<p>This mandate has been the bedrock of IDnow’s work and actions.</p>



<p>As a top-tier software solution provider, IDnow offers identification products that surpass the highest levels of security and fraud detection requirements within strictly regulated digital markets in finance and banking, insurance, telecoms, mobility and other sectors. </p>



<p>As such, we feel that we have set a benchmark for security and accuracy standards. </p>



<p>Through this benchmark in our industry, we feel that we have a unique ability to support new legislation. This includes our participation in setting new technical specifications such as our work on ETSI TS 119-461 and continual work on identity verification standards with ETSI, FIDO Alliance, the W3C and other global organizations. Our collaboration and exchanges further support robust regulations and smart growth, which leads us to say:</p>



<blockquote><p>Innovative technologies must not offer a false sense of assurance when it comes to pushing for greater cross-border interoperability.</p>Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



 Blocking the Identity Fraud Gates with state-of-the-art verification technologies 



<p>We have witnessed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/idnow-trend-report/">relentless growth in fraudulent activity</a> and increasing sophistication around it. Our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AI-powered ID verification solution AutoIdent</a> is based on optical technology, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technology to ensure secure identity verification.</p>



<p>AutoIdent provides access to the person who was identified in a seamless process, and there is no separate “Issuance, delivery and activation” process necessary. </p>



<p>The system verifies that the video stream of the ID document has not been manipulated and captures a photographic record of the user with a “selfie.” The biometric verification confirms the document’s rightful owner, comparing the user to the ID document picture, enabling subsequent face comparison and checking that a natural person is in front of the camera through a “liveness detection.” The option exists to include an identification specialist to verify and review the data and results gathered from the AutoIdent solution.</p>







 Evolution of identity verification and regulation 



<p>Identity verification techniques and regulatory requirements for the application of remote proofing have evolved a great deal over the past 6 to 7 years. </p>



<p>More automated solutions gradually replace or support traditional manual onboarding and verification processes. Generally, video-based solutions, which came first, are now shifting to more automated biometric-based solutions. </p>



<p>Take, for instance, France, Switzerland and Austria. These countries have introduced new legislation this past year, permitting more automated processes using AI and ML to support digital Know Your Customer (KYC) applications for their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws</a>.</p>



 Harmonizing regulations in the EU while closing technical and regulatory gaps 



<p>While the rapid evolution of digital applications in both the public and private sectors has taken off, the need for regulatory harmonization within this changing landscape is essential across the EU and the Member States. </p>



<p>The EU issued recent regulations that address digitization, including The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj">EU Cybersecurity Act</a> (EU 2019/881) and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/GA/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148">EU NIS directive</a> (EU 2016/1148), amongst other regulations. </p>



<p>The EU released two new draft proposals that further take these rules into account. These include the latest draft proposal for the EU regulation&nbsp;910/2014&nbsp;on electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) and the draft proposal for a new European AML Regulation presented earlier this year.</p>



<p>While the existing eIDAS regulation provides groundbreaking rules on electronic identification and trust services, technical and regulatory gaps result in fewer notified electronic ID schemes and fragmented cross-border interoperability across Europe. </p>



 The new proposal (EU regulation&nbsp;910/2014 + new European AML Regulation) aims to address these gaps: 



  The regulation offers EU citizens the choice of a digital identity that can be stored in a digital wallet.   A user will be able to select which attributes they want to present for access to a specific product or service with the ability to store new attested attributes like a university degree.   The Commission is preparing the technical and regulatory framework so users are able to access online and offline services with the wallet option.  



<p>Additionally, AML Regulations are foreseen at the EU level in the future. The Commission aims to harmonize better national AML regulations and better address fraud and enforcement criteria. It is expected that there will be a European AML Authority, new EU regulations on customer <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/due-diligence/">due diligence</a> and beneficial ownership, and new rules concerning national supervisors and Financial Intelligence Units. These regulations will go into effect in the next few years.</p>



 Looking ahead towards a European digital ecosystem 



<p>Many of these regulations are part of a longer-term goal, the evolution and implementation of a European digital ecosystem. They are elaborate and set several ambitious objectives in the realm of digital services, markets and application.</p>



<p>At the same time, Digital identity proofing for Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML onboarding, or account processes, is still a relatively new practice. Though so much seems to have happened in this sphere, we must remind ourselves that it was only 2014 when <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)</a> permitted VideoIdent for KYC use.</p>



<p>As such, this industry hasn’t yet achieved the collective presence in our minds as it will in the coming years. Identity proofing remains a fragmented concept operating under different definitions of digital identity, variations to national regulations and competing technologies.</p>



&nbsp;



  
<p></p>
  



 Developing AutoIdent to meet changing regulations 



<p>Using a solution that meets and keeps up to date with changing regulations is vital. </p>



<p>IDnow has moved to develop and expand <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">its platform</a>, offering a wide range of products. The experience and expertise we gained from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a> has allowed us to develop new solutions with increased functionality. This includes products that offer fully automated biometric identity verification, the use of NFC technology and electronic signatures, and in development of a digital wallet for KYC screening for AML and non-AML requirements.</p>



<p>Let’s look at the Financial Services Industry. We can confidently claim that our KYC platform offering with AutoIdent in its core can serve even the most highly regulated markets and industries.</p>



<blockquote><p>IDnow’s AutoIdent solution offers a range of use cases within the financial services industry – including customer onboarding, opening an account or signing a loan agreement. </p>Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>AutoIdent meets EU regulations for these use cases in many ways. The key areas include:</p>



  Fully automated onboarding, with video backup. AutoIdent offers fully automated biometric identification of users, but also offers a hybrid (manual) alternative. This can be handled by internal or third-party staff. Regulations differ between countries regarding whether they allow verification to be fully automated or to have manual involvement. AutoIdent allows both – and its solution meets regulations in many countries, including Germany, Austria, Spain, the UK and the UAE.  Meeting 5AMLD and 6AMLD regulations for Anti-Money Laundering. Improving AML regulations have brought many new requirements. 5ALMD added a new focus on sources of finance, including pre-paid cards and cryptocurrencies. Earlier regulations introduced the concept of beneficial ownership, where the ultimate owners of legal entities are recorded centrally. AutoIdent fully meets the KYC and data collection requirements for this.  AML screening functionality. Many financial services use cases also require AML screening. AutoIdent can be expanded to add fully compliant AML Screening &amp; Monitoring. This includes checking Politically Exposed Person (PEP) and Sanction Lists. The identification of PEPs and carrying out enhanced due diligence and monitoring was a feature of 5AMLD.  Issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) as part of document signing. AutoIdent is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1)d.&nbsp;This is standard across Europe and regulations are similar in the UK.  Use of NFC technology. AutoIdent has the functionality to read biometric data from NFC chips. This is currently used to read German identity cards, but the solution can be easily expanded as it fully meets the global ICAO 9303 standard.  



 Differing regulations across Europe 



<p>The use of a fully automated verification solution differs considerably across jurisdictions. </p>



<p>To meet this, AutoIdent provides various modules to the product. At IDnow, we are fully aware of different regulations in use across the EU and the UK. While some areas are set at the EU level, there are many country-specific differences. </p>



<p>As just one example, to meet German AML laws to verify the identity of customers, an automated solution must include a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> and a one-cent-bank transfer for remote onboarding.</p>



<p>European regulators’ adoption of automated or hybrid identity verification has expanded significantly in past years. </p>



<p>There is growing evidence that automatic techniques are more secure than manual ones in some areas (especially facial recognition, for example). The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recently issued digital identity guidelines that support the use of automated identity verification.</p>



<p>Some of the leading countries allowing automated solutions include The Netherlands, Austria, Spain (with an element of video review) and Sweden (with manual review). </p>



<p>Germany has long been the most regulated market and it has now accepted an element of automation combined with a manual review (and the use of qualified electronic signatures). France allows the use of QES for bank account opening and stand-alone use of AutoIdent for verification – IDnow is currently undergoing approval.</p>



<p>IDnow believes that such a trend will be for more countries to permit automated biometric verification and AutoIdent is ready to handle this.</p>



 Meeting UK regulations 



<p>Since the UK is no longer part of the EU, it has different regulations. AutoIdent maintains compliance with each set of regulations. The UK has always taken a more deregulated approach and generally supports automated solutions. It is also one of the only countries that allow the use of biometric processes without the end user’s consent.</p>



<p>After withdrawal from the EU, the EU eIDAS Regulation was adopted into UK law, with a few differences. The UK introduced <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/89/made">The Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Regulations in 2019</a>.</p>



<p>One significant difference in the UK is the lack of a national identity card. If any solution is offered in the future, private providers will be more likely to be used. UK regulations guide states that these should follow ICAO 9303 NFC standards, which will allow adoption into the AutoIdent solution.</p>



 Moving to a digital future 



<p>As mentioned earlier, trends are moving to portable identity to be reused in other domains and even into a form of self-sovereign identity. Technology companies will seize these opportunities to develop sector-specific solutions, products, and relationships with customers that allow for greater ownership of a user’s identity and its reuse.</p>



<p>New amendments in regulation, such as eIDAS, presents game-changing possibilities and lay the foundation for a truly portable identity. </p>



<p>It is now incumbent upon businesses to work more actively with the EU, its member states and regulators to bring the advantages of eIDAS into the private sector. Our understanding of this can be summarised as follows:</p>



<blockquote><p>IDnow fully supports the call for building an EU framework that considers identification for its reuse across borders and sectors with appropriate levels of assurance and reliance on open standards.</p>Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



 The future of digital identity is based on trust, reliability and security 



<p>As we move closer to a person-centric digital identity, safety and accessibility will require initial identity verification grounded in trust, reliability and the ability to meet a minimum level of security.</p>



<p>The Commission recognizes the complexities around one aspect of the digital identity, namely digital onboarding. Part of producing the regulatory and technical framework ahead addresses interoperability, security and innovation. Rapidly, digital identity is evolving beyond digital national identity schemes and best practices in customer KYC regulations.</p>



<p>IDnow supports and prepares for future evolutions in digital identities stored in wallets and their verification and authentication. It is equally essential to IDnow that we best serve the market’s current requirements and user expectations. </p>



<p>AutoIdent has been developed alongside these regulation changes and remains ready to support all current and future shifts. IDnow strives to be the best, offering innovative, competitive and secure platforms. </p>



<p>Ultimately, digital identities and automated verification make things safer for verifying institutions and individuals. </p>



<p>Alongside offering security, creating a user experience with less friction and challenges is very important for financial institutions to increase conversion rates and maintain their brand. IDnow is at the forefront of development.</p>



<p>For a more in-depth look at AutoIdent, how it has evolved, and how it offers a well-thought-out balance between security and user experience, take a look at IDnow’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHcpM_dj4x8">recent webinar</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, we can help in discussions addressing interoperability, innovation, and, most importantly – security frameworks. </p>



<p>Employing the most robust practical security measures is a strategy through which we believe the growth of our market segment will be achieved. The achievement will be based on trust.</p>

<p>After building software at a major global ocean carrier for about half a decade, I decided this year to switch to a technology startup company. I had come across a particular set of emerging technologies, and the more I dug into them the clearer it became to me that they would define and revolutionize the future of digital supply chains. Passion took over; I just had to be part of driving these revolutionary technologies forward.</p><p>This article aims to explain to supply chain participants the future which these technologies will enable. In particular, we will explore what they do, what brought them about, how they fit together, and how they can be applied to our industry.</p> The Present <p>Today, supply chain operations are largely based on manually handled documents: PDFs, pictures, Excel sheets and even physical paper. These require human processing — vast amounts of emails are exchanged to enable the flow of&nbsp;goods.</p><p>EDI messaging is also very prevalent for automatic data processing. However, EDI connections have generally been over-customized for decades, which shifts the manual burden from business processing to EDI maintenance. EDI is the technological legacy of the industry: we are forced to respect it, but we all wish it would go&nbsp;away.</p><p>In recent years, we’ve made steps towards HTTP-based API integration, exchanging JSON-encoded data. Forward thinkers have exposed their business services this way, allowing customers to integrate with modern tooling and prevalent programming languages. Industry standard groups such as IATA, DCSA, UN/CEFACT play an important role guiding the industry&nbsp;ahead.</p> The Future <p>The macro trend towards API adoption is clear, but technologies continue to evolve. Particularly, Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identifiers are emerging standards which will revolutionize all industries of&nbsp;trade.</p> Linked Data <p>Let me start with a real example from two of my favorite ocean carriers’ developer portals: what CMA-CGM calls `voyageCode` on their schedules APIs, Maersk calls `voyageNumber` on theirs. Humans can infer that `voyageCode` and `voyageNumber` both mean the same thing, but computers need very explicit instructions and can only connect these terms with human assistance. This puts the interpretation burden on the developer tasked to integrate to these APIs. Interpreting two APIs doubles the risk of making incorrect interpretations.</p><p>Adding more carriers means the complexity and risk increases further. When we multiply that risk by the thousands upon thousands of customers integrating these APIs we come to a sad conclusion: every developer is doing the same costly repetitive work. And since we all have different backgrounds, language, cultures and skills, we invariably interpret API intention and meaning differently.</p><p>This is the challenge which <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON Linked Data</a> addresses. JSON-LD is a W3C standard which acts as a “layer” on top of JSON and literally adds context to the data. The context defines web Unique Resource Identifiers (URIs) for each of the terms used in the&nbsp;API.</p><p>The common meaning behind the above voyage example is in fact formally defined by UN/CEFACT. The URI for this definition looks like this: <a href="https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/#scheduledIdentificationId.">https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/#scheduledIdentificationId.</a> This URI is not exactly sexy, but computers love (unsexy) unique identifiers. Now, using JSON-LD CMA-CGM can define `voyageCode` by pointing at the UN/CEFACT URI. Maersk, in turn, can point their `voyageNumber` to the same UN/CEFACT URI. Now there’s no interpretation left for the developer. Both terms are explicitly defined and can be directly consumed by computer&nbsp;code.</p><p>JSON-LD switches the responsibility of determining meaning from the many consumers to the one single provider — where it&nbsp;belongs!</p><p>Linked Data deals with semantics: the meaning of the exchanged data. Ensuring that we “speak the same language” is the very essence of standards.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> is a W3C standard for cryptographically signing JSON data. Explained very briefly, encryption means mathematically signing a chunk of data with a private key known only by you. Subsequently, using your public key anyone can verify that the chunk of data indeed comes from&nbsp;you.</p><p>Cryptography is nothing new, but it is traditionally applied on the transport layer (HTTPS, for example); Verifiable Credentials bring cryptography to the data-layer. Instead of keeping track and remembering “I received this piece of data from that party via this channel”, at any point in the future you can verify where data came from and trust that it hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>There is a reason why traditional paper-based contracts are printed on letterhead paper and are signed: it’s so that the agreement can be proven in the future. The idea of just jotting down contractual data on a white piece of paper and trusting its validity based on the courier who carried it is absurd. Nonetheless, that is exactly what happens with a standard API call over HTTPS. This also explains why paper (physically as well as PDFs) is still so widely used in supply chains. The fundamental requirements remain while technology is catching&nbsp;up.</p><p>A Verifiable Credential is a container for data, which can be whatever the API call requires to support a business use case. The container adds `issuer` and `proof` elements. `issuer` captures the identity of the entity issuing the data, typically in the form of a Decentralized Identity (more on that in the next section). `proof` contains the cryptographic material needed to verify the data, particularly the “signature” string which is generated based on the data and the issuer’s private key. Anyone receiving this “contained” data will know who it came from and can verify that the data is how the issuer intended it to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Again, the paper analogy is useful: `issuer` corresponds to the pre-printed company letterhead on paper contracts while `proof` corresponds to the analogue signature. This analogy falls short, however, since a cryptographic signature is many times more secure than an analogue signature on&nbsp;paper.</p><p>I do want to quickly mention what Verifiable Credentials are not: a Verifiable Credential does not deal with data access management. Sensitive data still needs to be securely handled when sent (in transit) and stored (at rest). Also, a Verifiable Credential does not deal with originality. Verifiable Credentials can be copied and distributed just like any other JSON file, every copy is tamper-proof and can be verified.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials couple trust with&nbsp;data.</p> Decentralized Identifiers <p>The third and final aspect deals with identity. Managing who is who is a massive undertaking all over supply chains. Every organization keeps registries of customers, suppliers, contractors, and employees. Essentially, everyone maintains a model of everyone else. This is an exponentially complex problem, computer science-wise. The total amount of effort that goes into keeping customer master data up-to-date is staggering, and costly mistakes are a standard part of operations.</p><p>Traditional digital identity is based around identity providers which lends out tokens that represent you. The identity provider typically knows nothing more about you than verifying a working email and checking that “you’re not a robot.” This falls way short of knowing and trusting a supply chain counterpart on a foreign continent.</p><p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> turn the identity solution inside out. DIDs can be generated freely and can represent anyone or anything. They are trustless, meaning they don’t pretend to represent any sort of objective vetting; rather, trust is built from Verifiable Credentials. A DID is just an identity. DIDs are controlled by the holder of a private key, and additional keys can be associated with it to perform actions like authentication or signing Verifiable Credentials. Keys and DIDs are related, but clearly distinct aspects. So again: DIDs only represent identity.</p><p>There is no limit to what a DID can identify. The obvious examples are organizations and people, as explained above. They can also represent assets such as shipping containers, seals, boxes, vessels, or locations, and intangible concepts like bookings, agreements, transactions, or documents.</p><p>Here is an example of a DID: `did:web:transmute.industries`. DIDs are strings which always start with `did:`. What comes after depends on its type, its so-called DID Method. Just like a URL resolves a web page, DIDs resolve a DID Document. That DID Document carries public information relevant to the DID, notably its associated public keys. This way, anyone in the world can verify that someone claiming to control a DID indeed does hold its private key, or that a Verifiable Credential was indeed issued by the controller of the `issuer`&nbsp;DID.</p><p>There are a number of different DID Methods to choose from serving a range of requirements such as availability, confidentiality, censorability, and affordability, just to name a few. Some examples include `did:key` where the DID and its keys are consciously hard coupled (self contained, fast, simple), `did:web` where the DID Document is kept on a web server (tangible, transparent), and `did:elem` where the DID Document is kept on Ethereum (immutable, censorless).</p><p>So, an organization may control many DIDs. One could represent the organization itself and its geographic subsidiaries (`did:web` would likely be a suitable choice for these). But the same organization could also control DIDs representing, say, owned shipping containers and the seals applied to them (`did:key` would be a good choice here). As the DID controller, the organization can perform all corresponding actions such as proving ownership of assets and issue claims on behalf of legal entities.</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers put the digital identity of every supply chain actor in their own hands. It is the only globally scalable solution to a challenge faced by this truly global industry.</p> Bringing It All&nbsp;Together <p>Let’s bring together Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identifiers to more closely examine the future of supply chain data flows. When combined, these three emerging technologies lead to semantically unambiguous data, well-managed identities, and claims based on trusted sources. Let’s imagine what the future would look&nbsp;like.</p><p>As a domestic buyer, I can remotely establish a trusted relationship with a foreign supplier. The risks inherently present in intercontinental trade are largely mitigated by the credentials which the supplier presents. These credentials prove government-issued company legality, long standing relationships with several known carrier brands, and show ethical and environmental certificates issued by established NGOs. I may not know the exact issuer of the environmental inspector, but I am also presented with an agency credential issued to that inspector from a global NGO which I do know. So, all the needed claims are issued by DIDs which I know and trust, or through a “trust chain”, which links back to trusted entities.</p><p>The products I purchase are given precise DIDs and their quality is inspected on-site by a trusted 3rd party. The manufacturer is also able to present credentials proving a degree of recycling and sustainable materials sourcing.</p><p>Since all documentation is completely digital, the carrier booking and export documentation processing is completely automated. Product DIDs are linked to a carrier consignment DID which cryptographically proves they have taken ordered goods into custody. I have chosen “slow steam, low emission” transport, so the consignment gets issued a reduced carbon-footprint credential which in turn links back to my products.</p><p>Upon arrival, Customs can easily build a holistic model of origin, commodity, provenance, transport routing risks, and factor in backgrounds of every party involved from the presented credentials. Fully automated, Customs can make near real-time risk assessments, duties calculations, and release determinations.</p><p>With the goods landed, I can flaunt the exact certificates of the ethical and low carbon premium choices which I made during production and transportation. Selective disclosure allows me to cryptographically prove this to my customers without revealing any other data elements from, say, the commercial invoice or bill of lading documents.</p><p>Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identifiers are standards, comparable to the likes of HTTP or JSON. All these advanced use cases are cross-vendor interoperable, and each actor can freely choose whichever tool or software provider they&nbsp;fancy.</p><p>All data will eventually become verifiable. After all, why would you ever again settle for ambiguous data from vaguely identified sources?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-digital-supply-chain-of-the-future-79e9431aaa0d">The Digital Supply Chain of the Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>9th December, Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokenchampions.com/">Tokenchampions</a> is the first investment fund that tokenizes debts for the acquisition and management of international football players’ image rights. Partnering with tokenization platform provider Tokeny, Tokenchampions makes this asset accessible for retail investors in Europe for as little as €100. Furthermore, a secondary market solution will be offered to improve liquidity.</p>
<p>The selection of the football players is headed by Josep Maria Minguella, who discovered and developed talents like Maradona, Messi, Stoichkov and Guardiola, among others. In this first issuance, Tokenchampions is incorporating young football stars on the rise with enormous growth potential, including Nicolò Zaniolo (Roma), Rúl Moro (Lazio), Bobby Adekanye (Lazio) and David Navarro (Atlético de Madrid Youth A Sub-19).</p>

		 
	 
    If we add the use of blockchain technology to the knowledge amassed over all these years of experience with players, we are in a position to tackle the challenges posed by the future of football business management with a greater likelihood of success.  Josep Maria MinguellaHonorary Sport President at Tokenchampions    
	 
		 
			<p>As an investor, it has traditionally been difficult to invest in the football business, either because the minimum investment amount is very high or because there is simply no access to such investment opportunities. In addition, this type of asset is notoriously illiquid, further complicating the investment in the field.</p>
<p>Tokenchampions aims to change that through tokenization, the process to digitize assets on the blockchain. Assets can be programmed and fractionated with this technology, allowing for smaller investments and automated compliance.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokenchampions democratizes the football business by combining the latest technology with an unrivaled experience in the management of sports talent, and thanks to financial strength allowing all football fans to participate, regardless of whether they are small or large investors.  Carlos SalasCEO of Tokenchampions    
	 
		 
			<p>By using Tokeny’s Billboard, Tokenchampions also provides a secondary market for investors, enabling them to meet other eligible counterparts and make compliant peer-to-peer transactions prior to the maturity date.</p>

		 
	 
    The Tokenchampions team is a pioneer in using tokenization to make football investment more accessible and liquid for a wider range of investors. By providing them with a compliant infrastructure, we bridge the technology gap and enable them to concentrate on their core business. Our end-to-end tokenization platform helps them to achieve rapid onboarding of investors, cost-efficient management, and rapid transfer of securities in a compliant manner.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Tokenchampions has been structured in Luxembourg, as Bill 7637 gives clear regulatory status to blockchain as the underlying technology for the issuance and circulation of securities. This is yet another demonstration that Luxembourg is the hub for asset tokenization, attracting more serious and promising projects. Both token issuers and investors will benefit greatly from the tokenization ecosystem that is being developed and completed here.</p>

			 About Tokenchampions 
<p>Tokenchampions is the first investment fund allowing all football fans to participate in the appealing business of their favorite sport. Tokenchampions tokenizes debt for the acquisition and management of the image rights of upcoming international talents in the world of football. Tokenchampions democratizes the football business by combining the latest technology with an unrivaled experience in the management of sports talent and allowing all football lovers to participate, regardless of whether they are small or large investors.</p>

 About Tokeny&nbsp; 
<p>Tokeny allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments. Tokeny is the leader in its field and in 2020 was named one of the top 50 companies in the blockchain space by CB Insights. The company is backed by Euronext.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>We know that the way forward for business IT is to use multi-hybrid architectures for long term agility of operations. Such architectures will include multiple clouds for new services, on-prem stacks, edge devices, OT integration and much more. But while the need for multi-hybrid is clear, the resulting complexity of ad hoc deployment of multi-hybrid architectures can lead to serious security holes.</p>
<p>Unmanaged complexity will invariably result in an enlarged attack surface that will encourage attackers to take a pick and mix approach to find and exploit vulnerabilities within your operating environment. Attackers will find holes to deposit new malware or ransomware and then mix these with malicious tools that they may already be deploying on your networks – all without your knowledge. Unlike the Pick ‘n’ Mix counter at the sweetshop, such malign confectionery will taste sweet only to the attackers.</p>
 So why don’t we just make everything simpler? 
<p>Good point, and we will get to that but unless your organization was built yesterday, from the ground up, with a cloud native architecture that so far does not extend much beyond your own employees – a kind of cloud first perimetered structure, it is likely your IT stacks will be complex and challenging to audit and manage as part of a multi-hybrid architecture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: An expanding infrastructure will inexorably get more complex as it grows beyond its original state. The spheres represent resources such as multi-clouds, on premise stacks, databases, date centres, tools and applications etc. The swirling dots represent machine and human identities (Source: KuppingerCole).</p>
<p>No, like the Universe, today’s typical IT infrastructure is constantly expanding as demand shifts and change and unplanned and unsanctioned mini galaxies are created in the form of clouds purchased at departmental level and DevOps groups, among others.</p>
<p>Because, of course, IT is complex, it’s a fact – even that seemingly simple cloud native architecture will take trained and qualified people to construct – and the same level of expertise to maintain. Now consider the more typical scenario that we see every day. Older organizations will consist of the old and the new – usually not working together in perfect harmony. There will be (possibly) old mainframes, legacy stacks on premises, private clouds, public clouds, third party networks, remote workers, endpoint devices, edge devices, IOT, unauthorised devices and more.</p>
<p>And of course, within all that will be the reason why the architecture can be become a deadly attack surface. It’s all those identities – your people, your devices - flowing in and around the architecture looking for access to services, applications and more. And this is key. If IT ran without identities acting with agency, then the attack surface would be minimal. Unfortunately, nothing can be created, nothing can be done without human and machine identities doing something and using applications.</p>
<p>Our new multi-hybrid world is geared expressly around the notion that the quicker employees and others get access to resources, the more efficient the business will be and the more competitive – and this is mostly true is the IT architecture is engineered well. But multi layered IT stacks engineered for a business outcome will not solve the security and risk equations the architecture poses on its own. IT architecture can only be simple to a certain degree so we need to look at how organizations can simplify the policies and processes needed for the business outcome and harden the identity and access management protocols. For this, organizations need to take their own pick and mix approach to the stuff happening inside their multi-hybrid infrastructure.</p>
 So, how to simplify what happens within the multi-hybrid infrastructure. 
<p>First off, this is not a quick process and trying to outline every step you should take to reduce your attack surface in a multi-hybrid infrastructure is impossible in a blog, but we can do themes and high-level options. And of course, KuppingerCole analysts are always available for advisory services on digital transformation.</p>
<p>In short, you need to reduce complexity by focusing on processes and outcomes – mostly around managing identities and access to resources. The chart below, by KuppingerCole’s Principal Analyst, Martin Kuppinger, shows at least some options that may be useful to an organization created in that way. But this is just one example, every organization – yours most importantly – will be different. Your universe will be expanding in different ways – you may be running AWS but you may not use VMs. You may process financial information, but you don’t use edge devices or IoT. And so on, bearing in mind that may all change in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: How to start thinking about managing complexity in multi-hybrid environments.</p>
<p>Therefore, before you can simplify operations inside your infrastructure the three key questions to ask are:</p>
 
 What is the desired outcome? How can you deliver, run and secure the services the business needs? 
 What are the components in your IT environment needed to deliver that outcome? Look at what makes up your infrastructure, the data, the applications, and the policies that control usage. 
 Who or what needs access to those components? Choose from data, people, machine identities, third parties, digital things, devices etc. 
 
<p>So that’s a very simple chart we have created to illustrate what, in reality, looks more like the expanding universe infrastructure in the first diagram. But it’s a start and one that will focus minds on reducing complexity within, and from a user identity viewpoint – that is critical. You need to reduce vulnerability from identity management failings and determine how a complex environment can be made simpler and reduce the attack surface at the same time.</p>
<p>A Pick ‘n’ Mix mentality should be something that works for you – you choose what you need, who gets access to what and what the outcome is. This is good, but without rationalising identities and access management within and outside of your multi-hybrid architecture, you will never overcome the inevitable complexity of the physical architecture because you have no view on what is happening across it. And it will reduce the risk of attackers picking unmanaged identities to find their way in across your multi-hybrid infrastructure.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago we wrapped up our first public test of Holochain + the Holo hosting infrastructure, and in my opinion, it went wonderfully. For those of you who weren’t involved, we used a proof-of-concept app called Elemental Chat to collect insights on what was and wasn’t working. Five thousand of you signed up and eagerly attacked it, sending each other about 30,000 messages in English, Turkish, Dutch, French, Greek, and other languages.</p><p>(Note: I realise this isn’t really news anymore, and I apologise for the gap in Dev Pulse publication. My attention was unexpectedly taken away from work for a couple weeks.)</p><p>The most important finding was that Holochain is already working pretty well. In fact, it exceeded our expectations. When we told the Holo dev team about how many people we hoped to invite, one team member was concerned about pushing it past 300 concurrent users. Well, you all helped us blow past that by more than 3× without any visible problems.</p><p>This was exciting, partly because there are a bunch of improvements that didn’t even make it into this test. Sharding was still turned off, none of the recent database work was included, and there are many more optimisations we could explore. Given that sharding is part of our strategy for achieving near-infinite scalability, it looks like performance can only get better — by orders of magnitude.</p><p>We also discovered bugs and slowdowns. As Holo wrote in their <a href="https://press.holo.host/205474-elemental-chat-public-test-success-amp-learnings">most recent update</a>, that was the purpose of this test. So even though this might seem like a bad thing, it was really just another marker of success.</p> Kinda special <p>When you’ve been immersed in the development of a project for a few years, it’s easy to forget what’s different about it. But as I lay awake in bed a few weeks ago, thinking about our plans to open testing up to the whole world, I started remembering why what we have is special.</p><p>Usually, when you want to access a P2P network, you have two options:</p>  Become a full participant, which means downloading the software, connecting to peers, and replicating their data. For non-blockchain networks, this is often <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases">as</a> <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn/releases">easy</a> <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/">as</a> <a href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork">downloading</a> <a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/downloads/">an</a> <a href="https://aether.app/">app</a> — as long as your computer’s permissions allow it. (Don’t even try this on a public library computer.) But for blockchain networks, this is nearly impossible — the hardware demands are too high, and installing the software can be a challenge.  Access a centralised ‘gateway’, which handles all the P2P stuff for you. If you want to write things to the network, depending on the nature of the gateway, you either need to install a ‘wallet’ browser plugin for your cryptographic keys (most blockchain dApps work this way) or trust the gateway to handle your keys for you (most cryptocurrency exchanges work this way).  <p>I prefer the first option. I get to take charge of my participation in the network, I can work offline if I like, and I get the happy feeling that comes from supporting something that matters to me. While I’ve never tried installing a blockchain node on my machine, I’ve tried other P2P apps, and they’re quite nice. My only frustration is that I can’t easily switch my work to another computer.</p><p>The second option lets me work from any machine I like, but I have to be connected to the internet all the time. And if the gateway goes down, good luck getting anything done. To me, this doesn’t seem very decentralised. And besides, I have a really hard time figuring out how crypto wallets work — even after four years in the business. If this is what my experience is like, what’s it going to be like for my dad?</p><p>Holochain + Holo hosting can blend the offline-friendliness of self-run nodes with the portability of web access, all while maintaining users’ sovereignty and making their experience pleasant and familiar. I know of <a href="https://datdot.org/">very</a> <a href="https://fission.codes/">few</a> other projects doing that.</p> What’s next? <p>During the test, the dev teams identified some areas of work. You already know about some of them — the last few releases have included bugfixes that came directly from this test. Here are some others:</p>  Database optimisations that increase efficiency. One of these, which permitted asynchronous database queries, arrived in Holochain <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#holochain_sqlite-0015">0.0.115</a>. The other, a large <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1130/files">database refactor</a>, was completed in 0.0.117 (see below).  Gossip algorithm improvements and other bug fixes to issues discovered during testing, to reduce overhead and make gossip sustainable over time. One issue in particular involves gossip of historical DHT data. When two nodes sync with each other, they compare the data they’re holding using something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a>. It’s a small data structure, kind of like a hash, meant to quickly compare approximate differences between two data sets. Currently Holochain calculates it on every round of sync, which results in a lot of database I/O, causing the sync to time out and restart. We believe this is one cause of the slowdowns, and we’re investigating ways to make historical gossip more efficient. Some of this work has already landed in recent releases.  And of course sharding. This will likely give us the biggest improvements. Overall efficiency will get better, because fewer nodes to gossip with = less gossip = more time and space to work on other things. ‘Convergence time’ will also improve. In distributed systems speak, convergence is the moment when all nodes agree on the data they’re holding. In Holochain terms, this means that newly published data will become available more quickly, new nodes will sync more quickly with their peers when they first become part of the DHT, and old partitions will heal more quickly.  <p>Now that you know where we’re heading, let’s take a look at what happened with Holochain the past four weeks.</p> Four new Holochain releases  Holochain 0.0.116: Dependency cleanup <p>This was a very small release: some unused dependencies were removed, which sped up compilation time. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1116">#1116</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.117: Database refactor <p>The biggest change in this release is that gossip is shared between all cells on a conductor which share a DNA, which allows Holo-hosted cells to gossip more efficiently.</p>  Breaking: DHT shard and authored databases are shared among all cells that share a DNA. There’s no breaking changes to the HDK, but your conductor will have to start over with a fresh database. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1130">#1130</a>)  Breaking: Wire messages have been changed to support shared gossip, which means that this version’s gossip protocol breaks compatibility with earlier versions. Again, no HDK changes. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1091">#1091</a>)  Breaking: The <code>db_sync_level</code> directive in the conductor config has been renamed to <code>db_sync_strategy</code> and can accept the values <code>Fast</code> and <code>Resilient</code>. This directive handles how SQLite writes are flushed to storage. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1130">#1130</a>)  Bugfix: Some databases can handle corruption by wiping and recreating the database. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1039">#1039</a>)   Holochain 0.0.118: Small gossip change <p>This release brings one breaking change to gossip: nodes now keep metrics on each other based on their agent key, not TLS certificate. This once again breaks the gossip protocol’s compatibility with earlier versions of Holochain. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1114">#1114</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.119: Performance improvements <p>This release brings a bunch of small changes that increase performance.</p>  Breaking: when syncing the DHT ops they’re holding, two nodes can send the data in batches rather than in one huge message. Again, this breaks gossip protocol compatibility. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1143">#1143</a>)  A few cleanup sweeps have been done over the entire codebase, catching database queries that weren’t made async in 0.0.115 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1145">#1145</a>) and various outstanding todos (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1150">#1150</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1152">#1152</a>).  A small database change results in faster <code>get</code> queries. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1143">#1143</a>)  Agent info entries are published, not just gossiped. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1115">#1115</a>)  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.119/CHANGELOG.md#20211208091009">release notes for the last four versions</a>.</p> Wait, where’s HDK 0.0.119? <p>You may have noticed that, while Holochain is now at version 0.0.119, the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hdk/versions">HDK is still at 0.0.115</a>. What happened to the four newest versions?</p><p>Based on feedback from hApp developers, the release team has decided to only bump HDK release numbers when there are actual changes. This does cause a mismatch between a HDK version and the Holochain version(s) it works with, but it also means you don’t have to update and rebuild your zomes with every Holochain release.</p><p>To find the HDK version that matches the Holochain version you want to use, we’ll be introducing some tools and documents. In the meantime, you can visit this URL (using Holochain 0.0.119 as an example release; you’ll need to change that number to the release you actually want):</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.119/crates/hdk/Cargo.toml">https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.119/crates/hdk/Cargo.toml</a></p><p>In this case, you can see that the HDK version is at 0.0.115:</p> A first-time hApp creation tutorial <p>Today I came across this tutorial by <a href="https://github.com/wimpheling">wimpheling</a>, a new hApp developer, documenting their recent learnings as a tutorial. This guide takes you through setting up the Holochain dev tools, building a hApp backend, and creating a web-based UI for it. I found it easy to read and follow — and I’m grateful they wrote it, since we don’t currently have a good beginner tutorial that takes you all the way to a running app.</p><p>If you haven’t yet built a hApp but you’d like to give it a try, <a href="https://blog.without.hosting/posts/holochain-getting-started/">follow the tutorial</a> and see what you think! (Note: it says it’s written for 0.0.117, but it should work for 0.0.119 just fine. One other thing to keep in mind is that, while the blog says to use <code>https://nightly.holochain.love</code> to download the latest dev tools, you should use the non-nightly URL <code>https://holochain.love</code> instead.)</p> Playground: now with real DHT data! <p>Long-time readers will remember the Holochain Playground, a simulator that helps you understand how all the agents and data in a DHT relate to each other. You could create cells and watch how their source chains and the shared DHT data grew as they made zome calls.</p><p>Now, Playground’s creator Guillem has added a ‘connected’ mode, which hooks up to a real conductor and shows you exactly what’s going on in a real DHT! Because I’m not much of a hApp dev myself, I’ll let others describe what they think:</p><blockquote>This is amazing, Guillem. Really awesome. [...] Everybody will benefit from using this.<br>— Eric Harris-Braun, Holochain co-creator</blockquote><blockquote>To me, as a hApp developer, this is game-changing. Really next-level in terms of being able to learn as I go and more deeply understand all the mechanics that are going on — and understand bugs and ways to optimise.<br>— Harlan Wood, hApp developer</blockquote><p>Even Guillem discovered fun <a href="https://youtu.be/rA_SvneAhQE?t=1100">surprises</a> as they played with a copy of Eric’s Where app.</p><p>If you’d like to understand a bit more about why this could be useful to you, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/rA_SvneAhQE">Holochain in Action demo</a>. When you’re ready to try it out, download it from the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-playground/holochain-playground">GitHub repo</a> and watch the video again for usage instructions.</p> Holochain In Action: countersigning <p>If, like me, you’ve been enjoying the entertaining, explorative, and educational Holochain In Action videos, there are four or five new ones since last Dev Pulse. They cover interesting topics like test-driven design with Sweettest, creating a minimum viable NFT implementation, and more. I thought this one looked particularly educational: countersigning and multi-party signatures. Since countersigning will be an important part of any sort of transactional app, it seems important to get a good grounding in how it works.</p><p>You can find all the other videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwIuwkCI5HMSzHJpKys-RQ/videos">here</a>.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@mphotographym?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Moritz Mentges</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hammer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 A Public&nbsp;Q&amp;A <p>In October Caribou Digital convened a discussion around the use of geospatial technology and data for humanitarian crises. We were privileged to be joined by UKHIH Caribou Space fellows<a href="https://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/nakalembe/catherine"> Catherine Nakalembe</a> (Associate Research Professor, University of Maryland),<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mapmakerdavid/?originalSubdomain=nz"> David Garcia</a> (PhD candidate at University of Canterbury, Christchurch looking at geospatial technologies) and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stella-chelangat-22a1a8177/?originalSubdomain=ke"> Stella Chelangat</a> (Geospatial and remote sensing expert) as well as over forty people from different backgrounds and organisations.</p><blockquote>A recording of the session <a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/rec/share/wETYmRqtFQkc6XTjz2AMB1wLi56FcTCmZ2_9Shvi7Kv4t5nUXUpuA22s1mRchzT4.mL8YWvGtTU1X9B2U">is available here</a>.</blockquote><p>The discussion focused on the Fellows’ cutting edge research and their work on mapping the geospatial technology for humanitarian crises sector, and covered a wide range of topics from Catherine’s insights into the application of technologies and data, David’s deep understanding of community uses of geospatial data and Stella’s rich experience of using satellite technology and geospatial data for humanitarian response. Amongst others, one underlying theme that ran through much of the discussion was the importance of the bridges and connections between the technical dimensions of satellite technologies and geospatial data and the users and impact of these innovative data&nbsp;sources.</p> The data is out&nbsp;there <p>Stella described the importance of satellite data for humanitarian response, saying ‘It allows us to understand the hazards, the services and the needs prior to humanitarian event after humanitarian event.’ but that it also played an important role in anticipatory humanitarian action — ‘particularly in areas that face conflict in Eastern Africa, including South Sudan and Ethiopia’. Stella went on to describe in Kenya, satellite data is available, but it’s application always depends on the use and their knowledge. Catherine went on to describe how at a macro level resources such as the Google Earth Engine and the Sentinel hub, which provides detailed data and analysis exist — as she put it, ‘the resources are out there. You just have to know how to find them’&nbsp;.</p> From data to application <p>But the existence of data does not necessarily translate into application. Catherine went on to describe her perception of the gap between the advanced technical research work producing data and the application of geospatial data, and a sense that ‘nobody wants to do the in-between work. And that in-between work is really important when engaging with different stakeholders’. This is particularly striking from field experience, where she described ‘the chaos of setting up, you know, buildings and structures, giving people support and aid has no relationship with a geographical interface because sometimes there’s even no power or no internet’. This leads to a sense that there is ‘this in-between void between the satellite application and the practical implications on the&nbsp;ground’.</p><p>David, drawing on his experience of working with communities, elaborated on this, and how important he found it to view mapping in a social and technical way — ‘So for example, I deal with shapefiles and rasters. At the same time, I have to face the community’. David shared three keywords that helped illustrate the challenge of applying geospatial data in practice: It’s about accuracy, it’s about accessibility and about accountability: accuracy in terms of making sure that information is accurate in response to people’s needs, describing how as needs changed the data didn’t — ‘the imagery focused on the buildings, so we couldn’t trace the reefs, an important part of our long long-term resilience’. Accessibility refers to the presence of really easy to use open geospatial tools — ‘One of my favourites is Field Papers. I just go to the website and then select an area of interest. I select how many A4 papers I want to spread the map over. And then the website generates a map layout based on OpenStreetMap. After printing the PDF, I could lay the maps side by side and tape them together. Our mapping team can then go to do fieldwork without the need for a large-format printer, especially in rural areas’. Finally, accountability connects to the importance of maintaining relationships and accountability to people on the ground, especially given the temporary nature of humanitarian funding — ‘And then funding goes, but it’s the same people that’s doing the&nbsp;work’.</p> The use of data: ethics in&nbsp;practice <p>A second theme of the discussion was around the ethical use of data, which is increasingly a concern, particularly to the application of satellite and geospatial data in ways that uphold humanitarian principles.</p><p>All three Fellows emphasised the importance of incorporating ethics into the use and application of geospatial technologies and data. David illustrated this with an account of involvement in one of the OpenStreetMap pilot projects in 2013, and how he had to translate the complex concept of ethics ‘in an ordinary way, in an everyday level’ in engaging with both international diplomats and village leaders because ‘people like me who are both international and local, we have to translate this at the local level’. He went on to describe how, faced with a government that was reluctant to share detailed mapping data, the OpenStreetMap community embarked on a community mapping exercise — but in the process came up against opposition from local community to including certain spiritually and culturally significant sites and locations on the map, and had to negotiate the ‘humanitarian imperative’ of saving lives against the local concerns and values around protecting certain sacred spaces. This negotiation highlighted the challenge of translating high level, at times abstract concepts such as ‘ethics’ and ‘humanitarian principles’ into practice — and the importance of negotiating these issues with people themselves — as David concluded, ‘So I suppose there is the focus on ordinary ethics. That is one key phrase. We had to negotiate to have opportunities for both geospatial refusal and knowledge equity.’</p><p>The discussion covered a broad range of topics, from specific data availability to the challenges of applying and translating technical data into usable formats to the application of geospatial data for anticipatory humanitarian response — this is a select, edited summary of some key themes. The Beyond Borders programme continues, and will produce a report providing an overview mapping of key issues and opportunities in the sector in early 2022, while the Fellows own research complementing this programme will also be completed at the same time — and we look forward to a second public discussion around these findings. Watch the <a href="https://www.caribou.space">Caribou Space website</a> and social media channels for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>Beyond Borders is funded and supported by the UK Humanitarian Innovation Hub (UKHIH), an initiative working to overcome long standing humanitarian challenges through strategic collaborations, networks, and evidence. The UK Humanitarian Innovation Hub is funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and hosted by Elrha, a global charity that finds solutions to complex humanitarian problems through research and innovation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/satellite-and-geospatial-tech-for-humanitarian-crises-b90b670aba46">Satellite and geospatial tech for humanitarian crises</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Rise of Privacy Tech (<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/">TROPT</a>) organization recently surveyed key players in privacy tech to bridge the gaps between tech, capital and expertise in finding technological solutions to privacy problems. The results are published in the newly release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TROPT-Defining-the-Privacy-Tech-Landscape-2021-v1.0-1.pdf">whitepaper</a>,&nbsp;Defining the Privacy Tech Landscape 2021: The Rise of Privacy Tech – A Foundational Whitepaper to Help Fuel Privacy Innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were particularly interested in what B2B privacy tech buyers and consumers had to say about the privacy tech space: the privacy problems they’re trying to solve, and what they want from solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This group put forward a list of areas where they need most help from privacy tech: data minimization, retention, vendor management, de-identification, accountability tools, and what’s called “shift left privacy” tools for developers. Does your organization also need support in these areas? (Go straight to our solution,&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, or read on.)</p>



 Data minimization 



<p></p>



<p>Organizations increasingly need to adopt&nbsp;<a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/business/glossary/data-minimisation/">data minimization</a>, which is both a privacy principle and held up in legislation (such as the GDPR) as a technique that helps organizations comply with the regulation. Data minimization&nbsp;<a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/business/glossary/data-minimisation/">means</a>&nbsp;that organizations should not hold or further use data collected and processed unless it is essential for reasons that they clearly state in advance to support data privacy. The GDPR defines minimal data as data that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many organizations want automated data minimization tools that function at earlier stages in both the data and development lifecycles to help minimize privacy risks and to force them to only process relevant data. Another aspect of data minimization is cultural. The organization needs to be willing to make and maintain an inventory of the data they collect and process, how they use it and how long they keep it – and then be willing to challenge their status quo on every aspect of the inventory.</p>



 Data retention and disposition 



<p></p>



<p>End-of-life data retention and disposition can be a difficult privacy challenge to solve because holding onto data has become a default mindset for many organizations; it’s not a customer-facing function so tends to be given lower priority; it must be addressed under most data protection regulations; and shadow IT systems make retention and deletion technically difficult to solve. Shadow IT refers to IT systems that the organization doesn’t know about at the enterprise level, such as copies of data that live in other places in the organization that aren’t part of the known inventory.</p>



 Vendor and third party management 



<p></p>



<p>Organizations are seeking solutions in this area since regulators and the public are increasingly interested in how enterprises are sharing customer data with their vendors and other third parties.&nbsp;</p>



 DevPrivOps (or Shift Left privacy tools for developers) 



<p></p>



<p>Pleasingly, there’s a trend towards organizations wanting to solve privacy problems earlier on in the data lifecycle. TROPT calls this the “shift left privacy” trend and it’s extending to even before the start of the data lifecycle (before an organization begins to collect customer data) to the privacy product development stage.&nbsp;<br><br>TROPT found privacy tech buyers and consumers want to see how code and algorithms affect privacy and are hunting for code governance tools for their developers. The new goal here is to stop the privacy problems before they’re created.&nbsp;</p>



 How Sudo Platform solves these privacy concerns 



<p></p>



<p>Sudo Platform, our business toolkit of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhancing_technologies">privacy enhancing technologies</a>,&nbsp;is founded on Privacy by Design. We apply its 7 principles to designing, building and operating&nbsp;our products so our brand partners&nbsp;can move easily to a more data minimal culture. (Read&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">How We Apply the 7 Principles of Privacy by Design</a>.)</p>



<p>We designed&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;with data minimization and data retention and disposition in mind from the outset. Our consumer facing capabilities (platform, SDKs for safe browsing, VPN, password manager, etc.) preempt the potential issues privacy tech buyers and consumers described to TROPT. But not only do we provide these consumer privacy solutions, we’ve got the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">expertise</a>&nbsp;to build them in a way that adheres to privacy principles from inception.</p>



<p>For vendor and third party management, the challenge for organizations is really about knowing where they put their data. We have business processes in place to take heavy scrutiny of our suppliers. And while Sudo Platform is not a general purpose DevPrivOps tool, for the specific privacy and cybersafety&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">features</a>&nbsp;we offer in Sudo Platform, by choosing our products and the benefits of our deep engineering, privacy and security experience, our brand partners are taking a shift left approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the TROPT whitepaper reveals that privacy tech buyers and consumers look for certain features when buying privacy tech tools: product effectiveness, automation, efficiency, budget, scalability, vendor trust, and ROI.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform is not a ubiquitous or general purpose data management toolkit, but we provide significant benefits. For our brand partners, using the existing capabilities in Sudo Platform delivers a time-to-market and ROI advantage over building the same capabilities themselves. They also gain from the efficiency of integrating with Sudo Platform once to pick up multiple services, rather than going to multiple vendors and going through a vendor evaluation, selection and integration time-after-time. The more Platform products our brand partners license, the greater the efficiency benefit.</p>



<p>We’re saying to the priv tech consumer market, Sudo Platform is a great choice from a budget, efficiency and ROI perspective. Learn more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">here</a>.</p>

 Highlights <p>In a relatively new industry like blockchain, change is a constant state. When Ontology launched at the end of 2017, Bitcoin was putting crypto on the map through continuous price surges, before crashing at the end of 2018. Since this time, in an uncharted landscape that at times seemed dominated by speculation, Ontology strove to be a lighthouse in a sea of confusion, providing clear and reliable blockchain use cases that put users’ interests first. To celebrate Ontology’s 4th anniversary, Ontology and community members jointly designed the anniversary special event “Cyberspace 4 Philosophers”.</p><p>At the same time, the new version of our official website <a href="https://ont.io/">ont.io</a> was launched. The new architecture and multi-language version will bring users a better experience. With a continued focus on decentralized identity and data solutions, Ontology will bring better trust, privacy, and security to the new&nbsp;web3.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet and are 97% finished with testing.

We have finalized Ethereum RPC support and have completed internal testing. The TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 98% done with&nbsp;testing.  We have completed Ontology’s Ethereum account system development and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 97% done with&nbsp;testing.  The EVM/OEP-4 asset seamless transfer technical solution, which facilitates the efficient conversion between OEP-4 assets and EVM assets, is complete and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 100% done with&nbsp;testing.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the decimals of ONT and ONG and we are 20% done with&nbsp;testing.

  <p>Businesses have unique and complex needs. In addition to the user or organization-specific data to show, there might be a need to display different views and content conditionally. The conditions might include the user’s role or which department they belong to.  The information about a user might be part of the authenticated user’s <a>ID token as a profile claim</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a>, you can show different components or even parts of templates conditionally using built-in directives such as <code>*ngIf</code>. Using <code>*ngIf</code> works when the amount of conditional template changes are small, but what if the view has a lot changes, or if the number of conditions to evaluate increases? Managing the correct view only by using <code>*ngIf</code> becomes difficult. These types of scenarios are where <a href="https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-component-loader">dynamic components</a> are helpful. Angular has the mechanics to load components at runtime so you can dynamically display content.</p>

<p>After following the instructions in this post, you’ll have an Angular app using <a href="https://material.angular.io">Angular Material</a> UI controls that displays unique content based on an authenticated user’s claim value.</p>

<p>The main flow for the application is after initially launching a welcome page; you’ll log in using Okta from a button in the toolbar and redirect to the guarded content. The toolbar now displays your name, and you’ll see a rotation of dynamically created components based on a user claim from your ID token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this post, we’ll</p>
 
   Set up an Angular application with routing and lazy-loaded modules 
   Create an OIDC client in Okta 
   Add authentication to the Angular application 
   Capture authenticated user information and user claims 
   Simulate an external server call and implement the dynamic components 
   Complete displaying the dynamic components using the user claim value 
 

<p>We’ll be covering a lot in this post to build out a non-trivial Angular application. As a result, this post assumes some Angular knowledge. We’ll be blazing through some basics to focus on working through the dynamic components and user profile information.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>
 
   A valid version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> for Angular v13, such as Node.js 14.15 
   <a href="https://cli.angular.io">Angular CLI</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> 
 

 Scaffold the Angular application 

<p>The <a href="https://cli.angular.io">Angular CLI</a> automates creating Angular apps quickly. It makes the project folder and scaffolds the application shell. We’ll pass in the parameters to</p>
 
   add routing 
   use scss for styles 
   use inline templates 
   use inline styles 
   skip tests (The code repo includes tests to show working tests with testbed setup and authentication service spies, so feel free to include tests if you want to try that yourself.) 
 

<p>We’ll have a lot of small components in this application, so inline templates and styles will allow us to minimize the number of files to touch.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create an Angular v13 app.</p>

   <code>npx @angular/cli@13 new dynamic-components --routing --style=scss --inline-template --inline-style --skip-tests
</code>   

<p>You now have a directory named <code>dynamic-components</code> with a working application skeleton. All CLI commands in the rest of this post should be run inside the project directory.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll add the Angular Material component library to the application using their schematic. We’ll pass in the parameters to</p>
 
   set the theme 
   add typography 
   enable animations 
 

<p>Run the following command with preset values to add the Angular Material v13 library and affirm that you will proceed with the installation.</p>

   <code> ng add @angular/material@13 --theme=custom --typography=true --animations=true
</code>   

<p>Feel free to serve the app using <code>ng run</code> or <code>npm start</code> in a second terminal so you can view the changes as you progress through this post.</p>

 Create components for the initial view 

<p>With our application scaffolded and libraries added, we can now add our code. Start by creating three components: a <code>Home</code> component that contains the application’s default view, a <code>Menu</code> component to handle logging in, and a <code>Profile</code> component to display your name after authentication by running the following code.</p>

   <code>ng generate component home
ng generate component menu
ng generate component profile
</code>   

<p>We can update what we’ll first see when loading the application with these components. Open the project in your favorite IDE and open the <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> file to add <code>HomeComponent</code> as a default route, as shown below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [  
 { path: '', component: HomeComponent }  
];
</code>   

<p>Next open <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code>. We need to add some modules for the Material components we’ll use.</p>

<p>In the <code>NgModule</code> <code>imports</code> array, add the following Angular Material component modules:</p>
 
   <code>MatToolbarModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/toolbar</code> 
   <code>MatIconModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/icon</code> 
   <code>MatButtonModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/button</code> 
   <code>MatMenuModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/menu</code> 
 

<p>Now we can update the templates. Open <code>src/app/app.component.ts</code> and replace the entire component with the following code.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-root',  
  template: `  
    &lt;mat-toolbar color="primary" class="toolbar"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;My favorite work app&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;app-profile&gt;&lt;/app-profile&gt; 
        &lt;app-menu&gt;&lt;/app-menu&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/mat-toolbar&gt;
    &lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt; 
  `,  
  styles: [`  
   .toolbar { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; }
 `]  
})  
export class AppComponent { }
</code>   

<p>We added a Material toolbar that displays text, along with the contents of the <code>Profile</code> and <code>Menu</code> components. We’ll update the template of those components in a bit. Below the toolbar, the <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;</code> shows the view for the current route. You should see the output of the <code>Home</code> component when you serve the app.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/app/home/home.component.ts</code>, which is your welcome landing page. Feel free to change the template and styles to whatever suits you.</p>

<p>I added text, an illustration, and styles like below for my tastes.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-home',  
  template: `  
    &lt;div class="welcome"&gt;
      &lt;h2 class="mat-display-1"&gt;Welcome! Log in to get started.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="assets/welcome.svg" alt="welcome illustration" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; `,  
  styles: [`  
    .welcome {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;  
 
      h2 { margin: 3rem; }  
      img { width: 40%; } 
    } 
  `]  
})  
export class HomeComponent { }
</code>   

 Create module for dynamic components 

<p>Next, we’ll create a new module, <code>Protected</code>, to hold the view guarded by authentication. We can pass in the parameters for routing, creating the default component, and lazy-loading, by running the following command.</p>

   <code>ng generate module protected --routing --route=protected --module=app
</code>   

<p>This module also contains the dynamic components, interfaces, and directives for dynamic loading, which holds most of the app’s business logic.</p>

<p>There’s a directive for the component view reference named <code>DynamicDirective</code>, and a component to house the dynamic component view and orchestrate the loading called <code>DepartmentComponent</code>.</p>

<p>We’ll put all the code in the same folder by running the following code.</p>

   <code>ng generate component protected/department
ng generate directive protected/department/dynamic
</code>   

<p>Now on to the dynamically created components themselves. There’s a base interface for all dynamically created components that contains component data named <code>DynamicComponent</code>. We’re being a little tricky for the CLI here, so we need to rename the interface after we generate it manually. First, create the interface by running the following command.</p>

   <code>ng generate interface protected/department/dynamic --type=component
</code>   

<p>Open the <code>src/app/protected/department/dynamic.component.ts</code> file and rename the interface from <code>Dynamic</code> to <code>DynamicComponent</code> to help us better keep track of what the interface provides.</p>

<p>We have three dynamically created components to display content: <code>Clawesome</code>, <code>Pawesome</code>, and <code>Smiley</code>.</p>

   <code>ng generate component protected/department/clawesome --flat
ng generate component protected/department/pawesome --flat
ng generate component protected/department/smiley --flat
</code>   

<p>Let’s get the main view for the <code>Protected</code> module set up. The default view in this module shows <code>ProtectedComponent</code>, which displays a task list and the <code>DepartmentComponent</code> dynamic component loader. First, we’ll import the Material component modules, then update the <code>Protected</code> component template and styles, and populate the task list.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/app/protected/protected.module.ts</code> and add the following Material component modules to the imports array:</p>
 
   <code>MatCardModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/card</code> 
   <code>MatListModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/list</code> 
 

<p>Next open <code>src/app/protected/protected.component.ts</code>. First, we’ll set up the tasks. Create a public array for task items in the component and set the values to whatever you want. Here’s my task list.</p>

   <code>public tasks: string[] = [
  'Respond to that one email',
  'Look into the thing',
  'Reply to their inquiry',
  'Set up the automation'
];
</code>   

<p>For the <code>ProtectedComponent</code>’s template, we’ll use Material’s List component. Update the inline template and styles code to look like the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-protected',  
  template: `  
    &lt;div class="dashboard"&gt;
      &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;mat-selection-list #todo class="task-list"&gt;
          &lt;mat-list-option *ngFor="let task of tasks"&gt;  
            {{task}}  
          &lt;/mat-list-option&gt;
        &lt;/mat-selection-list&gt;
      &lt;/main&gt;
      &lt;app-department&gt;&lt;/app-department&gt;  
   &lt;/div&gt;
   `,  
  styles: [`  
    .dashboard { 
      margin-top: 2rem; display: flex;  
      main { 
        width: 75%;
        h2 { text-align: center; }
        .task-list { width: 80%; margin: auto; }
        mat-selection-list { max-width: 800px; }
      }
    }
  `]  
})
</code>   

<p>If you want to check out your work by running the application, you’ll need to manually type in the route for the <code>Protected</code> module as part of the URL.</p>

 <code>localhost:4200/protected
</code> 

<p>When we add authentication, we’ll automatically route to it.</p>

 Dynamic component loading 

<p>Next, let’s get into this exciting dynamic component loading part! Here’s how this works. The <code>Department</code> component is the container for the dynamic components, and controls which component to show. The <code>Department</code> component HTML template contains an <code>ng-template</code> element with a helper directive to identify where to add the dynamic component to the view.</p>

<p>Angular v13 included updates to the <code>ViewContainerRef</code> API to make working with dynamic components more straightforward. We could use Angular Component Development Kit (CDK) <a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/portal/overview">Portals</a> instead since it has extra helper functionality, but let’s take the updated API out for a spin. 😁</p>

<p>Each of the dynamic components needs the same base component interface. In our case, the base component interface is the <code>DynamicComponent</code> interface. Open each dynamic component file, <code>Clawesome</code>, <code>Pawesome</code>, and <code>Smiley</code>, and implement the <code>DynamicComponent</code> interface to the class. The interface is empty now, but we’ll add members later. Feel free to remove the <code>OnInit</code> lifecycle hook too. The <code>Clawesome</code> component class looks like the following example, and the <code>Pawesome</code> and <code>Smiley</code> component classes should look similar.</p>

   <code>export class ClawesomeComponent implements DynamicComponent {
   // ...remaining scaffolded code here
}
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/app/protected/department/dynamic.directive.ts</code> to inject the <code>ViewContainerRef</code>. Your code will look like the following.</p>

   <code>@Directive({  
  selector: '[appDynamic]'  
})  
export class DynamicDirective {  
  constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) { }  
}
</code>   

<p>Now on to the container component. Open <code>src/app/protected/department/department.component.ts</code>. First, we’ll update the template and styles. Update the inline template to include the template reference with the <code>Dynamic</code> directive. I added text, so my template and styles look like the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-department',  
  template: `  
   &lt;h3 class="mat-headline"&gt;Relax, you got this&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;ng-template appDynamic&gt;&lt;/ng-template&gt;
  `,  
  styles: [`  
    h3 { text-align: center; } 
  `]  
})
</code>   

<p>In the component class code, we have a bit to do. We need to load the dynamic components and rotate the components to display. We’ll hard-code the list of components to show for now, but later we’ll add a service and add in the logic for handling the user claim value.</p>

<p>We use the <code>ViewChild</code> decorator on the <code>Dynamic</code> directive to access where to insert the component. When creating the component, we pass in the component <code>Type</code>. Copy the following class code and replace your <code>DepartmentComponent</code> class code.</p>

   <code>export class DepartmentComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {  
  @ViewChild(DynamicDirective, {static: true}) private dynamicHost!: DynamicDirective;  
  private interval: number|undefined;  
  private currentIndex = 1;  
  
  private messages: { type: Type&lt;DynamicComponent&gt; }[] = [  
    { type: ClawesomeComponent },  
    { type: PawesomeComponent },  
    { type: SmileyComponent }  
  ];  
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {  
    this.loadComponent();  
    this.rotateMessages();  
  }  
  
  public ngOnDestroy(): void {  
    clearInterval(this.interval);  
  }  
  
  private loadComponent(): void {  
    if (this.messages.length === 0) return;  
    this.currentIndex = (this.currentIndex + 1) % this.messages.length;  
    const message = this.messages[this.currentIndex];  
  
    const viewContainerRef = this.dynamicHost.viewContainerRef;  
    viewContainerRef.clear();  
  
    const componentRef = viewContainerRef.createComponent&lt;DynamicComponent&gt;(message.type);  
  }  
  
  private rotateMessages(): void {  
    this.interval = window.setInterval(() =&gt; {  
      this.loadComponent();  
    }, 10000);  
  }  
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s talk through the <code>loadComponent</code> method in a little more detail. First, we make sure we’re rotating through the messages sequentially by keeping track of where in the array we are, then clearing out the previous component. To dynamically load the component, we use the directive as an anchor and create the component into its position in the DOM. The <code>createComponent</code> method requires the component type, not the instance. We use the base interface as a generic type for all the components, and use concrete component type in the method parameter.</p>

<p>If you look at your app, you’ll see the components rotating!</p>

 Add authentication 

<p>Now we can start customizing based on the user information.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You will need them in the following steps.</p>

<p>We can use the Okta-provided Angular SDK to connect to the OIDC client quickly. Add the two packages by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-angular@4 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.8 --save
</code>   

<p>Open <code>srcs/app/app.module.ts</code> and create an <code>OktaAuth</code> instance by adding the following before the <code>NgModule</code> and replacing the placeholders with the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code> from earlier.</p>

   <code>import { OKTA_CONFIG, OktaAuthModule } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
});
</code>   

<p>Next, add <code>OktaAuthModule</code> to the <code>imports</code> array and configure the provider for the <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> token, as shown below.</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...,
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth } }
  ],
  ...
})
</code>   

<p>Okta has a component for the login callback, but we need to add the route. Open <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and add the following to your routes array.</p>

   <code>{ path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
</code>   

<p>We also want to guard the <code>Protected</code> component route to authenticated users. Okta has a guard we can use. Open <code>src/app/protected/protected-routing.module.ts</code> to add a <code>canActivate</code> guard to the default route. Your routes array will look like the code snippet below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [{ path: '', component: ProtectedComponent, canActivate: [OktaAuthGuard] }];
</code>   

<p>For the actual logging in, open <code>src/app/menu/menu.component.ts</code> to add a menu with login and logout buttons. We’ll use some Okta-provided code to log in, log out, and identify the authenticated state. Update the component code to match the code below.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-menu',  
  template: `  
    &lt;button mat-icon-button aria-label="Button to open menu" [matMenuTriggerFor]="menu"&gt;  
      &lt;mat-icon&gt;menu&lt;/mat-icon&gt; 
    &lt;/button&gt; 
    &lt;mat-menu #menu="matMenu"&gt;  
      &lt;button mat-menu-item *ngIf="!isAuthenticated" (click)="login()"&gt;  
        &lt;mat-icon&gt;login&lt;/mat-icon&gt; &lt;span&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;/button&gt; 
      &lt;button mat-menu-item *ngIf="isAuthenticated" (click)="logout()"&gt;  
        &lt;mat-icon&gt;logout&lt;/mat-icon&gt; &lt;span&gt;Logout&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt; 
    &lt;/mat-menu&gt;
  `
})
export class MenuComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {  
  public isAuthenticated = false;  
  private _destroySub$ = new Subject&lt;void&gt;();  
  
  constructor(private _oktaAuth: OktaAuth, private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService, private _router: Router) { }  
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {  
   this._authStateService.authState$.pipe(  
     filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s),  
     map((s: AuthState) =&gt; s.isAuthenticated ?? false),  
     distinctUntilChanged(),  
     takeUntil(this._destroySub$)
   ).subscribe(
     (authenticated: boolean) =&gt; this.isAuthenticated = authenticated
   );  
  }  

  public ngOnDestroy(): void {
    this._destroySub.next();
  }
  
  public async login(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {  
    await this._oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect().then(  
      _ =&gt; this._router.navigate(['/protected'])  
    );  
  }  
  
  public async logout(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {  
    await this._oktaAuth.signOut();  
  }  
}
</code>   

<p>Now that you can log in let’s get your name displayed in the toolbar. Open <code>src/app/profile/profile.component.ts</code>.  Okta’s auth state has user info. Notice it’s also available through a claim. Replace the <code>Profile</code> component code with the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-profile',  
  template: `  
    &lt;ng-container *ngIf="name$ | async as name "&gt;
      &lt;span class="mat-body-1"&gt;{{name}}&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;/ng-container&gt; 
`})  
export class ProfileComponent {  
  public name$: Observable&lt;string&gt; = this._authStateService.authState$.pipe( 
    filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s &amp;&amp; !!s.isAuthenticated),  
    map((s: AuthState) =&gt; s.idToken?.claims.name ?? '')  
  );  
  
  constructor(private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService) { }  
}
</code>   

<p>Now you see your name when you log in to the application.</p>

 Format the dynamic components 

<p>All the messages have data to display. The data always includes an URL plus other content that is unique to each component. Let’s define the interface to support the message data. Run the following command to create the interface.</p>

   <code>ng generate interface message
</code>   

<p>There’ll be three different message formats, one for each dynamic component. So we’ll define a message type, standardized data properties, and a class that holds the type and data properties. Open <code>src/app/message.ts</code> and replace the contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>export type MessageType = 'Pawesome' | 'Clawesome' | 'Smiley';  
  
export interface MessageData {  
  url: string;  
  content?: any;  
}  
  
export class MessageItem {  
  constructor(public type: MessageType, public data: MessageData) { }  
}
</code>   

<p>When we created the dynamic components earlier, they all implemented the same base interface, <code>DynamicComponent</code>. Since all the dynamic components have some data, we need to update the <code>DynamicComponent</code> interface to reflect this shared property that all the components will implement.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/app/protected/department/dynamic.component.ts</code> and add a property named <code>data</code> of type <code>MessageData</code> to it. The interface now looks like the following.</p>

   <code>export interface DynamicComponent {  
  data: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>Because we have separate components specifically designed to handle each message type, we keep the logic very straightforward. We’ll apply template updates to each component and implement all the interface members by adding an input property to accept the data.</p>

<p>Start by opening <code>src/app/protected/department/clawesome.component.ts</code>. This component’s data has an URL to an image and string content.  Update the component to the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-clawesome',  
  template:  `  
    &lt;mat-card class="card"&gt;
      &lt;img mat-card-image src="{{data.url}}" alt="Photo of a clawesome creature" &gt;  
      &lt;mat-card-content&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{data.content}}&lt;/p&gt;  
      &lt;/mat-card-content&gt;
    &lt;/mat-card&gt;
  `,  
  styles: [` .card { max-width: 300px; } `]  
})  
export class ClawesomeComponent implements DynamicComponent {  
 @Input() data!: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>Each component is a Material card control with an image to display. Next open <code>src/app/protected/department/pawesome.component.ts</code>. In addition to the URL, content contains the properties <code>name</code> and <code>about</code>. Update the component to the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-pawesome',  
  template: `  
    &lt;mat-card class="card"&gt;
      &lt;mat-card-header&gt;
        &lt;mat-card-title&gt;{{data.content.name}}&lt;/mat-card-title&gt;  
        &lt;mat-card-subtitle&gt;Good doggo&lt;/mat-card-subtitle&gt;
      &lt;/mat-card-header&gt;
      &lt;img mat-card-image src="{{data.url}}" alt="Photo of a pawesome creature" &gt;  
      &lt;mat-card-content&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; {{data.content.about}} &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/mat-card-content&gt;
    &lt;/mat-card&gt;
  `,  
  styles: [` .card { max-width: 300px; } `]  
})  
export class PawesomeComponent implements DynamicComponent {  
 @Input() data!: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, open <code>src/app/protected/department/smiley.component.ts</code>. The only data in this message type is the URL. Update the component to the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-smiley',  
  template: `  
    &lt;mat-card class="card"&gt;
      &lt;img mat-card-image src="{{data.url}}" alt="Photo of a smiley creature" &gt;  
      &lt;mat-card-content&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SMILE!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/mat-card-content&gt;
    &lt;/mat-card&gt; `,  
  styles: [` .card { max-width: 300px; } `]
})  
export class SmileyComponent implements DynamicComponent {  
 @Input() public data!: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>The rotating components look a little goofy now and you’ll see a lot of errors in the console, but we’ll get it fixed up soon.</p>

 Add claim in Okta dashboard 

<p>Next, we need to add the claim. We’ll assign a department to the user and create a claim that pulls in the department value. We can do this in the Okta dashboard. Navigate to Directory &gt; People and click the user you’ll log in with.</p>

<p>Navigate to the Profile tab and press Edit. Scroll down to Department and enter the number <code>1</code>. We’ll label the department names as either <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> for ease of coding.</p>

<p>Since we see different content by user claim, it’s helpful to have more than one user. If you have a second user, update their department name to <code>2</code>, but you can also edit the department value between logging in.</p>

<p>For the claim, navigate to Security &gt; API and select your Authorization Server to edit in the Okta dashboard. If you are using a Developer Account, you’ll have one named “default”. In your “default” Authorization Server, navigate to the Claims tab. Press the Add Claim button to create a new claim. Name your claim “department”, always include it in the “ID Token”, and set its value to <code>user.profile.department</code>. Your inputs should look like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The ID token now contains the new claim with the value of the user’s department.</p>

<p></p>

 Use claims in the application 

<p>The dynamic components are cool, but they don’t do anything yet. The value of dynamic components is that the component contents change, and we can show whatever data in the component we want. Let’s add the code to see how flexible dynamic components are. We need a service that emulates a server response to return messages. Run the following command to create the service.</p>

   <code>ng generate service message
</code>   

<p>The <code>MessageService</code> returns messages the company wants to display to its users. All messages have a URL, and some have additional content to display. Open <code>src/app/message.service.ts</code> and add the following code to fake out message responses as a private class property.</p>

   <code>private messages: MessageItem[] = [  
  {  
    type: 'Clawesome',

      content: 'Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, too cute for human to get mad'
    }
  },  
  {  
    type: 'Pawesome',
    data: {

      content: {

      }  
     }
  },  
  {  
    type: 'Pawesome',
    data: {  
      url: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/825949/pexels-photo-825949.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1260&amp;h=750&amp;dpr=1',  
      content: {  
        name: 'Pittunia',  
        about: 'Maximum adorable shooberino'  
      }  
    } 
  },  
  {  
    type: 'Pawesome',
      data: {  
        url: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/406014/pexels-photo-406014.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1260&amp;h=750&amp;dpr=1',  
        content: {  
          name: 'Bay',  
          about: 'Long snoot for pats'  
        }

  },  
  {  
    type: 'Smiley',
    data: {  
      url: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/2168831/pexels-photo-2168831.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940'  
    }  
  },  
  {  
    type: 'Smiley',
    data: {  
      url: 'https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/06/17/13/11/axolotl-2412189_960_720.jpg'  
    }  
  }  
];
</code>   

<p>There’s one more property to add. A real server call should only return the messages relevant to the department of the caller. Users of department “1” shouldn’t see the messages for department “2” by inspecting the network response. We’ll handle this within the service by creating a mapping for message types by the department. Add the <code>departmentMapping</code> property and update the constructor for the service as shown below.</p>

   <code>private departmentMapping: Map&lt;number, MessageType[]&gt; = new Map&lt;number, MessageType[]&gt;();  
  
constructor() {  
  this.departmentMapping.set(1, ['Smiley']);  
  this.departmentMapping.set(2, ['Pawesome', 'Clawesome']);  
}
</code>   

<p>Now let’s add a method to get the messages. Add the following code to filter the hard-coded messages.</p>

   <code>public getMessages(department: number): MessageItem[] {  
  const messageTypes = this.departmentMapping.get(department) ?? [];  
  return this.messages.filter(m =&gt; messageTypes.includes(m.type));  
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to call this service method. To do so, we’ll read the claims values of the authenticated user and pass in the department to the <code>getMessages</code> method. We’ll access the claim through the ID token from Okta’s auth state subject. Even though we’re in a guarded route, we’ll still add the safety measures to verify the user authentication, and to return a default value if the claim isn’t on the ID token for some reason. Open <code>src/app/protected/protected.component.ts</code> and update to the following code.</p>

   <code>export class ProtectedComponent implements OnInit {  
  // ... task list property here don't delete 
  
  public messages: MessageItem[] = [];  
  
  constructor(private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService, private _messageService: MessageService) { }  
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {  
    this._authStateService.authState$.pipe(  
      filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s &amp;&amp; !!s.isAuthenticated),  
      map((s: AuthState) =&gt; +s.idToken?.claims['department'] ?? 0),  
      take(1)  
    ).subscribe(  
      (d: number) =&gt; this.messages = this._messageService.getMessages(d)  
    );  
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We now have a list of messages to display to the user. We’ll pass this to the dynamic component’s container component to action. In the inline template for <code>ProtectedComponent</code>, update the <code>&lt;app-department&gt;</code> element to pass in <code>messages</code> as an input property. You’ll see an error in the IDE since we haven’t created the input property in the Department component yet. The element in the inline template will look like the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;app-department [messages]="messages"&gt;&lt;/app-department&gt;
</code>   

<p>You can probably see where this is going. Now we’ll update the Department component to support the input property. Open <code>src/app/protected/department/department.component.ts</code>. Replace the hardcoded private <code>messages</code> property into a public input property like the code snippet below.</p>

   <code>@Input() public messages: MessageItem[] = [];
</code>   

<p>You’ll have a new error in the app because our code in the <code>loadComponent</code> method expects a component type. We’ll add a factory method to return the component type to create by matching the <code>MessageType</code> to the component type like the following example.</p>

   <code>private componentTypeFactory(type: MessageType): Type&lt;DynamicComponent&gt; {  
  let comp: Type&lt;DynamicComponent&gt;;  
  if (type === 'Pawesome') {  
    comp = PawesomeComponent;  
  } else if (type === 'Clawesome') {  
    comp = ClawesomeComponent;  
  } else {  
    comp = SmileyComponent;  
  }  
 return comp;  
}
</code>   

<p>Then we can update the <code>loadComponent</code> method to use the factory method. We also have message data to pass into the components, although the dynamic components can’t support the input property. Update the code and add the new line of code to pass data to the components like the code block below.</p>

   <code>const componentRef = viewContainerRef.createComponent&lt;DynamicComponent&gt;(this.componentTypeFactory(message.type));  
componentRef.instance.data = message.data;
</code>   

<p>Now everything should compile, and you should have a working app that displays a rotating set of cute animals images to help you power through working on that task list. Try logging in as a user with a different department (or change the department value for yourself in the Okta dashboard) to see the various dynamic components at work.</p>

As one veteran Basel-ite who had an exhibition at Design Miami explained to me — and I’m dutifully paraphrasing here — Art Basel is the one major art festival (or really, marketplace) where you’ll see world class contemporary art sitting side by side next to world class clickbait.</p><p>(You all remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian_(artwork)">the infamous banana</a> that made headlines pre-COVID.)</p><p>That clickbait — perhaps unsurprisingly — emerged in the form of all things crypto this&nbsp;year:</p>  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/04/1061539871/nft-art-craze-hits-miami-art-basel">NFT art craze hits Miami Art&nbsp;Basel</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-nft-collector-hit-art-basel-miami-beach-for-a-crash-course-we-tagged-along-11638626828">A Day in the Life of an NFT Collector at Art Basel Miami Beach — Told Through&nbsp;Photos</a>  <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/12/french-montana-nft-jean-michel-basquiat-art-basel-miami">French Montana Leaks A Rare NFT Featuring Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>  <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/04/star-trek-creator-gene-roddenberrys-signature-becomes-first-living-nft/">Signature of ‘Star Trek’ creator Gene Roddenberry becomes first living NFT at Art&nbsp;Basel</a>  <a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/12/05/artist-narine-arakelian-sells-her-eggs-as-an-nft-at-art-basel/">Artist sells her eggs as an NFT at Art&nbsp;Basel</a>  <p>Art and money have always existed hand in hand so modern art’s natural symbiosis with new age money and value frameworks makes plenty of sense. Today, Art Basel’s home in Miami has crypto&nbsp;fever.</p><p>And boy were things feverish. Enthusiasm, alcohol, and money flowed freely throughout the week. Artists and entrepreneurs abound, promoting their projects. VCs diligently scampering from dinners to afterparties in search of the next big&nbsp;thing.</p><p>While crypto insiders, builders, and investors are rallying around the promise of DeFi, NFTs have brought in a whole new demographic to the space — further fueled by Facebook’s recent Metaverse pivot, providing a new form of energy centered around engagement.</p><p>There’s plenty of hype, speculation, and easy money at the moment, which leads to plenty of&nbsp;noise.</p><p>One thing was clear. It’s buzzy to talk about things like web3 and the metaverse, but these are very early days and much of the hard work is yet to be&nbsp;done.</p><p>It reminded me a bit of Bitcoin 2013 in San Jose, a formative moment in crypto’s history. There was plenty of energy and money (relatively speaking) then, too. People were already talking about concepts like smart contracts and how they might fuel a new chapter for decentralized finance — and this was before Vitalik Buterin had even published his Ethereum white paper. (That would come out later that&nbsp;year.)</p><p>But that was all it was back then. A lot of talk and some really compelling concepts. We’ve only started seeing the fruits of those labors in the last couple of&nbsp;years.</p><p>We’re going through that same process today with web3 and the metaverse.</p><p>Just as the rise of Bitcoin did back then, the prevalence of NFTs and DeFi has given us a taste of what’s possible for this next&nbsp;chapter.</p><p>Now, it’s time to&nbsp;build.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/at-art-basel-nft-fans-say-no-thanks-to-facebooks-metaverse.html">The Future of the Internet May Be Happening in Miami.

A crypto Bill of&nbsp;Rights <p><a href="https://yourcryptorights.com/">Courtesy of Binance</a>, the world’s largest crypto exchange:</p>  Every human being should have access to financial tools, like crypto, that allow for greater economic independence.  Industry participants have a responsibility to work with regulators and policymakers to shape new standards for crypto assets. Smart regulation encourages innovation and helps keep users&nbsp;safe.  Responsible crypto platforms have an obligation to protect users from bad actors and implement Know Your Customer (KYC) processes to prevent financial crimes.  Privacy is a human right, and personally identifiable information (PII) data should be subject to strict levels of protection.  Crypto users have the right to access exchanges that keep their funds secure, in safe custody with comprehensive deposit insurance.  Healthy markets should maintain a robust level of liquidity to ensure a stable and frictionless trading environment.  Regulation and innovation are not mutually exclusive. Crypto users deserve safe access to emerging technologies and practices, including NFTs, stablecoins, staking, yield-farming, and&nbsp;more.  Closing the knowledge gap is essential when it comes to crypto. Users have the right to accurate information on crypto assets, without fear of falling victim to unfair or deceptive advertising.  Marketplaces that offer derivative instruments should be subject to the appropriate regulations. This ensures all users meet eligibility requirements and that their transactions are fairly&nbsp;settled.  Crypto regulation is inevitable.* Users have the right to share their voice on how the industry should evolve with their blockchain platform of&nbsp;choice.   4.

<p>Open banking technology is responding to the demands of an expanding market, creating new payment choices for consumers within the ACH network. Electronic payments are growing at an exponential rate, quarter by quarter. In<a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/ach-network-sees-record-growth-2020-268-billion-payments"> 2020 alone</a>, 26.8 billion payments were initiated, moving $61.9 trillion, up 10.8% from 2019. Internet-initiated consumer payments for bills, account transfers and other payments increased 15% to more than 7.7 billion. It’s clear that open banking payment apps and services are a major factor contributing to the increased ACH volume, and they are gaining mass adoption due to the added value of digital enablement.</p>
<p>The transition to convenient digital payments and banking services is picking up speed. Friction-hampered, outdated account validation processes are increasingly unacceptable to consumers. Remember when borrowers faxed in voided checks to set up ACH payments? While ridiculous today, clunky account validation processes persist. Loan servicers need accurate data to confirm account ownership. Finicity, a Mastercard company, and its open banking platform simplifies this and expands possibilities for both lenders and borrowers through the FinicityPay solution set.</p>
<p>Using ACH transactions, Financial Institutions can set up a new account, fund a loan, retrieve closing costs and origination fees, or set up recurring payments across mortgage, auto, small business and personal loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FinicityPay serves up rich data sets in seconds, verifying account details, account owners and balances to enable accurate, confident payments. Our real-time retrieval of account financial data helps mitigate fraud risk, reduce payment failures and fees, enable onboarding and aid in maintaining compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Leveling Up With Finicity Open Banking 
<p>Finicity recently reached an integration agreement with<a href="https://loanpro.io/"> LoanPro</a>, a tech-forward SaaS-based solution in loan servicing software​​.</p>
<p>LoanPro will utilize consumer-permissioned data and smart analytics from FinicityPay solutions to verify account ownership and account credentials to fund loans, and help mitigate payment failure and fraud. LoanPro’s SaaS-based loan servicing, management, and collections platform offers a full-featured, configuration-first, API-based lending solution, designed to streamline both loan servicing and loan collections workflows. FinicityPay seamlessly adds real-time account verification capabilities to LoanPro’s digital repayment solutions.</p>
<p>Using Finicity’s smart data, account owner and balance check, can be verified in seconds, before initiating a payment. LoanPro can now offer improved payment success rates, reducing the risk of NSF fees. Payment fraud and failure are also minimized with FinicityPay’s secure, encrypted digital data flow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Finicity’s work with LoanPro is a great example of how open banking can help providers create a seamless payments experience,” said Steve Smith, Chief Engagement Officer, Open Banking at Mastercard. “Through the integration, LoanPro’s customers will be able to validate account information in real time before pushing out funds and scheduling repayments, initiating a more strategic and accessible approach to loan servicing.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for digital repayment solutions, as<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/us-digital-payments-achieving-the-next-phase-of-consumer-engagement"> consumers move more of their finances online</a>. LoanPro’s Loan Management System (LMS) software integration with Finicity Pay adds speed, security, and increased payment success to the platform, an absolute necessity as the growing payments market goes digital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Pay Confidently 
<p>With FinicityPay, you receive fast, reliable data from the largest financial institutions, with 95% market coverage. The deep learning analytics layer in our data services mitigates fraud risk, payment failure and fees. Finicity’s solution suite is also aligned with<a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits"> Nacha’s WEB Debit Rule</a>, so consumers and businesses can set up and manage their accounts with confidence.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce the launch of the Dock Wallet on mobile, the app is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dock-crypto-wallet/id1565227368">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dockapp">Play Store</a>. This is a significant milestone for Dock, as not only can community members now store, send, receive, and manage Dock tokens from their mobile device, it will serve as an important gateway to a number of planned Dock innovations. </p><p>The Dock team has been developing the app since March 2021 with a vision to provide a safe, secure and convenient mobile wallet for storing and transacting with Dock tokens. Importantly, Dock’s Wallet App gives the token holder full control over their DOCK tokens as the wallet enables them to control and manage their own private keys, allowing them to send and receive tokens without the involvement of any third party.</p><p>Dock Wallet App vs. Crypto Exchanges</p><p>Existing centralised crypto exchanges are in control of the tokens held on their platforms; to send, receive, lock, or withdraw cryptocurrency, the network must first approve of this transaction. With these so-called custodial wallets, there are many security considerations including; (1) them being hacked or (2) blocking your access to your account for a certain reason if they feel it’s necessary.</p><p>With Dock’s Wallet App, and as previously mentioned, the token holder is in control of the private key, can send, receive, withdraw, and manage their tokens without the permission or input of any third party. The user creates their own recovery phrase and can create several accounts on the App. </p><p>Work before the launch</p><p>Developing the App began on the 29th March, and engineering came into play around the 10th June. Full steam ahead, Dock relied on the community to help with beta testing which took place on and after the 22nd September. After getting some great feedback and suggestions from the community, our expert engineers worked out the bugs and took the suggestions into consideration. In mid October, the Dock team submitted the App to the App Store and Play Store - the Play Store had approved of the App within a few days, followed by the App Store a week later. By the 22nd October, the App has been approved to go live on both Apple and Android devices. </p><p>Shortly after, the app was audited by Oak Security. We’ve published the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-app/blob/master/audit-reports/OakSecurity-AuditReport-Wallet-v0.1.pdf">full report here</a>. We are happy to announce that all discovered issues have been resolved. The audit was completed on the 6th December. </p><p>This is just the start</p><p>As mentioned above, the wallet not only represents a much improved user experience for the Dock community today, but it will also be a building block for new features. Future iterations will include the ability for individuals to receive, store and send verifiable identity and credentials, as well as staking and governance features. Watch this space...</p><p>Download</p><p>Download the Dock Wallet App from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dock-crypto-wallet/id1565227368">AppStore</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dockapp">PlayStore</a> here.</p>

<p>As more and more people are turning to working from home, with a vast majority of those people living in huge epicenters around Europe, we are seeing a few growing trends within the mobility industry. The major trend is the versatility in which people are getting from A to B and the conveniency it offers.</p>



<p>A study from McKinsey expects the annual growth rate for shared-mobility solutions to exceed 20 percent through 2030. With this prediction, the way in which mobility is seen, used and offered will change and the requirements will need to be met.</p>



<p>Aspects such as flexibility, price, conveniency and sustainability must be incorporated in order to stay relevant and competitive. But what exactly are consumers using and why are we seeing these trends? Let’s have a look:</p>



 Top Trends: 



  Micro-mobility: The first trend we are seeing is an increase in popularity of what has come to be called micro-mobility. This includes all small vehicles used by an individual such as a bike, e-bike, e-scooter, moped, etc. It is a very practical solution for those that don’t have a far commute or reside in large cities where smaller modes of transportation are easier and more convenient.  Car-sharing/car-hailing: A somewhat new phenomena for getting around is a concept known as car-sharing/car-hailing. Easily book a car for a short period of time or order a ride to take you where you need to go. This type of traveling is better when the distances are greater between destinations and is just as accessible as micro-mobility.  



 Reasons for the rise in shared-mobility in a digitized on-demand world 



<p>Both of these somewhat new mobility trends change the way of how we view transportation due to the fact that there isn’t a need to personally own a vehicle. But why are we seeing these trends coming into the mobility market?</p>



  Home Office. With the majority of people working from home these days, there is no longer the necessity to own a personal vehicle. Why waste time and money on something that you don’t need every day? Car-sharing or car-hailing becomes more practical and is as simple as a click on your smartphone.  Global Pandemic. The Corona virus has changed many aspects of our lives and one of those would be the urgent need to get from A to B. Instead, there’s less of a demand for constant or immediate transportation. Plus, micro-mobility is more appealing due to the fact that there is minimal contact with other people when traveling.  Sustainable. When comparing micro-mobility and car-sharing/hailing to other forms of transportation, these two new trends are far more eco-friendly. Many of the smaller vehicles are sustainable and there are even options for electric vehicles. The future of mobility is greener with the help of these rising trends.  Cheaper. When considering the costs of owning a personal vehicle, around half of the people underestimate the total amount. Car ownership is not to be taken lightly, as unexpected costs can arise. Both car-sharing/hailing and micro-mobility offer a less expensive option based on traveling needs.  Convenient. The conveniency is extremely desirable with these up-and-becoming trends since living in larger cities can pose obstacles for personal autos. Instead, e-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing and other options are readily available without wasting any time.  Flexible. When owning your own vehicle, there aren’t many options for switching to a different model and trying something new. However, with micro-mobility and car-sharing, the choice is yours whenever you want. The options are there to fit your lifestyle and not the other way around.  



 







 Convenience through Security 



<p>As mobility becomes more flexible and diverse, security plays a major role in leading the future of mobility. Companies and consumers want to know they can trust one another because safety is everyone’s concern. End users of these services are not only looking for convenience, but also secure mobility options. They need to trust that they are getting exactly what they are looking for in a transportation service.</p>



<p>In return, mobility providers want to deliver on that because they know that the more convenient and secure their service is the higher the conversion rate. Therefore, security is a two-way street for both the consumers and the companies because when convenience is met by providing a secure and reliable service, conversions rates rise.</p>



<p>Furthermore, when automated ID verification is integrated into the onboarding process it increases the confidence of users in using a certain mobility provider. Onboarding feels safe, robust, straightforward and convenient for consumers while also being flexible to the services through easy integration into a mobility app with different languages in the interface.</p>



<p>IDnow is there to assist in this endeavor with products such as AutoIdent or AutoIdent with e-sign add-on. With an onboarding process of only a couple of minutes, consumers have the conveniency they are searching for, while companies meet KYC needs. Trust is our top priority and we wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>



 Why conveniency and security should be at the top of your priority list 



<p>Not only have we mentioned that the right balance of conveniency and security will increase your conversion rates, but it will give you a step-up from your competitors. Because users are looking for these two main aspects in a mobility service, if you don’t provide it, or aren’t fast enough, they will easily find the next scooter or car that does provide what they are looking for. Looking ahead gives you the benefit of knowing what consumers want and need, and they will thank you for it by choosing you every time.</p>

<p>The UK Government plans to ‘reform’ data protection law to replace citizen data rights with corporate data&nbsp;rights.</p><p>The paper containing its proposals, Data: A New Direction, has 51,503 words. But you only need 58 of them to get to its essence (if you can find&nbsp;them).</p><p>The Government, says the paper, intends to “create a limited, exhaustive list of legitimate interests for which organisations can&nbsp;… process personal data without unnecessary recourse to consent.” [Paragraph 57]. One of these ‘legitimate interests’ (where no consent is required) would be “Managing or maintaining a database to ensure that records of individuals are accurate and up to date, and to avoid unnecessary duplication.” [Paragraph 58&nbsp;(i)]</p><p>The “bold new data regime” created by this carefully crafted wrecking amendment (supported by many others) would replace today’s core principle for data protection legislation — that organisations should only process individuals’ data for ‘specified, explicit purposes’ — with a new general corporate right to data surveillance: the right to maintain databases about individuals without their&nbsp;consent.</p><p>The Government’s stated reason for these reforms is its wish to “usher in a new golden age of growth and innovation” [Ministerial Foreword] by creating “​​a better balance” between data protection and data use. [Paragraph 59] In other words, it’s based on the idea that there is an unavoidable trade-off between data protection rights and innovation and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>This narrative is flawed from start to finish. Everything the Government says it wants to achieve could be achieved without major changes to existing legislation and by enhancing rather than abolishing citizens’ control over their data. The Government wants a ‘new direction’ for personal data, but it has chosen the wrong direction.</p><p>This blog, the second in a series prompted by the UK Government’s proposals, shows why — and in doing so also shows why a practical, positive, citizen-empowering alternative to what the Government is suggesting already exists and is ready and waiting to be implemented.</p> The ‘trade-off’ myth <p>The thinking behind the Government’s proposals goes something like&nbsp;this:</p><p>“1. Personal data can play a huge role in enabling innovation that drives economic growth that benefits both citizens and businesses.</p><p>2. But organisations’ ability to access and use this data is being constrained by data protection regulations such as&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>3. Therefore, to unleash personal data’s innovation and growth potential, citizens’ rights need to be curtailed.”</p><p>Some other sub-narratives go along with this story. They include the ideas&nbsp;that:</p>  The innovations we’re talking about will take the form of ‘products’ that will be sold for money in ‘markets’ (where ‘amount of extra money made’ is the best or only way to measure the resulting ‘growth’)  By definition, this innovation and growth will be generated by the private&nbsp;sector.  <p>Let’s start with the sub-narratives first.</p> Myth #1: ‘Innovation takes the form of products that generate growth by being sold in&nbsp;markets’ <p>This may be true on some occasions. But not always. In our last blog we showed that data’s <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">biggest source of value lies in its reliability</a> — that if you can be confident that the data you are using is correct, you can use it without the costs and risks of making mistakes or having to invest time and effort ensuring that these mistakes are not&nbsp;made.</p><p>This being case, the most important form of innovation made possible by data lies&nbsp;in:</p>  better processes for making reliable data available — not separate ‘products’&nbsp;…  primarily relating to the more efficient, effective administration by which stuff gets done — not selling a product, or data, in ‘markets’&nbsp;…  resulting in cost reductions — not the ‘new revenue streams’ by which ‘growth’ is usually measured. (In fact, by enabling system-wide reductions in friction, effort, risk and cost, better uses of reliable data could result in a reduction of GDP because it involves less money being spent: GDP measures money spent not real value created.)  enabled by new data logistics infrastructure that helps people and organisations to get exactly the right (reliable, up-to-date, accurate, complete) data to and from the right parties in the right formats at the right times — not a separate, additional activity called ‘new product development’.  <p>Developing such infrastructure is a hugely important arena of innovation because it supports all the monitoring, decision-making, planning, organising, coordinating, implementation and administration that is needed wherever services are delivered to individuals across all industries and sectors — and it does not need to compromise citizens’ data protection rights in any&nbsp;way.</p><p>To the contrary, its best achieved by enhancing them, by providing individuals with their own personal data stores which enable them to collect and share their own data under their control. This approach is already being pursued in the public sector by the Scottish Government with its <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a> (and by Mydex CIC). But it is ignored by the UK Government in its proposed ‘reforms’.</p> Myth #2: ‘The private sector is the source and driver innovation’ <p>Again, this may be true. But not&nbsp;always.</p><p>Developing the infrastructure needed for improved availability of reliable data is an innovation that can (and needs to) take place everywhere: in the private sector and the public sector and the third sector (charities, social enterprises and so on). Yet, by focusing its attention on the private sector the Government’s proposals miss this opportunity.</p> Myth #3: ‘To innovate better, organisations need access to more&nbsp;data” <p>As ever, this may be true. But not&nbsp;always.</p><p>The story told by ‘Big Data’ enthusiasts is that organisations always need more data, because more data means they can generate better ‘insights’. But if the biggest economic benefits come from better administrative processes using reliable data, the key source of added value is not ‘insights’ made available by ‘more data’, but efficiencies made possible by the ability to access exactly the right data at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>It’s worth exploring this a little more because of all the myths behind the Government’s disastrous proposals, this is probably the biggest&nbsp;one.</p><p>The vast majority of organisations that collect and use personal data to provide services do not need ‘more’ data. They need the right data for their specific&nbsp;service.</p><p>An online retailer doesn’t need to know your blood type. A doctor doesn’t need to know your bank balance. Whatever the service we are talking about, whether it is diagnosing an illness, assessing eligibility to a loan or a benefit, purchasing a product or ticket online, switching an energy supplier etc, delivery of the service in question depends on the availability of the exact data needed to complete that particular operation.</p><p>In such scenarios, which account for the vast majority of real life uses of data, ‘more data’ doesn’t drive value. To the contrary, it drives waste. A product manufacturer who has to handle a wide range of components that are not needed to make its product simply incurs extra unnecessary costs. Likewise, a service provider processing extra&nbsp;data.</p><p>Yes, service quality, timeliness and efficiency is compromised if any key data points are missing. To that degree, service providers may need to get hold of data that they don’t currently hold. But the key issue here is not accessing ‘more data’ in general. It is about being able to access the right data, which takes us back to data logistics infrastructure.</p><p>In fact, ‘more data’ is only needed in a very small proportion of activities. They boil down to two categories. Activities such as research and the use of training data in AI do indeed need ‘more data’ to get better results, but they don’t need personal data. That’s because they are using data for statistical analysis where anonymised data does the job just as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The only industry that always wants more personal data is ad-tech. The inner logic of data-driven advertising targeting flies directly in the face of data protection. To achieve perfect targeting (e.g. to eliminate waste and error in targeted messaging) you need a perfect profile, and to achieve a perfect profile you need to know all there is to know about the individual concerned. People may argue about the social and economic pros and cons of advertising itself. But the ad-tech industry is a different kettle of fish. It is an intrinsically totalitarian project.</p><p>Advertising accounts for around 1.5% of all economic activity. Basing a wholesale re-write of 25 years’ worth of regulatory fine-tuning on the needs of a tiny, toxic offshoot is not a sound way forward. But that is what the Government appears to be&nbsp;doing.</p> Myth #4: “Growth comes from helping organisations to improve their operations” <p>At first sight, this seems obvious. Who else is going to ‘innovate’?</p><p>But what this statement actually articulates is an innovation-constraining organisation-centric assumption. The organisation-centric mindset assumes that the only entities that can (and therefore should) collect and use personal data are organisations — not people themselves, because it is only organisations that do stuff with data. According to this view, individuals are (and always should be) treated as data subjects (as they are called under the GDPR data protection regulations).</p><p>Data subjects are not empowered to collect and use their own data for their own purposes. Rather, organisations collect data about these data subjects and use this data for their own organisations’ purposes (which may be benign or malign: see Myth #5&nbsp;below).</p><p>But what would happen if individuals were able to collect and use their own data to manage their lives better (just as organisations collect and use data to manage their operations better)? What would happen if individuals could become the point where information about themselves is aggregated and integrated, directly under their control, rather than having their data dispersed across hundreds of separate and different organisational data&nbsp;silos?</p><p>Answer: an explosion of innovation focused on improving citizens’ lives by helping them use their own data to make better decisions and get stuff done in their lives. This is a whole new dimension of innovation — a vast new continent of opportunity — that is still waiting to be explored. And, far from creating a trade-off between data protection rights and innovation and growth, it relies on the opposite: on empowering citizens with their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Given this enormous untapped opportunity for innovation and growth, you would think the UK Government would be bending over backwards to promote it. But no. None of its proposals address this opportunity. Instead, they all reinforce the organisation-centric assumption that charges in exactly the opposite direction — of disempowering citizens, minimising their ability to control their own data&nbsp;… and ignoring opportunities for innovation that don’t fit its preconceptions.</p> Myth #5: “All ‘innovation’ is, by definition, a good&nbsp;thing” <p>Usually, when people talk about innovation, the unquestioned underlying assumption is that all innovation is a good thing, by definition. This is the assumption behind the UK Government’s proposed&nbsp;reforms.</p><p>But it is palpable nonsense. Nuclear bombs were an innovation. Fraudsters are constantly innovating: coming up with new, better ways to con people out of their money. Cambridge Analytica was profoundly innovative. So it is simply not true that all innovations make peoples’ lives better. Many do the exact opposite.</p><p>In fact, a recent research review of the history of innovation and entrepreneurship* concluded that throughout history there have been two types of entrepreneurship, resulting in two types of innovation: productive and unproductive/parasitic, with unproductive innovators “seeking to obtain a larger slice of the pie for themselves, rather than increasing the size of the pie for everyone”.</p><p>Here is the study’s conclusion:</p><blockquote>“How the entrepreneur acts at a given time and place depends heavily on the rules of the game, the reward structure in the economy, that happen to prevail&nbsp;… It is the set of rules and not the supply of entrepreneurs or the nature of their objectives that undergoes significant changes from one period to another.”</blockquote><p>By depriving citizens of most of their current rights under data protection law, the UK Government is trying to change ‘the rules of the game’ to recast ‘the reward structure in the economy’ in ways that incentivise the wrong sorts of innovation. What it is proposing would not benefit citizens or bona fide service providers. Instead, it would create a breeding ground for dozens more different types of unproductive, parasitic Cambridge Analyticas.</p> Conclusion <p>The rationale behind the UK Government’s data protection ‘reforms’ is flawed, made up of a bundle of myths, misconceptions and mistaken assumptions. It misunderstands what makes personal data valuable in the first place, where the biggest opportunities for innovation and growth lie, and the role data has to play in unleashing these opportunities.</p><p>This blog has shown that the route to innovation and growth lies in an entirely different direction to the one assumed by the Government: empowering citizens with personal data store-based data logistics infrastructure that enables the right, reliable data to get to and from the right people at the right times, while keeping citizens in control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The same infrastructure can enable individuals to aggregate data about themselves that is currently dispersed across hundreds of separate organisational data silos, to create new-to-the-world citizen-centric data assets that act as engines of privacy protecting innovation.</p><p>Current data protection law does nothing to hinder these — the right sorts of innovation and growth. What the law does hinder is the collection and use of personal data without individuals’ consent for purposes that individuals have not asked for — i.e. ‘innovative’ Cambridge Analytica-style business models. Government proposals would sweep these protections — now called “impediments” — away, thereby ushering in ‘a new golden age’ of surveillance capitalism.</p><p>As far as economy boosting innovation and growth goes, it is a wild goose chase. Another wild goose chase that the Government is pinning excessive hopes on is so-called Artificial Intelligence. That is the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is Data Valuable?</a> Exposes misconceptions about the value of data, and therefore where its biggest economic potential lies.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">AI: The Emperor’s New Clothes?</a> Shows how the Government’s claims that these ‘reforms’ are needed to promote Artificial Intelligence are without foundation, and based on deep misunderstandings of AI&nbsp;itself.  <p>*The invention of enterprise: entrepreneurship from the ancient Mesopotamia to modern times, Princeton University Press, 2010, edited by David S Landes, Joel Mokyr, &amp; William J&nbsp;Baumol</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">Five Myths about Data, Innovation and Growth</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Rennes and Munich, Dec. 7, 2021, AutoIdent+QES is an all-in-one solution with qualified electronic signature (according to eIDAS v1) paired with remote identity verification, compliant with the AML-CFT Directive, available on the French market and a real alternative to a PVID service. 
<p>IDnow and ARIADNEXT, who recently joined forces (June 2021) with the purpose of becoming the KYC leader in Europe, introduce a qualified electronic signature solution paired with automatic and manual identity verification: AutoIdent+QES complies with KYC requirements of French companies under the European AML/CFT Directive.</p>
<p>As a reminder, many sectors are subject to the AML/CFT Directive: banks, insurance companies, fintech and neobanks, online gambling, etc. As part of their onboarding process (KYC), they are required to implement measures such as verification of the person’s identity document, micro-payment, identity verification by a Remote Identity Verification Provider (PVID) or qualified electronic signature. These measures can be considered as constraining, in the integration of the solution but especially in their impact on the onboarding process for end users, looking for smooth experiences.</p>
<p>The AutoIdent+QES solution, certified by an accredited body, effortlessly orchestrates a hybrid identity verification completed by a qualified electronic signature according to eIDAS. Easily integrated, it enables regulated companies to address their services in full compliance to all types of audiences (even non-banked) and delivers a complete, fluid and fast user experience, with a less than 10 minute onboarding process during which the user proves their identity.</p>
<p>A significant advantage of the AutoIdent+QES onboarding process is its total flexibility: depending on the customer’s needs, the eSign module for digital contract signing can complete the journey by enabling the signing of a contract, paving the way for other use cases, such as taking out a consumer loan in a fully digital process.</p>
<p>“With AutoIdent+QES, our customers, who operate in an ever-changing environment, have the peace of mind and flexibility to choose the solution that best meets their needs,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>
<p>Marc Norlain, co-founder of ARIADNEXT and IDnow Board Member adds “this certified solution, already available on the European market, offers a real alternative to the upcoming PVID certification in the French landscape. The AutoIdent+QES solution completes our product offering for companies required to comply with AML-CFT regulations and anticipates the upcoming certification of our PVID solution by offering a service that can be deployed by financial institutions”.</p>

  <p>Electron is one of the most popular desktop frameworks today. Electron uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for its front end and Node.js for its backend. This design enables developers to quickly write and easily maintain cross-platform applications between their desktop and web applications. Since Electron uses Node on the backend, it also has access to the entire npm ecosystem that Node developers have come to rely on.</p>

<p>Even though it is built on Node, Electron is used for desktop applications rather than web applications. This can present a new set of challenges. For example, one of the most common and popular ways to interface with Okta from a Node.js application is to use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/oidc-middleware">Okta NodeJS OIDC Middleware</a>. The middleware takes some configuration and connects with Okta. This process is super simple to set up and use securely.</p>

<p>Matt Raible wrote a blog post <a>about using Electron with Okta</a> in 2018. In his example, he used <code>AppAuth</code> with its PKCE extension to secure his Electron application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Both of these approaches require a callback path where Okta can send the authentication code to be processed by your application. For some companies, allowing <code>localhost</code> to receive the response from Okta may pose a security concern. There are many ways to handle this, but in this article, you will use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-auth-js">Okta’s Auth JS SDK</a>. This SDK exposes a <code>signInWithCredentials()</code> method that you can use to authenticate your users.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Native and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and the Logout Redirect URI 
    (where <code>dev-133337.okta.com</code> is your Okta domain name). Your domain name is reversed to provide a unique scheme to open your app on a device.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Native App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Native App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>You can leave the redirect URI at the default as you won’t be using it for this project. If you have multiple authorization servers you will need to pick one. For this application, the <code>default</code> server is fine.</p>

<p>Once your application is configured, the Okta CLI will return the issuer and client-id. Make note of these as you will need them when you build your application.</p>

<p></p>

 Build an Electron app 

<p>Now you’re ready to build an Electron application. First, open a new folder using your favorite IDE. In the console, type <code>npm init</code> and complete the setup presented to you. Accepting all the defaults is fine. Once you are done with the setup, install the following dependencies:</p>

   <code>npm i -D electron@16.0.3 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.8.0
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>start</code> script to your <code>package.json</code> file.</p>

   <code>"scripts": {
  "start": "electron .",
  ...
},
</code>   

<p>Create a new file called <code>main.js</code> and add the following code to it. Make sure to replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> and <code>{yourClientId}</code> with the settings from the OIDC app you created earlier.</p>

   <code>const { app, BrowserWindow } = require("electron");
const path = require("path");
const OktaAuth = require("@okta/okta-auth-js").OktaAuth;

const { ipcMain } = require("electron");

let mainWindow;
let user;

var config = {
  // Required config
  issuer: "/oauth2/default",
  clientId: "{yourClientId}",
};

var authClient = new OktaAuth(config);

ipcMain.on("user:login", (event, data) =&gt; {
  authClient
    .signInWithCredentials(data)
    .then(function (res) {
      console.log(res);

      if (res.data.status != "SUCCESS") {
        event.reply("login-failed", err.errorSummary);
        return;
      }

      user = res.user;
      openHome();
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
      console.log(err);
      event.reply("login-failed", err.errorSummary);
    });
});

ipcMain.handle("user:get", (event) =&gt; {
  return user;
});

ipcMain.on("user:logout", (event) =&gt; {
  user = null;
  openIndex();
});

function createWindow() {
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js"),
    },
  });
}

function openIndex() {
  mainWindow.loadFile("index.html");

  // Open the DevTools.
  mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();
}

function openHome() {
  mainWindow.loadFile("home.html");
}

// This method will be called when Electron has finished
// initialization and is ready to create browser windows.
// Some APIs can only be used after this event occurs.
app.whenReady().then(() =&gt; {
  createWindow();
  openIndex();

  app.on("activate", function () {
    // On macOS it's common to re-create a window in the app when the
    // dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open.
    if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) createWindow();
  });
});

// Quit when all windows are closed, except on macOS. There, it's common
// for applications and their menu bar to stay active until the user quits
// explicitly with Cmd + Q.
app.on("window-all-closed", function () {
  if (process.platform !== "darwin") app.quit();
});
</code>   

<p>This file serves a few different functions. First, it is the main entry point for the application. Because of this, it also handles creating the window as well as the close function.</p>

<p>The <code>main.js</code> file also serves to navigate between the unsecured <code>index.html</code> page and the secured <code>home.html</code> page. When the user is authenticated you will direct them to the <code>home.html</code> page. After the user logs out, direct them to the <code>index.html</code> page which contains the login logic.</p>

<p>The file also contains handlers for the main process and communication back to the renderer process. In Electron, these processes are isolated from each other for security. The appropriate way to communicate between the two is to use the <code>contextBridge</code> and the <code>ipcRenderer</code> or <code>ipcMain</code> modules, depending on which way you are trying to communicate. In <code>main.js</code> you are receiving communication from the renderer process when the user attempts to log in or requests to log out. There is also a handler for <code>user:get</code> that will return the user stored by the main process to the renderer process.</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>main.js</code> file will also handle the authentication logic from the Okta SDK. You will need to configure your client first, using your issuer and the client ID obtained during the setup process above. Next, you can create a <code>login()</code> method that makes use of the <code>signInWithCredentials()</code> method provided by the SDK. This method will return a result that you can parse. If the message is a success then you can redirect the user to <code>home.index</code>, otherwise you can return an error message and handle that on your renderer side as you see fit.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>preload.js</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require("electron");

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("electron", {
  login: (data) =&gt; ipcRenderer.send("user:login", data),
  getUser: async () =&gt; {
    const user = await ipcRenderer.invoke("user:get");
    return user;
  },
  logout: () =&gt; ipcRenderer.send("user:logout"),
});

ipcRenderer.on("login-failed", (event, message) =&gt; {
  document.getElementById("error-message").innerHTML = message;
});
</code>   

<p>The <code>preload.js</code> file is where you will mediate the communication between the main and the renderer process. <code>contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld</code> allows you to define an API, in this case, called <code>electron</code>, that your renderer can invoke. This file has access to both the renderer and main process and can delegate messages from the renderer to the main process. When the renderer calls <code>electron.login</code>, the <code>ipcRenderer</code> will send the message and payload through the <code>contextBridge</code> to be handled in the <code>main.js</code> page you saw earlier.</p>

<p>Next, add two HTML files. Start by adding <code>index.html</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;A Brief Electron demo with Okta&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Electron and Okta&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Please Login&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="username" id="username"/&gt;

    &lt;label&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="password" name="password" id="password"/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;button id="login-button"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;label id="error-message"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  .container {
    width: 60%;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  document.querySelector("#login-button").addEventListener("click", () =&gt; {
    const username = document.getElementById("username").value;
    const password = document.getElementById("password").value;

    const data = {
      username: username,
      password: password,
    };

    window.electron.login(data);
  });

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>index.html</code> page is for users who are not authenticated yet. You are presenting the user with a login screen that collects a username and password and calls <code>window.electron.login</code>. As you learned earlier, this function is added in the <code>preload.js</code> file.</p>

<p>Finally, add a <code>home.html</code> file and provide a landing page for authenticated users.</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Home&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Congratulations &lt;span id="username"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;, You've made it to a secure page using Okta.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;button id="logout-button"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () =&gt; {
    window.electron.getUser().then((user) =&gt; {
      document.getElementById("username").innerHTML = `${user.profile.firstName} ${user.profile.lastName}`
    });
  });

  document.getElementById('logout-button').addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
    window.electron.logout();
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>The logout button calls your <code>electron</code> API from the <code>preload.js</code> file. You are also displaying the user’s name from Okta. This helps verify that the user is logged in and who they signed in as.</p>

<p>This page has been left intentionally simple for a very good reason. Electron doesn’t care what frontend you use. This could be a full-fledged React application or could have very little JavaScript at all. How you handle managing the application and user state is up to you. But, by using the Okta SDKs you can securely authenticate your users, and push them into the application state you need.</p>

<p>With your application ready, you can use the command <code>npm start</code> or run your debugger to see the application. You will see a warning in your console when starting:</p>

   <code>[okta-auth-sdk] WARN: Memory storage can only support simple single user use case on server 
side, please provide custom storageProvider or storageKey if advanced scenarios need to be 
supported.
</code>   

<p>For development, this isn’t an issue; in production you may want to consider implementing a custom storage provider for your application. You can find <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#node-js-and-react-native-usage">more usage information here</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once the application starts up, you can use your Okta credentials to log in and see the <code>home.html</code> page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Wolf McNally’s <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash">LifeHash</a> is one of Blockchain Commons’ interoperable specifications intended to make digital infrastructure open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate. A LifeHash takes a cryptographic objects such as a seed or a key (or really, any sort of data) and turns it into a beautiful and easily recognizable image.</p>

<p>You can now play with LifeHashes at <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash-web/">C++ implementation compiled to WebAssembly</a> allows you to enter an arbitrary text string or a SHA-256 digest and view the corresponding LifeHash — using one of a few different LifeHash variants. (We recommend v2 as the “official” LifeHash.) Because it’s compiled into Webassembly, LifeHash.info does all the work in your browser, ensuring your secrets stay safe!</p>

<p>A similar idea called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-blockies">Blockies</a> already exists to identify Ethereum addresses. They’re a great addition to the Ethereum ecosystem, but LifeHashes incorporate a few additional features. Because each one is built from an iteration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>, they’re more detailed. They also have been carefully formatted to display well on grayscale screens and low-resolution screens, with our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/Q1-2021-Report/">LetheKit offering a proof of concept</a>.</p>

<p>So why use LifeHashes? They ensure that any time that you see a key or seed in a different environment, you’ll be able to recognize it through the visual hash (and now you can use <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a> to display the LifeHash derived from the SHA-256 hash of an object, even if your app doesn’t support LifeHashes). As an adjunct to existing computer and human examinations of digital hashes, LifeHashes can improve your security.</p>

<p>LifeHashes are particularly important for Blockchain Commons given our focus on resilient and independent airgapped architectures: a LifeHash allows for the easy comparison of a cryptographic object on either side of the gap, so that you know that you received what you were expecting. Transferred a seed? Asked to sign a PSBT for a specific account? LifeHashes can help you avoid costly errors.</p>

<p>Our explainer video talks more about LifeHash and demonstrates how it works:</p>





<p>Blockchain Commons is dedicated to improving the human aspects of the digital world; LifeHash does that by considering the human experience of cryptographic hashes and providing visual cues to replace (or at least supplement) the long strings of letters and numbers that we can’t easily differentiate.</p>

				  The emergence of a global pandemic has driven the digitalization of services making reliable authentication online a critical need, says Charlyn Ho, a privacy and technology expert at international law firm Perkins Coie, in a new white paper.   
			  
				
				
				 <p>We caught up with Charlyn to learn more about her paper, <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/4/247949/2021-Perkins-Coie-LLP-Health-Passport-White-Paper.pdf">COVID-19 as a Catalyst for Advancement of Digital Identity</a>,&nbsp;and to talk about&nbsp; the future of decentralized identity. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio: &nbsp;Tell us about yourself and your work and how it led you to write this paper. </p>
<p>Charlyn Ho (CH): Perkins Coie has a long history with self-sovereign identity beginning in 2016 when we were approached by a pro-bono client that was looking to use digital identity to empower refugees to control their own national papers to help mitigate the risk of physical papers being lost or stolen. These efforts started the Blockchain Technology group’s passion for self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Blockchain Technology group authored “<a href="https://www.virtualcurrencyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2017/05/Perkins-Coie-LLP-Legal-Aspects-of-Smart-Contracts-Applications.pdf">Legal Aspects of Smart Contract Applications</a>” a white paper that provided an initial analysis of the legal aspects of five prominent smart contract use cases that included self-sovereign identity. Later that year, Perkins Coie became the first law firm to be selected as a <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/perkins-coie-selected-as-a-founding-steward-in-self-sovereign.html">Founding Steward</a> by the Sovrin Foundation, which is when I began my work in this space. In 2018, I co-authored a white paper addressing self-sovereign identity and Distributed Ledger Technology titled “<a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/1/v3/218495/Perkins-Coie-Self-Sovereign-Identity-and-Distributed-Ledger-Tech.pdf">Self-Sovereign Identity and Distributed Ledger Technology: Framing the Legal Issues</a>.” The paper outlined the high-level legal issues and technological challenges that must be addressed ahead of mass adoption of self-sovereign identity. Also in 2018, Perkins Coie began representing Sovrin with whom we co-authored a white paper titled “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf">A Protocol and Token for Self-Sovereign Identity &amp; Decentralized Trust</a>.”</p>
<p>As we watched the COVID-19 pandemic unfold, we became convinced that flimsy paper cards and quick-fix health passes would not provide sustainable solutions. So, we decided to put pen to paper and draft “<a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/4/248113/2021-Perkins-Coie-LLP-Health-Certificate-White-Paper.pdf">COVID-19 as a Catalyst for Advancement of Digital Identity</a>,” which we believe lays out the fundamental principles underlying self-sovereign identity. We hope our paper can serve as a framework upon which governments and institutions can build digital identity systems in a way that is both privacy-preserving and widely adoptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio: &nbsp;How did you land on the three pillars of digital identity? You mentioned Christopher Allen’s paper “The Path to Self Sovereign Identity,” how influential was that material to the direction of the paper?</p>
<p>CH: Any comprehensive digital identity system is unlikely to garner widespread acceptance without being able to convincingly assuage your average user’s (understandable) concerns about how their data is stored, used, shared, and accessed. Such skepticism can be healthy—it’s your data after all. But if we also believe that digital identity systems hold the potential to not only provide users enhanced security and efficiency of their data but also the ability for nations and institutions to respond quickly to disasters, pandemics, and other threats, then we need to prioritize systems that are crafted with users’ needs and interests in mind if we are to reap these rewards.</p>
<p>One of our primary objectives in writing this paper was to ascertain the fundamental building blocks of any healthy digital identity system. While any number of desirable features may be present in a successful digital identity system, from our review of the relevant literature and existing digital identity systems we determined that trust, user-centricity, and data security are the pillars for any comprehensive system to function effectively and secure users’ confidence.</p>
<p>While many thought leaders influenced this project, Christopher Allen is certainly a pioneer in this space, so his work had a particularly important influence us. I think he put it best when he wrote, “You can’t spell identity without an ‘I.’” Digital identity starts and ends with the user — a concept that was vital to our work, particularly our second pillar (user-centricity). Hopefully we’ve been able to build on the foundation that Mr. Allen has laid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio: You mention paper vaccination cards and plastic drivers licenses as examples of physical identification cards and cite the problems in offline identification systems being not fully inclusive — with 1.1 billion people being “invisible, discounted, or left behind.” Is a trustworthy, secure, user-centric digital credential system a necessity that governments should pursue with more urgency? What are your thoughts on the urgency of adoption of digital identity at the government-level?</p>
<p>CH: Paper and plastic provide a veneer of security — you can see, touch, and physically move a driver’s license or birth certificate. But those same characteristics create a double-edged sword. If paper and plastic can be seen and touched, they can also be forged. If they can be moved, they can also be lost or stolen. For those fleeing conflict or born into poverty, physical credentials are scarce, which makes proving that you are who you say you are all the more challenging.</p>
<p>For these reasons (and many others), governments absolutely should be exploring trustworthy and secure digital credential systems. Governments around the world have been slow to develop comprehensive digital identity systems, which became all-too-apparent during the somewhat disjointed and on-the-fly approach that various nation states and institutions took to developing credentialing systems during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio:&nbsp; In the paper, you describe Indicio’s digital identity system with SITA as being in Phase ‘3.5’ in evolution for user control of identity. Can you talk about what a Phase 4 system would look like in relation to health credentials? Would a more comprehensive digital identity system need to be adopted at a government level for user-centric digital identity to catch on or will private use cases help push us to Phase 4 evolution?</p>
<p>CH: A Phase 4 (self-sovereign) digital identity system is more of a journey than a destination. As the name implies, Phase 4 is true self-sovereignty, but whether or not true self-sovereignty can ever exist in practice is debatable due to countervailing state interests in having some measure of control over or access to one’s data. A Phase 4 system requires that users be vested with autonomy or sovereignty with respect to their credentials, which would apply to health credentials or otherwise. But what that looks like and the friction that may exist when such a system is put into practice remains to be seen. Without moving through Phase 3.5 (user-centric) we only have limited ways to conceive of what a Phase 4 system could look like in a practical sense. Putting the pieces of the puzzle together remains murky because we are only at the very nascency of Phase 3.5.</p>

  &nbsp; EU Advances on Travel Rule Negotiations  
<p>On November 29th 2021, <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/12/01/anti-money-laundering-council-agrees-its-negotiating-mandate-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/">ambassadors to the Council of the EU agreed</a> on a mandate to negotiate with the EU Parliament on regulating the information accompanying cryptoasset transfers. Currently, payment service providers dealing in fiat currency must collect and share information on the sender and beneficiary of each wire transfer they process. This is what the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) refers to as the Travel Rule (FATF Recommendation 16). In June 2019, the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfgeneral/documents/outcomes-plenary-june-2019.html">FATF updated its guidance</a> to apply its Travel Rule standards to cryptoassets. <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14259-2021-INIT/en/pdf">With this proposal</a>, the EU is advancing to expand the scope of regulation to apply to cryptoassets.</p> 
<p>EU ambassador Andrej Šircelj, said “this agreement is an important step towards closing the gaps in our financial systems that are malevolently used by criminals to launder unlawful gains or finance terrorist activities. Crypto-assets are more and more at risk of being exploited for money laundering and criminal purposes, and I’m glad the Council could make swift progress on this urgent proposal.”</p> 
<p>In practice, cryptoasset business will need to provide originator and beneficiary information which will accompany cryptoasset transfers. This also applies to cryptoasset business which process transfers from the EU to outside the Union. This information will be submitted “before or at the moment the transaction is completed” by the customer of the cryptoasset business.</p> 
<p>If the parties involved in a transaction are suspicious or are the subject of sanctions, the proposal highlights that: “payment service providers of payers and of payees, as well as intermediary payment service providers, take appropriate action to freeze certain funds or that they comply with specific restrictions concerning certain transfers of funds.” The document highlighted that personal data collected to comply with this regulation should not be processed for commercial purposes. Furthermore, negotiations should include requirements regarding data protection and sharing.</p> 
<p>The proposal also clarifies exemption for a number of blockchain network participants.&nbsp; Indeed, “persons that are merely ancillary participants, which do not provide or actively facilitate the transfer of crypto-assets, such as persons that provide only Internet services, cloud services, a gateway to connect to a distributed ledger network (for example a so called ‘unhosted wallet’) or nodes that help validate the transactions, should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.” However, when a cryptoasset business receives or transfers funds from or to a private address not linked to a business, the cryptoasset business “will have to obtain information both on the originator and the beneficiary, usually from their customer.”</p>

  Reports From India Suggest the Government Will Regulate Rather Than Ban Cryptoassets  
<p>A bill seeking to prohibit all private cryptoassets in India was presented for consideration to the Lok Sabha, India’s parliament, as<a href="http://loksabhadocs.nic.in/bull2mk/2021/23.11.21.pdf"> announced in the official bulletin</a> on November 23rd 2021. A week later, the creator of this bill, former Finance Secretary Subhash Gard,<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-misinterpreted-private-crypto-ban-says-crypto-bill-creator"> said</a> it was misinterpreted by observers. In fact, he believes that “the future of currency is in digital currencies.”<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cabinet-note-suggests-india-will-regulate-rather-than-ban-crypto"> Local reports</a> suggest that investors will have to declare their cryptoasset holdings and will be given time to transfer their funds to soon-to-be regulated exchanges. In parallel, the Reserve Bank of India is working on a framework to<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-backed-digital-currency-soon/articleshow/87977223.cms"> experiment launching its central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC). This would also be covered by the bill pending introduction to the Lok Sabha as detailed in the bulletin. These announcements follow two significant cryptoasset regulatory developments covered by Elliptic in November 2021<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-president-working-group-releases-report-on-stablecoins"> here</a> and<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-infrastructure-bills-cryptoasset-reporting-requirements-seen-as-overreach"> here</a>.</p>

  SEC Clamps Down on Cryptoasset Fraud Costing More Than $7 Million to Investors  
<p>On December 2nd 2021, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-248?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"> charged a Latvian national</a>, Ivars Auzins, with fraud involving cryptoassets. The charges relate to two separate cryptoasset offerings which defrauded hundreds of retail investors. These schemes operated in 2018 and 2019 but Auzins failed to register with the SEC and adhere to anti-fraud requirements. It is estimated that at least $7 million of the funds raised through these offerings were misappropriated by Auzins. The Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit, Kristina Littman, declared: “[w]e will continue to detect and pursue those that seek to victimize investors in the digital asset space.”</p>

 &nbsp; Luxembourg Releases Guidance on Cryptoasset Investments  
<p>On November 29th 2021, Luxembourg’s financial markets regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), <a href="https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/FAQ_Virtual_Assets.pdf">&nbsp;published an FAQ</a> document on cryptoassets. It outlines which market participants are authorised to trade cryptoassets. It clarifies that alternative investment funds (AIF) and investment fund managers (IFM) must obtain prior approval from the CSSF before trading cryptoassets. This includes, “[a]n updated risk management policy including in particular how the risks in relation to the virtual assets are managed” and “AML/CTF analysis on the assets side.” Furthermore, the “CSSF expects [...] supervised entities investing in virtual assets possess, and can demonstrate, an adequate understanding of the new ML, TF, Proliferation Financing risks posed by virtual assets and the necessary measures to mitigate them.” Cryptoasset business looking to operate in Luxemburg should refer to the<a href="https://mj.gouvernement.lu/dam-assets/dossiers/blanchiment/ML-TF-vertical-risk-assessment-on-VASPs.pdf"> Ministry of Justice’s vertical risk assessment framework</a> for cryptoasset businesses.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>A summary of Jolocom’s projects in 2021 provides a broad overview of how we work, what our values ​ are, and how we have developed. Spoiler Alert: A lot has happened since January.</p>



 ONCE in implementation 



<p>In spring this year we began the implementation phase for the project ONCE. ONCE had been selected as one out of four projects of the innovation competition ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’ by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) for a three-year implementation phase. Jolocom brings its expertise in the development of wallet-based digital identities based on the self-sovereign identity (SSI) approach to three of the selected implementation projects.</p>



<p>In this project, Jolocom is responsible for the development of an ONCE-compliant wallet. Based on the Jolocom Smartwallet. In the next two years, this is to be supplemented with additional modules and functions together with the project partners.</p>



<p>In the initial phase, the projects focuses extensively on the development, implementation and integration of the technical components. Soon, however, the implementation of use cases from the areas of public administration, mobility and tourism will come to the fore. The solutions of the ONCE ecosystem will then be piloted and put into circulation in particular in the Hesse region and in partner cities in Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia.</p>



<p>From this point on, the practical results of ONCE will be tested in everyday life by residents of the regions. In terms of its functionality, the ecosystem is designed to serve both sovereign identities and evidence (eID, mDL, iKfz), as well as identity features that are issued and used according to the principles of SSI.</p>



<p>The ONCE project also takes current developments around the European eIDAS regulation into account, with the clear goal of providing future-proof solutions on the subject of digital identities for German and EU citizens.</p>



<p>Read more about ONCE? You can find more information here: <a href="https://www.once-project.de/partner/jolocom/">https://www.once-project.de/partner/jolocom/</a> &amp; on our website: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/once-eidas-de/">https://jolocom.io/blog/once-eidas-de/</a></p>



 Jolocom goes Consulting – since 7 years 



<p>2021 was a productive year for Jolocom. A lot has happened since January: projects have been further developed and expanded. An example of this is the area of consulting.</p>



<p>In its seven years, Jolocom actually always held a consultant role, which means that we can pull off a great deal of know-how through various project implementations. The focus here is of course on SSI. But Jolocom has also been able to acquire a lot of knowledge through active work in the field of technology or in networks of various bodies (e.g. W3C, DIF, INATBA) and consortia (e.g. shop window projects digital identities). That, in turn, can flow into our advisory role.</p>



<p>We don’t just strive for advice from start to finish. No, rather from start to operation without detours. Because Jolocom covers all areas and levels, from the first contact with the topic of digital identities, creation of the strategy, selection of the technology to implementation. This enables efficient first-hand advice without time-consuming and costly detours.</p>



<p>Principles and solutions</p>



<p>We are convinced that a decentralized identity should be an open platform with uniform standards, regardless of a single solution. Products and solutions have to be interoperable. This is the only way to realize the potential of the technology for the individual, public, and private sector.</p>



<p>This principle guides us in consultation and in the creation of our freely available platform. When it comes to consulting, we are therefore independent of technology and aim to avoid a vendor lock-in or other dependencies.</p>



<p>Jolocom Consulting supports project / consortium management, so that the solution goes into operation as planned and the potentials can be realized. <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/">https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/</a></p>



 



<p>The development and thus the projects of Jolocom are constantly evolving. For example, we are working on demos that clearly and vividly present what we do and what we are working on. For the ConDIDi project, Jolocom created a demo together with the TIB in Leibniz, which shows this well and can be tried here: <a href="https://labs.tib.eu/condidi/">https://labs.tib.eu/condidi/</a></p>



<p>Jolocom started its ONCE project in 2021 and was able to further expand the area of ​​consulting. We also worked on the development of the Smartwallet 2.0, which will be presented in more detail in another article. We are very excited about the opportunities 2022 will bring and proud of the progress we made in 2021.</p>

 Eine Übersicht über die Projekte von Jolocom bietet ein umfassendes Bild darüber, wie wir arbeiten, was unsere Werte sind, und wie wir uns entwickelt haben. Spoiler Alert: Seit Januar hat sich viel getan.&nbsp; 



 ONCE in der Umsetzung&nbsp; 



<p>Im Frühling begann die Umsetzungsphase für unser Projekt ONCE. Als eines von vier Projekten wurde ONCE im Innovationswettbewerb ,,Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten’’ vom Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi) für die dreijährige Umsetzungsphase ausgewählt. Jolocom bringt seine Expertise in der Entwicklung von Wallet-basierten Digitalen Identitäten auf Basis des Selbst-Souveränen Identität (SSI) Ansatzes in insgesamt drei der Umsetzungsprojekte ein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Im ONCE-Projekt ist Jolocom für die Entwicklung einer ONCE-konformen Wallet zuständig, welche auf der Jolocom Smartwallet aufbaut. In den kommenden zwei Jahren soll diese gemeinsam mit den Projektpartnern um weitere Module und Funktionen ergänzt werden. In der Anfangsphase liegt der Fokus noch stark auf der Entwicklung, Implementierung und Integration der technischen Komponenten. Bald jedoch wird die Umsetzung von Anwendungsfällen aus den Bereichen Öffentliche Verwaltung, Mobilität und Tourismus in den Vordergrund treten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Lösungen des ONCE-Ökosystems werden dann insbesondere in der Region Hessen, sowie in Partnerstädten in Bayern und Nordrhein-Westfalen pilotiert und in Umlauf gebracht. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt werden die praktischen Ergebnisse von ONCE im Alltag durch Anwohner:innen der Regionen erprobt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In seiner Funktionalität ist das Ökosystem darauf ausgelegt, sowohl hoheitliche Identitäten und Nachweise zu bedienen (eID, mDL, iKfz), als auch Identitätsmerkmale, die nach den Prinzipien von SSI herausgegeben und verwendet werden. Das ONCE-Projekt berücksichtigt auch derzeitige Entwicklungen rund um die europäische eIDAS-Verordnung, mit dem klaren Ziel, zukunftsfähige Lösungen zum Thema Digitale Identitäten für deutsche und EU-Bürger:innen bereitzustellen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Jolocom goes Consulting – schon seit 7 Jahren&nbsp; 



<p>2021 war ein produktives Jahr für Jolocom. Seit Januar hat sich viel getan: Projekte wurden weiterentwickelt und Schwerpunkte ausgebaut. Ein Beispiel hierfür ist der Bereich der Beratung.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom hatte in seinen sieben Jahren eigentlich immer auch eine Beraterfunktion inne, wodurch wir von großem Know-How durch verschiedene Projektdurchführungen zerren können. Der Fokus hierbei liegt natürlich auf SSI. Doch auch im Bereich der Technologie oder in Netzwerken verschiedener Gremien (z.B. W3C, DIF, INATBA) und Konsortien (z.B. Schaufensterprojekte Digitale Identitäten) hat Jolocom sich durch aktive Arbeit viel Wissen aneignen können. Dass wiederum kann in unsere Beraterfunktion einfließen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir streben eine Beratung nicht nur von Anfang bis Ende an. Nein, vielmehr vom Anfang bis zum Betrieb ohne Umwege. Denn Jolocom deckt alle Bereiche und Ebenen ab, von erstem Kontakt mit dem Thema digitale Identitäten, Erstellung der Strategie, Auswahl der Technologie bis zu einer Implementierung. Dies ermöglicht eine effiziente Beratung aus erster Hand ohne zeit- und kostenintensive Umwege.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grundsätze und Lösungen&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass eine dezentrale Identität eine offene Plattform mit einheitlichen Standards sein muss, unabhängig von einer einzelnen Lösung. Produkte und Lösungen müssen interoperabel sein. Nur so können die Potentiale der Technologie für den Einzelnen, für den öffentlichen Bereich und die Privatwirtschaft umgesetzt werden. Dieser Grundsatz leitet uns in der Beratung und in der Erstellung unserer frei verfügbaren Plattform. In der Beratung sind wir daher technologieunabhängig und verfolgen das Ziel, dass ein Vendor lock-in oder andere Abhängigkeiten vermieden werden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom Consulting unterstützt bei Projekt-/Konsortienmanagement und als Spezialist, damit die Lösung wie geplant in Betrieb geht und die Potentiale realisiert werden können. <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/">https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Weiteres  



<p>Die Entwicklung und damit die Projekte Jolocoms sind sich stets am Weiterentwickeln. Beispielsweise arbeiten wir an Demos, die übersichtlich und anschaulich vorstellen, was wir machen und woran wir arbeiten. Für das Projekt ConDIDi erstellte Jolocom gemeinsam mit dem TIB in Leibniz eine Demo, die dies gut darstellt und gerne hier probiert werden kann:</p>



<p>Jolocom hat 2021 sein Projekt zu ONCE gestartet und den Bereich der Beratung weiterausbauen können. Weiterhin arbeiteten wir an der Entwicklung der Smartwallet 2.0, die in einem weiteren Artikel näher vorgestellt werden wird. Wir freuen uns sehr auf die Möglichkeiten, die 2022 bieten wird, und sind stolz auf den Fortschritt, den wir 2021 erzielen konnten.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thinking in a decentralized architecture</p>
<p>We have a tendency to apply existing solutions or frameworks towards new things. </p>
<p>In the early days of the web, many companies implemented fax on the Internet, rather than rethinking if faxes were still the best solution for certain types of information exchange. </p>
<p>Are we doing the same thing today with wallets? </p>
<p>Wallets are a tool which we employ to store physical identity cards, credit/debit cards, receipts and other things. But when we think about storing digital identities/credentials, of course employing a wallet sounds like an appropriate thing to do, considering it’s what works as the physical world. </p>
<p>I wonder however if framing it as a digital wallet boxes our thinking.</p>
<p>A second tendency we have, specifically in the digital identity space (and I’m guilty of this at times..), is to look at things as layers or foundations. </p>
<p>I often hear phrases such as: “Government issued digital identities will form the foundation for [insert use case].” </p>
<p>Rather than looking at it as something foundational, we should try framing our thinking around a decentralized architecture.</p>
<p>Let’s take the government regulated environment for instance. Rather than thinking of governments issuing Digital IDs as being foundational, can we instead look at a particular government agency being one identity system?</p>
<p> The ministry managing health cards is one identity system. The ministry managing driver’s licences is another. </p>
<p>They are all individual identity systems, but they participate in an Identity Metasystem. </p>
<p>Rather than being a layer they are a node.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Identity Metasystem Diagram</p>
<p>In this podcast episode, Phil talks about a time where he made a back of the envelope calculation to approximate how many credential types existed within the US. The number he came up with was 16 million.</p>
<p>16 million credentials that need their own identity systems – 16 million identity systems which are built by specific entities for specific contexts.</p>
<p>Identity systems are everywhere and new ones are being built every day (most being very small for very niche contexts).</p>
<p>Identity Metasystems leverage common standards (e.g., Verifiable Credentials, DIDs) and technology protocols (e.g., DIDComm, DID Registries). These are the well areas where the various identity systems can participate and inject/extract value from.</p>
<p>If we can distinguish Identity Systems from Identity Metasystems, it creates a better framing for discussions around the roles of governments, private sector and wallet technology providers.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 SSI Wallets – what can be learned from the Web Browser? 
 How will SSI Wallets be adopted? – Will we have very few or many wallets? 
 Distinguishing Identity Systems from Identity Metasystems. 
 How can governments best contribute to Identity Metasystems? 
 Phil’s thoughts on Open ID SIOP (self-issued IDs).&nbsp;

LFG<p>May we have your attention please! This is the paging announcement for all SafleNauts ready to #GoBeyond with us on this journey. Mark your calendars for the 16th of December, 2021 as the Safle project is thrilled to announce its much awaited Initial DEX Offering (IDO) for the $SAFLE token on Polkastarter, the premier decentralised platform for launching new tokens and projects.</p><p>We want to thank our community for continually supporting us and welcome all the curious newcomers interested in mastering the world of cryptos &amp; blockchains with Safle. To understand how to participate in a Polkastarter IDO, make sure to check out Polkastarter’s <a href="https://polkastarter.com/projects/safle">blog post</a> on this&nbsp;topic.</p><p>Safle has created a set of tools for developers and retail end users that provide private, non custodial open governance protocols to manage their self sovereign identity based wallets, and a complete suite for running and managing web services needed to connect to fully synced blockchain nodes. Safle technology stack was built envisioning the challenges in current mainstream mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and of applications built on top of blockchain. The Stack empowers the community to make independent decisions and have power over their digital assets. The current Safle technology stack as well as the envisioned solution offerings for future use cases are built on two main&nbsp;pillars:</p>  Access to Identity in a Decentralised Environment  Access to Finance in a Decentralised Environment  <p>$SAFLE: The protocol’s native governance token</p><p>In order to maintain a balance between developers and retail users, Safle intends to develop wallet infrastructure in a completely non-custodial fashion using open governance mechanisms via the SafleDAO, coordinated and maintained by the Safle token economy. The native $SAFLE token will not only enable token holders to propose and vote on changes (governance privileges) to functionalities and feature sets of the wallet and node services, but will also create a self-sustaining token economic model, where value will be generated by providing access to finance and identity in the decentralised digital world. $SAFLE is a governance and a multi-utility token. Users can earn yield by staking it via the staking&nbsp;pool.</p><p>The $SAFLE token will have two main utilities:</p><p>Asset Value $SAFLE can either be used as a method of payment or as a staking token that enables users to use various subscription services as long as tokens are&nbsp;staked.</p><p>Governance $SAFLE holders can participate in the future of the project by participating in the Governance mechanism through SafleDAO. Holders of the $SAFLE token will have a 1–1 ratio for voting on the proposals. Holders also get the right to propose for carrying the ecosystem forward.</p><p>About Polkastarter</p><p>Polkastarter is the fully decentralised protocol for launching new ideas. Our curation process and industry access enable us to offer the best new projects in blockchain and digital assets. With Polkastarter, decentralised projects can raise awareness, build a loyal community, and receive long-term support. Users of the platform will be able to participate in a secure and compliant environment and use assets both in and beyond the current ERC20 standard.</p><p><a href="https://www.polkastarter.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/polkastarter">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/polkastarter">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://t.me/PolkastarterAnnounce">Telegram Announcements</a></p><p>Stay tuned for our upcoming announcement on how to join the whitelist!</p><p>Safle 🔗</p><p><a href="https://getsafle.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/getsafle">GitHub</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/aj9YRCfh26">Discord</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetSafle">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://instagram.com/getsafle">Instagram</a> | <a href="http://t.me/safleann">Telegram Ann</a> | <a href="http://t.me/saflechat">Telegram&nbsp;Chat</a></p>

<p>Bloom recently launched <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a>, a new DeFi-focused product that helps enterprises with KYC &amp; AML compliance as well as enabling risk assessment via traditional and alternative financial data, all while preserving user privacy. By enabling access to reusable, verifiable credentials for ID verification, sanction screening, and PEP screening, as well as other identity data such as phone number, email, and social accounts, OnRamp is a key piece for DeFi companies facing increased regulatory efforts.</p><p>Bloom Meets Plaid</p><p>Bloom is excited to announce an integration with <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, a data network that powers the digital financial ecosystem. The Plaid integration gives Bloom the ability to offer consumer-permissioned, traditional financial data for better risk assessment through OnRamp.</p><p>With OnRamp, enterprises can prioritize user privacy while still working towards compliance requirements. Bloom uses Plaid so that consumers can link &nbsp;their bank accounts to verify their account information, all while keeping their information private, even from Bloom. &nbsp; The Plaid integration provides users with the option to securely permission and confirm information used in enabling risk assessment by connecting their financial accounts.</p><p>In addition to bank balance data, the Bloom-Plaid integration opens the door to exciting future integrations, including salary verification. The opportunity for OnRamp to incorporate alternative signals like bank account balance and salary can not only expand financial inclusion, but they may, in fact, be more reliable indicators for creditworthiness than traditional metrics. Stay tuned for more updates on how Bloom is unlocking the full power of DeFi! <br></p><p>About OnRamp</p><p><a href="https://bloom.co/">Bloom</a> plans for <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a> to be a key piece of infrastructure for DeFi companies, whether they are in launch or growth mode. The developer-friendly application includes no integration fees, no monthly minimums, no long term contracts, and flexible pricing. OnRamp reduces the barrier to entry for new builders, allows growing companies to expand, and most importantly, opens the door a bit wider for those who deserve access to the decentralized finance markets. Beyond achieving compliance, the use of reusable, verifiable credentials will help DeFi companies enable risk assessment, transcending the collateralized lending structure that has limited growth in the sector up to this point. OnRamp offers reusable, verifiable credentials (VCs) for bank account activity, balances and other financial signals.</p>

<p>A letter from IdentityNORTH Co-Chair, Aran Hamilton</p>
<p>This week we lost a giant in the digital identity space and a leader in the IdentityNORTH community. Kim Cameron was recognized in 2016 as a Founder of Canada’s Digital Economy for his work in recognition of his foundational and groundbreaking work writing the “<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of Identity</a>” (2005).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim was the Chief Architect of Identity in the Identity and Access Division at Microsoft, where he championed the emergence of a privacy-enhancing Identity Metasystem reaching across technologies, industries, vendors, continents and cultures. Kim played a leading role in the evolution of Active Directory, Federation Services, Forefront Identity Manager, CardSpace and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s other Identity Metasystem products. In 2009, he was appointed a Microsoft Distinguished Engineer.</p>
<p>A true friend and mentor to many of us, Kim spoke at IdentityNORTH on several occasions. His talk in 2012 was “Cloud Identity Aha Realizations”, Kim helped us kick off the public consultation for the BC Services Card in Vancouver in 2014, speaking with Don Thibeau as we worked to help the BC Government plan the roll-out of their digital ID program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim was actually the inspiration for the Award that we started in 2015 but we made him wait for it. He spoke to us twice in 2016, first as the Keynote for our Annual Summit “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqUXYl90XHM">Beyond the Laws of Identity</a>” referring to his ground-breaking work and taking us through what he felt he missed when he published his Laws. Kim spoke later on the importance of the community when he received recognition as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdlBg0Ai9aQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">Founder of Canada’s Digital Economy</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim joined us again in 2020, after he retired from Microsoft and gave a different sort of talk. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSYCxw6I8c">keynote</a> at the IdentityNORTH Annual Summit was a sort of career retrospective, a humble recount of some regrets regarding his work and a call for us to pick up where he was leaving off. Always introspective, Kim wished he’d focused more on creating inclusive solutions for individual and enterprise identity challenges and he wanted us to learn from his mistakes. Once again Kim was ahead of his time, thoughtful, and thought-provoking with a large measure of humour and wit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an honour to learn from him, and our community will continue to drive forward his work in shaping and implementing meaningful digital identity solutions.</p>
<p>In our most recent chat over Zoom, Kim gave IdentityNORTH advice on a series of talks he thought we should host in the coming months and years. He spoke of his expectations of the world in covid, and after, and very eagerly of getting to spend virtual time with his very young grandchildren. He remarked at the resilience of children, and their ability to connect emotionally even when presented with technological barriers… and how much fun he was having getting to know them as real people. Our sincere condolences to Kim’s family, we will all miss Kim for his many contributions to our lives and the passion he brought to the IdentityNORTH community.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs is proud to be presenting at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/">The Rise of Privacy Tech</a>&nbsp;(TROPT) interactive forum during&nbsp;<a href="https://staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-week/">Data Privacy Week 2022</a>. Data Privacy Week is an international effort to empower individuals and encourage businesses to respect privacy, safeguard data and enable trust. Data Privacy Week will run January 24–28, 2022. The TROPT interactive forum will be held on January 26–27 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ahead of its interactive forum, the TROPT organization has released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/definingprivacytechwhitepaper2021/">whitepaper</a>&nbsp;titled,&nbsp;Defining the Privacy Tech Landscape 2021: The Rise of Privacy Tech – A Foundational Whitepaper to Help Fuel Privacy Innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, the whitepaper puts forth a comprehensive definition of privacy and, since there’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">much debate</a> about what data privacy really means, we thought we’d share the definition with you here.</p>



 The TROPT definition of privacy&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>First, as we’ve also&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">reported</a>&nbsp;in the past, TROPT acknowledges that&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy definitions</a>&nbsp;and conceptualizations vary widely. To overcome this, TROPT has united the common principles into a multi-dimensional definition of privacy, as you can see here:&nbsp;</p>







<p>TROPT believes this is “a multi-faceted understanding of privacy” which covers individual control and power over personal information (our priority at Anonyome Labs) and facilitating trust in personal information relationships.&nbsp;<br><br>The definition embraces a “comprehensive taxonomical approach to conceptualizing privacy based on the activities that impinge upon privacy: information collection, information processing, information dissemination, and invasions.”</p>



<p>Significantly, this definition rejects “the limited conceptualization of privacy as secrecy, obscurity, or anonymity only.”</p>



<p>Going further, TROPT identifies 7 principles of privacy tech from among the existing privacy principles in privacy regulations:</p>







<p>TROPT then maps its 7 principles to the stages of the data life cycle:</p>







 What does all this mean? 



<p></p>



<p>TROPT&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">agrees with us</a>&nbsp;that “privacy is one of the most critical issues of our time.” Better defining and understanding it, particularly at the practical level of the data lifecycle for an organization, will boost development and uptake of innovations that will help solve the privacy problems we now face at&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">crisis level</a>. Enterprises are demanding more privacy tools in response to growing&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">customer demand</a>&nbsp;for better stewardship of their personal data, and it helps to see what exactly is required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cybersecurity/trusted-tech.html">2020 PwC Trusted Tech report</a>&nbsp;put it, brands that get consumer trust and safety right will disrupt the market. At Anonyome Labs, through our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;business privacy toolkit, we help enterprises rapidly produce branded cybersafety solutions to get out in front of their competition. Through&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, the world’s only all-in-one privacy app, we’re putting the power to protect personal information directly into consumers’ hands.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce Dock’s collaboration with Transak, a platform for onboarding global users from fiat to crypto and back using local payment methods. Previously, Dock Tokens were only available for crypto to crypto buyers, thanks to Docks Integration with Transak, Dock Tokens can now be bought via bank transfers and card payments.</p><p>To celebrate the collaboration, Dock will contribute $10,000 USD toward user transaction fees. This means that early users will get the convenience of Transak without the fees, but you’ll need to be quick, as once the budget is used up the full transaction fees will apply. A small exchange fee will still apply.</p><p>How It Works</p><p>Transak enables bank transfers and card payments in multiple international currencies in over 60 countries, including the UK, Europe and India. In a few simple steps, you’ll own DOCK tokens and will be able to participate in governance, staking, and transacting on the Dock Network. </p><p>Purchase DOCK via the widget on <a href="https://www.dock.io/token#get-dock-token">Dock’s website</a>, sign up to Transak and follow the steps below.</p>  Enter the amount you’d like to purchase in your local currency  Pick your preferred payment method of bank transfer or card payment  Click “Buy Now”  Complete KYC  <p>To ensure compliance, you’ll be asked to enter necessary details such as name, mobile number and DOB, Transak can then tailor your experience for an easy fiat payment the next time you purchase. Purchasing DOCK via Transak is not currently available in the United States, India, China and other select countries. View the full list of <a href="https://www.notion.so/Currency-Coverage-and-Fees-for-Buying-Crypto-976ee96fc0764628ba990b550b1310d3">supported countries here</a>.</p><p>Join the Dock Community</p><p>The Dock community expressed their trouble buying DOCK, with it only being available for crypto to crypto users. Taking on board their concerns, Dock engaged Transak to enable purchases via their fiat on/off-ramp. The integration went live on the 1st of December 2021. </p><p>Dock has a total supply of 1 Billion tokens, circa 750 Million are in circulating supply owned by DOCK token holders. </p><p>Transak has enabled non-crypto holders to purchase DOCK allowing more people to partake in governance, validating, and staking, while ensuring all KYC, AML, and fraud monitoring requirements are met. </p><p>Dock CEO Nick Lambert commented on the collaboration “We’re really excited to be working with Transak in opening up DOCK to a wider audience, enabling non-crypto users to enter our ecosystem”. </p><p>Alessandro Raboni, Head of Growth at Transak commented "At Transak we are early believers in the Polkadot ecosystem and we are thrilled to see it developing with such strong solutions and applications like Dock. Dock solves a very important problem in addressing inefficiencies in current data solutions, leveraging blockchain technology. We share with Dock the vision for decentralisation, as well as our developer-centric approach, perfect match!”</p><p>Head to <a href="https://www.dock.io/token#get-dock-token">dock.io</a> and purchase your DOCK tokens today.</p>

<p>We are stoked to announce our partnership with PureFi, a decentralised protocol that provides compliance tools while maintaining the anonymity of its users. PureFi is the only DeFi compliance protocol for mitigating risks of interacting with high-risk illicit assets and onboarding institutions into DeFi. Developed by AMLBot in partnership with Hacken Foundation, it aims to provide a full-cycle solution for crypto asset analytics and AML/KYC procedures in the DeFi ecosystem. Through a set of smart contracts, PureFi seamlessly connects KYC/AML providers to DeFi end users &amp; protocols to provide them with analytics that help differentiate between honest DeFi market profiles and “suspicious profiles”. For example, a liquidity pool can avoid the risk of getting an illegal money trail into the pool through PureFi’s Verifiable Credentials Certificate providing the contributor’s full-fledged AML/KYC&nbsp;data.</p><p>Safle x&nbsp;PureFi</p><p>The prevalent economic narrative has revolved around the concept of inflation and DeFi has been increasingly seen as a safe-haven against it. DeFi as an industry has been disruptive to say the least, but the exposure to “black hats”in the DeFi ecosystem is causing hindrance in its mass adoption. To combat the same, Safle and PureFi will work together on mutually beneficial technical integrations. The SafleID wallet will be integrated as a means of authorisation within PureFi’s beta product, the widget. Furthermore, both projects will collaborate by integrating the PureFi proprietary Beta solution to assign an AML score for SafleID&nbsp;users.</p><p>In addition, within the scope of this partnership, PureFi will also act as a strategic advisor for the Safle project, facilitating strategic relationships with existing ecosystem partners &amp;&nbsp;others.</p><p>“ Being ethically conscious and imposing a strong culture of ethics within the DeFi ecosystem is obligatory. We’re looking forward to making DeFi Safe &amp; Simple together with PureFi.” Priyanshu Singh, CMO,&nbsp;Safle</p><p>About Safle</p><p>A next-generation non custodial wallet, self sovereign identity protocol and Web 3.0 infra. provider for the decentralised ecosystem, governed by the community. Safle is a decentralised blockchain identity wallet that enables secure private key management and seamless experience for dApps, DeFi and NFTs. In order to maintain a balance between developers and retail users, Safle intends to develop a wallet infrastructure in a completely non-custodial fashion using Open Governance Mechanisms via the SafleDAO coordinated and maintained by the Safle token economy.

<p>Digital identity thought leader Kim Cameron´s passion for fundamentally influencing the way we think about, and deal with privacy and digital identity, has brought us where we are today and will endure forever. On 30th November, 2021, Kim passed away after his courageous battle with cancer. We will continue to honor him by living by his ideals that he expressed back in 2005 with his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of identity</a>.</p>
<p>User Control and Consent, Minimal Disclosure for a Constrained Use, Justifiable Parties, Directed Identity, Pluralism of Technologies, Human Integration, Consistent Experience across Contexts -&nbsp; Kim injected his 7 laws of identity into Microsoft´s DNA as their Chief Architect of Identity at a time, when Microsoft was still&nbsp; “under the dark influence of Privacy is Dead”, and transformed that “big complicated place”, as he called it, into a modern and forward-thinking, privacy driven company that is respectful of the rights of individuals and organizations, and has become a strong contributor to the Identity Standards Community.</p>
<p>In his last two years at Microsoft, Kim paved its way into supporting Decentralized Identity as a new and sustainable way to balance privacy and state-of-the-art security. Gaining back more control over his time after leaving Microsoft in 2019, his interest in digital identity was “as keen as ever,” he wrote in an <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/">August 2020 blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Kim attended nearly all the European Identity Conferences (EIC), from the very first one back in 2007, to 2019 and inspired us with his visionary, content-rich yet entertaining keynote talks and panel sessions. Have a look at his 2019 talk about privacy in the platform economy (“<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2019_14_09_cameron">Turning the Web Right Side Up</a>”), his 2018 talk on the “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2018_06_cameron">7 Laws of Identity on the Blockchain</a>”, his visionary “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic15_keynote_cameron">Identity Services 2020</a>” talk at EIC 2015, where he also reflected on 15 years of working together with Jackson Shaw in the same company and cited Berthold Brecht saying “Because things are the way they are, things won´t stay the way they are.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all will miss you so much, Kim. Diving with your wife Adele, you and so many friends into the cultural life of Munich while we were there for EIC, enjoying Ingo Maurer´s Light Design Showroom and some delicious Italian food. Farewell, Kim, thank you for your guidance and advice. And thank you for being a friend.</p>

<p>Why offering multiple identity verification options can become a competitive advantage.</p>



<p><a></a>Like everything in life, there is rarely ever one solution that fits all. The same applies to identity verification. Even though automated solutions might offer your customers a fast and convenient way to get verified, some still prefer – or need – human guidance. This gap can be fulfilled with semi-automated processes such as video-based solutions.</p>



<p>Video-based solutions have been used for almost a decade in countries such as Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. Until very recently, this solution was the only accepted way to perform electronic identity verification for customer onboarding as it provides a higher level of assurance; according to some regulators, it is equivalent to face-to-face verification. Even though automated solutions are becoming available in some of these countries with strict regulations, video-based solutions are still widely used because of their ease of use as well as its efficiency to combat different types of fraud.</p>



<p>Providing options to customers not only protects the financial institution from fraud, but it can also improve customer engagement and conversion rates. It will ensure that the customer does not step away if they cannot go through the process with the primary method of verification, which converts into conversion rates. It will save time from customer success teams having to go into eternal email chains with customers. Most importantly, this will help businesses to demonstrate their efforts to become more inclusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow recognises the challenges of having only one method of identity verification. For this reason, IDnow has built a nimble identity verification platform that enables its customer to fulfil their regulatory requirements, combat fraud effectively and increase its conversion rates. All of the verification solutions are available in one joined platform, with one single API integration. </p>



<p>Want to learn more? Listen and watch (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">Webinar: The evolution of ID verification</a>) our IDnow experts discussing IDnow’s journey from a pure Video-based ID Verification player towards a multi-solution platform provider.</p>



 The right method for each customer and for your business. 



<p>Offering multiple identity verification options provides benefits to both customers and businesses.</p>



<p>On one hand, there might be some customers that for any reason cannot get approved. They might not be tech-savvy or perhaps have other learning disabilities which impedes them to complete the automated verification process. By providing alternative ways to verify themselves makes the process more inclusive and enables more customers to successfully complete the process. Customers feel more comfortable and in control and will also build trust in the institution.</p>



<p>Alternative methods of verification can also be valuable for businesses as the level of assurance can be increased and can help to prevent fraud. For example, a video-based verification can provide a more robust verification compared to an automated solution, as it can prevent more sophisticated fraudulent attacks like money mulling or social engineering attacks. IDnow’s identity platform offers multiple solutions to verify the identity of individuals. Below we present two of these main solutions, VideoIdent and AutoIdent, which can help to start providing the benefits to organisations and we dig into how each of them can serve different customer segments.</p>



<p></p>



 







 <a></a>AutoIdent for a fast and reliable onboarding process. 



<p>I<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">Dnow AutoIdent</a> offers a state-of-the-art automated identity verification leveraging modern AI and machine learning technology. Automated identity verification allows customers to identify themselves on their own, anywhere, anytime, and within just a few minutes.</p>



<p>Because of the automated and self-service onboarding approach, AutoIdent offers high convenience and conversion rates. The convenient user experience and ease of use, makes it popular with young and tech-savvy customers. Especially, customers who have used digital identity verification solutions before are looking for the fastest way to identify themselves.</p>



<p>AutoIdent supports identity documents from 195 countries and is available in over 30 languages. Additionally, more and more regulators are approving automated identity verification methods for due diligence purposes. This enables businesses to onboard customers in a variety of markets.</p>



 



<p></p>







 <a></a>Building a more exclusive and inclusive process with VideoIdent. 



<p>Even though today we live in a digital-first world, some individuals are still seeking personal customer service. That’s where VideoIdent shines. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">IDnow VideoIdent</a> offers customers a video-chat-based process, that is guided by one of our many Ident Specialists. VideoIdent not only provides a very tailored experience to customers, but also allows to better serve the elderly and less technology, affine individuals, making the process more inclusive.</p>



<p>With IDnow, you benefit from 15 Ident Centres with hundreds of identity verification and fraud prevention specialists. All of IDnow’s Ident and data centres are located within the European Union to ensure a high level of data protection. Let your customers enjoy multi-language support and 24/7 service availability.</p>



 <a></a><a></a>Optimise your conversion rates and save money with a fallback option. 



<p>Offering a selection of identity verification methods especially comes in handy when a customer is having issues with one of them. In these scenarios, it’s good to have an alternative solution as a fallback option.</p>



<p>For example, a customer might go through the onboarding journey with an automated identity verification method. However, the customer might struggle to navigate the process, and after a few attempts, they are not able to complete it. This can bring two consequences to the organisation: (1) the customer decides to contact the customer service team and ask for their assistance (2) lose the customer as they’ve given up completely.</p>



<p>None of the above consequences are ideal. The first one can represent a huge effort and cost for the organisation as they would require a dedicated team to solve these issues for customers. This can also be a lengthy process as instead of only taking a few minutes to get verified, it might now take days or weeks to be solved – another frustrating point for customers which might lead them to abandon the process.</p>



<p>Having a fallback option like VideoIdent provides instant guidance to customers and can save the organisation’s customer service team valuable time which could be used for other activities. Most importantly, providing options will ensure that customers go through one way of verification or another in only minutes, maximising the overall conversion rate and minimising the cost of verification.</p>

   Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are unique identifiers that enable entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.  Within the SSI community, there are many known DID methods, but most of them require you to have a digital identity wallet 🔒, where you will keep a seed (private key)&nbsp;🔑.

Furthermore, they have to go through the registration process, which will not be intuitive at all&nbsp;times.</p> Nature of Implementation <p>The other shortcoming from an implementation perspective is that issuers can’t issue a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credential (VC)</a> without knowing the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">holder’s DID</a>, which until now, was stored only in a digital wallet. In other words, VCs can’t be issued without a&nbsp;wallet!</p><p>In short, digital wallets are not for everyone, still, they are an essential part of the VC issuance and storage&nbsp;process.</p><p>To enable everyone to get on the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0">Web 3.0</a> bandwagon, we at Affinidi, decided to use some easy options that don’t require a digital wallet to store a&nbsp;DID.</p> Implementing DID Without a&nbsp;Wallet <p>Before we go into how you can use a DID without a wallet, let’s quickly understand why we need a private key in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>The simple answer — to prove that you are the owner (holder) of the digital asset (Verifiable Credentials) in question.</p><p>So, how can you prove that you’re the owner without a private&nbsp;key?</p><p>Well, you would&nbsp;need</p>  A unique id for your digital assets&nbsp;(<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a>).  Proof that you are the owner of that unique&nbsp;id.  <p>And how can you do&nbsp;both?</p><p>With two DID methods — did:email ✉️ and did:phone 📞</p><p>Since both email and phone numbers are currently being used in web 2.0 for authentication, it is a simple way to prove that you are the owner of a VC that has a unique DID. You will get an OTP(One Time Password, which mostly is just random characters) on your email/phone, and sending it back will prove your ownership.</p><p>Also, you will have the DID and will be able to get digital assets with this&nbsp;DID.</p> Advantages of DID&nbsp;Methods <p>The biggest advantage of this method is that it is universal and straightforward and provides the same experience for users as Web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>The other advantage is that users don’t have to install any additional software and this can work well for users of all technical knowledge and experience.</p><p>Also, issuers (service providers) can issue <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> to their existing clients (holders) without workarounds on how to get their holders’&nbsp;DID.</p> Limitations of DID&nbsp;Methods <p>Of course, these DID methods have some limitations as well. The most important is that the holder has to reveal his or her email/phone number to strangers, and this could be a spot of bother from a privacy standpoint.</p><p>Overall though, these methods are a great alternative to digital wallets and can be a good starting point for newcomers to embrace the world of VCs and web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>To know about more such interesting things that we do at Affinidi, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>, join our <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">mailing list</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>.</p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

  <p>Kubernetes has become an unavoidable part of a software infrastructure these days. If you are an enterprise or medium/large company, chances are you are already running Kubernetes clusters for your workloads. If you are a DevOps engineer, there is a good chance you are maintaining either an on-prem Kubernetes cluster or a PaaS like Amazon EKS, Microsoft AKS, or GKE. But regardless of how you run your Kubernetes clusters, you need to make sure that they are secure.</p>

<p>The Kubernetes API server has multiple layers of security.</p>

 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/controlling-access/">Transport security</a>: All API communication is done via TLS (transport layer security) using valid certificates. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/">Authentication</a>: All API requests are authenticated with one of the several authentication mechanisms supported by Kubernetes. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/">Authorization</a>: All authenticated requests are authorized using one or more of the supported authorization models. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/">Admission control</a>: All authorized requests, except read/get requests, are validated by admission control modules. 
 

<p>Kubernetes comes with many security options out of the box, but to bulletproof your infrastructure, you need to consider many more security best practices. Today we will look into some of the vital security best practices for Kubernetes.</p>

 1. Use Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 

<p>Kubernetes supports multiple authorization models for its API server. These are <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/abac/">ABAC (Attributed-Based Access Control)</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/node/">Node authorization</a> and the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/">Webhook mode</a>. Out of all these, RBAC is the more secure and most widely used and is ideal for enterprises and medium to large organizations. With RBAC, you can define role-based access control that closely resembles your organization’s business rules. RBAC also works great with OIDC authentication.</p>

<p>Most Kubernetes distributions have RBAC enabled by default. You can check this by running the command <code>kubectl cluster-info dump | grep authorization-mode</code>, which should have <code>authorization-mode=RBAC</code> in the output. If not, you can enable it using the <code>--authorization-mode</code> flag for the API server when creating or patching the cluster. For example, setting <code>--authorization-mode=RBAC,Node</code> will enable both RBAC and Node authorization on the cluster.</p>

<p>Once RBAC is enabled, you can create roles (<code>Role</code>/<code>ClusterRole</code>) and bindings (<code>RoleBinding</code>/<code>ClusterRoleBinding</code>) to control access to your resources. Here is an example of a role and role binding that lets users view pods and services.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: fancy-namespace
  name: pod-service-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods", "services]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
</code>   

<p>The below binds the above role to a specific group of users.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods-services
  namespace: fancy-namespace
roleRef:
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-service-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects: # subject can be individual users or a group of users. Group is defined in the external authentication service, in this case, an OIDC server
  - kind: Group
    name: k8s-restricted-users
</code>   

 2. Secure the API server with OpenID Connect 

<p>Kubernetes supports many authentication mechanisms. Some of the most common are:</p>

 
   Client certificates 
   Basic authentication 
   Tokens (Service account tokens, Bearer tokens, and so on) 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a> 
   Proxy 
 

<p>Out of all these authentication mechanisms, OIDC is the most secure and scalable solution. It is ideal for clusters accessed by large teams as it provides a single sign-on solution for all users and makes it easy to onboard and offboard users. It is also way more secure than other mechanisms as you don’t have to store any sensitive information on a user’s computer, like client secrets and passwords. You can also use features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">MFA</a> and Yubikey if supported by your OIDC provider.</p>

<p></p>

<p>OIDC combined with RBAC becomes necessary as more and more people start accessing the cluster. It becomes essential to create groups and roles and provide limited access to specific groups. You can read more about this in my previous post <a>How to Secure Your Kubernetes Cluster with OpenID Connect and RBAC</a>.</p>

 3. Use Secrets for all sensitive data with appropriate access 

<p>This one should be a no-brainer. Kubernetes has a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret">Secret</a> resource that can be used to store sensitive data. This is a great way to store passwords, keys, and other sensitive data. Secrets can be used for storing string data, docker config, certificates, tokens, files, and so on. Secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables to be used in containers. Secrets can be plain text or encoded, but please don’t be that person who uses plain text secrets.</p>

<p>Secrets are flexible and native to Kubernetes, so there is no reason for you not to use them. Also, make sure to implement proper RBAC for secrets so that not everyone has access to them.</p>

 4. Keep Kubernetes version up to date 

<p>Like any other software, Kubernetes also has bugs and issues. And from time to time, there might be a high severity bug that calls for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVE</a>. Hence, it’s an excellent idea to keep the Kubernetes version up to date on the server and the CLI client. You can check the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/security/">Kubernetes security and disclosure information website</a> to see if there are known security vulnerabilities for your Kubernetes version. If you are using a managed PaaS, it should be pretty easy to upgrade, and for on-prem installations, there are tools like <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kOps</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/">kubeadm</a>, and so on, that makes it easy to upgrade clusters.</p>

 5. Restrict kubelet, API, and SSH access 

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/">kubelet</a> is the primary “node agent” running on each node, and by default, a kubelet’s HTTP endpoints are not secured. This could allow unintended access and hence <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-authentication-authorization/">should be restricted</a>.</p>

<p>When someone has access to a Kubernetes cluster, they can access the k8s API server and SSH into the cluster nodes themselves. To limit node access, cluster access should be limited as much as possible. Disable SSH access for non-admin users. Secure the API server using OIDC and RBAC, as we saw earlier, so that only authenticated users with sufficient roles can access the API.</p>

 6. Secure container images 

<p>Securing the container images that run on the cluster is as important as securing the cluster itself. A malicious image running on a cluster could wreak havoc. Follow these best practices for container image security.</p>

 
   Do not run containers as root as this would give the container unlimited access to the host. Always run the containers using a non-root user. 
   Enable container image scanning in your CI/CD phase to catch known vulnerabilities using tools like <a href="https://github.com/quay/clair">clair</a> or <a href="https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine">Anchore</a>. 
   Use minimal up-to-date official base images and remove all unwanted dependencies, packages, and debugging tools from the image as it will make it more secure and lightweight. 
   Prevent loading unwanted kernel modules in the containers. These can be restricted using rules in <code>/etc/modprobe.d/kubernetes-blacklist.conf</code> of the node or by uninstalling the unwanted modules from the node. 
   Use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/">official verified images</a> for popular software. Use a trusted registry for non-official images and always verify the image publisher 
   Use <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security">Docker Bench for Security</a> to audit your container images 
   Use <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/">Pod security policies</a> to limit a container’s access to the host further 
 

<p>You can read more about it in our “<a>Container Security: A Developer Guide</a>”.</p>

 7. Control traffic between pods and clusters 

<p>Generally, pods within the same cluster will be able to communicate with each other, and if you have multiple clusters in the same network, there may be traffic between them as well. Do not leave this all open, as it could lead to a compromised cluster when another in the network is affected. Use <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/">Kubernetes network policies</a> to control traffic between pods and clusters and allow only necessary traffic.</p>

 8. Use namespaces to isolate workloads 

<p>Do not run all your workloads in a single namespace. Isolating workloads in different namespaces based on business needs is more secure and easier to manage with RBAC. This way, you can fine-tune RBAC even further to let users access only what they need to see. You can also use Kubernetes network policies to isolate traffic between namespaces where applicable.</p>

 9. Limit resource usages 

<p>As with securing APIs and the cluster itself, it is also essential to set resource limits on how much CPU, memory, and persistent disk space is used by namespaces and resources. This secures your cluster from denial of service attacks when a particular container uses up all the resources. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/">Resources quotas</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/memory-default-namespace/">limit ranges</a> can be used to set limits at the namespace level, and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/">Requests and limits</a> can be used to set resource limits at container level as well.</p>

 10. Use monitoring tools to monitor all traffic and enable audit logging 

<p>Finally, it is also extremely important to monitor and audit your clusters. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/">Enable audit logging for the cluster</a> and use monitoring tools to keep an eye on the networking traffic to, from and within a cluster. Monitoring can be done using open-source tools, like Prometheus, Grafana, or with proprietary tools.</p>

 Bonus 

<p>Furthermore, keep these infrastructure best practices also in mind when securing your Kubernetes cluster.</p>

 
   Ensure that all communication is done via TLS. 
   Protect etcd with TLS, Firewall, and Encryption and restrict access to it using strong credentials. 
   Set up IAM access policies in a supported environment like a PaaS. 
   <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2021/08/20/how-to-secure-your-kubernetes-control-plane-and-node-components/">Secure the Kubernetes Control Plane</a>. 
   Rotate infrastructure credentials frequently. 
   Restrict cloud metadata API access when running in a PaaS like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining. And today, we’ll hear insights from the world of hackers. Of course, ethical hacking is what we’re talking about. And we have a very special guest with Linus Kvarnhammar. Linus is an independent cybersecurity consultant and professional hacker. He’s also one of the hackers in the TV series Hackad on the Swedish TV SVT. He has more than 20 years of experience working in the IT industry, where the last 10 years have been spent exclusively doing penetration tests of applications and networks with a few social engineering assignments every now and then.</p>
<p>Hello, Linus.</p>
<p>Linus Kvarnhammar: Hello.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very welcome. It’s nice being with you, Linus. And well, good to hear more about the interesting work you are doing there. So…</p>
<p>Linus: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please tell us a bit more about yourself and how was your journey to this world of cybersecurity and hackers.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah. I- the last 10 years or so, I’ve been doing penetration testing as a security consultant. And yeah, my interest in computers started when I got my Commodore 64, I think it was 1987. And then I had an Amiga. And then I started working with computers directly after school and I’ve been doing that since. I also spent some time, some years doing development work, being a .NET programmer. So a quick bit about my background.</p>
<p>Oscar: You also worked as a developer at some point?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, yeah. I think my background as a developer, and an IT pro back in the early days, was a good way of getting into security. Because I think, for me, cybersecurity is about knowing how a computer system works and trying to break it, right. So if you know how the application is built, and if you know how operating systems and networks work, then I think you have a good chance of being good at cybersecurity, I think.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And I can imagine if you have had, since a child you had a computer at home, not many of the ones who are listening to this had that. And yeah, I’m sure you understand. You have time to understand quite well how the computer works exactly as you said and also in your perspective as a developer. So when you were, for instance, a developer, during time you were a developer, you had also this interest in trying to find the vulnerabilities or something that doesn’t work well, you had already this curiosity?</p>
<p>Linus: No, I don’t… Nah, not really, actually. I think I was mostly focused on – focusing on like writing good code for new and upcoming cool technologies. So I didn’t really… I wasn’t really that interested in security when I was a developer, actually. So it was first when I actually got a job at a security company doing development work. So there, as one of the few developers or maybe the only one, I saw what the security consultants were doing. I thought it was really cool that they could like break into systems and networks. It’s like being a thief, but being authorised to make burglaries, but in the cyber domain, I think it was really cool. And so I transitioned to that.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, OK, that’s… yeah, that’s how you found this path. Fantastic. You have just said you have been working at least the last 10 years in penetration testing and these kind of activities. And you recently, you will tell us more, recently you have started to appear in a TV series called Hackad in the Swedish TV, please tell us a bit about that, especially how, yeah, how you were chosen, or, yeah.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, the TV series firstly is six episodes, and it’s broadcast on the Swedish Public Service television. And it can actually be viewed all over the world. But it’s in Swedish obviously. It’s six episodes with various themes, like private people, celebrities, companies, the smart home, etc. In each episode, we’re hacking different things, and showing what we’re doing and a lot of social engineering as well.</p>
<p>And I was approached by SVT, like maybe a year ago or a year before we started recording. And it was – we started, we recorded a pilot in December last year. And then we recorded the TV series in February, March. And a year approximately before that, I was approached by a person who was like working on developing the programme idea, and he got my name from another security consultant. And I, in turn, gave a few other names of security consultants that I knew were good at their jobs.</p>
<p>And in the beginning, the idea was that they were going to make a TV series about integrity and privacy and big data. So like Facebook, Google, what do they know about us, kind of thing. But me and a lot of other security consultants, I think told them that we can hack stuff. That’s what we do. And that’s pretty cool as well. I think they turned their attention or the focus of the TV series more, or not more, completely towards hacking things, both hacking private people and hacking companies.</p>
<p>In the pilot in December, we didn’t get any preparation, we were three people. And we showed up at a hotel and they said, “Hack this hotel.” And we went at it. We opened doors to try to find network connections, we attacked the WiFi, we did everything we could, but then eventually, we realised that this hotel is just one computer in the lobby, and the rest of the building is like a shared office space. So we failed miserably. But actually, for some reason, the pilot was, it turned out well anyway. And the managers at SVT they decided they wanted it so they ordered it and the production started two months later.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds super cool. And definitely, I watched some of the – some of the episode even though I don’t understand Swedish, but yes, it looked great, very interesting.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, actually, Jinny, one of the hackers in the TV series, she did an awesome job at actually translating all the episodes. So you can find <a href="https://hackad-english.blogspot.com/2021/11/hackad-tv-2021-english-subtitles.html">English subtitles</a> for the episodes out there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, it’s already…</p>
<p>Linus: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow. I have to come back and watch then.</p>
<p>Linus: I can provide you with <a href="https://hackad-english.blogspot.com/2021/11/hackad-tv-2021-english-subtitles.html">the link</a> where you can actually watch the streaming – but streaming from SVT and then adding English subtitles on top of it, it’s possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, perfect. We’re going to share that information so everybody can watch them. Fantastic. All right, excellent. And, as you say, at least in this series, it’s super visual when someone says OK, you can hack a person, it’s a celebrity, big profile company, can have machines, particularly machines, and yeah, it’s super wide how you can be hacked. Let’s bring the attention a bit on identity, which is the main thing we talked about in this podcast. We know that identity is, of course, quite connected to security. What do you think are the biggest problems related to identity that you find or you have been finding through your work as a security consultant?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, there are obviously a lot of technical issues that can be connected to identity authentication more. But on a higher-level identity I’m thinking, a thing I have been talking with clients about recently is this issue of government issued identification – because when you log into a generic application, you can usually say, you can provide whatever identity. You can make up your name, you can make up your– you can register any Gmail or any email address. But what about these applications where you need to prove your real identity, like public service applications?</p>
<p>I think that’s something I don’t think we’ve solved in our business like, is it… what/ how do we identify to as like me with my social security number to an application? In Sweden, we have something called mobile BankID. In other countries, they have similar but is that something we can require or expect every user to have? I think that’s a problem. I’m not sure it’s the biggest problem we have but it is a problem. Because some people might say that, “Well, my mobile BankID that’s my private ID and I don’t want to share that with my employer, for instance.</p>
<p>That’s probably something that needs to be solved. Like, we have a standard way of identifying a person in real life – passport, driver’s license, national identity card. But as far as I’m aware, we don’t have one that is universally accepted both by the individual and companies. Do you have any take on that?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s true. As you said, in Sweden there is a solution, I think it works pretty well. In a few other countries there’s something similar. But yeah, in the vast majority of countries, there’s no – first of all, there’s no global, as you say, there’s not something universal. And such solutions as the Swedish BankID is not present in most countries.</p>
<p>Linus: Exactly. And I was talking to a customer yesterday about like drivers in a company and the drivers, like kind of taxi drivers, they need to prove their identity when they start the car, or start like a device inside the car. And the best way of proving their identity would be mobile BankID. But then the question comes up, like can we really require that everyone has a mobile BankID, which is a personal identification? I’m not sure. And I guess that’s more of a legal aspect, I guess, than cybersecurity. But it is interesting nonetheless.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it is a good question definitely. Do some places, like as you give this concrete example of a driver authenticating so to say, to a car? Yes. What is a reasonable way?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. Because if you don’t use that kind of identification, let’s say you use a regular login, register and login like you do online, then you would have drivers running around with nicknames as authentication. Or, if it’s username and password, yeah, what makes it not the case that you share your username and password with another driver. So, as far as the public authority is concerned, one guy is driving, but actually it was another guy. So he may be his subcontractor that’s driving – his contract to another guy, and he just shared his login.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, yeah, actually that’s a very good observation, because in some of those cases, like driving a taxi or a bus, yeah, there should be more security into how the personnel identifies himself there.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. Imagine if the real bus driver was sitting at home watching TV, and then his brother, who wasn’t a bus driver, he was logging into the bus and driving it around. That wouldn’t be very good from a public safety standpoint.</p>
<p>And I guess these challenges are coming more and more as we have digitalising society more and more. Because if now, this is a fictitious example, but when you get your bus in the old way, or probably the current way, then you go somewhere, and you maybe show your ID at the gate, and you get your key, and then you sit down in the bus. But let’s say you digitalise all that, then you need government-issued or government approved digital identification to prove your identity. And then we have BankID, but can we expect everyone to use that? Or is that perhaps not legal? I’m not sure. I think it’s an interesting question. That would be more important as we go further into the digitalisation of the society.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah it is. Yeah. So what else have you found related to identity on those activities? Obviously, I know that in the TV series already, you are hacking some person’s identity for instance, right? So what is typical? What situation is typical to find?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, I would… if you have only a password, so if you divide up like, it’s interesting to think of passwords as something you know, like a phone, something you have, and then your eye or your fingerprint as something you are. Let’s say you only have one factor, the password. Then we have a long list of different issues that can occur. And one of the most common ones that we abuse in the TV series is that users typically share passwords or use the same password on many sites. And then it’s enough that one of those sites is hacked and the database leaks. So I have terabyte of leaked databases on my computer, which I can search.</p>
<p>So that’s one of the first and most easy ways to do if you want to get into someone’s account, you search for their email address, and see what password they’ve been using previously, in other applications, and you try out those, that’s one.</p>
<p>Another one is that if I give my password to you, or to your application, then you have the password. And then if I share that password with another site, then you, with your application, can know my password and try it on other applications. That’s also I mean, a fundamental issue.</p>
<p>And then you have everything with password resets and password policies, there are loads of technical security issues that you can find. And it’s in applications that we penetration test. I think it’s our job to push the clients or we’d like to push them to increase security. So we often like add requirements as time progresses, up the requirement on password length, for instance.</p>
<p>But then, with multi-factor authentication, it’s interesting as well, because I think a lot of people think that if I have two-factor authentication, I have my SMS codes, for instance, I’m fine. Nothing can happen. Well, I think it’s, you’re way much better off compared to someone who doesn’t have it. But when it comes to the security of the application, then it becomes really important to secure this session. Because if you’re – once you are authenticated, there’s something proving that you continuously can access the application right – and that’s typically a session cookie or JWT token. And if someone can steal that, they have stolen your login without you actually giving up your password and the two-factor authentication code.</p>
<p>A good example of that I did an assessment years back of a medical application for the everyday person in the society. And they were logging on with BankID. So that worked really solid well. But then they had a vulnerability in the web application that disclosed the error log. And then the error log were errors from all the other users. And in the error log was also their session cookie. So if I looked at their log, and waited for another user to trigger some error in the application, their session cookie would be logged, and I could see it. And then I could take that cookie, put it into my browser, and boom! Now I’m logged in as them.</p>
<p>See, I think it’s a good example of how you think a web application that requires mobile BankID is like 100% secure, but it’s actually not if it has these kinds of vulnerabilities. So there are a lot of things to test with regards to session management, like cookies and stuff like that, where it can go wrong.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s on the application side, right, the application that is right after you authenticate.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and I’ve found vulnerabilities around 2FA, two-factor authentication as well, like, let’s say you implement it, and it’s working perfectly. It’s just that when you guess, or when you enter your 2FA code, you can do it unlimited amount of times. And often the 2-factor code is four to six digits and if you can guess that in a high speed, and there will never be anything that prevents you from guessing further, you can potentially guess the right code.</p>
<p>Oscar: So you have you have done that. You have managed to…</p>
<p>Linus: I have done that. Yes. Yes, absolutely. And also backup codes – so sometimes you have two-factor authentication code, but then you have a backup code in case you lose your device and you are supposed to write down the backup code. If the backup code, that basically becomes a password. So it must be strong enough to stand against, I guess. But I’ve seen backup codes that are weak. So if they’re weak enough for you to be able to guess it, and perhaps you can guess indefinitely, and as long as you don’t have an application that detects this – detects and/or blocks, then maybe I can guess for weeks. That’s some examples of technical vulnerabilities that can affect I mean, high security authentication mechanisms. I mean, seemingly high as in two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So you were able to hack most of two-factor authentication methods.</p>
<p>Linus: Not most, not most. Some, some only.</p>
<p>Oscar: The weakest ones. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: &nbsp;Like, for instance, ah, typical is the SMS OTP?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: &nbsp;Yeah, that’s one of the weakest, yeah. Just guessing and guessing and you find out the…</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. If you’ve not implemented it properly in the backend, I mean, in the application. And obviously, a problem with two-factor authentication via SMS is also that the code is actually displayed on the locked phone, typically.</p>
<p>Let’s say you and me work in the same office and I’ve searched database dumps online and found your password in one of them and I try it out and I get confirmation that the password works, but you have two-factor authentication connected to your phone, then probably I’ll just wait until you leave your phone. And most people don’t leave their phone. But if you leave your phone to go to the toilet or something, I can login and just look at your phone, enter the code into the web application and get in.</p>
<p>Oscar: The phone is locked but it shows them, yeah.</p>
<p>Linus: Exactly. Yeah, it shows at least the first line of the SMS, it will typically show.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, very, very interesting, of course.</p>
<p>Linus: And I guess you probably talked or maybe you talked about SIM swapping attack. Have you done that?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, tell us more if – what you have found out.</p>
<p>Linus: That’s another problem with SMS as a two – second factor is, you’re basically relying on your cell phone provider to not give anyone else your phone number. So you’ve outsourced your security to your mobile phone provider. So if someone and this has been done, it’s been written about online. If someone managed to go to the phone store and convinced them or over the phone, convinced them that they are you, get a new SIM card for your phone number, then for a brief period of time until you notice it, they will have access to your phone number. But during that window, they can log in as you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Linus: And it could be even the case that if you do issue a password reset, some applications will have a password reset functionality that only requires the user to have the phone available. So in that case, you don’t even need the password. You just have to do a password reset and confirm that you know you have the right number and then you’re in. That makes other types of two-factor solutions like a mobile app much, much better.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how often still this SIM swapping done nowadays?</p>
<p>Linus: I’m not so sure about that. I don’t have any updated data or news on that. It was long time since I heard about it. But it is, I mean, the principle is that you’re relying on your mobile phone provider. So it’s – in that sense, it will always be a viable attack. It will always be dependent upon them keeping your phone number secure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it is definitely. And this is where mostly the attack is with the social engineering, correct?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, I would say so. But it’s not unreasonable in more sophisticated scenarios that you have an insider. So, if you look at these mobile phone shops, it’s typically young people that work there, they probably don’t have that much pay, so if you go to them, one of them, maybe take the one who’s mostly the least moral and the biggest amount of cash need, and you give them 1,000 Euro, maybe 10,000 Euro, I don’t know, they might be able to issue you on a new SIM card for that number.</p>
<p>And then that’s the cost of getting into that account. So if you have – if you consider you as, I mean, if you value your security high, maybe you are a person with additional requirements for some reason, or security, maybe this should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see that’s still a big threat. Yeah, absolutely, I guess.</p>
<p>Linus: I would expect the future to show us more cases of buying insider access and stuff like that, especially ransomware gangs, nowadays, they have so much money. So it’s not unreasonable for them to pay these kinds of amounts, I think for insider access.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Well, especially like a big target, right? Not unlike like a normal person but yeah, the big target.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. But let’s say you work at a big company, but you’re a regular person. If it’s enough to take over your account to get VPN access into this big company, that can then be ransomwared, then you are actually a pretty normal person. But your access is worth a lot to a ransomware gang.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So they gave a bigger target than the company that we get. Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Linus: It’s like, sometimes, you say you can hear people saying I think it’s valid, like the, one of the best key chains to get hold of is the cleaner in an office because he can access everything. I mean, if you want to pay someone to do something for you, he has access to everything. And he’s walking around the office space when everyone is not there. So it’s him or her as a person. It’s not a high value target but the access they have is high value.</p>
<p>Oscar: Something I remember now when we had a chat with you a few weeks ago before this interview is that, you show us on the on the TV series, I think you hacked one person, I don’t remember what you hacked exactly – either Facebook or some password. And because of that, thanks to the – well the single sign-on, for instance – by accessing one of these services, you were able to access many other services.</p>
<p>Linus: Yep, that’s right. And that’s – I think that’s episode one where we hack a private person’s Facebook account and then we can show him and the viewers that we had access to, I don’t know, 10, 20 applications, because he was using Facebook to authenticate to these applications.</p>
<p>That’s – I mean, that’s the nice thing with single sign-on, as in a Windows, typical Windows network but it’s also the downside. So in a Windows network, if you get hold of the identity of one person, you get access to all the resources this person has access to. So it’s, yeah, both pros and cons with that.</p>
<p>I understand why people use Google and Facebook to authenticate. And you have a lot of, what do you say, pros with that because you don’t have to manage a bunch of different websites or passwords. I mean, and you only need to trust that Google or Facebook is doing the authentication right. So there is a lot of good things with that. But then you should really keep that password and that account closely guarded. Because if you lose that it’s yeah, you have a lot of problems.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it’s important to be aware of that. So the users see the benefits, the process you said, but also take it – yeah, keep it very secure, especially if it’s a main account, like Google or Facebook could be it’s a gate to other services as well.</p>
<p>In the side of, for instance, this case, we’re talking about authorisation because we are authorising via your access from Google, for instance, to some access to other applications. When you have, for instance, were able to hack some systems, bypass the authentication, have you found that the weaknesses in the authorisation that the systems are not properly configured or even designed to, to define well the authorisation of a user?</p>
<p>Linus: I think that’s one of the most common vulnerabilities we see because it’s complex. It’s typically more complex to get this right than other things. So an application typically has many, many different endpoints to get information, to change information, to add information. And every one of these needs to be configured properly usually in code. Like to access this endpoint, you need to be this role and this role. And it’s easy to miss that, to forget one or more of those, or configure them wrong. Maybe that’s one that should require a more strict role than another one. So I think the complexity there is working against developers. And we often see some mistakes in this area.</p>
<p>Oscar: And the mistakes goes more or both into designing the system and also configuring right, maybe in both, I think.</p>
<p>Linus: I would say it’s mostly implementing it, because when you design it, you can say that, well, the admin page should only be accessed by admins – administrators, for instance. But that requires that every admin action then is implemented such that it will deny a regular user access. So it’s up to the programmers often to do the right work to get this right.</p>
<p>And then it’s good to understand that, at least from my perspective, two main different types of access control mechanisms. It’s on a functional level, like role-based, you should have access to this area and not this. So let’s say you’re a regular user, you should not be able to access the admin page, or admin functionality. And then there’s an object-based, so I should be able to read my messages, not yours. And the latter one is typically the most difficult to get right because it might be that it’s built further down in deeper layers of the application where you need to actually check that the object that you’re trying to read and return is actually belonging to this user. That’s a typical vulnerability we find.</p>
<p>It’s actually something often pretty easy to test for regular people. If you’re browsing the web, and you– or you’re logged in somewhere and you’re maybe reading messages, downloading files, and you see the URL that has a number there, try changing the number to something else. And if you get someone else’s message, then maybe you committed a crime, I’m not sure. But at least you can report it to the company.</p>
<p>I did that for – you can say I can anonymise it a little bit, but privately I got, like I said, I got a certain kind of license, so I interacted with one government page. So I logged in, and I accessed like my test results on this license. And then I could see easily in the URL that there was a number there. So I just changed that number to another number, and I got someone else’s test results. And then I put that into a script. And I downloaded probably like 10,000 test results. And obviously I contacted them, found out who was responsible and told them about this, and they fixed it immediately. And they were really thankful. But it turned out that this database contains test results from I think back to the ‘90s.</p>
<p>Oscar: Did your service to the…</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Oscar: …to the community. Fantastic. Yeah, it’s excellent that the power of people like you that have this amazing technical expertise and can help not only specific companies, but also to everybody like to the whole country, the whole community. Fantastic.</p>
 
 Super interesting hearing your stories and everything we have in here. And please, final question we’d like to ask you is for all business leaders, decision makers who are listening to this, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today? 
 
<p>Linus: Business leaders should be aware of the risks that they are having. So if they are not talking to the IT department, IT manager or CISO, if they are not talking to them, asking them like what risks do we have? Are we doing – are we assessing security? Then they should do that, because otherwise, the risk is that security is something that is handled below like far down in the organisation. And then this need for budget and time and everything that is needed to invest in security is not getting addressed at the top.</p>
<p>So if the leaders asked their subordinates, “Tell me about the risks we are having.” and they – then they need to get these reports. And that’s I think, how you – how it should start, not start but if you know what I mean. I think typically or in many organisations, security is not addressed at the top. So it should be considered an investment in your company, in your solutions, not just a cost.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Yeah, I could not agree more with that. Thanks a lot Linus for this very interesting conversation. It’s been a pleasure. Let me know if people would like to see your work or get in touch with you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Linus: I think <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kvarnhammar/">LinkedIn</a> is the best. That’s where I’m pretty active. I answer messages and yeah, I publish some stuff there every now and then.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great. And of course, do watch the TV series Hackad on the Swedish TV, which I’m going to put the link on this episode. Again, thank you, Linus, what a pleasure talking with you and all the best.</p>
<p>Linus: Thank you very much.</p>

 GiD Report#188 — Square’s web3 identity ambitions <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-186-what-is-web3-155d493ac6c5">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-14-what-we-learned-at-solana-breakpoint-331ce5c0341f">EPISODE 14 — What we learned at Solana Breakpoint</a></p><p>This week:</p>  Square’s web3&nbsp;vision  A world full of credentials  Chart of the week — 90s internet&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. Square’s web3&nbsp;vision <p>First, they <a href="https://tbd54566975.ghost.io/introducing-tbdex/">published a white paper</a>, as per <a href="https://twitter.com/TBD54566975/status/1461791639308050443">their cheeky tweet</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a> and <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><p>The paper was <a href="https://github.com/TBDev-54566975/white-paper">also published to Github</a> (in case you want to contribute).</p><p>For context, TBD is a new division within Square focused on non-custodial and decentralized financial offerings.</p><p>The white paper’s vision is similarly straightforward — essentially a decentralized exchange with built in social trust (AKA identity). From the abstract:</p><blockquote>The tbDEX protocol facilitates decentralized networks of exchange between assets by providing a framework for establishing social trust, utilizing decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to establish the provenance of identity in the real&nbsp;world.</blockquote><p>For the world of self-sovereign identity, Square’s entrance into the arena will be huge when it comes to the promotion of open, interoperable, and privacy preserving standards such as decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.</p><p>As GlobaliD co-founder and CTO Mitja Simcic&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>Most interesting bit is that unlike traditional DEXs, Square doesn’t plan to use a trustless model, like atomic swaps, and instead uses decentralized identity and verifiable credentials</blockquote><p>As <a href="https://tbd54566975.ghost.io/introducing-tbdex/">their blog post explains</a>, this was a natural solution.The real world, both social and economic, is still based on the notion of identity — not merely the ownership of cryptographic keys. In order to build those bridges, building trust and identity into decentralized frameworks is an inherent requirement. There’s also the question of regulations and compliance:</p><blockquote>This means that such exchanges of value must necessarily be based on other means of governing social trust. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) provide part of the solution by enabling verifiable digital identities that facilitate trustworthy exchanges between counterparties. But the main benefits are lost if the DID method is not implemented in an open, permissionless, and censorship resistant manner.</blockquote><blockquote>We propose a solution that does not rely on a federation to control permission or access to the network; nor does it dictate the level of trust required between counterparties. There is no governance token. Instead, the tbDEX protocol allows participants to negotiate trust directly with each other — or mutually and voluntarily rely on trusted third-parties to vouch for the counterparty. Transaction costs are ultimately driven by risk. At maximum anonymity, transaction costs will necessarily be higher; at maximum disclosure, they should be lower. This approach to price discovery allows the marketplace to find the right&nbsp;balance.</blockquote><blockquote>The tbDEX protocol also facilitates the secure exchange of the minimum necessary identity information acceptable to counterparties in order to satisfy requirements, be they legal, regulatory, or related to any other consideration of risk. The protocol itself neither collects nor records any personally identifiable information.</blockquote><p>So there you have&nbsp;it.</p><p>It may or may not have been a coincidence that Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720">resigned as Twitter CEO</a> this morning. We know that ideas of web3 have been percolating in Jack for some time. Back in December of 2019, he <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">announced what would become Bluesky</a>, an initiative to develop a decentralized social media protocol. We haven’t heard much&nbsp;since.</p><p>But dreams of a decentralized future continued. In August, Jack announced their latest plan — <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1431320761474617344">develop a decentralized Bitcoin exchange</a>.

With web3, people can share tokens showing someone’s crucial role on a project. This happens, now, on DAOs (more on those here), blockchain-based communities. I spend a lot of time at the Bankless DAO, where it is just a routine part of the daily flow for people to send tokens of gratitude to those who have been helpful in some project or other. People who attend meetings, get a POAP, a token of attendance. So, you can see at a glance if someone is an active member or an occasional lurker. Every day, people send “tips” of tokens of gratitude to others. One person giving a particularly helpful colleague a tip often leads to an avalanche of others doing the same. (Come to think of it, I really haven’t gotten a lot of tips. I should up my&nbsp;game.)</blockquote><blockquote>As web3 becomes more ubiquitous (as I expect it to), younger employees will ask their bosses and co-workers and, eventually, demand of them that they implement this kind of in-real-time, collaborative credentialing.</blockquote><blockquote>Similarly, people can build up a collection of immutable tokens showing the conferences they attended, the courses they took, the skills they proved, the books they read, the creators they supported.</blockquote><blockquote>I expect it to become routine — first among younger people in more technical fields — that recruitment will involve looking at someone’s blockchain-backed identity to see a richer picture of the person’s background. If a candidate with an unpromising resume can demonstrate an unusually large number of these Gold Star tokens — in which former bosses and colleagues sent digital expressions of gratitude — from their past, you might overlook the fact that they didn’t, quite, graduate college. Alternatively, if someone with pristine credentials has a dearth of such expressions of gratitude, you might look at them more critically.</blockquote><p>Combining that with token issuance for specific projects:</p><blockquote>If you want to achieve some quick result — design an app, create a conference, build a new kind of bicycle, whatever — that you couldn’t do on your own, you typically have to spend a ton of time and resources NOT doing the thing you care about. You probably need to hire people, which means you need to raise money, which means you need a business plan and have to spend most of your time pitching.&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>With web3, you could announce your goal publicly. People who are interested will reach out. You can quickly see what they’ve done (see above) and choose the team that meets your requirements.

 Introduction: <p>The team at Ocean is thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.neworder.network/">New Order </a>and <a href="https://reflexer.finance/">Reflexer Labs</a> will launch H2O, an $OCEAN backed, non-pegged stable asset. It’s based on the RAI stable asset by Reflexer Labs. Like RAI, it is decentralized, permissionless, and minimizes governance.</p><p>New Order DAO is driving this initiative. They are a community-driven venture DAO incubator for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. H2O will be available on New Order’s DeFi marketplace with strong benefits for the Ocean ecosystem, especially Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> What is&nbsp;H2O? <p>Stable crypto assets help attract would-be users of Web3 applications who have shied away from cryptocurrency due to excessive volatility. They are growing in popularity with their market surging past <a href="https://charts.coinmetrics.io/network-data/#313">$100&nbsp;billion</a>.</p><p>The H2O non-pegged stable asset is a friendly fork of RAI. Whereas RAI uses ether (ETH) as its asset for collateral, H2O uses OCEAN. The price of H2O is managed by an algorithm that rebalances to bring the redemption price close to the market price and participants are incentivized to aid in this process. Traditional stable assets are pegged to a price such as 1 USD. In contrast, RAI (and soon H2O) are free-floating but typically settle around a price; for RAI this has been&nbsp;~$3.</p><p>The (un)governing token of the protocol will be AQUA. This token helps manage the initial parameters of the protocol, bootstrap ecosystem development, and incentivize the liquidity of the protocol. AQUA token emissions will be done fairly, with portions earmarked for the Ocean community.</p><p>The H2O token will bring two near-term benefits to the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>First, OCEAN holders will be able to stake OCEAN in order to mint H2O tokens, similar to how ETH is staked to mint DAI or RAI. The OCEAN stakers can earn based on staking. Second, Ocean Market users are exposed to lower volatility data prices. Ocean Market is a decentralized data market powered by Ocean Protocol, which has been live since fall 2020. In it, people use $OCEAN to buy, sell, and stake in the OCEAN token. This adds liquidity to the Ocean ecosystem whilst generating demand for $OCEAN. With the launch of H2O, Ocean Market (V4) users will be able to price tokens and stake in data pools with H2O. Therefore, data prices do not fluctuate the way they would with changes in the price of $OCEAN. (Users will still have the option to use $OCEAN). This reduces the risk and increases the potential upside for Ocean Market&nbsp;users.</p> H2O Launch and Tokenomics <p>The project is overseen and executed by the New Order DAO which is a new permissionless incubation DAO, generating long-term value by building and launching early-stage financial protocols, applications, tools, and infrastructure. The DAO launches and supports projects across many layer one ecosystems, and explores DeFi &amp; NFT markets surrounding new digital asset&nbsp;classes.</p><p>H2O is currently in the final stages of the initial deployment. Its official mainnet deployment will be lined up with the release of the Ocean V4. Expected to ship in Q1 2022, Ocean V4 includes Data NFTs and resolves rug pull challenges. Then, there will be work for support of H2O in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>The distribution of the AQUA un-governance token is planned to occur over 18 months via staking contracts. This includes 2.45% to single-sided FLX staking, 2.45% to FLX/ETH Uniswap V2 LP, 2.1% to RAI Curve LP (subject to change to Reflexer’s liquidity plans). Some AQUA will be distributed directly to the Ocean community.</p><p>Visit<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/"> oceanprotocol.com</a> to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> |<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a> |<a href="https://blockfolio.com/coin/OCEAN_3"> Blockfolio</a> |<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/"> Blog</a> |<a href="https://www.youtube.com/oceanprotocol"> YouTube</a> |<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/"> Reddit</a> |<a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a> |<a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">&nbsp;Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/stable-asset-h2o-backed-by-ocean-is-launched-by-new-order-together-with-reflexer-labs-91d3a29efb21">Stable asset H2O backed by $OCEAN is launched by New Order together with Reflexer Labs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Building trust within an NFT community is tough. The NFT world is rife with scam stories about bots, rug pulls and bad actors, making it hard for buyers to trust good projects. Even worse, there are only limited tools available to combat these threats.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re proud to present an innovative suite of tools as an end-to-end solution that takes every step of the NFT lifecycle into account, helping creators prove authorship, protect their mints against bots, build more reliable communities, and create members-only experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creators can get started immediately by verifying their identities, pseudonymous-identities, and projects — they may simply go to our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MWmhXauJw8">Discord server</a> to get verified through our new automated Civic Pass portal. With Civic Pass, creators are also able to confirm that participants are legitimate buyers, not bots. And coming soon, creators will also be able to verify that community members in their Discord servers hold certain NFTs in their wallet. This feature will allow creators to offer members-only experiences.</p>



<p>Our goal is to make the process of building trust easier and more effective for creators. With that in mind, we’re sharing an overview of our plan to address the pain points of creators and marketplaces in the NFT space using identity tools.</p>



  
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Build trust: Get verified by Civic</p>



<p>The first step for NFT teams or creators is to get verified with the Verified by Civic Pass program.</p>



<p>Our NFT identity verification process includes biometric liveness checks, KYC and sanctions screening, Twitter handles and ownership of project websites. Once completed, Civic will announce that creators have been fully verified. This helps establish trust with potential buyers and community members. <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/verified-by-civic-pass/">We’ve verified over a dozen projects</a>, and we’ll have more product developments in this area in 2022.</p>
  



  
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Issue your NFT collection: Defeat bots and create member whitelists</p>



<p>Coming soon, Civic Pass will be integrated with Metaplex’s Candy Machine and Fair Launch Protocol (FLP), the leading Solana protocols for minting, to add on-chain real-person verification. <a href="https://docs.civic.com/candy-machine-and-ignite-pass-setup/how-to-protect-nft-mints-from-bots">Civic Pass TokenGuard</a> is fully compatible with Metaplex’s Token Metadata standard, so tokens remain fully compatible with wallets and secondary marketplaces. Creators can use Civic Pass TokenGuard to confirm that mint participants are legitimate buyers, not bots.</p>



<p>Freedom and security shouldn’t just be limited to creators, so Civic is creating a Discord bot to keep the community spaces fair and secure by providing industry-leading whitelisting tools. Our Discord bot will offer a standardized process, including a liveness check, for verifying participants within the Discord community.&nbsp;</p>
  



  
<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Create members-only experiences and gated experiences for DAOs</p>



<p>Soon, we will be enabling gated, members-only experiences with proof of NFT ownership. Using Civic Pass, community members will be able to enter Discord servers by holding certain NFTs in their wallets. And, the same NFT in combination with Civic Pass will enable a related decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to prove that members meet its requirements. With these tools, community members can start shaping communities that feel more meaningful.&nbsp;</p>
  



<p>We are excited to offer these tools to the NFT and DeFi communities because we believe identity verification is vital to safeguarding digital assets as they become more widely adopted.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">Developer Hub</a> is a great place for developers to start integrating Civic’s NFT solutions into their projects.<a href="https://twitter.com/civickey"> </a>And, verifying upcoming NFT drops and mints is <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MWmhXauJw8">easily started on Discord</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This series of blogs is prompted by the UK Government’s proposed reforms of data protection law contained in its consultation paper Data: A New Direction. The stated intention of these proposals is to unleash a new ‘golden age’ of innovation and growth. But the real effect of these reforms would be&nbsp;to:</p>  Under the banner of tackling ‘consent fatigue’, abolish citizens’ right to consent to the collection and use of their data: achieved by expanding the definition of organisations’ ‘legitimate interests’ (where they don’t have to seek consent) to cover almost every activity they would wish to undertake, thereby rendering consent irrelevant.  Under the banner of helping organisations access more data for the purposes of research and innovation, abolish the core principle upon which data protection regulations have been built: that personal data should only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. The Government’s proposals would do this by making ‘further processing’ of citizens’ data legal in so many additional circumstances (‘legitimate interests’, use in ‘research’, for AI, to improve ‘data sharing’, etc) that the core principle is rendered irrelevant.  <p>These proposals represent the biggest attack on citizen rights seen in this country for generations. They would <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/the-uk-governments-plan-to-reform-data-protection-laws-are-terrifying/">make new Cambridge Analyticas legal</a>, and would put UK citizens’ data up for sale in global markets — the stated goal being to “secure the UK’s status as a global hub for the free and responsible flow of personal data” (where ‘responsible’ is never defined in over 50,000 words of argumentation, but where the door is opened to ‘irresponsible’ uses of data many times&nbsp;over).</p><p>This blog series explores the many mistaken assumptions that lie behind this disastrous initiative. The innovation and growth that Government promises its reforms will bring are a fantasy. They will not unleash a new ‘golden age’ they are based on deep misunderstandings of what makes data valuable in the first place and how to unleash this value. This, first, blog in the series looks at why data is valuable.</p> Where data’s value comes&nbsp;from <p>Given all the fuss that’s made about data, you’d think everyone would have an immediate answer to this question. But when you ask it strange things&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Some people immediately go off on a tangent, talking about how much money is being made out of data. But this begs the question: why are people prepared to pay so much for it? Others repeat catchphrases such as ‘data is the new oil’. Very soon people are embroiled in arguments about whether data is, or is not, ‘like oil’ — while the original question gets forgotten.</p><p>But the answer to this question matters, because it will inform all the policies and strategies that follow. If you get it wrong (as the UK Government is currently doing with their proposals to ‘reform’ data protection regulations ) you risk wasting huge amounts of time, money and effort chasing rainbows, while missing the opportunities that really&nbsp;matter.</p> Reliability and&nbsp;Surprise <p>So why is data valuable? Because of two things. Reliability and Surprise.</p><p>Reliability If we know a fact to be true, we can act on it without incurring the risks (and costs) of making a mistake. If the data you are working with is unreliable — if you don’t know if it is true or not — any decisions or actions you take on the basis of it risks being wrong. One of three things then&nbsp;happens.</p>  You don’t dare making the decision or taking the action, in which case lots of things that could happen&nbsp;don’t.  You make a wrong decision or take a wrong action and then have to incur the costs of cleaning up the&nbsp;mess.  You invest significant amounts of time, money and effort trying to improve the reliability of your data (often paying external agencies exorbitant fees to confirm basic facts), so that you avoid the costs and lost opportunities of the first&nbsp;two.  <p>Across the economy today, individuals’ and service providers’ inability to access and use the right, reliable data when and where they need it is a major cause of unnecessary cost and waste, fraud and of missed opportunities.</p><p>This lack of access to the right reliable data has deep structural causes. Usually somebody, somewhere has generated or checked that a piece of information is correct — that is indeed reliable. But because our data economy is currently organisation-centric (that is, organised around hundreds of different, isolated, separate data silos run by different, separate organisations), this data remains inaccessible.</p><p>What’s needed is a new personal data logistics infrastructure which enables individuals to get hold of certified data about themselves (verified attributes) and to share this data, under their control, as and when they need to. If such infrastructure were put in place, everyone would have access to reliable data when they need it, and everyone would be able to eliminate the friction, effort, risk and cost that pile up when it’s not available.</p><p>We estimate that over 95% of all data processing activities undertaken by British services providers in the private, public and third sectors (e.g. banking, insurance, retail, utilities, media and communication, local and central Government public administration, education, health, transportation, leisure, charities, etc) relate to the collection and use of data for the purposes of service provision: primarily administrative activities that depend on the availability of reliable&nbsp;data.</p><p>Yet nowhere in the 50,000-plus words of of the UK Government’s Data: A New Direction consultation does it even come close to recognising this fact. Which means its entire ‘data strategy’ is already missing the most fundamental point.</p> Surprise <p>The second reason why data can be valuable is the opposite of the first: it can surprise you by telling you something you didn’t know. It’s data as ‘surprise’ that helps people and organisations keep abreast of a fast changing&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data as ‘surprise’ is what fuels research and those innovations that are driven by insight into peoples’ behaviours. It’s a great thing. But we have to keep it in perspective. By definition, innovations are exceptions to the rule — the rule being the administration of existing services. And once an innovative product or service has been created to realise its value, it needs to be delivered to people, which requires the reliable data that drives these processes. In this situation, data’s two aspects of reliability and surprise work together, with ‘reliability’ still ensuring the actual delivery of value. For the ‘surprise’ side of data to generate value, the ‘reliability’ aspect is essential.</p><p>That’s why we say that at least 95% of data’s value comes from reliability. But unfortunately, as we’ve noted above, the UK Government’s proposed data protection reforms focus entirely on research and innovation: the 5%. A classic case of the tail wagging the&nbsp;dog.</p> Mixtures of reliability and&nbsp;surprise <p>Even though they are like chalk and cheese, often the biggest value is generated by mixing reliability and surprise. For surprises to be valuable they need to be reliable: fake news can be a very dangerous thing, Some things can be surprisingly reliable as we’ll see when we discuss artificial intelligence in a later&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other things are ‘reliably surprising’: by which we are confronted by new information that changes what we do, but where the sorts of new information and the sorts of changes that result are part of a routine&nbsp;process.</p><p>Take your daily commute to work. You know exactly where you are going, what the route is, how long it should take, and so on. And yet, every journey you make is full of little surprises — little bits of new information that you need to respond to. A traffic light turns red. A child looks like they might run out into the road. A car suddenly turns right in front of you. In each case, you know how to deal with the situation. It’s happened many times before. But on each occasion, you still have to deal with the ‘surprise’.</p><p>In modern economies, a huge range of important value-adding activities fall into this category of managing ‘reliable surprises’. Take the health service which is largely organised around the management of ‘reliable surprises’: common ailments with well known symptoms and treatments but where, on each occasion, a diagnosis is still needed and a resulting set of actions planned and implemented.</p><p>Likewise financial services when deciding whether or not to give someone a loan or assessing an insurance risk, or public administrators deciding whether an individual is entitled to a benefit or service. And so on. A huge amount of the data that’s collected and used in our society today is devoted to the efficient management of such ‘reliable surprises’.</p> Implications <p>Talking about reliability and surprise as we’ve done here may seem simple and obvious. In a sense it is. But its implications are profound.</p><p>Practically speaking, for the full potential of data to be realised, individuals and service providers need to be able to access and use the right reliable data at the right time, on a mass scale. For this, we need new infrastructure. Just as the industrial age needed a national electricity grid to unleash electricity’s potential, so we need a new data ‘grid’ — a data logistics infrastructure that gets the right reliable data to (and from) the right people and places at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>That’s what we at Mydex are working on — personal data logistics infrastructure that puts citizens at the heart of the process, including them in the workings of society and economy. The Scottish Government has begun to realise this with its decision to create its <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a>. SAPS enables organisations to share verified (reliable data about their citizens) with the citizen so citizens, in turn, can share this data when and where they need to gain access to other services and eradicate things like form filling, delays and improve access, inclusion and outcomes.</p><p>Some of the work the UK Government is doing around personal data — its Identity and Attribute Trust Framework for example — has truly positive potential. But this Consultation and these proposals? Oh dear! They misunderstand where the real value of data lies and rely instead on a mythological narrative promoted mainly by Silicon Valley lobbyists. The <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">next post in this series</a> turns to this narrative.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">Five Myths about Data, Innovation and Growth</a> Explains why the Government’s claims that its ‘reforms’ will promote innovation and growth are without foundation.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">AI: The Emperor’s New Clothes?</a> Shows how the Government’s claims that these ‘reforms’ are needed to promote Artificial Intelligence are without foundation, and based on deep misunderstandings of AI&nbsp;itself.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is data valuable?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Online scams have seen a huge surge in the past year, with a reported number of identity thefts and digital fraud rising by 25.07% in 2021, compared to 2020, according to TransUnion.</p>



<p></p>



<p>As our community may be aware, we have recently been targeted by scammers impersonating us, and offering ShareToken in exchange for your seed phrases, and personal security information. Although not an uncommon circumstance within our industry, we would like to take this opportunity to remind our users about their digital safety, and what triggers to look for when identifying a potential scammer.</p>



<p>Imposter scams will mimic anything that entices you to engage with them. This could be the likeness of a company, such as ShareRing, to the impersonation of social media challenges such as that on Instagram, where participants are asked to share their personal information in response to a question on their stories.</p>



<p></p>



<p>A key characteristic of a scam is usually associated with unusual payment requests such as making a direct bank transfer, often with urgency. This is one of the most prevalent methods used. Scams tend to manipulate emotion by also impersonating authority from government officials to family members. To keep your privacy safe, here are three tips you should always keep in mind:</p>



  Never disclose passwords and seed phrases  



<p>Be alert while sharing your personal information. Do not save your credit/ debit card or personal details on a website. It is suggested to secure your privacy by using a code on every app &amp; never provide any seed phrase, code or passcode to anyone.&nbsp;</p>



  &nbsp;Be careful of fake websites.  



<p>Always head to the official websites or accounts. Many accounts mirror the official websites and may disguise themselves with very similar URLs (G00gle.com) or redirect people to unofficial payment links. Always check the domain name to see whether there is an “s” in the URL, E. g. “https://”, or a lock on the address bar.&nbsp;</p>



  &nbsp;Avoid unknown caller or text messages.&nbsp;  



<p>Do not respond to text messages or missed calls from unknown numbers. Never provide any personal details, security numbers, passwords and any personal identification to suspicious callers. If you receive emails with links and attachments, do not click on them to avoid phishing scams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-terbu/">Oliver Terbu</a> (<a href="https://mesh.xyz/">ConsenSys Mesh</a>), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alen-horvat-0418b551/">Alen Horvat</a> (<a href="https://www.aceblock.com/">AceBlock</a>)</p> Introduction <p>With <a href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</a> the Web3 community has established a critical piece of infrastructure that is used by the majority of web3 protocols to different degrees. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> is part of the <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> stack and is used for the underlying peer-to-peer network for discovery, routing and data exchange. Peers in the network can dial other peers in the network to exchange messages using various transports, like QUIC, TCP, WebSocket, and Bluetooth. Modular design of the <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> framework enables it to build drivers for other transports. Peers can run on any device, as a cloud service, mobile application or in the browser and talk to each other as long as they are connected through the same <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>&nbsp;network.</p><p>A peer in a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network is identified through its <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/">peer identity (peer ID</a>). A peer ID is essentially derived from the public key (hash) of the peer’s key pair which can change over time, specifically when keys are rotated or revoked. For that reason, peer IDs are insufficient for building a stable fully-decentralized messaging framework. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, on the other hand, were designed to support key rotation while keeping a stable identifier. Hence, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> should be used as the more permanent public identifier for peers in the network, which would hold information about the peer IDs, <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network and supported protocols. Peers would still use their peer ID for <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> routing and authentication. Alice and Bob would exchange their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> out of band and will be able to find their counterparty’s peer ID via their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. In this way, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> acts as an indirection layer for the peer ID, thus allowing Alice and Bob to change their peer ID for practical reasons without the need to notify each&nbsp;other.</p><blockquote>Note: A <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/">peer ID</a> is a term defined by libp2p and is not the same as a <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">peer DID</a> although a <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/">peer ID</a> can also be used with a <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">peer DID</a> by following the approach described in this&nbsp;article.</blockquote><p><a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> is a modular system of protocols and specifications for building P2P applications. It can be also used to build P2P messaging applications. although messaging through <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> has limitations. Peers in the network are usually not always online, especially if Bob is travelling a lot, lives in an area with limited connectivity, is actually an intelligent car, or has a monthly limit with his mobile data plan. When Alice wants to send Bob a message and Bob is not online, then the likelihood of Bob eventually receiving the message reduces dramatically. DIF <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> solves this problem by defining mediator nodes that can run in high-availability mode. Those mediators can act as Alice and Bob’s mailboxes where both use DID authentication to receive the latest messages from their mediators. Instead of associating Bob’s peer ID with his <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>, Bob would associate his mediator’s peer ID with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>, so Alice would dial-up Bob’s mailbox through the <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network and first forward the message to the mediator. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> ensures that only Bob can decrypt the message and that Bob can verify Alice authenticated the message through authenticated encryption (authcrypt). Additional trust, security and access management can be added through <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> that counteract spam and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>This article explains how two parties, Alice and Bob, can securely communicate using <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> through a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network, where discovery, security and trust are rooted in Decentralized Identity technologies. First, we present how Alice and Bob prepare and exchange information about their peers, next we describe how peers establish secure P2P connections, and last we present DIDComm message exchange via the channels. We assume you are familiar with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VCs</a>. If you are not, check out <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">DIF FAQ</a> for a great&nbsp;intro.</p> Exchanging information <p>To start messaging, Alice and Bob must exchange information about their peers and mediators. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> help to establish a trusted Decentralized Identity layer for the peers, where peers can always find the latest information about the active mediators, peer IDs, authentication, and encryption keys. This enables mutual peer authentication and end-to-end stream encryption. We use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> service property to manage and share peer information as presented below.</p>DIDComm Messaging service section using libp2p transport<p>Thus Alice and Bob need to exchange their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> out-of-band and clients will be able to discover, authenticate and connect. The design is applicable to almost all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>&nbsp;methods.</p> Establishing secure&nbsp;streams <p>Now that Alice and Bob exchanged information about their peers, the peers establish authenticated and end-to-end encrypted P2P streams. If at least one of the peers has public endpoints or supports NAT transversal, peers can connect directly. Since most services are behind firewalls or don’t have public endpoints, P2P connection can be established only via relay or proxy nodes. These nodes either help with the NAT traversal or simply relay all the traffic. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> has full support for relay nodes that can be hosted by anyone, i.e. self-hosted or hosted by a 3rd party provider. Furthermore, every client can select which relay node(s) can be used to establish a connection with it and every new connection can be established via different nodes. Such an open design enables us to build a fully decentralized mesh of relay&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>After discovery, peers mutually authenticate. Authentication can be performed using peer IDs or any other <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> authentication key(s). <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> ensure that keys are valid (not revoked) and are linked to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>. Modular design enables plug in various mutual authentication protocols, like mutual TLS. After a successful mutual authentication, the streams are end-to-end encrypted either using TLSv1.3 or Noise Protocol, both supporting perfect forward secrecy. Note that other encryption protocols or frameworks can be plugged in. Only allow-listed peers, i.e., <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> of Alice or Bob registered with their clients, are allowed to open a stream. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) can be used to define more granular identity and access management policies.</p><p><a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> supports establishing a connection on the network levels, like QUIC, TCP/UDP, WebSocket, client authentication and traffic encryption. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> is introduced on top of <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> to fill-in the missing messaging capabilities.</p> Messaging <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> (aka DIDComm V2) provides a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Version 1 of DIDComm was specified in the HyperLedger (HL) Aries project as a set of HL Aries RFCs. With governance and further development moved to DIF, the goal was to specify one core specification for <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging </a>that addresses previously defined gaps and achieve better development experience. In particular V2 relies on better formalized methods, simpler message structures, has no requirement for DID exchange, treats ephemeral and full mode in the same way and has explicit support for all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> methods. Another goal was to address requirements beyond the HL Aries community.</p><p>In <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> trust is rooted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Atop <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> defines a set of methodologies to send messages between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> or more specifically their agents. Messages can be extended through specific <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocols. At a glance, <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> entails the following:</p>  Defines a data model for a common plaintext messages structure i.e. headers,&nbsp;body.  JOSE-based authn and encryption between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> with repudiation by&nbsp;default.  Defines a methodology for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> rotation.  Defines a methodology for (onion-)routing for various network architectures.  Defines core protocols such as invitations and feature discovery.  Defines core transport protocols for HTTP(S) and WebSockets.  Defines an extensibility model for adding new sub-protocols (e.g., VC Exchange) and new transports (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>).  <p>The following diagram shows the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> mental&nbsp;model.</p>DIDComm Messaging Mental&nbsp;Model<p>Typically, if Alice wants to send a message to Bob, Bob sends Alice an explicit invitation or Bob gives her his public <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> (implicit invitation through Bob’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Document</a>). Alice would then extract the service endpoint and recipient/routing keys from the invitation and can start sending messages to Bob. The first message could already contain a <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol message, since Alice can encrypt the message to Bob. After Bob receives the message, Bob can create a new <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> for Alice and indicate the change through <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> rotation.</p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> is transport-agnostic and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Documents</a> can be extended to support various transport mechanisms. The community developed approaches for HTTP(S) and WebSockets primarily, other transports such as Bluetooth are also under development.</p> Putting all&nbsp;together <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> running on top of a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network enables us to build a next generation decentralized messaging framework. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> enables establishing secure connections between peers regardless of their transport and IP properties (public, local, static, dynamic). Once peers establish secure connections with the help of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, they can authenticate (DID Authentication) and exchange <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol messages. Using a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network doesn’t require any changes to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol as <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> clients can support multiple messaging protocols and multiple different <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> networks (private or public) — it can work via existing public IPFS network, private <a href="https://www.aceblock.com/">AceBlock</a> network, and others. Layered architecture and clear separation of the P2P network from the messaging protocols, in our case <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>, enables us to design and develop the P2P network and <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> independently. Namely, the libP2P network doesn’t need to know anything about the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> and vice versa. Using such a setup, anyone can build edge agents and mediator nodes. Maintenance of such a P2P network is inexpensive. It is built using open source components.</p><p>The proposed solution&nbsp;supports</p>  direct communication (both clients have public&nbsp;IPs)  indirect communication (communication is relayed via <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> relay nodes; messages can be relayed via random relay nodes or pre-defined ones)  synchronous message exchange (if both clients are&nbsp;online)  asynchronous message exchange via mediator nodes (if one of the clients is&nbsp;offline)  Sending Messages through DIDComm Messaging and&nbsp;libp2p Conclusion and&nbsp;outlook <p>We outlined the next generation decentralized messaging solution built on top of <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VCs</a> and a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network. We presented how Alice and Bob establish a connection, exchange messages and demonstrated what connection types are supported.</p><p>We are currently working to demonstrate different setups and scenarios (using <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> and <a href="https://www.aceblock.com/">AceBlock</a> <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> client), we are adding <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> transport to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> specs and are working on the full framework design.</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates and j<a href="https://discord.gg/Er4E5xRdPj">oin our Discord</a> if you want to get involved!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/didcomm-messaging-through-libp2p-cffe0f06a062">DIDComm Messaging through libp2p</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Accelerate your decentralized identity skills with two free Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries workshops  
			  
				
				
				 <p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> are two of the popular open source repositories that can help propel development of decentralised identity products and services. Aries is a toolbox of several blockchain-agnostic repositories that allow for trusted online peer-to-peer interactions based on decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. The project grew out of work that was happening in Indy to create technologies for managing decentralized identity. Aries was moved to graduated status by the TSC in February 2021. Indy graduated in 2019 and provides a specific blockchain purpose-built for identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing the growth in interest for these two projects, Hyperledger Foundation has partnered with member company <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and its team of deeply experienced developers and architects to develop this free, multi-course curriculum to help developers and architects gain a deeper understanding of decentralized identity, with a deep dive into Aries and Indy. Registration and preparation information can be found on this <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops">Workshops page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two four-hour, beginning level, hands-on workshops provide opportunities to install and run the Indy and Aries components just like you would if you were making a real Indy-based network or Aries-based application. They introduce the necessary Git repos as well as how to use the Indy Command Line Interface (Indy CLI), run the Aries toolbox and create and issue a verifiable credential. They also introduce some current projects using Aries and Indy to help you accelerate your understanding of decentralized identity and build the skills necessary to successfully make changes to the underlying code with hands-on guidance to develop your own projects.</p>

  For many businesses, Access Management still remains a big challenge. Not only should we control who has access to our systems, but we should also know where people are accessing this information from, and what exactly they are doing with it. This is particularly challenging when working in the cloud, as well as having customers, employees and other external sources accessing applications remotely and with multiple devices. Multiple devices mean more access points to manage which create a higher risk to your business. In this KCLive Event we take a critical look at employee and third-party identity management. Our analysts and experts will give you invaluable insights on how best to move forward on your digital transformation path.

  Digital Transformation has put businesses under a lot of pressure, not only with regards to compliance but also through a high demand for customer privacy and improved user experience. With too much security, e.g., through Authentication, users are scared off, whereas having too little security is risky. How do we find the right balance? To succeed in Digital Transformation, businesses need a strong digital identity backend that delivers all identity services required by the new digital services that are created. Unfortunately, most digital identities reside in silos. Building a modern Identity Fabric that delivers seamless yet secure and controlled access from everyone and everything to every service requires breaking down the legacy identity silos.

<p>As the world moves towards digitization, financial institutions are looking to adopt identity verification solutions that verify and validate in near real time the identity of the customer.</p>
<p>The UAE Central Bank along with the Securities and Commodities Authority, Dubai Financial Services Authority, and the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority recently issued guidelines for those financial institutions adopting such technologies. Within these guidelines, the UAE governing authorities have approved the usage of facial verification to identify banking customers at the time of onboarding.</p>
<p>This growing trend of regulatory approved biometric solutions that rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to onboard clients is spreading across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. And with the rise of cybercrime – cyber-attacks occurring every 11 seconds, regulators and authorities looking to solutions that are in compliant with the highest security standards.</p>
<p>IDnow, a leading expert for digital identities and identity verification welcomes these new guidelines. With extensive expertise serving Germany’s and Switzerland’s highly regulated markets, IDnow has always focused on striking a balance between security and user experience.</p>
<p>IDnow’s regulatory affairs team is part of several regulatory working groups like ETSI, FIDO Alliance, W3C, and Hyperledger and consults authorities worldwide that are working on digital identity verification and authentication standards.</p>
<p>Being an expert has allowed IDnow to develop financial regulatory compliant products, notably, BankIdent. This completely AML-compliant online identification solution utilizes the users’ current online bank account to create an easy and secure identity verification service that effortlessly combines technology with existing identity and banking data. All that is required of the user is a valid photo ID, an active online bank account, and valid login credentials.</p>
<p>In addition, IDnow is looking closely into the latest developments around digital identity wallets in Europe and, is supporting different expert- and working groups with their expertise. The new law will allow people to have their official documents, such as their drivers’ license or ID card in one central place on their smartphone with easy access to it and, the assurance that their information is securely stored.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, IDnow is expanding its global footprint. It recently opened two offices in the United Kingdom and one in the United Arab Emirates and is also looking to set up a call centre in the Middle East to comply with regional data residency laws.</p>
<p>This benefits every party involved in the process, from making consumers’ lives easier, to reducing waiting times and increasing conversion rates, while keeping a high level of security.</p>

COVID-19 has forced us into a new era of remote working and a massive cloud-first trend has provided us with complex multi-cloud, multi-hybrid infrastructures and a new level of attack landscapes. On the other side of the coin, we are seeing a massive shift to doing business online. Digital transformation has become a reality and the ability to provide a seamless digital experience to our customers and prospects has a direct impact on our revenues. The enterprise has become a virtual place without a physical „inside“ and this is why traditional Identity &amp; Access Management has come to its limits.
