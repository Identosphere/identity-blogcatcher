				  Indicio launches its marketplace solution to using and scaling verifiable digital credentials using open source technology.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth<br>Today, we launch Proven™ — a complete, decentralized ecosystem for using verifiable credentials to create, share, and verify data of any kind while preserving privacy and enhancing security.</p>
<p>It means the future’s here.</p>
<p>Sometimes called “self-sovereign identity,” or “user-centric identity,” or “reusable identity,” the open source technology behind Proven provides an authoritative way to authenticate any data without having to check in with the source of that data — or go through a third party.</p>
<p>“Verifiable credentials are a new foundation for trust in digital interaction,” says Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “They are a simple, powerful solution to the internet’s missing verification layer for people — but they go way beyond that. They can be used to verify the identity of devices and digital objects; they can verify any kind of data associated with an identity. And they deliver breakthrough privacy and security features. This technology does so much that we say it creates “Trusted Digital Ecosystems.”</p>
<p>Proven is designed to be a complete starter kit for creating your own Trusted Digital Ecosystem. It contains all the components needed to create, share, and verify data through verifiable credentials, along with continuous upgrades and customer support from Indicio’s experienced engineering team from integration through implementation.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make it easy to start using verifiable credentials by giving people an off-the-shelf solution,” says Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio. “To do that the product had to be complete. It couldn’t leave the customer searching for components and struggling with compatibility. It couldn’t leave the customer dependent on proprietary tech or struggling to master open source codebases. As leaders in the open source community, we believe open source is critical for adoption, scale, and innovation, but an unfamiliar codebase is still going to be a heavy lift for any development team. Proven removes this obstacle, while remaining fully open source so a customer can develop on it to meet their needs.”</p>
<p>“We all believe in the power of this technology to solve chronic problems in digital interaction,” says Dahl, “but we also see Proven as a gateway to opportunity. We’ve seen our customers win awards for building Trusted Digital Ecosystems. Now, we want to seed that innovation as widely as possible. With our experience as market leaders in decentralized identity, we know what works. We know what’s needed. Proven is it.”</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — July 11th to July&nbsp;17th  Global and local regulators taking action towards a regulated crypto industry. <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s weekly recap. The crypto regulatory landscape continued buzzing last week, with global regulators &amp; financial bodies announcing their intention to reign in the digital assets market. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> South Africa to Implement Crypto asset Rules by&nbsp;2023 <p>Africa’s third-largest economy, South Africa, will regulate cryptocurrencies as financial assets by 2023, with Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA) overseeing the crypto sector in the country. This announcement was made by South African Reserve Bank Deputy Gov. Kuben during the PSG-hosted online series on July&nbsp;12.</p><p>Experts consider this decision a masterstroke because of the growing popularity of crypto assets among South Africans. For instance, with crypto regulation, the South African government will finally put an end to the use of digital assets for financing illicit activities, such as terrorism financing, money laundering, and tax&nbsp;evasion.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/south-africa-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies-as-financial-assets-by-2023-d95ed18aa4da">https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/south-africa-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies-as-financial-assets-by-2023-d95ed18aa4da</a>.</p> Financial Stability Board (FSB) to Present Crypto Regulatory Framework at G20 Meet in October This&nbsp;Year <p>A global regulatory body that tracks &amp; recommends measures for the global financial ecosystem, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), recently published a report titled “FSB Statement on International Regulation and Supervision of Crypto-asset Activities.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1547642186421792771?s=20&amp;t=Sxhz_PJWtiH0RJIwxyQ6TQ">Image Source</a>)<p>In the report, FSB highlighted the current crypto market turmoil to point out the vulnerability and volatility of digital assets, including stablecoins. The financial regulator also stressed that the fallout from the crypto market could also extend to the broader financial industry, i.e., short-term funding&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Thus, a robust and effective regulatory framework is a must to offset the negative impact of crypto assets and simultaneously encourage the underlying technology’s growth. This is why the FSB is currently preparing a crypto regulatory framework, which it will present during the G20 finance ministers &amp; central bank governors meet in October this&nbsp;year.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P110722.pdf">https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P110722.pdf</a>.</p> International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSC) Forms two Working Groups to Prepare Recommendations Over Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>A global group of securities regulators, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSC), recently published a roadmap for crypto policy recommendations.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1547975803970826241?s=20&amp;t=Sxhz_PJWtiH0RJIwxyQ6TQ">Image Source</a>)<p>The document states that the Fintech Task Force, a group within IOSC, will work on preparing crypto asset policy recommendations over the next 12–24 months. Their focus will be on market integrity and investor protection.</p><p>There will be two subgroups within the Fintech Task Force, with the U.S. SEC heading the Crypto and Digital Assets group and the U.K. FCA heading the Decentralized Finance&nbsp;group.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD705.pdf">https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD705.pdf</a>.</p> European Central Bank Raises Alarm Over Stablecoin &amp; Decentralized Finance <p>The European Central Bank published a Macroprudential Bulletin titled “A Deep Dive Into Crypto Financial Risks: Stablecoins, DeFi, and Climate Transition Risk” on 11 July. The bulletin underlines the need for robust regulation and oversight over DeFi &amp; stablecoins.</p><p>The authors argue that robust regulations are a must before the interdependence of the crypto industry and the traditional financial sector grows further. They also point out the TerraUSD debacle saying that stablecoins may not be as stable as they were made out to be. In fact, “Stablecoin” may just be a misnomer.</p><p>That said, there’s no denying that stablecoins play a central role in the global crypto trade. Thus, a possible impact of a broader stablecoin market crash could not be rolled out, as it could destabilize the global financial stability.</p><p>As for the DeFi, the authors call it a novel approach to offering financial services. But they also state that there’s nothing new about it as it’s just an improvised version of traditional financial players with technology at its core. Thus, the authors bat for the “Same Business, Same Risk, Same Rule” approach for DeFi, demanding effective supervision and regulations over&nbsp;it.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_1~750842714e.en.html">https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_1~750842714e.en.html</a>.</p><p>The regulatory fire continues to spread wider, with many international bodies calling for robust crypto regulations amid the increasing intertwining of the digital assets market with the traditional financial sector. Interestingly, international financial watchdogs, such as the FATF, are leading the&nbsp;charge.</p><p>For instance, FATF has urged countries to implement the Travel Rule urgently. Thus, sooner or later, all countries will have to adopt it. And at that point, all Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) will have to strictly comply with the Travel Rule provisions. Thus, VASPs should stay prepared.</p><p>All that VASPs need to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution (TRS). And we have the best solution to suggest: Veriscope. It is the only solution against the much-dreaded sunrise issue, thanks to Veriscope’s historic look-back feature.

Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1547649632074858496?s=20">weekly Community Call</a>, discussing why the integration of multi-chain and multi-application wallets has become the mainstream trend. It was concluded that wallets will become the gateway for Web3. ONTO Wallet is considered able to stand on its own due to the deployment of its DID and reputation system, providing security for users and projects.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion led by Benny, an Asian community Harbinger. While introducing Ontology’s fourth Carnival event, he discussed with community members the role and meaning of decentralized identity: it can help users control their digital identity without the intervention of third parties, and create a seamless, accessible and verifiable ecosystem that solves many problems in fields such as NFTs and&nbsp;DAOs.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   The Ontology 4th MainNet Anniversary Carnival is still in progress. The current activities include the staking event and the joint celebration activities. Celer Network, Unifi Protocol, and Wing Finance are celebrating the 4th anniversary with Ontology, inviting global users to experience cBridge, uTrade, and the Wing FlashPool (Ontology EVM) to earn a share of the&nbsp;rewards.  The third OWNInsights “People, Platforms, Web3” was released, written by Ge Li, Ontology Business Development Manager. From the perspective of Web3 participants, it analyzes how individuals can control their own datasets to expand their influence through DID, and effective ways to build Web3 based on the OWN infrastructure. This article was first published on the well-known Chinese blockchain media Cointelegraph Chinese, and was recommended by the platform.  Ontology and the cross-chain Swap project StealthEX held an AMA event. While introducing the project and development to the community members, it also answered questions for the community members. The selected questions were rewarded with&nbsp;ONT.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Cointelegraph — “<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-will-help-realize-the-true-vision-the-metaverse-hopes-to-achieve">AI will help realize the true vision the Metaverse hopes to&nbsp;achieve</a>”</p><p>“Many of the metaverse projects that have been launched are in the world of gaming. However, more often than not, these projects simply consist of standard gaming features combined with virtual reality and NFTs. A true metaverse, in the sense of a digital parallel universe to our analog world, a digital simulated reality in which participants can take part in diverse social, economic, entertainment and artistic activities in a variety of self-organized groupings and environments, has yet to be realized.”</p><p>Achieving this full vision requires easy portability for users, a large and diverse set of metaverse fragments, and simple user construction of new locations and spaces. Decentralized Identity (DID) technology is considered to be a more suitable technology to provide digital identity for the Metaverse — users with DID will be able to flexibly (one-stop) log in to different Metaverse scenarios without creating different identity accounts; at the same time the personal data recorded in the DID can be seamlessly ported in different scenarios without worrying about data collection or&nbsp;leakage.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-july-12-18-2022-1620cce989c1">Ontology Weekly Report (July 12–18, 2022)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Kizuna is a messaging application for one-on-one or group conversations.

<p>Kizuna empowers people to message each other completely privately, without the involvement of a central server. The app is open-source and is being developed by a non-profit group called the <a href="https://www.hcij.org/en/">Holochain Institute of Japan</a>.</p><p>This is the first article in a series of mini-spotlights on projects using Holochain. Many of these projects, like Kizuna, are quietly but busily working away towards a public product. They’re actively building, testing, and refining their prototypes as they get ready for Holochain’s beta release. You may not hear much from them, which is one reason I’ve chosen to write these updates.</p> Kizuna at a glance <p>Description: Kizuna is a messaging application for one-on-one or group conversations. Messages are kept private by high-strength encryption.</p>  GitHub: https://github.com/hc-institute-japan/kizuna  Demo videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcCJmnU5ryA">1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqdTac7J9s8">2</a>  Website: https://kizuna.foundation/en/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn/  Newsletter: https://kizuna.foundation/en/newsletter/  <p>We asked the Kizuna development team a few questions about their project, and the answers were intriguing.</p> Why is Kizuna being built? <p>You might ask, why another private messenger? There are a lot of them out there already — Telegram, Matrix, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Signal, Viber, and so on, all give you various promises of message privacy. What’s different about Kizuna? What does it hope to contribute?</p><p>Well, all of these services have one common feature: you connect with your contacts through central servers. (<a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is somewhat of an exception; their software is open-source and you can run your own server if you like.) Sure, the server may not be able to read your encrypted messages, but it can still see who’s connecting with whom, who belongs to what group, how often you send messages, and other bits of extra information about you. This sort of data is candy for companies who build their businesses on selling insights about your behaviour to advertisers.</p><p>You may not be worried about this, but advertisers aren’t the only customers. If you live in an oppressive regime that’s secured the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat#State_surveillance_and_intelligence_gathering">cooperation</a> of one of these messenger services, your privacy could be a matter of survival.</p><p>But maybe you’ve found a messenger service that you trust. They’ve promised not to reveal your private metadata to anybody, and you believe them. But they can still go out of business, suffer a server crash, get hacked, or get bought up by a less honest company (along with all your data). What happens to the connections you’ve made then?</p><p>To the developers who came up with Kizuna, these compromises were unacceptable. They believed that we ought to be able to simply talk to each other. Form our own connections and take care of them ourselves. Without someone in the middle.</p><p>As Tatsuya Sato, lead developer and a faithful Holochain supporter who’s translated many of our articles into Japanese, explained to us:</p><blockquote>We believe that the conversations we have with others reflect our private lives. Messaging applications built in the last two decades allowed us to make hundreds of those conversations instantaneously. However, the messages we send in those conversations are being used as a tool for companies to sell our data, serve ads, and influence our choices. We've also seen an increase in messaging and social media applications getting hacked by attackers since they have an incentive to target applications that store millions of people's data in one place. Kizuna is a Japanese word that roughly translates in English to "deep bond" (there really is no direct translation that catches the full nuance of the word Kizuna in English) among people. We believe that humans have the innate desire to build and nourish this deep bond with others. A belief that this bond that we nurture with others should never be capitalized on.</blockquote><p>He and his colleague Nicko Pangarungan go on to say that “without the fear of data compromise, we can share our deep and intimate selves with others — which is the very nature of kizuna”. And that’s their ultimate goal — to enable deep bonds online.</p><p>On the practical level, here’s a feature-by-feature comparison to other popular private messengers.</p> Why did they choose Holochain? <p>Because the Kizuna team were committed so deeply to putting users in control, it made sense to build the service on peer-to-peer networking technology. This kind of internet communication doesn’t need servers, except in limited cases to punch through home firewalls and help people discover each other.</p><p>They could’ve designed from scratch, but that would have been a lot of work. If there were already a set of basic building blocks they could use for the networking layer, that would let them focus on the things that matter most to them — giving people a simple, reliable, private way of talking to each other. Fortunately, Sato had already been introduced to Holochain by his colleagues, and it seemed to be an appropriate starting point.</p> So, why is Holochain important for the Kizuna team? <p>Perhaps most importantly, it embodies the very principles they’re building into their product. I’ll let Sato and Pangarungan explain it themselves:</p><blockquote>Holochain is not just another development framework for making things easier (in some ways it does not 😅). But what makes us root for Holochain are the very principles it represents and the ideals of an online community that strives to realize – agent centricity, data security, peer-to-peer networks. These principles align themselves with what we believe are essential for a messaging app or any online application.</blockquote><blockquote>To put it simply, they chose Holochain because it puts users first by design.</blockquote><p>In particular, they like the fact that applications and their data are hosted by the people who use them, which means that your ability to access them can never be restricted by someone else. You and your group are in charge.</p><p>As they hinted at the beginning of that quote, it has come with its challenges. As a young technology, Holochain is still changing rapidly, which means they've had to rewrite pieces of their code. And a lot of the things that make Holochain work—for instance, the 'deterministic validation' that forms the foundation of an application's 'immune system'—have been quite a learning journey.</p><p>But through all this, they're still committed. Besides all the reasons Holochain was the right fit for their needs, they say there are other benefits. The learning they've invested in has paid off in new ways of thinking about problems. And they love the supportiveness of the community, core dev team, and learning materials (something Mike Gamble of RedGrid also mentioned in a previous article). They also love the Rust programming language and WebAssembly, and feel that they're both a good bet for future-proofing their work.</p> How are they using Holochain? <p>There are a few specific Holochain features that they're putting to good use in the design of Kizuna.</p>  As part of its deterministic validation rules, a Holochain application can add a 'membrane' that controls who can join its network and communicate with other members. The team uses this to restrict access to messages—each group conversation is a separate copy of the core messaging code with its own isolated, encrypted network. This is what lets Kizuna claim it has 'spy-proof group messaging' --- if you can't join the network, you can't access its messages. And unlike server-based private messengers, even your metadata (group membership, for instance) is safe from prying eyes.  Holochain exposes best-practice cryptographic functions to applications for further security. You may wonder, if each group's messages are encrypted as they travel, why does this matter? Well, in spite of the fact that Holochain encrypts network messages with TLS (the same protocol that secures your banking and online shopping), there's a slim chance that a session could be compromised. Kizuna uses Holochain's crypto functions as an extra layer of protection. Additionally, they plan to use Holo hosting to support web and mobile users, and this prevents hosts from reading users' stored messages.  The team appreciate how well Holochain supports inter-application interoperability. As long as the application is designed to support it, a user can access the functionality and data of any application they have installed from any of their other applications. This means that Kizuna's core could be embedded into other Holochain applications, and it also means that it could gain surprising new features thanks to the creativity of other developers.   How can I get involved? <p>If you're interested in supporting the team, the best thing to do right now is <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/newsletter/">sign up for their mailing list</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn/">follow them on Twitter</a>. They did public release of their app in 2021 but Holochain has advanced sine then and their codebase has followed. They are preparing for a public release soon!</p><p>In the meantime, you can also check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/rqdTac7J9s8">public demos</a> they've given during <a href="https://youtu.be/OcCJmnU5ryA">Holochain Ecosystem Sessions videos</a>, or take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/hc-institute-japan/kizuna">codebase on GitHub</a>.</p><p>And of course, you can go to their <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/">website</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn/">Twitter</a> to get a better picture of what they've got planned and what motivates them.</p>

Improvements to&nbsp;OceanDAO <p>This section describes some significant changes in OceanDAO, as of round 20 and&nbsp;21.</p> Goals in Improving OceanDAO <p>In round 20 and 21, we are tuning OceanDAO towards these&nbsp;goals:</p>  A culture of contributing. Biasing to those who engage for the love of doing it. An engaged, diverse community.  Quality outcomes. Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results.  Improve DAO efficiency. More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking&nbsp;overhead   Approaches in Improving OceanDAO <p>Towards these goals, we have received feedback from the community on possible approaches. After many iterations of discussion and design, we have arrived at the following.</p><p>The main pillar will be: for R21, retroactive grants only. Here, you can only ask for a (retroactive) grant for some outcome you’ve already achieved. It’s a philosophy of “show don’t tell”: show us what you did, rather than tell what you’re going to do. Community voting then is about choosing how much they’d like to reward you for the outcome. We’re doing this for R21 not R20 to give opportunity for the community to prepare. <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c">Here’s a great post</a> to learn more about the “why” of retroactive grants.</p><p>Second, we have come to see that OceanDAO is better suited to earlier-stage funding of projects. As projects get stronger, they are in better shape to seek funding from <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Ocean Shipyard</a> grants program, complementary ecosystem grants programs, investors (angels, VCs), and potentially launching their own token. Given this, we have tuned OceanDAO to give more space to earlier-stage projects compared to experienced projects, by capping total funding amount for a project or&nbsp;team.</p><p>There is a category of experienced teams that has been using its funds to dole out micro-grants to their own sub-community. It doesn’t fit Shipyard because it’s not building-oriented; it isn’t appealing to investors because it’s grants; yet it’s of value to the Ocean ecosystem and we want to encourage this. So, we have earmarked 10K USD to the first recipient of this: Algovera.</p><p>Between retroactive grants (which help for DAO efficiency) and shifting experienced projects to Ocean Shipyard and other sources, we feel comfortable reducing the total amount available per month, from 100K USD to 85K USD (including the 10K micro-grants). We tuned the funding ceilings per tier accordingly.</p><p>The final change aims to give more breathing time to proposals, to voting, and to reduce OceanDAO ops overhead. Starting in R21, DAO cycles will be every two months, not one. Some related numbers are tuned accordingly.</p><p>We now summarize the changes for R20 and&nbsp;R21.</p> Round 20&nbsp;Changes   Total funding of 85K USD, including 10K micro-grants  100K USD max. per project in lifetime, and 100K USD max. per team in lifetime (not including Advisors)  The max funding that a project can request for this round is: New project tier 3K USD, existing projects tier 7.5K USD, and experienced projects tier 15K USD. “Tier” details are&nbsp;below.  We encourage everyone to start building proactively (compare Round 21&nbsp;updates)   Round 21&nbsp;Changes <p>R21 starts August 8th,&nbsp;2022.</p>  Retroactive Grants only. That is: projects apply for grants that fund outcomes of work they did, not plan to do. Projects will still submit their work via the Proposal Portal; demo videos are encouraged! Voting is still by OCEAN holders. Projects can still demo their work in Town Halls to receive voter support. We recognize no project is the same and expect Deliverables to vary across Project Categories.  Total funding of 150K USD available  2 Months Cycle per Round. This means more time for teams to build great projects, more time for the community to review proposals, and more time to demo in Town Halls and to the&nbsp;DAO.  The max funding that a project can request for this round is: New project tier 5K USD, existing projects tier 10K USD, and experienced projects tier 10K USD. “Tier” details are&nbsp;below.   Discussion on&nbsp;Changes <p>By implementing these changes we hope to improve OceanDAO’s culture and values towards a more collaborative web3 data ecosystem. This includes helping steward and supporting projects that are actively building rather than promising future&nbsp;results.</p><p>We also want to support projects that want to build fun, constructive products around Ocean, whether that is a DeFi protocol, or a collection of t-shirts. By focusing on the work and presenting it to the DAO before entering the voting period, we hope to steward good practices for creating value in any environment.</p><p>This concludes our discussion of&nbsp;changes.</p> 4. OceanDAO Grants Structure <p>The rest of this article describes other aspects of in round 20, with respect to the DAO’s structure and related parameters. We always include these in each round’s “announcement” blog post, for thoroughness.</p> Grant Funding Categories <p>OceanDAO provides grants for a variety of project&nbsp;types.</p>  Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself   Submitting Proposals <p>We encourage you to submit proposals early. Please, reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016658239610920">here</a> for guidance.</p><p>To submit proposals, use the <a href="https://seed.oceandao.org/">Proposal Portal</a>. A tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Write-Proposal">here</a>.</p><p>Please do not submit proposals through Ocean Port directly anymore, as you will run the risk of not having your proposal accepted.</p><p>Proposals will then be published on Ocean <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-16/76">Port</a>. Port is also where voters can read proposal details.and ask questions.</p><p>All proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO voters receive funding, shortly after voting concludes.</p> Project Standing <p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing, to stay eligible in future Funding Rounds. The <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> has&nbsp;details.</p> Funding Tiers <p>Teams start in the tier of “new project”, and then can achieve higher tiers by delivering on their grant promises. The higher the tier, the more funding that a team can&nbsp;request.</p><p>The Funding Tiers&nbsp;are:</p><p>1. New&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN&nbsp;token.</p> Earmarks <p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 6K USD available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  6K USD for New Teams (non-outreach category)  3K USD for New Teams (outreach category)  17.5K USD for 2nd/3rd Time&nbsp;Teams  13K USD for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  35.5K USD for General (all projects)  <p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>There are specific tech that the core team and Ocean technical community would love to see built. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Round-20-Tech-Earmarks">Here’s the list for R20</a>. It’s earmarked, therefore building towards it gives you “air cover” wrt competition.</p><p>Note that R20 has earmarks for integration with Chainlink, TheGraph, Filecoin, and Arweave. (Ocean Shipyard specs for these are not quite ready&nbsp;yet.)</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech WG discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p> Other OceanDAO&nbsp;Features <p>Quadratic Funding: Instead of projects receiving a binary grant (either 100% or 0% of what they asked for), all proposals will receive grant amounts relative to how much engagement they received, while still abiding by other rules such as Earmarks and Funding Ceilings.</p><p>Minimum USD amount: Projects can set a minimum they are willing to accept, and return the funds if they are insufficient. This drastically increases probability for receiving a grant, on top of Quadratic Funding. (You can reduce your Deliverables commenting in Port, if you only receive a minor part of your overall requested budget.</p><p>Voting Boosts: Quadratic Voting helps distribute voting power better. The more projects you vote on, the higher your overall voting power becomes. In addition, you can now visit the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">Web3 Portal</a>, register yourself with BrightID and receive a 400% voting&nbsp;boost.</p><p>Voter Delegation: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/delegate">Voter Delegation</a> allows participants to delegate their decision making to ecosystem members they trust, easily assigning their voting power to other addresses. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-voting-improvements-qv-delegation-multi-chain-c393afc7f5e6">More info&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>Funds recycling: Any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the treasury.</p> Working Groups <p>Here are the&nbsp;WGs:</p>  Project Guiding&nbsp;WG  Parameters &amp; Roadmap&nbsp;WG  Core Tech&nbsp;WG  OceanDAO Engineering WG  Outreach WG  Ambassadors WG  <p><a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> has a channel for each WG.

   The 2022 ForgeRock Consumer Identity Breach Report shows that identity-based breaches are up. Again. 

 More stolen credentials, more unauthorized access, more breaches, more, more, more 

<p>Would it surprise you to know that breaches due to unauthorized access rose last year? Probably not, but I'll spare you the suspense: they did, and they now account for half of all breaches. But numbers and percentages on their own can only tell us so much. As we dug into the data, a story began to emerge that we can all learn from. And the story is exactly why we spend months each year compiling research from around the world to create these reports.</p>

<p>By the start of 2021, consumers had become accustomed to conducting much of their personal business online, from shopping and banking to paying taxes, taking classes, holding family gatherings, and conducting tele-health visits with their doctors. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, retail e-commerce alone grew 18.3% in 2021<a>1</a>, even after the massive, pandemic-fueled growth of 31.8% in 2020<a>2</a>. Each of these activities involves an online account that may contain a vast amount of sensitive information that is at risk of exposure or theft in the event of a breach.</p>

<p>Today, the average consumer has 100 online accounts, and, in a perfect world, each account would have unique and complex usernames and passwords. But that is not reality. Many people use simple (easy to guess) passwords and many more reuse passwords on multiple sites. To make matters worse, most people rarely change their passwords. All these practices present a huge challenge to IT and security professionals trying to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Stolen username and password combinations are regularly bought and sold on the black market. Attackers can use these stolen credentials to attempt new attacks. How many are we talking about? In 2021, more than 2 billion records containing usernames and passwords were stolen. These stolen credentials may very well be the source of new breaches that we'll have the unfortunate task of reporting on next year.</p>

<p>What else did the report reveal?</p>


			
			  The average cost of a breach in the U.S. was $9.5 million. 
				 Unauthorized access was the top vector in 2021, accounting for 50% of all breaches. 
				 In the U.S. retail sector, the average cost of a single breach rose by nearly two-thirds to $3.27 million. 
				 There was a 297% increase in breaches due to third-party or supply-chain attacks. 
			 
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

 If we had no passwords, there'd be no passwords to steal 

<p>The report contains several "best practices" sections for mitigating the types of risks the report exposed. But one practice stands out in light of the relentless rise in crimes involving login credentials: Making passwordless authentication part of your MFA strategy.</p>

<p>Passwordless authentication improves both the security and the ease of use for online access, while greatly diminishing the usefulness of credentials stolen by cybercriminals. Phishing and other social engineering attacks rely on users to enter their login credentials, but in a passwordless world, such attacks are fruitless. Same with keylogging, which records a user's keystrokes as a way to get account numbers and login information. And, because no credentials are sent over the internet, they can't be intercepted or subject to man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks.</p>

<p>The industry's biggest players — Apple, Microsoft, and Google — have announced plans to enable passwordless authentication across multiple devices, browsers, and platforms. We believe the time for passwordless is now, so we can eliminate the threat of stolen credentials. We look forward to seeing the number and severity of breaches retreat, and going passwordless is a great way to start that trend.</p>

<p>Now, I want to dive a little deeper into the vulnerabilities. In this short post, we’ll dive into Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and look at the built-in help you get when using Angular.</p>

 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection 

<p>In the <a>previous post</a>, you learned how an attack for CSRF occurs when an agitator uses your active session for a trusted site to perform unauthorized actions. We also learned there’s built-in support from browsers to mitigate attacks with <code>SameSite</code> attributes on cookies, validating the authenticity of the request on the backend, and potentially having the frontend send a CSRF token to the backend for every request.</p>

<p>The mitigation strategies primarily require server-side work, except for that game of CSRF token sending, where the client needs to send the token back in a way the backend can validate.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When using CSRF tokens, it’s essential to tie the token to the user’s session so that the backend can validate the request. The most common ways are through the patterns called <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#synchronizer-token-pattern">Synchronizer Token Pattern</a> and <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#double-submit-cookie">Double Submit Cookie</a>.</p>

 Synchronizer Token Pattern 

<p>The Synchronizer Token Pattern requires the backend to store the user’s session information and match it up with the CSRF token for validity. This pattern can be used with SPAs but is a better match for web apps that use forms with post methods for requests, such as:</p>

   <code>&lt;form action="https://myfavekdramas.com/fave-form" method="POST"&gt;
  &lt;label for="name"&gt;What is your favorite K-Drama?&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name"&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Save my favorite K-Drama&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt; 
</code>   

<p>Submitting this form POSTs to <code>https://myfavekdramas.com/fave-form</code> using the <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> content type. CSRF is especially susceptible when using non-JSON data.</p>

 Double Submit Cookie Pattern 

<p>Sadly, this pattern doesn’t involve double the cookies—it’s a dual submission. Sad news indeed for chocolate-chip cookie fans. 🍪🍪 😢 But the good news is the Double Submit Cookie Pattern doesn’t require the backend to track the user’s session to the CSRF token.</p>

<p>In this pattern, the CSRF token is a separate cookie from the user’s session identifier. The client sends the CSRF token in every request, and the backend validates that the CSRF token cookie and the token in the request values match. This pattern is more common for SPAs.</p>

 CSRF support in Angular 

<p>Angular has built-in support for a flavor of the Double Submit Cookie Pattern, where the CSRF token is automatically added as an HTTP header for every backend request once you have a CSRF token in a cookie. Nice!</p>

<p>The <code>HttpClientXsrfModule</code> automatically adds an interceptor for your HTTP requests. The interceptor grabs the CSRF token from a session cookie named <code>XSRF-TOKEN</code> and adds the token value to outgoing requests in the HTTP header named <code>X-XSRF-TOKEN</code>. Then your backend is responsible for verifying the values for the cookie and HTTP header match.</p>

<p>To add this handy helper, add <code>HttpClientModule</code> and the <a href="https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpClientXsrfModule"><code>HttpClientXsrfModule</code></a> to your module’s <code>imports</code> array.</p>

<p>If you don’t like the default names, you have the option of configuring the names of the cookie and HTTP header like this:</p>

   <code>imports: [
  HttpClientModule,
  HttpClientXsrfModule.withOptions({
    cookieName: 'Pecan-Sandies',
    headerName: 'Top-Of-Page'
  })
]
</code>

<p>Congratulations to W3C on the ratification of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID v1.0</a> as a W3C standard!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Though Blockchain Commons has only lightly touched upon DIDs to date, they nonetheless are a crucial part of our history. In addition, their ratification today as an international standard demonstrates the ability of a cooperative commons to incubate ideas that will eventually be adopted as standards to be used widely by governments, corporations, and individuals.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen began experiments with decentralized identifiers in late 2014 when he built on his previous work as the co-author of the TLS spec by suggesting a <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherA/revocable-self-signed-tls-certificates-hack">hack to TLS</a> that associated X.509 certificates with Bitcoin addresses and then allowed revocation of those certs by spending the Bitcoin. It was a decentralized solution to the centralized problem of certificate authorities. Around the same time, Dave Longley and Manu Sporny were exploring similar ideas around identifiers and decentralization in the <a href="https://web-payments.org/minutes/2014-05-07/">W3C Web Payments Community Group</a>. Then, in 2015, Christopher began work with Drummond Reed and others from Respect Network as part of the XDI Registry Working Group, whose goal was to explore possibilities for a decentralized and rootless registry of identifiers; a strawman was presented at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/A_Registry_Directory_~_based_on_BLOCKCHAIN_that_is_ROOTless_%26_NOT_Centralized">IIW 21</a>.</p>

<p>That presentation led to interest from Anil John of the Science and Technical Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, who was looking for alternative identifiers to the US Social Security Number that also provided clear differentiation between identifier and authenticator functions. Christopher helped to coordinate a community effort that led to both Drummond Reed at Respect Network and Manu Sporny at Digital Bazaar submitting proposals to the Identity Management and Data Privacy R&amp;D Program. The goal was to show wide community interest in decentralized identity. Not only did both companies receive a grant, but they also both received additional funds through round two of the program.</p>

<p>Much of the community’s support for DIDs then occurred through the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop</a> that Christopher founded in November 2015 to mark the upcoming 25th anniversary of PGP. One of the five papers that were published following that first workshop was the massive <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure paper</a>, which included as one of its design principles that “each principal must be in complete control of their current identifier/public-key binding”, but had not yet settled on questions such as whether decentralized identifiers should be usernames or UUIDs.</p>

<p>DIDs themselves saw their first major workshopping at RWOT 2, which was run in conjunction with the <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-holds-inaugural-summit-at-the-united-nations-7112014add5e">ID2020 conference</a> at the United Nations in May 2016. Drummond Reed and Les Chasen of Respect Network produced the initial paper on the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/blob/master/final-documents/requirements-for-dids.pdf">Requirements for DIDs</a>, supported by that US Department of Homeland Security grant. That was also the workshop that brought in Manu Sporny’s work on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, which required an identifier to work with, and so was quickly dovetailed into the project.</p>

<p>Christopher has been constantly involved with the iterations of the DID specification that followed, beginning with the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/did-implementer-draft-10.pdf">DID Data Model and Generic Syntax Implementer’s Draft 01</a> that was written at RWOT 3 in San Francisco, where he worked with Drummond and Les as well as Ryan Grant. More designs followed across the subsequent Rebooting the Web of Trust events, including a massive DID breakout room at RWOT 5 in Boston, which spent the length of the conference refining the growing spec. Many, many more people contributed to the evolution of the design, among them: Daniel Buchner, who spearheaded Microsoft’s support of DIDs and with Microsoft’s backing created the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF); and Joe Andrieu, who led the work on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/">DID Method Rubric</a>, a way to evaluate DID methods, as well as foundational use cases and engagement models for decentralized identity such as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/joram-engagement-model.pdf">Joram</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers document</a>.</p>

<p>As part of his work on the preliminary DID spec, Christopher became one of the co-chairs of the W3C Credentials Community Group alongside Joe Andrieu and Kim Hamilton Duffy. There, he co-authored and co-architected the DID spec to be presented to the W3C. He has also been an invited expert at the DID Working Group since its advent in September 2019. Today, July 19, 2022, that Working Group’s work became a “W3C Recommendation” and thus an official international standard. Our congratulations to DID Working Group chairs Daniel Burnett and Brent Zundel, to DID editors Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, Markus Sabadello, and Drummond Reed, and to everyone who has spent the last seven years working on turning the ideas incubated in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and elsewhere into a real specification that can change the world by giving people control over their digital identifiers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Besides his work on the DID spec itself, Christopher is also one of the architects alongside Kim Hamilton Duffy, Ryan Grant, and Dan Pape, behind <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">the BTCR DID method</a>, which has been dubbed the <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/podcasts/23899/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids-didbtcr">“granddaddy of DIDs”</a>. This DID method anchors decentralized identifiers on the Bitcoin blockchain, very similar to the X.509 cert revocation that Christopher was advocating back in 2014.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons was founded in 2018 to support the ideas and community that came out of Rebooting the Web of Trust. Though Blockchain Commons proper has not published much on DIDs, except as an educational topic for our interns, it continues to be a future focus for us, with the idea of decentralized identifiers being a crucial assumption for our Gordian architecture. Christopher also continues to be an invited expert on Verifiable Credentials 2.0 and has advocated for the DID spec throughout its ratification process. Our expertise with DIDs and with BTCR leaves this all as an open opportunity for Blockchain Commons. If you’ve considered becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor</a> of Blockchain Commons and are interested in DID work, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a> to discuss the topic!</p>

Kuben announced the government’s plans to regulate cryptocurrencies as financial assets by 2023 while attending a PSG-hosted online series on July&nbsp;12.</blockquote><blockquote>- Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA) will oversee the crypto industry in South&nbsp;Africa.</blockquote><blockquote>- Experts believe crypto asset regulation will end the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering, terrorism financing, and tax evasion in the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><p>A move that could be defined as a big moment for the crypto assets industry in the African region, the regional economic powerhouse, South Africa, may soon regulate cryptocurrencies as a financial asset in the country. The rainbow nation’s central bank, South African Reserve Bank, recently announced that it will legalize digital currencies as financial assets by&nbsp;2023.</p> The Fact of the&nbsp;Matter <p>Attending a PSG-hosted online series on July 12, South African Reserve Bank Deputy Gov. Kuben announced plans on crypto legislation with the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA) overseeing the nascent sector as a regulator.</p><p>With this move, the South African central bank plans to put an end to the use of digital assets in funding illicit activities, such as terrorism financing and money laundering, among other&nbsp;things.</p><p>Speaking of the popularity of digital assets in the rainbow nation, recent statistics prove that crypto assets are slowly becoming a popular investment option among South Africans. For instance, Punchng’s latest report states that 22% of South African adults hold cryptocurrencies, which puts the number of crypto users in the country at around 7.6&nbsp;million.</p><p>Thus, it was about the time when the country’s central bank took concrete steps to regulate the industry to support innovation &amp; protect investors at the same time. And there couldn’t have been a better time, as global regulators have begun coordination to draft international regulations considering the borderless nature of crypto transactions.</p> What Changes for Virtual Asset Service Providers Such as Exchanges? <p>Once the proposal is implemented, virtual assets service providers will have to collect personal information from their users under the compulsory Know Your Customer (KYC) clause. Besides this, exchanges will also have to highlight the risks of trading digital assets to its&nbsp;users.</p><p>__________________________________</p><p>South Africa’s digital assets regulation is just one of many recent regulatory changes to come for South African Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). For instance, the adoption of FATF’s Travel Rule could be next. After all, FATF has been urging countries to fasten up the adoption of the Travel Rule, and South Africa being a FATF member since 2003, could very well be the next country to enforce it. That is why South African VASPs must begin preparing for it beforehand.</p><p>All VASPs need to begin complying with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Service Provider (TRSP).

<p>Bringing data validation and verification to Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Shipyard, the $2M grants program to fund entrepreneurs looking to build open-source Web3 solutions on Ocean, is introducing Athena Protocol as its first grantee of&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Athena Protocol will add value to the Ocean ecosystem by developing an interface to accredit data before it is posted to the marketplace as well as bringing easy-to-consume climate datasets collected from IoT mesh networks and satellites.</p><p>Sheridan Johns, Ecosystem &amp; Partnerships, said:</p><blockquote>“Data validation and verification tools such as what Athena are building promise to add tremendous value to the Ocean ecosystem. We are excited to support their work on this through Shipyard and look forward to bringing the results to the community.”</blockquote><p>Timothy Carter, Chief Executive Officer, commented:</p><blockquote>“Ocean Protocol Foundation and the Shipyard program go above and beyond to support the work we do to bridge the gap between the blockchain and the real world. Our tools and services will add credibility to data assets on Ocean Market, unlocking altogether new use cases like ESG asset verification and more. Shipyards support allows us to move ahead with confidence in our development.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.athena.tech/">Athena Protocol</a> is building IoT and edge computing infrastructure solutions for bridging the gap between the offline world and the blockchain world to ensure transparency, equity and algorithmic accountability in automated data collection and verification processes.</p><p>To facilitate the ethical collection of data on a global scale, Athena Protocol leverages on SolarPunk Network (SPN). The SPN provides an alternative to current architectures in that it facilitates near real-time monitoring without sacrificing privacy; securely bridging the gap between stakeholders and the decision-making processes that affect their lives, their communities, and their ecosystems.</p><p>Athena Protocol will enable data verification on Ocean Protocol and, thanks to the $50,000 in $OCEAN granted by Ocean Shipyard, they will be able to commit to transparent and clear deliverables.</p><p>By the end of September 2022, Athena will develop an interface for proposing data assets and managing asset portfolios. This will allow the team to focus on processes and procedures for Social Credentials &amp; data NFTs. On top of this, the first ESG asset verification suite v1 will be accredited and published, allowing for multi-token contracts for algorithmic consensus. The Athena team is also ready to launch 2 pilots with full-scale ESG MRV project proponents to quantify ecosystem services.</p><p>By the end of December 2022, it’s envisaged that the design and token model for $ATHENA will be finalized, and the ESG verification suite v2 will be built and deployed.</p><p>If you are a passionate individual or team looking to build something valuable on Ocean Protocol, this is your best chance to kickstart your dream project and be a pioneer of the new data economy.

 Hire of Mike Kiely signals major growth plans in UK and beyond 



<p></p>



<p>Manchester and London, 18 July, 2022 <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow group</a>, a leading European provider of identity proofing and digital identities, has appointed Mike Kiely as its Sales Director for Financial Services. Based in IDnow’s Manchester office, Kiely brings with him decades of experience in data and biometrics, most recently heading up Identity and Biometric sales at GBG, and will drive the firm’s substantial growth ambitions in the financial sector in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kiely’s appointment represents the firm’s ongoing investment into the UK market, with ambitions to become a leader in the UK’s financial services industry, and a global leader in the sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenting on his appointment, Mike Kiely said: “As a German business, IDnow has built a platform that meets some of the world’s strictest compliance and regulation requirements, while offering the broadest portfolio of identity proofing methods. As such, it is in an incredibly unique position, able to support businesses in their identity proofing needs who are looking to scale beyond their UK territory, and into geographies that are inherently difficult to penetrate such as France and Germany.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For me, this represents a hugely exciting opportunity to work with a talented team; I am able to help drive growth here in the UK thanks to the market-leading identity proofing platform IDnow offers while supporting the business to reach its global growth ambitions with a particular focus on financial services.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kiely’s appointment comes after IDnow reported a significant rise in order intake for the first quarter of 2022 of 95%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow group offers the broadest identity proofing portfolio on the continent via a single platform, from automated to human-assisted, from purely online to point-of-sale. This mirrors the trend towards the acceleration of advanced digital business models from single-product identity verification towards comprehensive identity proofing platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benjamin Haas, Senior Sales Director at IDnow, added: “Since we acquired ARIADNEXT and IdentityTM last year, we have been immersed in our growth plans and in bolstering our position as one of the strongest identity verification and document signing players in Europe. Mike’s appointment signifies our continued efforts to establish a substantial foothold, particularly in the UK’s flourishing financial services sector. Mike’s experience will help ensure our expansion ambitions become a reality, so we’re really excited to welcome him to the team.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Thales, a global provider of advanced technology solutions, with more than 80,000 employees worldwide, and an established business unit for Digital Identity and Security, has announced the acquisition of OneWelcome, one of the leading European providers of CIAM (Consumer IAM).</p>
<p>While the acquisition will provide OneWelcome with a go-to-market capability on a global scale, there are interesting options beyond that. OneWelcome delivers CIAM and B2B management capabilities, consent management, authentication support, and policy-based access control. Thales, on the other hand, has a variety of cybersecurity and identity technologies in its portfolio, including biometrics and identity verification, digital wallets, and data security and data protection.</p>
<p>The combination of authentication of customers with strong authentication technologies such as biometrics and identity verification, and consent management with data protection and data security, brings the potential for leveraging the strengths of both vendors for delivering innovations to the market.</p>
<p>As for every acquisition, there is the question about the potential impact on existing customers. Due to the fact that the portfolios of both companies are complementary, but with almost no overlaps, the risk for existing customers of products becoming end-of-life as a consequence of this acquisition, appears to be negligible. &nbsp;On the other hand, there is a strong potential for customers to benefit from improvements provided by joining the forces of these two vendors. This will depend on Thales effectively leveraging the strong potential that this acquisition holds.</p>
<p>For more information on OneWelcome’s CIAM and consent management capabilities, have a look at this Executive View report on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev80945/onewelcome-customer-identity-and-b2b-identity">OneWelcome Customer Identity and B2B identity</a> and this Leadership Compass report on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80532/privacy-and-consent-management-2022">Privacy and Consent Management 2022</a>.</p>

 Supercharge your Job Search with Next-gen&nbsp;Tech <p>Many people are wary of looking for and applying to jobs online, and rightly so, as job scammers are on the rise, targeting their prey more creatively than&nbsp;before.</p><p>So, how can we help people quickly ascertain genuine opportunities while matching their skills and experience to suitable roles? About 70 students from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore attempted to answer this question during the LemmaTree x NTU POCathon.</p><p>They came up with impressive submissions, ranging from job portals showcasing verified jobs and companies to scam alert verification features. The 17 teams that participated in this event wowed the judges with their amazing POCs, created in less than four weeks. The top 6 teams were shortlisted for an in-person demonstration in NTU, where all four judges cracked their heads to select the top 3 winning&nbsp;teams.</p><p>Here are the great ideas of the top&nbsp;6:</p><p>1235</p><p>1235 proposed a verified and optimized human resources platform for companies and applicants to create verified customizable profiles. Their POC, powered by Affinidi’s APIs, strives to help companies verify their job applicants’ backgrounds and vice versa. It was awe-inspiring for the judges to see a product coded within such a short&nbsp;time.</p><p>BYTEMASTERS</p><p>BYTEMASTERS’ proposed solution grants access only to verified companies, ensuring that job-seekers do not have to deal with any job scams while receiving a curated list of suitable roles powered by AI technologies. Although they did not manage to create a fully functional application, they made an interesting comparison of current solutions and their loopholes before crafting an all-rounded solution. Kudos to the&nbsp;team.</p><p>localhost404</p><p>localhost404 created a functional portal that accurately detects unverified companies and job postings besides curating a list of suitable job opportunities for users. The judges were impressed with the ready application.</p><p>Newbility</p><p>Team Newbility proposed a web service solution that could verify company accounts, review job posts, and provide tailored talent and job recommendations to companies and applicants. A unique feature of their proposed solution was to feature job openings from other sources instead of having the companies post their roles from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>noTurningBackSistas</p><p>One of the most out-of-the-box ideas goes to this all-women team. Their solution focused on helping remote employees, including freelancers, by creating smart contracts, a digital wallet, and automated scam detections. They even included an introductory tutorial for users — putting themselves in the shoes of users,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>ThesePeopleAreOnTime</p><p>Another all-women team, these people were not only on time but also on point.

<p>TL;DR</p>  Dock launches <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Web3 ID</a>, a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first  Organizations can request private user data in a privacy-preserving way that users can trust based on the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity while leveraging the security of cryptography  Developers can build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and authenticate people securely with Web3 ID  <p>Table of Contents</p>  Fully Own and Control Your Web3 Identity <p>Our team has been working diligently to keep building robust decentralized identity solutions and we are excited to announce the launch of Dock’s Web3 ID. Web3 ID is a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first. It allows organizations to securely request private user data and the user has the option to give permission to reveal the information or confirm it without revealing the data at all. Web3 ID enables people to fully own and control their digital identity. </p><p>Centralized digital identity management systems are broken. Organizations storing all their users' data on centralized servers are putting it at greater risk by creating a "honey pot" where a hacker can breach and access all that information at once. These systems use centralized identifiers, like email addresses and phone numbers, that can be used to track users online, correlate their data (data can be traced back to someone's identity), and share that information with third parties without people's knowledge. Cybercrimes cost victims <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cybercrime-victims-318-billion/">$318 billion annually</a> and <a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/new-research-most-people-have-70-80-passwords-21103705">the average person manages between 70 to 80 passwords</a>, which creates a bad and unsecure user experience. Web3 ID solves many of these problems.</p><p>“Web3 ID is essential in fulfilling the vision of Self-Sovereign Identity that gives people full control and ownership over their digital identity. We’ve developed game-changing technology that enhances security, efficiency, and privacy for individuals, developers, and organizations.”–Nick Lambert, CEO at Dock</p> Key Benefits of Web3 ID <p>Individuals</p><p>Organizations</p><p>Developers</p><p>Sign in to websites and apps securely with blockchain-based authentication while fully owning and controlling your digital identity</p><p>Can request and instantly verify private and personal data from their users without the need to store it</p><p>Build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords</p><p>Create as many Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as you want for different relationships and interactions to prevent user tracking and correlation (your data can be traced back to your identity by signing in to websites and apps with Google for example)&nbsp;</p><br><p>Creates more trust between organizations as users know that Web3 ID preserves their privacy and they are always in control of their data.

With Web3 ID, developers can verify private user data.</p> What is Web3? These are the ways people sign in to Web1, Web2, and Web3.<p>Before we dive into the details of Web3 ID, it’s important to understand what Web3 is. </p><p>The term “Web3” (often called Web 3.0) was coined by Gavin Wood, a computer scientist who is the co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot, and Kusama. Web3 is the next evolution of a decentralized internet where platforms and apps will be built on blockchain and provide increased data security, scalability, and privacy for people. A key part of Web3 is that users should own and control their online identity and reveal parts of their identity only when they choose to do so. </p> The Evolution of the Internet These are the key characteristics of Web1, Web2, and Web3. Key Differences Between Each Phase of the Internet <p>Web1</p><p>Web2 (dominant form of the internet now)</p><p>Web3</p><p>Creators were usually developers&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive and social web</p><p>Smart applications</p><p>Read-only, static websites that mainly had text or image content without much interactivity</p><p>Era of centralization where a large share of communication happens on platforms owned by a handful of corporations like Amazon and Facebook&nbsp;</p><p>Decentralized internet where Web3 applications and websites run on blockchain&nbsp;</p><br><p>Anyone can be a creator with platforms like YouTube and interact with the content</p><p>People can own and prove the ownership of digital assets</p><br><p>Data is owned, shared, and controlled by third parties</p><p>People can interact with content without needing authorization from a centralized platform like Facebook that can remove content and responses posted on a platform</p><br><p>Read-write websites&nbsp;</p><p>You own your data that is securely stored in a non-custodial identity wallet&nbsp;</p><br><p>Computers retrieve and show searched information but don’t understand the meaning behind the websites</p><p>Semantic web that makes internet data machine-readable, which provides richer and more accurate search results based on someone’s intent and meaning rather than keywords alone</p> Centralized vs. Decentralized Digital Identity Management <p>A digital identity is a way of verifying who we are online and the body of information about an individual or organization that exists online. A digital identity is an extension of current physical ID documents like passports, bank cards, and driver’s licenses. </p><p>The data that forms a digital identity includes: </p>  User names and passwords  Search history  Social security number  Buying history  Social media profiles  <p>Problems With Web2</p><p>Web3 Solutions</p><p>Never-ending data breaches (when information is stolen, viewed, transmitted, copied, or used by an unauthorized person)</p><p>Data is decentralized and stored by users in their wallets which reduces the risk of large scale data breaches</p><p>Platforms and apps are owned by a central gatekeeper</p><p>Platforms and apps are owned by users&nbsp;</p><p>Monetization of apps incentivize companies to sell information based on personal data</p><p>People are rewarded for using, building, and maintaining Web3 projects without sharing data unless the user allows it</p><p>Companies own your data and you have no control over how it is used</p><p>Full ownership and control of your data</p><p>Companies often track, store, and share user data</p><p>Prevents tracking and information is only shared when you give consent</p><p>Organizations can remove access to data and services any time&nbsp;</p><p>No central authority can take away your control over your digital identity</p> How Web3 ID Works <p>In Web2, people authenticating their identity have to manage an endless number of emails, passwords, and other login information, all of which are centralized digital identifiers, while data is being spread more on the internet. And when people log in with Google or Facebook that don’t require someone to create a new account, they are still sacrificing their privacy. But with Web3 ID, people can create their own Decentralized Identifiers to securely prove their identities and credentials to sign in to apps and websites without compromising their privacy.</p><p>Web3 ID is:</p>  A collection of the user's Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)  Blockchain-based authentication and authorization system  <p>How people can sign in with Web3 ID:</p>  An app or website uses a QR code to request cryptographically verifiable digital identity or credential data that is securely stored in someone’s digital identity wallet app  The user scans the QR code and is prompted to confirm the specific data needed to access or use an app or website  Coming soon to Web3 ID: People will be able to use privacy techniques like Selective Disclosure (only share a specific part of a credential) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (prove something about themselves without revealing the data that supports the proof)   The Role of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) in Web3 Identity Management <p>With Web3 authentication, a Decentralized Identifier is used. A DID is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is stored and managed in a digital wallet. </p><p>Here is an example of different DIDs on a Dock Wallet:</p>With Dock's Web3 identity wallet, you can create and manage as many DIDs as you want for different interactions.<p>A DID: </p>  Doesn’t contain personal data or wallet information  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Transferable across apps and websites  Can connect to multiple Verifiable Credentials that contain cryptographically secured user data  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Someone can have as many DIDs as they want which prevents correlation and tracking. Correlation and tracking are when companies like Google and Facebook track data back to a user because the same centralized identifier is used to sign in to multiple websites and apps. To enhance data security, someone can create a DID for professional purposes where they give permission to share their educational credentials while applying for a job and use another DID that’s only used to access online gaming websites.</p> The Role of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in Web3 Identity Management Conveniently manage your Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in your Dock Wallet.<p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. For example identity documents, certifications, licenses, and degrees can be issued as Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Key points:</p>  Personal user data is securely stored as Verifiable Credentials which are kept in a digital wallet app  Multiple Verifiable Credentials can be attached to a DID  Verifiable Credentials are not stored on the blockchain   Web3 Identity Benefits For Individuals, Organizations, and Developers <p></p> Web3 ID Benefits For Individuals   Enhanced user experience: Secure sign-in with blockchain-based authentication with one digital wallet by simply scanning a QR code rather than storing an endless number of logins and passwords   Full control and ownership of your Web3 identity: People can store all of their digital identity credentials in a non-custodial mobile wallet (you have sole control of your keys)  Portability: Your digital identity can be verified anywhere, any time  Privacy and security: Prevent account takeover with cryptography and privacy is protected with the use of Zero-Knowledge Proof and Selective Disclosure technology  Security: Data is only shared when you give permission and is protected with cryptography &nbsp;   Web3 ID Benefits For Organizations   Request private data from users while protecting their privacy: Securely request private data to access your service, or verify eligibility  Create trust between organizations and users: Authenticate users securely with the use of DIDs to prevent tracking and data correlation that traces data back to a user  Reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks: Because user data is not stored on a centralized database, organizations are less exposed to hacks and data breaches   High security: Data is protected with public-key cryptography   Improves efficiency in the verification process: Credentials can be verified instantly which reduces the cost and resources of managing digital identities   Web3 ID Benefits For Developers   Authenticate users securely and efficiently: Eliminates the need for user passwords and prevents account takeovers  Easy to integrate with OAuth: Just use your favorite OAuth library and update the domain/URLs in the configs  Open source and open standards: Web3 ID is <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/auth-server">open-source</a> and it uses the Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials W3C open standard   Industry-Leading Decentralized Identity Technology Solutions <p></p> Pioneers in Web3 Identity <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> has been a pioneer in the revolutionary Web3 space since 2017 and our team has some of the brightest minds in the blockchain industry. Our mission is to solve universal problems with data solutions and we have been building cutting-edge <a href="https://dock.io/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity</a> and <a href="https://dock.io/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> technology that will act as a gateway to Web3 in the future. </p><p>We work with organizations to adapt and innovate the Web3 ecosystem by helping them make documents, certificates, and credentials become digital, tamper-proof, and instantly verifiable. </p> Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Web3 Authentication (coming soon) <p>Private user data should never be on a public blockchain. In Web3 authentication, Zero-Knowledge Proofs are a cryptographic method where no passwords or identity data are exchanged. ZKPs basically allow you to prove information or identity without revealing the actual data itself, which greatly enhances online privacy and security. </p><p>Examples of how ZKPs are used: </p>  If you want to buy alcohol, you can confirm to the cashier that you are at least 18 years old without revealing your birth date by presenting the credential on the digital wallet app  Rather than typing your password to log in to a website, you can send a proof that you “know your password”  You can prove that you have a certain number of tokens without disclosing your full wallet balance   Conclusion  <p>Dock has launched Web3 ID, a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first. Web3 ID is a collection of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). A DID is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is stored and managed in a non-custodial digital identity wallet. Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. </p><p>Web3 is the next evolution of a decentralized internet where platforms and apps will be built on blockchain and provide more data security, scalability, and privacy for people. Web3 enables people to fully control and own their digital identity. </p><p>Key Benefits of Web 3 ID: </p>  For individuals: Enables secure sign in to websites and apps, full control and ownership of their digital identity, prevents user tracking, and prohibits account takeover  Organizations: Safely request private user data from users while maintaining their privacy, operate with improved security with public-key cryptography, and reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks by storing less data  Developers: Enables developers to build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords, easy OAuth integration, and remove inefficient authentication processes<br>  <p><br></p><p><br></p>

   5 Reasons to Implement or Upgrade to 7.2 
<p>The online world is crowded, and organizations are focusing their attention on digital experiences to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Identity and access management (IAM) solutions have become the strategic IT tool for such organizations to deliver a personalized user experience.</p>

<p>How strategic? Gartner estimates that by 2025, organizations adopting customer identity and access management (CIAM) solutions with converged fraud detection and passwordless authentication will be able to reduce customer churn by half!<a>*</a> Half! This forecast highlights the advantages a well-designed CIAM solution can bring to your business.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I'd like to introduce you to some of the features of the newly released <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/7.2/platform-guide/about.html">ForgeRock Identity Platform 7.2</a>. This release — like those before — supports our company's mission of enabling secure access to the connected world. For 7.2, we remained focused on making the customer experience both secure and exceptional, so you can keep customers engaged and coming back. There's a lot in this release, so we've broken it down into five ways its new capabilities can help solve some of your most pressing business challenges.</p>

  
    <p>Elevate the Customer Experience. This is really the name of the game. By providing a seamless omnichannel experience, your customers can get what they need when they need it. To this end, we extended our commitment to open standards. We've enabled extensions on top of the OAuth2 standard so you can configure more ways to authorize per application. This means users can get to what they need within their applications quickly, post login. </p>
   
 <p>Another cool feature in 7.2 is what we refer to as circuit breakers. In a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">hybrid world</a>, network latency between cloud and legacy or on-premises applications could result in a poor experience. With circuit breakers, you can reduce traffic to applications and also let users know if an application is slow or unavailable. The ability to push out a simple message, "We're running a bit slow today, be right with you," can help to reduce user abandonment and churn.</p>

  
    <p>Save Time and Improve Efficiency. Administrator time is valuable. As you scale up to support your ongoing digital transformation initiatives, it's important to ensure your IT administrators have tools that help them efficiently optimize the overall health and success of your IAM solution. To this end, we've added a couple of nodes to our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access</a> drag-and-drop orchestration engine. The Set Custom Cookie Node and Dynamic Scripting Node help to pass along stored attributes to clients and applications, easing the integration of legacy applications. Another, the Identity Management Groups (IDM Groups) Node uses group membership information to make smarter decisions about user journeys.</p>
   
   Improve Security. Everyone wants greater security, but in the identity world, security needs to be balanced and nuanced. Financial-grade API, or FAPI, has become the de-facto high-grade security and privacy standard for financial use cases, and many organizations beyond financial services are adopting FAPI. We already supported the standard, but with 7.2, we are delivering Enhanced FAPI Support, which is increasingly required with open banking standards.

   
   
    <p>Enhance Scalability, Performance, and Resiliency. IAM needs to perform at internet-scale. Users who experience slow returns due to sluggish retrieval of identity-related information will drop out of an enrollment or a transaction. For 7.2, we have optimized Big Indexes with our Directory Services. This means that as your directory grows to millions (or even billions) of consumer, workforce, and IoT identities and attributes, you can rest assured that your users and applications won't be left hanging when a big data search is required.</p>
   
   
    <p>Platform Extensibility/Low-Code/No-Code. Drag-and-drop orchestration is a game-changer. There are just too many use cases and changing business roles for developers to be intensively coding and testing every user journey. With 7.2, new nodes such as Dynamic Scripted Configuration Node, Set Custom Cookie Node, and Passthrough Authentication Node appear like magic in the orchestration library and deliver new capabilities with just a few clicks.</p>
   
 <p>In addition to those outlined here, there are many, many more features in the 7.2 release. We invite you to check out the ForgeRock Identity Platform Release 7.2, now available, by reading What's New here (<a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/7.2/release-notes/whats-new.html">AM</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7.2/release-notes/whats-new.html">DS</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idm/7.2/release-notes/whats-new.html">IDM</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7.2/release-notes/whats-new.html">IG</a>) and downloading the software here: (<a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/am/featured">AM</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/ds/featured">DS</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/idm/featured">IDM</a> / <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/ig/featured">IG</a>)</p>

<p>Amid tumultuous world markets, the crypto community <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/06/crypto-losses-hit-670m-in-q2-up-52-from-year-ago-period/">took losses of $670M in Q2</a>, up 52% from one year ago. Even through these strong headwinds, many companies doubled-down on building break-out products, including Civic. And, on the last day of the quarter, European Union regulators agreed on the long-debated Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/30/eu-agrees-on-landmark-crypto-authorization-law-mica/">landmark crypto authorization law</a> aimed at protecting investors and setting up stricter standards for stablecoin issuers. On their coattails, US regulators released the <a href="https://blockworks.co/us-regulators-release-first-of-many-reports-on-crypto-following-exec-order/">first of many reports on crypto</a> following the Biden administration’s executive order. As regulatory momentum gains speed, Web3 identity that is secure, private, reusable and verifiable on-chain becomes more important daily. Civic is ready to answer that call!</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>In Q2 of 2022, Civic introduced a new tool, called uniqueness verification, that determines user individuality in order to build diverse communities. When a project uses Civic Pass for uniqueness verification, each user is limited to using one wallet, making NFT drops or any other Web3 use cases a more fair and controllable experience across the board. The Ocean Explorers NFT project will be <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-bot-protection-for-oceans-explorers-drop/">the first project to use</a> uniqueness verification, and NFT buyers can <a href="https://civic.me/#oe-get-civic-pass">sign up for their uniqueness verification now</a>, in advance of the mint.</p>



<p>In other product news, Civic also launched a <a href="https://docs.civic.com/integrations/dao-governance">Civic Pass integration for Realms</a>, the preeminent DAO governance platform on Solana, during a hackathon for AthensDAO. Civic Pass for DAO governance adds a host of new features for DAOs, including Sybil resistance, one-person-one-vote systems and quadratic voting systems. It also allows for bot resistance, and age and location restrictions. For DAOs to be successful in the real world, they must have a broader and more nuanced toolset for managing their communities. Civic Pass is designed to give DAOs the tools they need without sacrificing user privacy.</p>



<p>In partnership with the Solana Foundation, Binance.US and others, <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-trm-labs-partner-against-crypto-fraud-with-chainabuse/">Civic partnered with TRM Labs</a> to support Chainabuse, a multi-chain reporting tool that allows crypto users to report illicit activity to a public forum. Our goal with TRM Labs is to advance fraud detection capabilities.</p>



<p>We also partnered with Anchorage Digital, which provides a best-in-class custody framework. We selected Anchorage to <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-taps-anchorage-digital-for-custody-of-cvc-utility-token/">help us scale</a> our growing business. We are also excited that Anchorage now offers CVC token support for any interested CVC institutional holders.</p>



<p>Civic joined the NFT community at NFT NYC with the announcement of our new uniqueness pass for the Ocean Explorers project and with the launch of Civic.me, a new consumer product for displaying digital assets, currently in alpha. Our leaders spoke at event conference panels about stopping mint meltdowns (Chris Hart, CEO) and evolving standards for NFT 2.0 (JP Bedoya, CPO). We also sponsored the <a href="https://twitter.com/MonkeDAO/status/1534581058641055745?s=20&amp;t=2m6NW9rw3c9JAUHiOw4ZqQ">MonkeDAO event</a> and the Superchief Gallery / Snowcrash event while we were in town. Finally, we made our entrance to the event sporting new colors, including Civic Orange, which was part of a greater rebranding effort, <a href="https://hookooekoo.co/magazine/nft-nyc-preview">in collaboration with Hoo Koo E Koo</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, we were proud to collaborate with our non-profit partner, Identity.com, on a white paper about <a href="https://github.com/identity-com/gateway-whitepaper/blob/main/gateway-whitepaper.pdf">The Gateway Protocol</a>, which outlines the technology underlying Civic Pass.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>In the second quarter, Civic accumulated a total online readership of more than 130 million viewers, as a result of press releases and news media coverage about <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-bot-protection-for-oceans-explorers-drop/">uniqueness verification</a> and our partnerships with <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/announcing-the-launch-of-chainabuse-the-multi-chain-scam-reporting-tool-that-empowers-crypto-users-against-fraud">TRM Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/civic_taps_anchorage_digital_for_custody_of_cvc_utility_token/prweb18751345.htm">Anchorage Digital</a>, in publications such as Yahoo! Finance, MarketWatch and Benzinga. Stories about the TRM Labs partnership appeared in <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/147601/trm-labs-unveils-community-driven-scam-reporting-platform">The Block</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-giants-co-launch-chainabuse-platform-to-water-down-rising-scams">Cointelegraph</a>.</p>



<p>In Q2, our leaders penned several op-eds for Cointelegraph and Newsweek. Our CEO, Chris Hart, opined about <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/what-makes-company-web3-1718220">what makes a company Web3</a> and how to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/metaverseweek/2022/05/26/how-to-prevent-the-metaverse-from-becoming-a-nightmare/">prevent the metaverse from becoming a nightmare</a>. And, our CPO, JP Bedoya, shared a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/metaverseweek/2022/05/27/who-are-we-in-the-metaverse-and-how-do-we-prove-it/">vision of digital identity in the metaverse</a>. Our VP of Engineering, Dan Kelleher, commented on <a href="https://blockworks.co/house-of-sempronias-departure-from-dao-sparks-further-concerns-over-dao-governance/">ways that DAOs can be more successful</a>.</p>



<p>Coming Soon</p>



<p>Though we’re barely into Q3, we’re already racing ahead toward our next product announcements. We are looking forward to the Ocean Explorers mint, which will use our uniqueness verification to diversify its community membership and protect against bots. And, you can also expect to see more announcements related to civic.me, which allows you to privately manage your Web3 identity, presence and reputation, including your NFTs.</p>

 Dragonfly Fintech named Finalist of G20 TechSprint CBDC challenge by BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia <p>BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia have officially announced the finalists for this year’s G20 TechSprint CBDC challenge and we are delighted that Dragonfly Fintech, an innovative fintech solution provider utilizing ProximaX’s blockchain protocol, has been shortlisted as one of the finalists.</p><p>The full <a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p220712a.htm">press release</a> is as&nbsp;follows:</p> BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia announce finalists of G20 TechSprint CBDC challenge   Twenty-one teams have been shortlisted, out of almost 100 teams worldwide.  Competition attracted proposals from a diverse range of competing organisations and&nbsp;teams.  Winners to be announced in October ahead of G20&nbsp;Summit.  <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Bank Indonesia, under the Indonesian G20 Presidency, today announced the shortlisted finalists for the G20 TechSprint challenge on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p><p>The 2022 competition <a href="https://www.bis.org/hub/2022_g20_techsprint.htm">was launched in April</a>. The BIS Innovation Hub and Bank Indonesia published three operational challenges and invited a wide range of stakeholders, including innovators, entrepreneurs, developers, data scientists and telecommunications experts worldwide to develop innovative technological solutions to them. The problem statements prompted participants to develop solutions to build effective and robust means to issue, distribute and transfer CBDCs; to enable financial inclusion; and to improve interoperability and better connect payment&nbsp;systems.</p><p>As part of the Indonesia Digital Economy and Finance Festival ahead of the meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, the shortlisted teams demonstrated their solutions to Bank Indonesia, the BIS and experts invited from central banks around the world. They also participated in a CBDC Masterclass to glean practical insights into some of the CBDC experiments under way at the BIS Innovation Hub.</p><p>The shortlisted teams now have until the end of August to complete their prototypes, which will then be judged by an independent expert panel convened by Bank Indonesia. Winners for each of the three categories will be announced in October ahead of the G20&nbsp;Summit.</p><p>The 21 finalists were selected from around 100 participating teams from more than 15 countries and jurisdictions. The shortlisted teams range from large global corporations to more specialised fintechs.</p><p>“CBDCs have been attracting strong interest from central banks around the world. The proposals from the finalists offer unique and innovative technology solutions that could allow CBDCs to be widely adopted. This highlights the G20 TechSprint’s role in bringing together innovators and the central banking and regulatory community. We look forward to seeing the fully developed solutions,” said Ross Leckow, Acting Head of the BIS Innovation Hub.</p><p>“While the need to explore CBDC is inevitably high for central banks, design choices are still unresolved. In practice, we need to understand how policy goals, practical issues and technology intersect. The best way for central banks to prepare for this future of payments is to explore, experiment, conduct proofs of concept, pilot and develop CBDCs. With this in mind, the G20 TechSprint Initiative is a great opportunity for bright and ambitious young individuals as well as mature and well-established firms to show off their best potential and bring the most innovative and applicable solutions in CBDCs,” said Juda Agung, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor.</p><p>For more details about TechSprint, see <a href="http://www.g20techsprint.id/">www.g20techsprint.id</a>.</p> Shortlisted teams <p>Problem statement 1: Building effective and robust means to issue, distribute and transfer&nbsp;CBDCs</p>  BitMint  Dragonfly Fintech Pte.&nbsp;Ltd.

  <p>Data is widely recognized as the lifeblood of the modern enterprise. However, the exponential rate at which it is being generated means that it is crucial that organizations have the capability to manage it effectively to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.&nbsp;These requirements are instantly recognizable as the three principles of information security, which means that in the modern business context, data and security are inextricably linked. But businesses can only use and protect the data they know about, which is why Data Catalogs are becoming increasingly important in the context of optimizing the value&nbsp; of business data.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at the emerging role of Data Catalogs for a variety of use cases, with specific emphasis on Data Governance and Data Privacy. He will list and explain core capabilities he expects to see in such solutions, and will talk about the trends in the market.&nbsp;Sam Gillespie, Data Governance Offering Manager at OneTrust will explain the business benefits of trust in data, how to achieve that, and how to use it to build an enduring relationship with consumers. He will also discuss why strong collaboration between data, privacy, marketing, and ethics teams is essential to building trustworthy data-driven practices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/protect-govern-data-you-know"></a>

 Stakers can claim DF4 rewards. DF5 will start when veOCEAN&nbsp;ships.  1. Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to data asset stakers for higher data consume volume (DCV) and&nbsp;stake.</p><p>DF Round 4 (DF4) is part of DF Alpha phase. DF4 counting started 12:01am Thu Jul 7, 2022, and ended 12:01am Jul 12, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were available. LPs can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>Catalyzed by recent events, veOCEAN will replace pools as the DF staking mechanism. DF will resume when veOCEAN is launched, within 3&nbsp;months.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, details on DF4, and plans going&nbsp;forward.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As an LP (staker), here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  For each network with rewards (where you staked): select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)  <p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF4 Input Parameters <p>DF4 is the fourth week of DF overall, and fourth week of DF Alpha. DF Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>DF4 parameters were the same as DF1. The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included these parameters.</p> 4. Changes to Ocean Market and DF&nbsp;Schedule <p>Over the past weekend, Ocean pools encountered a new attack vector, where a malicious actor found a way to drain OCEAN from pools. The Ocean core team did near-term triage action to mitigate further attacks. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-changes-3384fd7e113c">This blog post</a> has details. Because of this, DF counting was paused after 5 days, not the usual&nbsp;7.</p><p>Beyond triage, the team updated its plans: Going forward, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a> will be the main mechanism for staking OCEAN, for curation of datasets, and for Data Farming. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools to achieve similar functionality for staking and curation.</p><p>Pool functionality will be removed from Ocean Market. Data Farming is on pause, and will resume when veOCEAN launches, within 3 months. DF will pick up where it left off: in DF5, the first week of DF&nbsp;Beta.</p> 4. DF4 Output&nbsp;Stats <p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid 1), Polygon (137), Binance Smart Chain (BSC: 56), Energy Web Chain (EWC: 246), and Moonriver (1285).</p><p>Only Polygon had nonzero DCV in DF1, so we focus on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Due to the attacks over days, volume and stake were winding down. Polygon stake averaged 1,090,424 OCEAN across many pools. However just just two pools had consumes totaling 7776 OCEAN stake (total DCV of 0.216&nbsp;OCEAN).</p><p>With an upper bound APY of 125%, or weekly percent yield of 1.57%, then 122.21 OCEAN was dispensed as rewards. Put another way, the 10000 OCEAN available was not used up because there was not enough stake in the pools with volume. The rewards not dispensed remain in the OceanDAO treasury for future DF rewards or other community programs.</p><p>For more info yet, see the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:e564a527e42210bb67ab4d238de7810465fb98cd91921d9798a0c6623cc32fba">DF4 csvs</a> published as a free asset in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> 8. Conclusion <p>DF4 has completed. To claim DF3 rewards, go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF5 counting will begin when veOCEAN launches, within 3&nbsp;months.</p> Further Reading <p>The post <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Ocean Data Farming Series</a> collects together key articles, and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> for project announcements.

<p>Permissionless and permissioned blockchains are being used every day, but how do you figure out which one you should use?</p>
<p>What does permissionless mean? Permissionless means that it does not require authorization. In most cases, this refers to permissionless blockchains that are open to anyone, where users can remain anonymous and no one entity controls the blockchain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Blockchain and How Does It Work? 
<p>A blockchain is an immutable ledger, a record within a system of transactions that represents the activity on that network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the desire for a distributed transaction system has been around for a few years. The invention of Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency more broadly, brought this technology into the limelight. Discussing Bitcoin can help explain how a blockchain will typically operate.</p>
<p>Generally, a blockchain in a cryptocurrency network will work through the following processes:</p>
 
 Transaction: A user exchanges a token (in this case, a bitcoin) with another user. At the heart of any blockchain, rooted in the exchange of immutable tokens, is the notion that the record of this exchange is available to the governing mechanisms of the exchange network. In the case of Bitcoin, this is a public ledger, but in private systems, this may function differently.&nbsp; 
 Peer-to-Peer Network Transmission: The security and function of a crypto network operate through advanced encryption (hence the name “crypto”). Transaction information is encrypted, organized into “blocks” of collected transactions unique to that transaction and signed with a complex key as a block signature.&nbsp; 
 Validation: To ensure that the entries in the chain are legitimate, the network will employ a validation mechanism. In the case of public blockchains, this includes a “proof-of-work” (POW) process (where other nodes perform reversed cryptographic operations on the signature to verify it) or “proof-of-stake” (POS) systems (where nodes put up tokens as a “stake” as a part of the verification process).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Block Clusters and Ledger Commit: Blocks that have been validated are then placed at the end of the ledger, committed and immutable. At this point, the extension of the ledger record is unchangeable without a dramatic effort, including forking the entire chain.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While Bitcoin serves as the origin point for blockchains, the core technology has rapidly evolved to find application in specialized and enterprise systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Permissionless Blockchain? 
<p>The biggest change from the original conception of a blockchain was to try and fit the technology into modern, security-oriented contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public form of the blockchain was technically secure because it was resistant to brute-force attacks and double-spending. However, it’s not a technology you could trade sensitive information on because that information would become visible to everyone on the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address these issues, there has been a general split between two types of blockchain organizations:</p>
 
 Permissioned Systems: Pseudo-decentralized blockchains that operate in private enterprise contexts for data management. 
 Permissionless Systems: Public, radically decentralized blockchains. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Permissionless Blockchains 
<p>Permissionless blockchain ledgers are notable for their radical decentralization. This includes mechanisms for full transparency of transactions, open-source development models, and a lack of central authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permissionless blockchains have a few key benefits:</p>
 
 Open Architecture: Permissionless blockchains do not rely on a central authority to manage the network. This means that any user can add a node, and this node can participate in the network.&nbsp; 
 Transparency: Every transaction is open and visible to any node on the network—a critical part of maintaining auditable transactions. Conversely, however, this also means that any sensitive data put into a transaction is also completely visible. 
 Pseudo-Anonymity: Users on permissionless systems can remain semi-anonymous. That is, the user can participate through the use of an alphanumeric ID, and so long as no real connection is drawn between that ID and the user, it’s difficult to trace one from the other.&nbsp; 
 Radical Decentralization: The decentralization of user activity and transaction verification means that the network can grow quickly without the central authority to manage it. Everything operates via peer-to-peer mechanisms.&nbsp; 
 Network Resilience: While transaction data isn’t very secure, the network is resilient to attack. Hackers can only overwhelm the network by controlling 51% or more of the nodes, which is prohibitively difficult in a massive network.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Permissioned Blockchain 
<p>Permissioned blockchains are closed versions of their permissionless counterparts. While this changes the landscape of what they can do, it also empowers them to serve in many different roles that can bolster decentralized enterprise applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At its heart, a permissioned blockchain is one where a central authority controls aspects of the network, from user access to data encryption and access, typically through making the blockchain private.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of permissionless blockchains include the following:</p>
 
 Security for Sensitive Data: While permissionless systems provide robust network resilience, the trade off is that all data is transparent. Permissioned blockchains trade radical decentralization for more security around private information. This makes a permission system viable for storing personal data, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-on-blockchain/">login and identity credentials on the blockchain</a>, etc. 
 Customization: Permissionless systems are simple and overarching in their scope, meaning that they usually provide a baseline of functionality that can work over a huge scope of work. Permissioned systems, on the other hand, provide central operators more control over how that ledger works, what it stores, and who can use it.&nbsp; 
 Faster: Permissionless systems, especially those that rely on proof-of-work verification systems, are painfully slow with any appreciable scaling. Permissioned systems, on the other hand, can scale readily and with the need of their organization.&nbsp; 
 Decentralization: While the decentralizing capabilities of a permissioned blockchain aren’t as vast as those for their permissionless counterparts, they are still decentralized. This means that they don’t provide the same honeypot that, say, a database system might.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In general, enterprise permissioned blockchains, while less public and decentralized than their counterparts, are more secure, scalable, and configurable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Enjoy the latest OWN insights, by our Business Development Manager, Ge&nbsp;Li. <p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article from Ge Li, Business Development Manager at Ontology.</p><p>In the previous article, we made an in-depth analysis of blockchains, systems, and production relations. Which one contributes more to our real physical world, the production motivation promoted by the institution or the production efficiency accelerated by technological development, will be an ongoing topic. And such thinking can help us better understand the relationship between individuals, social organizations, and technological networks in the development of today’s world. It further illustrates the importance of identity and data-based blockchain technology innovation to the new generation of the Internet, and the Ontology Web3 Network (OWN) is a collection of effective solutions provided by Ontology for the Web3 exploration path.</p><p>This article discusses the human relationship with Web3 from a human perspective and the possible organization of individuals and networks in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>“The divine law (or truth) can be known, but it may not be the law well-known to you (or well-known truth) Things may be named, but names are not the things.” （Quoted from Tao Te Ching). People gain cognition due to various definitions and are also limited and confused by these definitions. For the same thing, there are substantial differences in individual cognition and feeling. Everyone has a unique personal world that overlaps with reality. Web3 is the general term for the next generation of blockchain-based decentralized network technology, and its essence is to maximize the interaction between the personal world, virtual reality, and the physical world through technology and institutional design. The data and network formed by individuals, and the multi-dimensional universe formed by overlapping and parallel data on the blockchain will become the future form. In a sense, the most interesting part of blockchains is not machine trust and value transparency, it is a magnifying glass. The innovation of cryptocurrencies has inspired people to reshape all kinds of existence in more autonomous ways, from monetary finance, cultural entertainment, and organizational forms, to specific technological products. What really is really magnified is the way human nature and groups choose&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Technology and institutions create the fertile soil and environment for progress, acting on both the physical and virtual worlds. As the basic constituent particles, individuals will play a wider role in the network in the process of technological development. Just like in the blockchain, the platform network succeeds through protocols, and in Web3, individuals will succeed by becoming a platform. Currently, we interact with the real physical world by organizing our identities, items, possessions, credentials, personal connections, and more. In the future, we have the ability to express and confirm this key information in a credible way in the digital world, which constitutes an important foundation of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Just like the coexistence of a large number of L1 and L2 blockchain networks now, we can regard the “metaverse” as a general term for virtual reality networks, in which the production factors of each person’s “miniverse” are flexibly organized under different scenarios and needs. The “metaverse” is a multi-parallel digital universe, and the power it unleashes will far exceed the existing economic and social production model. What kind of society would that be? People can combine their own sovereign data sets more transparently according to the demand scenarios, and the demand side can verify the partners more accurately and quickly. In the first ten years, the token economy has greatly promoted the production and innovation motivation of blockchain projects, and we have seen an iceberg on the water. The next ten years, like Vitalik et al.’s vision of soul tokens and a decentralized society, will be a return to people-oriented state, a recombination of data production elements, and a person-as-platform. These explorations will show us the hidden depth of the icebergs.</p><p>In Web3, people are platforms, which is actually an extension and prospect of the concept of decentralization. Although Web3 is still in its infancy, and there are still countless difficulties in technology and scale implementation, we have seen more top talents choose to join this field to overcome difficulties. When people become the platform to personalize the virtual world, the first thing that is needed is the seamless movement of sovereign data between devices and the network. When multiple personal platforms interact, the corresponding data combinations are called, and the network effects of the personal platforms are also obtained. Therefore, individuals will have a better chance to play the role of middlemen in different scenarios. One of the key changes of Web3 is to transfer ownership to individuals through encryption technology, and to build a direct financial incentive channel for individual contributions through token design, such as The Graph and Dune Analytics. Users are the content creators and the distributors. Creation is not only motivated by incentives, but also brings the efficiency of product and model innovation. The fact that data can be mastered by individuals for use, management, or commercialization may only be the beginning of Web3. After that, there may even be enough tools and foundations for users to develop their own protocols and contracts, and interact on the chain completely independently. From this point of view, the boundaries of individuals and platforms in Web3 will become blurred, and the essence is to give users the opportunity to coordinate and organize data, that is, the way to build their own platform.</p><p>The blockchain network basically has the characteristics of open source, allowing everyone to contribute and build together. Open source co-construction makes the traditional platform lose its appeal, which is the basis for the formation of the personal platform in Web3. At the same time, the in-depth development of smart contracts also strengthens the call between the established work results and saves the cost of forming a personal platform. The rapid development of the Internet celebrity economy in the past few years is the manifestation of the scale of the personal platform effect in Web2, and we believe that the influence and utility of personal formation in Web3 will become larger and larger. The product portfolio in the OWN infrastructure is our way of looking forward to Web3, which can better help individuals form network effects. In the future, the form of social contribution may no longer rely on traditional institutions. People can participate in the digital society through their own data sets such as credit certificates. In addition, the distribution of rights and interests will be more even and transparent.</p><p>On the other hand, identity is an important dimension of information definition in Web3. In fact, no matter in the real or virtual world, a person has a multi-dimensional identity role. If you add a time frame to each identity, it naturally extends the utility of that identity through contribution, outcome, problems, etc. elements of the individual in playing a specific role. On-chain records and definitions of identities and contributions at different stages are indispensable for the organization and collaboration of Web3. These breathing bodies on chains will be ourselves in different metaverses and the keys to our opportunities. The innovation of blockchain applications in the form of DeFi, NFT, GameFI, and X-Earn have promoted the rapid development of the market, and the next round of application outbreaks, we believe, will occur in organizational collaboration scenarios based on decentralized identity&nbsp;data.</p><p>One of the visions of Web3 is to eliminate the opposition between platform users and managers and return the platform to users. If the time horizon is extended, it is likely that in the future, it will be a network form in which people are the platform and virtual reality with multiple parallel metaverses. People will be the most important part of it, no matter what the road ahead, what will happen will be exciting, and the existence itself is a miracle, just as you stop and ask yourself: Is everything in front of you real? We create a virtual representation of reality, we understand the whole through the individual, and in the constant opposition and unity, Ontology and you are committed to exploring the innovative road of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of general blockchain basic protocols and products provided by Ontology for Web3 applications. Basic components including data and reputation, etc., and general-purpose tools such as a Web3 wallet, etc. Web3 applications can choose different basic components according to different scenarios for easy integration. It saves Web3 applications from developing basic functions from scratch, and thus can quickly develop applications. Individual users can also quickly access Web3 applications by using OWN basic products.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/title-people-platform-web3-c8e96245e16c">People, Platform, Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Forrester Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) Study Confirms a 186% ROI. 
	
	 Can you afford not to look at the economics of your CIAM strategy? 
	
	<p>To say that an organization's identity and access management strategy is important to its business is somewhere between a major understatement and a massive one.  Most businesses agree that if they don't pay sufficient attention to how well they manage their customer interactions, they are at an economic and competitive disadvantage.  And although many can articulate the role of customer identity and access management (CIAM) in their strategy, few have a way to analyze CIAM's benefits with data. In today's economic environment, it's imperative that organizations take a close look at their strategy and infrastructure to identify and quantify areas for improvement.</p>
	
	<p>Forrester Consulting recently conducted a commissioned <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-total-economic-impact">Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) study</a> to examine the return on investment (ROI) enterprises can realize by deploying the CIAM platform from ForgeRock. The top-line benefits realized by a typical large enterprise over three years are 186% ROI, less than nine-month payback period, and a net present value (NPV) of $28.5M.  Forrester's approach and methodology give you a way to analyze your own enterprise and gauge the value you could realize.</p>
	
	 The approach and methodology 
	
	<p>The TEI study analyzed the IT infrastructure and technology deployments for customer identity and access management, the business impact of the deployments on the organizations, and their overall strategic significance. Forrester conducted in-depth interviews with several people responsible for the strategy, implementation, and maintenance of their companies' CIAM infrastructure at five large enterprises. They used the resulting information to create a composite organization that represents a typical large global enterprise with $30B in revenue, 20,000 employees, and 30 million customer identities to manage.</p>
	
	<p>The Forrester framework is used to measure the economic impact for the composite organization, and is meant to be adapted and used for any organization to measure current costs and estimate the value of future benefits from implementing the ForgeRock CIAM platform.</p>
	
	 Analysis and results 
	
	<p>The impact analysis focused on five key areas and the potential benefits realized in each of them.</p>
	
	  Legacy environment infrastructure – Not surprisingly, the CIAM infrastructure in most enterprises consists of legacy components that are either home-grown or bought off the shelf and deployed in a heterogeneous manner with some components on-prem and others in the cloud.  Deploying ForgeRock as the single CIAM platform and integrating it with other applications in the enterprise returned a present value savings of $8.1 million over three years. 
		 Avoiding development costs – Software development to integrate an organization's customer workflow into their CIAM environment is expensive to implement and maintain.  ForgeRock's orchestration capabilities enable one to build and modify specific customer journeys using a drag-and-drop capability called Intelligent Access Trees.  This capability saved $1.3 million in custom development. 
		 Reduction in customer support requests – High friction in customer interaction is costly and detrimental to customer satisfaction.  Yet organizations must continue to evolve their identity infrastructure to keep their customers secure, and often do so by sacrificing the customer experience and increasing support costs.  Much of this is  due to tedious password reset procedures, multiple login requirements, and poor implementations of multifactor authentication (MFA). ForgeRock's CIAM platform provides a frictionless self-service approach to password resets, flexible MFA capabilities, and consistent single sign-on capabilities that reduced call volume by 40%, resulting in a present value saving of $24 million. 
		 Improved time-to-value for new releases – Fast-moving enterprises are under constant pressure to add new IT capabilities to support their business. They could include deploying new applications in the infrastructure, improving existing processes such as self-service workflows for customers, and security improvements. Many of these systems and processes have been dependent on and restricted by the CIAM infrastructure. ForgeRock CIAM transforms this dynamic. Improvements included an increase in the number of software releases made to the existing infrastructure, a reduction in the time taken for each release due to the simplified integration capabilities in the ForgeRock platform, and an increase in the number of new software capabilities added to the infrastructure. All this resulted in a present value benefit of $5.9 million realized through cost savings as well as an increase in revenue attributed to the faster addition of customer-facing functionality. 
		 Reduction of fraud – The impact of fraud on customer-facing organizations is significant and expensive.  Costs include reimbursements to customers for fraudulent orders made with their accounts and the effort required to detect such activity.  ForgeRock's platform was directly responsible for detecting and reducing fraudulent transactions by 25%, resulting in a present value savings of $4.7 million. 
	  Applying these results 
	
	<p>In its study, Forrester says: "By adopting a unified identity platform, enterprises have an opportunity to treat digital identity and identity access management as a key strategic initiative and work to develop and deliver differentiated experiences that delight customers and drive loyalty and profitability." Through its analysis, Forrester provides a framework that identifies the cost, benefit, flexibility, and risks that factor into a CIAM investment decision.</p>

	<p>In today's economic climate, can you afford not to?</p>

			 The Pitiful State of Identity Today 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Sometimes I marvel at how, despite sending people to space, editing genes, and getting dangerously close to AGI, humanity hasn’t built a way for me to prove my legal name is Riley Hughes online. Even to do so in real life, I need to pull a hopefully-not-forged plastic card out of a leather pouch in my pocket.<br><br></p><p>WHAT?! <br><br></p><p>Today’s digital identity companies ask users to photograph those plastic cards (and take a selfie) to authenticate their identity. Yet, we don’t photograph handwritten notes to communicate—we email. We don’t photograph checks to pay—we use Venmo or crypto. For all of our modern transactions, we use modern technologies and streamlined processes.</p><p><br>Our identity is the last thread tethering our lives to paper. It’s laughable, really, the way we’ve continued to use an archaic system for such an important and sensitive part of our lives.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What Does Identity Even Mean? 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>When I refer to identity in this context, I’m referring to everything that makes you, you. It’s not the same as “auth”—usernames, social logins, even public keys, are not your identity. And we’re not just referring to government IDs either. Our lives are so much richer and extend beyond our birthplace or address.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Real digital identity will allow us to represent our whole selves. It will enable us to illustrate and safely share our certifications, community memberships, licenses, preferences, and so much more.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Catch-22 Problem of Digitally-Native Identity 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>So why hasn’t real, digitally-native identity been done? First we need to acknowledge the catch-22 problem that exists. Right now, a university won’t be motivated to issue digital diplomas unless there are companies accepting them. Companies however, won’t be motivated to create an ecosystem for accepting university diplomas until universities are issuing them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer: we need a standard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Historically, companies have tried to *be* the standard. The problem with companies *being* the standard is that it’s led to a graveyard of “one ID to rule them all” companies. The result is clear: No single company can own the world’s identity. Even if a company does succeed in a niche, they scarcely grow beyond that niche. Only a standard can solve this problem at scale.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Role of Verifiable Credentials 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>This is where verifiable credentials (VCs) come into play. VCs are a W3C standard data container. Data inside a VC can be verified instantly and independently. That means someone could check that my diploma:<br><br></p>  was issued by my university,  was issued to me,  hasn’t been tampered with, and  isn’t revoked  <p><br>all without checking with the university. Of course, you’ll only trust the data in the credential as long as you trust the issuer. But this new standardized data container makes data portable for the first time.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Challenges of Decentralized Identity 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Instead of the interoperability companies were expecting, what we got were 15+ different “flavors” of verifiable credentials and decentralized identity. These ranged from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">SBTs</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SaHGyY9TjPg4a0VNLCsfchoVG1yU3ffTDsPRcU99H1E/edit#slide=id.g11b904107df_0_1">web5</a>, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ssmith-acdc-02.html">ACDCs</a>, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO’s mDL</a> (the standard Apple’s mobile driver’s license is based on), and more.</p>

				<p>What started as an effort toward interoperability ended up a mess of standards. Now, instead of solving business problems and building product, developers are being sucked into maintaining interoperability with an ever-changing, increasingly complex decentralized identity landscape. They’re forced to spend time and resources researching and detangling these complexities, instead of building their actual products.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>But the worst part of proliferating standards is the impact it’s had on adoption. The value of a standard is an exponential function of its adoption. In other words, verifiable credentials only become valuable as adoption increases. And the catch-22 problem is hard enough to overcome—a splintered ecosystem doesn’t help anything!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So is decentralized identity doomed? Enter Trinsic.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Trinsic: Decentralized Identity Made Simpler 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>We created Trinsic as an infrastructure for building awesome identity products. Dozens of engineers use our SDK to build identity wallets or embed verifiable credentials into their products. Our SDK enables an Apple Pay-like UX for sharing and verifying data either online or in-person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal has been to completely abstract away the complexity of the ever-changing landscape so organizations can focus on the important stuff—what product to build, and how to take it to market. Teams shouldn’t have to “pick winners” and wager what to build on. Their products should be interoperable with multiple ecosystems. That’s what Trinsic is providing, out-of-the-box.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 Our Story 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>So how did we get started? We came together in 2019 and built the first SaaS product for decentralized identity where developers didn’t have to run anything locally. We removed barriers to entry through a freemium product with usage-based pricing. We wanted to create a way for anyone to issue a verifiable credential in under five minutes, and we did.</p>

															</a>
														 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>As we ventured forward, we decided to build for the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a> ecosystem first; it was the most mature ecosystem at the time, and we knew the ecosystem well. It was a great starting point, and we quickly became a major player in that community. Last we checked, we power about 2/3 of Sovrin’s traffic, which equates to tens of thousands of transactions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we also support the W3C ecosystem, including JSON-LD and BBS+ credentials, as well as the Anoncred format from the Sovrin ecosystem. Furthermore, we support anchoring those credentials to Bitcoin (using ION), Veres1, and traditional web-based PKI. <a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/">You can see all the details for each of these in our docs.</a> In short, today we’re building the rails that power products that interact with this emerging ecosystem of verifiable, user-controlled data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And where are we going next? Let’s talk about Visa, first. Below you can see the Visa business model:</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Visa created a trust model that successfully brought over 1 billion people access to better payment transactions. And they proved the model could scale. Our plan is to take that trust model and apply it to identity. Of course, there are some key differences:<br><br></p>  First, instead of plastic credit cards, we use digital verifiable credentials.  Secondly, instead of a centralized settlement network written in Cobol, we use decentralized PKI—usually on a blockchain, but we work with traditional DNS-based PKI too.  Lastly, instead of controlling the entire ecosystem, we’re an open, API-first infrastructure anyone can build on.  					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Our approach to growth has been very product-led. It’s helped us remain highly scalable as community members help answer questions other developers pose, contribute to discussions on new products being built, and foster an environment where more developers want to join and explore building. We’re what Visa would have built if they wrote their software in 2020 instead of 1960—except for identity instead of payments.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			 The Future of Decentralized Identity 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>By removing the barriers to entry and providing an interoperability layer for developers, Trinsic is attempting to crack the adoption problem of decentralized identity. The best news: we’re seeing it work. We’re currently powering over 100,000 end-users’ identity wallets, up by about ~10x in just the last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, imagine for a moment you’re getting off the SpaceX craft on a Mars Colony. You need to prove your identity. Do you pull a plastic card out of your spacesuit? No. The future of identity will be much better than that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That future is a digitally-native identity as legitimate and nuanced as your human identity. Call it decentralized identity, web5, self-sovereign identity, reusable identity, or whatever you’d like. But it’s happening. Now that we know it’s possible, it’s inevitable.</p>

 Updating an application to use OAuth 2.0 doesn’t need to be complicated. Most of the time, your language or framework will already have an OAuth library. Sometimes, this isn’t the case, and you need to find an alternative. In this post, I’ll walk through setting up and using OAuth2 Proxy to secure your application without any code changes!

 An application without security 
 
 
<p>First things first, we need an application. You can use any web application, but for this post, I’ll stick with a Java Spring Boot app that will echo the details of the inbound HTTP request. Echoing the request information will help visualize the additional HTTP headers added by OAuth2 Proxy, such as the user’s email address.</p>
 
 
<p>You can grab the project from <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-oauth2-proxy-example">GitHub</a>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-oauth2-proxy-example.git -b start
cd okta-oauth2-proxy-example</code> 
 
 
 






If you want to see the completed project, check out the <code>main</code> branch instead.



 
 
<p>If you are interested in the details for this Java application, take a look at the <code>EchoApplication</code> class. It contains a single endpoint that will handle all requests and "dump" the contents of the request as a JSON object:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>@RestController
static class EchoRestController {
    @RequestMapping("/**")
    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; echo(HttpServletRequest request,
                             @RequestHeader HttpHeaders headers,
                             @RequestBody(required = false) Map&lt;String, Object&gt; body) {

        Instant now = Instant.now();
        Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();

        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; result = new LinkedHashMap&lt;&gt;();
        result.put("clientIpAddress", request.getRemoteAddr());
        result.put("cookies", cookies == null ? emptyList()
                                              : Arrays.stream(cookies).toList());
        result.put("headers", headers.toSingleValueMap()); // simplify json response
        result.put("httpVersion", request.getProtocol());
        result.put("method", request.getMethod());
        result.put("body", body);
        result.put("queryString", request.getQueryString());
        result.put("startedDateTime", now);
        result.put("url", request.getRequestURL());

        return result;
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you are a Java fan, you can start the application by running <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>. Everyone else can run the following Docker commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker build --tag echo-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 echo-app</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Once the application is running, open up your browser or access the web application in your terminal with HTTPie:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http localhost:8080/echo</code> 
 
 
 






When using HTTPie, you can omit "localhost" and just type <code>http :8080/echo</code>! 😎



 
 
<p>You will see a response that looks something like this:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
    "body": null,
    "clientIpAddress": "172.17.0.1",
    "cookies": [],
    "headers": {
        "accept": "*/*",
        "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate",
        "connection": "keep-alive",
        "host": "localhost:8080",
        "user-agent": "HTTPie/3.2.1"
    },
    "httpVersion": "HTTP/1.1",
    "method": "GET",
    "queryString": null,
    "startedDateTime": "2022-06-24T18:52:07.853663255Z",
    "url": "http://localhost:8080/echo"
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now that we have a working application, let’s secure it!</p>
 
 
<p>Before moving on to the next section, stop the app with Ctrl+C, don’t worry; we will start it back up in a minute.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Set up Okta 
 
 
<p>To secure our application with OAuth 2.0, we are going to need an OAuth Identity Provider (IdP). Just about any OpenID Connect (OIDC) capable server should work, such as <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> or <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloak</a>, but this is an Okta blog, so let’s use Okta.</p>
 
 
<p>If you don’t already have one, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a>
and from the project directory, run <code>okta start</code> to sign up for a new account and configure this application!</p>
 
 






If you already have an Okta account, run <code>okta login</code> first.



 

What does the Okta CLI do?
 
 
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the required redirect URIs and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: .env</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Run <code>cat .env</code> (or <code>type .env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ISSUER=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
CLIENT_ID=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
CLIENT_SECRET=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS</code> 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 Set up OAuth2 Proxy 
 
 
<p>There are two ways to use OAuth2 Proxy: route your traffic through it directly or use it with the Nginx <code>auth_request</code> directive. I’d recommend routing traffic through Nginx if possible, but I’ll walk through both options and explain my recommendation below.</p>
 
 
<p>To reduce the number of moving parts, I’ll leave Nginx out in this first example; all of our web traffic will flow through OAuth2 Proxy. Users who access the echo web application will be redirected to Okta to sign in. Once they have signed in, OAuth2 Proxy will set a session cookie. OAuth2 Proxy will validate the session before passing the request to the echo web app in future requests.</p>
 
 






In OAuth terms, OAuth2 Proxy is acting as the "client", handling the OAuth protocol details, (in this case, an <a href="https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/">Authorization Code Grant</a>).<br>
TL;DR - Redirects the user to the OAuth IdP’s sign-in page and handles a "callback" route to return them to the application.



 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>This example is going to outgrow manually using <code>docker run</code> commands; switch to using <code>docker compose</code> to start the echo web-app and oauth2-proxy.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s start simple and increase the complexity as we go along. Create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> with oauth2-proxy and the web app from above:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>version: "3.7"
services:

  web-app: (1)
    build: .

  oauth2-proxy:
    image: bitnami/oauth2-proxy:7.3.0
    command:
      - --http-address
      - 0.0.0.0:4180 (2)
    environment:
      OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS: http://web-app:8080/ (3)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAME: Okta
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER: oidc (4)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER_URL: ${ISSUER}
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID: ${CLIENT_ID}
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET: ${CLIENT_SECRET}
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PASS_ACCESS_TOKEN: true (5)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS: '*' (6)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIRECT_URL: http://localhost:4180/oauth2/callback (7)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: ${OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET} (8)

    ports:
      - 4180:4180 (9)</code> 
 
 
 


1
Build and run Dockerfile in the current directory.


2
Listen on port <code>4180</code>.


3
Proxy authenticated requests to the Java web-app container.


4
OIDC client information (issuer, client ID, and client secret), these values are defined in the <code>.env</code> file.


5
Optionally, pass the access to the web-app.


6
Allow all email domains unless you use a social auth provider, you’ll want to manage this in your IdP and NOT in your application.


7
Set the redirect URL to an <code>http</code> URL, this defaults to <code>https</code>.


8
Open up the <code>.env</code> file and set this variable to a random 32-byte base64 string <code>openssl rand -base64 32 | tr — '+/' '-_'</code>.


9
Expose port <code>4180</code>.


 
 
 
 
<p>Start everything up by running:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker compose up</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4180/echo</code>, and you will be redirected to a page with a sign-in button. Click the button, and you will be redirected back to the "echo" application, and you should see information about the newly authenticated request!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 






If you are already logged into your Okta account, open an incognito/private browser to see the full sign-in flow.



 
 
<p>Great, the application is now secured, but we still have a few things to clean up:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>All the session state is stored in a cookie.</p>
 
 
<p>The initial double redirect sign-in page has to go.</p>
 
 
<p>We haven’t talked about API access yet.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>These first two problems can be fixed with a few updates to the OAuth2 Proxy configuration. Edit the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>       OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: ${OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET}
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_SKIP_PROVIDER_BUTTON: true (1)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_NAME: SESSION (2)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SAMESITE: lax (3)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_SESSION_STORE_TYPE: redis (4)
+      OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIS_CONNECTION_URL: redis://redis
    ports:
      - 4180:4180
+    depends_on:
+      - redis

1
Skip the default login page and redirect directly to the IdP.


2
By default, the cookie name is <code>_oauth2_proxy</code>; change it to <code>SESSION</code>.


3
Set the cookie’s same site policy to <code>lax</code>; the redirect from the OAuth IdP will need the session cookie.


4
Use Redis to store session information.


5
Start up a Redis container.


6
Persist the Redis data between restarts.


 
 
 
 
<p>Stop the docker-compose process (Ctrl+C) and start it up again:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker compose up</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Once again, open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4180/echo</code> and open up your network tab, you will see the renamed and now smaller <code>SESSION</code> cookie.</p>
 
 
<p>You could stop here, but you shouldn’t. We still have a few issues: API clients are not supported, and we haven’t talked about logging out.</p>
 
 






For the next section, you will need an access token. You can use the access token from your last request’s <code>x-access-token</code> header. Open your terminal and set an environment variable: <code>export TOKEN={your-token-value}</code>.



 
 
 
 
 REST API clients 
 
 
<p>For the sake of this post, I will consider any client that sets an <code>Authorization</code> HTTP header to be an API client. For example: <code>Authorization: Bearer {access_token_here}</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The API client probably cannot handle a redirect response but expects a <code>40x</code> status code to be returned.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>Let’s take a step back and configure OAuth2 Proxy as an <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/the-resource-server/">OAuth resource server</a>, which accepts JWT access tokens. This might be all you need for some applications, but if you need to support both browser and API clients, keep reading, we will get there in the following section.</p>
 
 






It is common, but it’s not required for <a href="https://oauth.net/2/access-tokens/">OAuth 2.0 access tokens</a> to be a JWT. If you are using a different OAuth IdP, double-check if they support JWTs before continuing.



 
 
<p>In the <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, trim down the environment variables to the bare minimum needed for a REST API:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
    environment:
      OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS: http://web-app:8080/
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER: oidc (1)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS: '*'
      OAUTH2_PROXY_SKIP_JWT_BEARER_TOKENS: true (2)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_EMAIL_CLAIM: sub (3)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER_URL: ${ISSUER} (4)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID: api://default (5)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_SET_XAUTHREQUEST: true
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET: this_value_is_required_but_not_used (6)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: NOT_USED_BUT_REQUIRED_VALUE_32b_ (7)
...</code> 
 
 
 


1
We are not actually using any of the OIDC flows, but this is still required.


2
Perhaps a poorly named variable, this tells <code>oauth2-proxy</code> to validate the JWT access token and to "skip" looking for an OAuth 2.0 session.


3
Read the user’s email from the <code>sub</code> claim in the access token.


4
The same issuer URL is used, the JWKS endpoint will be looked up automatically via the OIDC discovery metadata.


5
The "client-id" is actually the audience <code>aud</code> claim and not the ID of a specific client (multiple API "clients" could be accessing the same REST API).


6
There is no "client-secret," but it’s a required field…​


7
Same with the cookie secret, these flows do not use cookies, but the field is required.


 
 
 
 
<p>Restart the services. (Stop and then run <code>docker compose up</code> again.)</p>
 
 
<p>Using the access token environment variable you set in the previous section, run this:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :4180/echo "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Awesome! Now your application is secured for REST clients!</p>
 
 
<p>Not so fast; now our browser clients don’t work correctly! The client ID and secret are not correct, which means users will not be able to log in. We can fix both of these problems with Nginx.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Add Nginx to route traffic 
 
 
<p>Adding another reverse proxy into the mix might seem excessive; for a request to get to the application, it would need to pass through both Nginx and OAuth2 Proxy first. However, you may already use Nginx for load balancing, TLS termination, or other ingress concerns.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>While we could route our traffic through both proxies as pictured above, I will use the Nginx <code>auth_request</code> directive instead. Nginx will make a REST request to OAuth2 Proxy’s <code>/oauth2/auth</code> endpoint using the original request headers (including any cookies and <code>Authorization</code> headers). OAuth2 Proxy will respond with a <code>202</code> status code if the request is valid or a <code>401</code> otherwise.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>This setup uses the same number of requests as the previous diagram but provides additional flexibility on how requests are routed to the upstream web app.</p>
 
 
 Configure Nginx 
 
<p>Jump back into the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> and add a new <code>service</code> for Nginx:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.21.6-alpine
    depends_on:
      - oauth2-proxy
      - web-app
    volumes:
      - ./nginx-default.conf.template:/etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template
    ports:
      - 80:80</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, create a <code>nginx-default.conf.template</code> file.  This code block is a little involved, be sure to read the annotations:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    location = /oauth2/auth {
        internal; (1)
        proxy_pass       http://oauth2-proxy:4180;
        proxy_set_header Host             $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme         $scheme;
        # nginx auth_request includes headers but not body
        proxy_set_header Content-Length   "";
        proxy_pass_request_body           off;
    }

    location / {
        auth_request /oauth2/auth; (2)

        auth_request_set $email  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_email; (3)
        proxy_set_header X-Email $email;
        auth_request_set $user  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_user;
        proxy_set_header X-User  $user;
        auth_request_set $token  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_access_token;
        proxy_set_header X-Access-Token $token;
        auth_request_set $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie;
        add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host:80;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port 80;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto http;

        proxy_http_version 1.1; (4)
        proxy_pass http://web-app:8080/; (5)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Don’t expose this route to external clients.


2
Nginx makes a request to <code>oauth2-proxy</code> REST API, to verify the auth for this request.


3
Add headers returned from the auth request.


4
HTTP 1.0 is the default if not set.


5
Send authenticated requests to the web app.


 
 
 
 
<p>Restart the docker containers and verify everything is working with HTTPie (make sure you are using port <code>80</code> now).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http localhost/echo "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you remove or change the <code>Authorization</code> header, a <code>401</code> will be returned. Browser requests will now also return a <code>401</code>!</p>
 
 
<p>Almost done! We still need to make everything work for both API clients and browsers, and handle sign-out requests.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Route  all traffic through Nginx 
 
 
<p>Sending all the traffic through Nginx has the added benefit of giving you control of how the OAuth2 Proxy endpoints are exposed. For example, the previous section marked the <code>/oauth2/auth</code> route as "internal," so only the <code>auth_requst</code> directive can use it.</p>
 
 
<p>In the <code>nginx-default.conf.template</code>, add a couple of new <code>location</code> sections to expose the other <code>/oauth2</code> endpoints. The first <code>location</code> will handle the OAuth 2.0-related requests like the redirect callback. The second will configure the sign-out endpoint to accept only POST requests. (This prevents a rogue GET request from ending the user’s session.)</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>    location /oauth2/ {
        proxy_pass       http://oauth2-proxy:4180; (1)
        proxy_set_header Host                    $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP               $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme                $scheme;
    }

    location = /oauth2/sign_out { (2)
        # Sign-out mutates the session, only allow POST requests
        if ($request_method != POST) {
            return 405;
        }

        proxy_pass       http://oauth2-proxy:4180;
        proxy_set_header Host                    $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP               $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme                $scheme;
    }
...</code> 
 
 
 


1
Send the OAuth callback and logout requests to oauth2-proxy.


2
Only allow POST requests to the sign-out endpoint.


 
 
 
 






The sign-out endpoint does not use a CSRF token. TODO: link to Alisa’s post on this topic.



 
 
<p>One last change, update the <code>location /</code> section to redirect to the sign-in page for all non-API clients:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>location / {
        auth_request /oauth2/auth;

        # if the authorization header was set (i.e. `Authorization: Bearer {token}`)
        # assume API client and do NOT redirect to login page
        if ($http_authorization = "") {
            error_page 401 = /oauth2/start;
        }
...</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Configure OAuth2 Proxy to support API and browser clients 
 
 
<p>Sometimes, an application needs to handle requests from browsers and other API clients.  In this case, the application acts both as an OAuth client and resource server. OAuth2 Proxy can be configured to support both types of applications. However, you may have noticed that a few OAuth2 Proxy configuration values are overloaded; for example, the "client ID" is used both as the ID of the OAuth client, and the JWT value for the audience. Luckily, there is a workaround! Here is the final annotated <code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>version: "3.7"

services:

  web-app:
    build: .

  oauth2-proxy:
    image: bitnami/oauth2-proxy:7.3.0

      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAME: Okta
      OAUTH2_PROXY_SKIP_PROVIDER_BUTTON: true (3)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIRECT_URL: http://localhost/oauth2/callback (4)

      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER_URL: ${ISSUER} (5)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID: ${CLIENT_ID}
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET: ${CLIENT_SECRET}

      OAUTH2_PROXY_SKIP_JWT_BEARER_TOKENS: true (6)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_EXTRA_AUDIENCES: api://default (7)

      OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIS_CONNECTION_URL: redis://redis

      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_REFRESH: 30m (12)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_NAME: SESSION (13)
      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: ${OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET} (14)

    driver: local</code> 
 
 
 


1
Allow all email addresses; the IdP will manage which users have access.


2
For single IdP use cases, skip the intermediate login page.


3
oauth2-proxy defaults to <code>https</code>, this example uses <code>http</code> on localhost.


4
The issuer, client ID, and secret will be loaded from the <code>.env</code> file.


5
Allow processing of JWT bearer tokens for API clients.


6
Configure an extra "allowed" audience, in addition to the "client ID".


7
Use the <code>sub</code> claim from JWT access tokens as the email address.


8
Add user information headers to the proxied web-app request.


9
Optional, pass the access token to the proxied web-app request.


10
Use Redis for session management.


11
Refresh cookies every 30 minutes.


12
Set the session cookie name to <code>SESSION</code>.


13
Configure the encryption key (loaded from the <code>.env</code> file).


 
 
 
 
<p>Restart the services and access the application through your browser: <code>http://localhost/echo</code>. Try again using HTTPie:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http localhost/echo "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Both requests should show similar information.</p>
 
 
<p>Without any code changes, the "echo" web application is now secured with OIDC / OAuth 2.0!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Is OAuth2 Proxy right for your application? 
 
 
<p>This post taught you how to secure an existing application with OAuth 2.0 without any code changes! OAuth2 Proxy isn’t just for legacy applications; it’s also commonly used in a sidecar pattern with Kubernetes, allowing you to keep authorization concerns separate from your application.</p>
 
 
<p>It’s not perfect, though; there are a few shortcomings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>SSO logout (<a>OIDC RP-Initated Logout</a>) isn’t supported yet.</p>
 
 
<p>Requires working around a logout route that accepts <code>GET</code> requests and doesn’t require a CSRF token.</p>
 
 
<p>API use cases support JWT-only access tokens; if your application needs to <a>remotely validate tokens</a> you would need another solution. It may be easier to configure <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_jwt_module.html">Nginx’s JWT module</a> instead.</p>
 
 
<p>Configuration is a little clunky; some values are required but not used.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Where does it shine?</p>
 
 
<p>If you need to add authentication to an application that doesn’t have OAuth support, or you need to support various types of applications in a standard way, OAuth2 Proxy can be a great choice! As a bonus, it has excellent <a href="https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/docs/">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Organizations use physical credentials like employee badges, certifications, and passports to identify people and verify claims about them like being old enough to go to a nightclub or graduating with a degree.

How would organizations know if a digital document is real? If organizations can’t tell if digital assets are real or fake, they are exposed to liabilities such as hiring someone who is not really qualified to do a job. Many people simply use Photoshop or change a PDF themselves to make fake certificates or licenses.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials can help individuals and organizations create and share their identities and claims reliably.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>  What Is a Verifiable Credential? CEO Nick Lambert explains the basics and importance of Verifiable Credentials.&nbsp;<p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. Imagine digital and instantly verifiable versions of identity documents, academic achievements, licenses, and more.</p><p>When digital credentials conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which is a standard established by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials. The Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 is a “specification [that] provides a standard way to express credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.”</p><p>W3C is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work to set international standards for the World Wide Web. They created standards for URL, decentralized identifiers, and others. Verifiable Credentials are one of the three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is an approach to digital identity that gives individuals control of their digital identities. The other two pillars are blockchain and decentralized identifiers.</p><p>The main parties involved in the use of Verifiable Credentials are the:</p>  Issuer: Organization that has the authority to issue Verifiable Credentials such as a government department issuing a national ID or a college issuing a diploma  Holder: Someone who owns the credential and stores it in their digital wallet  Verifier: The person or organization validating or authenticating the credential like a hiring company needing to check a candidate’s educational credentials   Benefits of Verifiable Credentials   Instantly verifiable anywhere at any time within seconds compared to days, weeks, or months with traditional verification processes  Tamper-proof with cryptography, which enables people to store, protect, and share data securely  No need to contact the issuer (e.g. a university or certifying body) to confirm the authenticity  Creates immediate trust between parties  ID holder have full control and ownership of their data, enabled by decentralized identifiers (globally unique identifiers) and Public key cryptography.  Provides user privacy because they can choose which parts of their identity they want to reveal such as showing their age without showing their full name. Or proving they are above a certain age without disclosing their date of birth.  No personal data is stored on the blockchain  Portable as holders can store Verifiable Credentials in their digital wallet and take them anywhere while still being verifiable.  <p>Organizations can issue their degrees, IDs, licenses, and more as verifiable digital credentials that can be stored in a digital wallet, which is a digital version of a physical wallet that people can carry around as a mobile application on their phone, computer, or even a cloud-based server.</p><p>Gartner, a technological research and consulting firm, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-key-predictions-for-identity-and-access-management-and-fraud-detection">shared five trends</a> for identity and access management and fraud detection. One of the trends is that the decentralized identity standard will shift to being increasingly mobile and global. The term “decentralized identity” is used interchangeably with self-sovereign identity because it refers to the idea of individuals owning and managing their own identities.</p> Verifiable Credentials Example <p>In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, the issuer and holder are required to use Decentralized Identifiers, or DIDs. Decentralized identifiers are similar to email addresses and phone numbers in that they are unique. The DID and public key of the organization that issued the credential are stored on the blockchain. So when someone wants to verify the authenticity of the credential, they can check the blockchain to see who issued it without having to contact the issuing party. </p><p>A DID:</p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Comes with a private key and a public key  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>We will go in more detail later on how DIDs work, but here is an example that ties all of these details together. </p><p>Let’s say a department of motor vehicles (DMV) uses verifiable credentials to issue licenses. Whenever they issue a new license, they will sign it with a private key while their public key and DID is on the blockchain. In this case, the data outline (schema) on the verified credential would include the name, driver’s license number, date of birth, address, and so on. </p><p>You will be able to store your driver’s license within your digital wallet and control precisely what you want a verifier to see. Then when a verifier, for example a company hiring a driver, wants to check the verified credential, they can check to see if the DMV’s DID really signed it because the DMV’s public key and DID is stored on the blockchain. </p><p>Another benefit of a Verifiable Credential is privacy. If you’re pulled over by a police officer who asks for your driver’s license, you can use your phone to simply show them a verifiable presentation of the credential that proves that you have the authority to drive. Unlike a physical license, you don’t have to share additional information like your name or address. With a verifiable credential, you can selectively disclose only the information required by the verifier. Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs, you could even prove you have a valid license without showing any information from the license itself.</p><p>With Verifiable Credentials, the DMV also has the authority and ability to define an automated expiration date. They can also revoke the license if a driver breaks the law and is penalized by having their credential removed for a certain period of time. </p> Why Do We Need Verifiable Credentials? What’s Wrong With Our Current Verification Systems? Nick covers the difference between centralized, federated, and decentralized ID management.<p>The main reason why Verifiable Credentials are becoming increasingly popular among people and businesses around the world is that it checks a lot of boxes when it comes to user privacy requirements and addresses several major issues associated with the current identity management system.</p> Problems With Our Current Traditional Verification Systems   Proving the authenticity of documents involves a slow and difficult verification process, which often takes organizations weeks or even months  Increased risk of breaches of data resulting from centralized data management systems storing a large amount of user information  Paper and digital credentials are easy to forge  Organizations store vast amounts of personal data from users which leaves users without control over who has access to their personal information, where their documents are stored, and how they are being used  With a physical credential or PDF, people may be disclosing a lot more information than is necessary when they present it for verification  <p>Verifiable Credentials enable people to verify their identity, only provide information that is relevant to the context, and prove their documents weren’t modified.</p><p>With a digital credential that could be in a PDF or XML document, for example, verifying the origin and authenticity of documents is complex. You’d have to confirm that:</p>  The Issuer Organization effectively issued that credential and has the authority to do so like an organization that provides driver’s licenses  The person submitting the credential (holder) is its rightful owner  The credential is valid and not expired, modified, or revoked  <p>​​In many cases, this involves manually contacting the issuing organization, which is a long, tedious, and often expensive process.</p><p>Here are just a few of many examples of how fraudulent IDs and credentials pose a risk to organizations:</p><p>Construction</p><p>New construction employees need to present credentials to an employer, especially if they will operate heavy machinery. If an employee presents fake credentials to a company, this is dangerous because this could result in a serious accident and the company could be liable for hiring someone without the right qualifications to operate the machinery and do the work safely.</p><p>Healthcare</p><p>The verification processes for providers in the healthcare industry have many inefficiencies with manual verification and gatekeepers. Traditional verification can take weeks to months which causes major delays in filling in much-needed healthcare roles and delays for people to begin working.</p><p>Supply chain</p><p>There can be severe safety issues and monetary damages that could happen from an improperly managed supply chain such as a manufacturer failing to ensure the safety of working conditions at their facilities, potentially resulting in severe injuries suffered by workers. Forged documents are also used to show the origin of goods, which can be dangerous for consumers if the products don’t meet safety standards.</p> How Does a Verifiable Credential Work? Dock's Solutions Architect Mike Parkhill explains how a Verifiable Credential works.<p>The issuer (e.g. nursing program) creates the verifiable credential and digitally signs it with a cryptographic key that only the issuer can use. When the verifier (e.g. hospital) receives a credential, they will verify its authenticity instantly through a blockchain, an immutable and decentralized database.</p><p>One important thing to note is that the blockchain doesn’t actually store people’s Verifiable Credentials. It only stores information that the verifier would need to validate the authenticity of the credential like the issuer's public cryptographic key that matches the one that signed the credential.</p><p>Using this information, the verifier will determine:</p>  If the issuer has the authority to issue that credential  If the verifiable credential is still valid (not revoked or expired)  If the credential has been tampered with  <p>This system is trustless. The verifier no longer has to contact the issuer to confirm the validity of the credential. And the best part is that everything happens in a matter of seconds!</p> The 3 Components of Verifiable Credentials   Credential metadata: This might be cryptographically signed by the issuer and contains the credential identifier as well as properties about the credential itself such as the expiry date and who the issuer is.   Claim(s): A tamper-proof set of claims made about the credential subject such as someone’s employee number and job title.   Proof(s): Cryptographic method that allows people to verify:     The source of the data (e.g. who the issuer is)  That the data has not been tampered with   What Is the Role of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) In Making Verifiable Credentials Work? Learn the basics and benefits of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Decentralized Identifiers Explained <p>We often use physical cards to provide proof of our identity and claims about us to show to other people or organizations. But in the digital world, there were no universally accepted standards for expressing, exchanging, and verifying digital credentials.</p><p>We currently use emails and phone numbers as identifiers to access websites, services, and apps. But our access to these identifiers can be removed anytime by service providers, the data is controlled by providers, and user data is vulnerable to hacks. Decentralized identifiers change all of this. &nbsp;</p><p>A DID:</p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers  Is created and owned by the user  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Comes with a private key and a public key that are also made up of a long string of letters and numbers  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Here is an example of a Dock DID: </p><p>A party can be an individual or organization and they can make as many DIDs as they want for different relationships. For example, you can have a DID for:</p>  Professional reasons like showing your credentials to an employer or university  Authenticate data for your personal interests like showing you are legal age to go to a bar or a member of an organization  Online gaming profiles   What Are Public and Private Keys? <p>Each DID comes with a private and public key. Keys come in private/public pairs and a DID can have multiple pairs. &nbsp;</p><p>Private key</p>  A private key (a string of letters and numbers) is like a password that allows a holder to access and manage their data.  The owner should be the only one who knows the private key and it should never be shared with anyone else.  Regarding DIDs, the private key allows people to prove ownership, grant permissions to share specific data, and sign documents.   <p>Public key</p>  A public key (a string of letters and numbers) that can be safely shared with anyone to send and receive data  Used for user authentication and verification purposes  <p>To explain how public and private keys work, let’s use the example of comparing a private key to a master key of a car. The car’s owner (holder) has the master key that gives her full access to all parts of the car, including the trunk and glove compartment. She can provide restricted access to other people she chooses. The owner should never give her master key to anyone else.</p><p>Now the owner wants to make another key that gives restricted access to a valet or auto body shop to start the car. This key is like the public key. The valet and car shop worker wouldn’t be able to access the glove compartment and the trunk. </p><p>To use another example, an employer would use their private key to sign and issue a verifiable credential to confirm an employee's job title. The employer’s public key would be shared on the blockchain so that the verifier, such as a government department that needs to authenticate someone’s work status, can confirm the authenticity of the data with that public key. Basically, the government body can check the DID on the blockchain to see who issued the credential without having to contact the issuing party.</p> Key Differences Between Centralized Identifiers and Decentralized Identifiers <p>Centralized Identifiers</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers</p><p>Identifiers provided by centralized&nbsp; providers like Google or phone companies allow access to apps and services (email addresses and passwords)</p><p>Identifiers you generate for yourself powered by blockchain to use apps and services</p><p>Your personal data is collected on centralized servers and it's not clear who has access to it</p><p>Data is not shared with anyone except whoever you choose to reveal it to and there is no personal data stored on the blockchain</p><p>Data can be manipulated by providers</p><p>Records on the blockchain are immutable and tamper-proof once it’s recorded on the blockchain</p><p>Data is owned by third parties and you can’t control your data</p><p>You have full ownership of your DIDs and complete control of your cryptographic keys</p><p>People’s identifiers are used to track online behavior</p><br><p>Create as many DIDs as you want for different relationships to keep your data private as having multiple DIDs makes it harder to track users and correlate data&nbsp;</p><p>Providers can remove access to your data anytime</p><p>Your data can’t be taken away from you and your credentials can be verified anywhere, anytime</p><p>Less secure and private connections between parties</p><p>Enables unique, private, and secure peer-to-peer connections between two parties</p><p>Here is a scenario that goes through all of the steps of how DIDs and Verifiable Credentials can work:</p>  Anita creates a DID on the Dock blockchain for professional purposes only to interact with educational institutions and employers.  Anita shares her DID with the university which allows the school to issue Anita a proof of enrolment status as a verifiable credential.  The university signs and issues the verifiable credential with their private key and this credential gets added to her Dock wallet on her phone.  Partnering businesses on and off-campus give 20% discounts on products and services to university students and they trust the university as an issuer.  Anita goes to a store and shows a verifiable QR code that confirms her student status at the university from her Dock wallet without revealing her name, age, and other unnecessary details at the store.  The store employee scans her QR code that is tied to her credentials and applies the 20% discount to her purchase.   <p>In another example, if someone wants to buy alcohol, a cashier can scan the QR code on a customer’s verified credential to confirm that they are of legal age. In this process, the customer can use a Zero-Knowledge Proof to prove they are above a certain age, without sharing any other information like their entire birth date or name.</p> The Role of Blockchain in Verifiable Credentials <p>The DID and corresponding public key of the organization that issued a credential to a holder is stored on the blockchain, which is an immutable database. The person who wants to verify the validity or authenticity of the credential can check the blockchain to see who issued it without having to contact the issuing party. &nbsp;<br></p>Learn the basics of blockchain.<p>Blockchain is a system of recording information chronologically in a way that makes it extremely difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system. It is a distributed database that is shared among nodes, which are computers in the blockchain network, that can execute certain functions like sending and receiving information. Each block on the chain has unique data that references the previous block and the blocks combine to complete a chain. Blockchain technology is also referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p><p>Key Features of a Blockchain</p><p>1. Decentralized: Blockchains operate using a peer-to-peer network of computers to verify and record transactions. Whenever there is a new transaction on a blockchain, the block can’t be added to the chain until it is verified by the network. For someone to tamper with the blockchain, they would have to tamper with all of the blocks of the chain and hack every node, which is extremely difficult to do. </p><p>2. A blockchain acts as a decentralized distributed ledger: A distributed ledger is a digital database that runs on a distributed network in diverse locations rather than having one record of data in a centralized location that a person or body can control or manipulate. Each node gets a full copy of the blockchain and the information can be used to verify that everything is in order and make sure it hasn’t been tampered with.</p><p>If everything looks good, each node adds this to its own blockchain. Everyone in the network creates consensus where they agree which blocks are valid and which aren’t. Tampered blocks will be rejected by nodes in the network.</p><p>3. Immutable: Each block on a chain contains transaction data and the blocks can’t be tampered with or backdated. Unlike traditional forms of record-keeping that are easy to change and manipulate information without anyone knowing.</p> Verifiable Credentials Using Blockchain Not all data goes on the blockchain to protect user privacy and maintain security. Mike covers which data goes on the blockchain.<p>In identity management, a blockchain allows everyone in the network to have the same source of truth about which credentials are valid and who authenticated the validity of the data inside the credentials. Blockchain can enable zero-knowledge proofs, meaning that someone can verify credentials without a holder revealing the actual data like their full name and address. </p><p>For example, let’s say Shelly wants to sign up to play a mobile game from her phone. The gaming company requires players to be at least 18 years old and uses Verifiable Credentials to confirm their age.</p>  Shelly creates a DID with the Dock blockchain and stores it in her Dock wallet on her phone  The department of motor vehicles (DMV) in the US issues Shelly a driver’s license as a verifiable credential that contains her date of birth  The gaming company trusts the DMV as an issuer  Shelly signs into the gaming site with her DID and the company uses the verifiable credential associated with her DID to verify that she is at least 18 years old without her revealing her date of birth  Shelly can securely sign in to play with her DID without ever using a user name and password  <p>In the above example, Shelly has full ownership and control of how her data is shared and used. And her information can’t be tracked or stored.</p> How to Show the Proof of Existence of Verifiable Credential Data and Files With Dock’s Blockchain <p>With Dock, issuers have the option of proving the existence of Verifiable Credentials or files to a verifier by connecting the data to a blockchain with the use of <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-anchoring-feature-is-now-live/">anchoring</a>. </p><p>What is anchoring in blockchain? </p><p>An anchor is a digital fingerprint of external data that is included in a blockchain transaction to prove that the external data is authentic. The anchor makes up the credential’s proof of existence in their original form. </p><p>Anchoring works by converting data to cryptographic hashes (a long string of numbers and letters that is not readable by any human) that are written to the blockchain. </p><p>Hashes: </p>  Prove the existence of data on files and credentials while the content is kept private  Maintain the privacy and security of data because only the hash is stored on the blockchain rather than the credentials themselves  Creates immutable timestamps associated with the information and recorded on the blockchain  <p>Let’s say there is an online course that wants to issue credentials to students who have completed the program. The issuer can use Dock’s anchoring feature to hash the credentials that they have issued. Anchors are created when the hashes are posted to Dock’s blockchain and the record can’t be changed. </p><p>Anchoring can be applied to any documents and verifiable credential data for a variety of situations.</p> What Is and Isn’t Stored on the Blockchain  <p>By default, nothing gets stored on the blockchain except for an issuer’s DID and public keys. The Verifiable Credentials that contain personal details are securely stored on a decentralized digital wallet app rather than the blockchain. They don’t need to be stored on the blockchain in order to be verified as long as the keys are available.</p><p>What is stored on the blockchain</p><p>What is not stored on the blockchain</p><p>An issuer and holder’s DID and public keys</p><p>A holder’s personal data like name, date of birth, address, and credit card details</p><br><p>Verifiable Credentials like a passport, citizenship status, employee title, and university degree.</p><br><p>Cryptographic hashes (a long string of numbers and letters) can be tied to the verifiable credential and stored on the blockchain to confirm proof of existence without revealing personal data. The hashes make the data unidentifiable to a human.&nbsp;</p> Verifiable Credentials Use Cases <p>Industry</p><p>Traditional Process</p><p>Problems/Risks</p><p>Verifiable Credentials Solution</p><p>Supply chain</p><p>Relies on physical IDs and documents to demonstrate compliance, which creates inefficiencies.</p><br><br><p>Documents can be easily forged and difficult to authenticate.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Manual verification process is slow and prone to errors.&nbsp;</p><br><p>An importer can bring unapproved, non-compliant medical supplies into a market putting public health at risk.</p><br><p>Verifiable Credentials can’t be forged and they can be verified within seconds without contacting the issuing party, saving a tremendous amount of time and money.</p><p>Finance&nbsp;</p><p>To access financial services, someone has to go through compliance screening by submitting personal details in physical form that is stored in a large database and shared with one or more third parties that conduct know your customer (KYC) and credit checks.&nbsp;</p><p>Individuals have no control over how their data is secured, shared, and accessed by third parties.&nbsp;</p><br><p>The data provided in the credentials is cryptographically secured, tamper-proof, and can be verified.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Healthcare</p><p>Employers use manual processes to verify paper-based licenses and certificates for healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Traditional verification takes weeks if not months, which creates delays in filling much-needed health care roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Organizations that provide and regulate medical licenses for the healthcare workforce can issue licenses in the form of digital credentials. The recipients of these licenses can then easily share them for instant verification by any hospital, clinic, or medical department where they would like to work.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials can be applied to an infinite amount of use cases across many industries. Here are just a few of many examples of ways that Verifiable Credentials solve a variety of problems.</p> Dock’s Clients Using Verifiable Credentials <p>Dock is working with organizations to provide technological solutions to issue Verifiable Credentials and create decentralized identifiers. </p><p><a href="https://gravitytraining.co.za/">Gravity Training</a> connected with us so they could issue Verifiable Credentials in a convenient and cost-effective way to people who complete their training program in field positions. Authentic credentials are essential to keep workers and employers safe. Their courses include rigging, fall arrest, and radio frequency awareness training. </p><p>Fake credentials are a <a href="https://www.sapeople.com/2019/02/14/fake-qualifications-are-on-the-rise-how-universities-can-manage-the-risk/">growing problem in South Africa</a>. Many people are photoshopping credentials and showing them to employers. Gravity issues thousands of certificates a year for trainees and is manually uploading certifications on their database, which takes a lot of time and resources. They want to use Verifiable Credentials to be compliant, to manage verifications across various locations, and to enhance their record-keeping for auditability. </p><p>With Dock’s technology, Gravity is able to:</p>  Save a tremendous amount of time and money issuing and managing &nbsp;credentials with expiry dates in bulk with Dock’s user-friendly platform that doesn’t require any code  Allow inspectors and managers to instantly verify documents and monitor expiration dates digitally  Provide workers with credentials they can store on a wallet with their phones  Nick speaks with Grant Thomas, the CEO of Credenxia to discuss how this global verification company is using Dock Certs to move to a decentralized solution of creating and managing employee credentials.<p>Dock has also been <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-using-docks-technology/">collaborating with Credenxia</a> since 2021 to help them move towards a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials. <a href="https://www.credenxia.com/">Credenxia</a> is a leading global verification company that partners with businesses in a wide range of industries including construction, health care, and transport. Their technology helps with compliance for employers and workers as well as enables businesses to effectively manage the credentials of their workforce.</p><p>The company chose to work with Dock because of our expertise in blockchain, we are compliant with W3C standards, and the APIs were well-documented. Credenxia was previously running on a trust model to do manual verification. They were getting feedback from their stakeholders asking how people would know if Credenxia was compliant themselves during their verification process. There is no overarching body that checks the work and processes of document verification companies.</p><p>The collaboration with Dock allows Credenxia to: </p>  Provide Verifiable Credentials with blockchain technology.  Enhance transparency with clients by adding verifiable notes that are hashed on the blockchain, making them immutable. If the notes have been tampered with, clients would be able to see it.  Enhance the audit position of the user base and give back control to someone’s credentials and identity.  Move towards a zero-trust model that clients are demanding.  Retrospectively decentralize already verified credentials.   Decentralized Digital ID Wallet App <p>A decentralized digital identity wallet is an identity management application that allows people to securely store, manage, and share digital credentials. A digital credential can be an ID, license, background check, certification, and more. It’s the equivalent of a physical wallet that holds various IDs and cards to demonstrate claims about yourself like licenses, bank cards, and service cards. </p><p>To illustrate how a decentralized digital ID wallet can work, let’s say Carlos wants to create a new profile on an online sports shop that uses Verifiable Credentials. He can sign in and make purchases from his digital wallet without creating a user name, password, and entering credit card information. The website needs to confirm that shoppers live in Spain as they only deliver within the country and their payment method. The website verifies his credentials that were issued by a credit card company and driver’s licensing organization, which are issuers that the website trusts to authenticate the credentials. &nbsp; </p> Dock’s Decentralized ID Wallet  <p>The Dock Wallet enables you to have full control over your digital credentials and every piece of data stored in the wallet has the ability to be shared with third parties only when you choose to do so and how much information you want to provide. You can grant and remove access to whomever at any time. </p><p>With the Dock Wallet you can import existing certificates, batches, and credentials to store all of your records and achievements in one place as long as they were issued as W3C-compliant Verifiable Credentials.</p> Summary of Key Terms<br> <p></p><p>Anchoring</p>  An anchor is a digital fingerprint of external data that is recorded on the blockchain transaction to prove that the external data is authentic  Proves the existence of verifiable credential data or files while the content is kept private  Anchoring works by converting data to cryptographic hashes (a long string of numbers and letters that is not readable by any human) that are written to the blockchain  <p>Blockchain</p>  A blockchain is a decentralized database that is shared among nodes which are computers in the blockchain network  A system of recording information chronologically in a way that makes it extremely difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system  <p>Decentralized Digital ID Wallet</p>  An identity management application that allows people to securely store, manage, and share digital credentials  <p>Decentralized Identifier (DID)</p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers  Is created and owned by the user  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over it  Comes with a private key and a public key that are also made up of a long string of letters and numbers  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Cryptographic hash</p>  A long string of numbers and letters that is not readable by any human  Used in anchoring to prove the existence of data on files and credentials while the content is kept private  Maintain the privacy and security of data because only the hash is stored on the blockchain rather than the credentials themselves  Creates immutable timestamps associated with the information and recorded on the blockchain  <p>Private key</p>  A private key (a string of letters and numbers) is like a password that allows a holder to access and manage their data  The owner should be the only one who knows the private key and it must never be shared with anyone else  Regarding DIDs, the private key allows people to prove ownership, grant permissions to share specific data, and sign documents  <p>Public key</p>  A public key (a string of letters and numbers) that can be safely shared with anyone to send and receive data  Used for user authentication and verification purposes  <p>Verifiable Credential</p>  A digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification  When digital credentials conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which is a standard established by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials   Conclusion <p>In an increasingly digital world, the problem with physical IDs and credentials is that they can be easily forged and take a lot of time to verify for authenticity. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials are:</p>  Are a digital version of paper-based credentials that people can present to organizations  Tamper-proof  Supports data protection  Instantly verifiable  Secure and allow the ID holder to have full control and ownership of their data  <p>In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, there is an issuer, holder, and verifier. The issuer and holder are required to use decentralized identifiers, or DIDs, which are globally unique identifiers that allow the owner to prove cryptographic control over them.

1&nbsp; What is Aries Interop Profile (AIP)? 
<p>Aries agents are all united through the standards and protocols they aim to adhere to, and the underlying technologies:</p>
 
 
 
 Cryptography 
 DIDs 
 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10NGAtlov49dbaDX96C0F4MdRrr20eHiE4RSZfJu0oXU/edit?usp=sharing">DID Utility Ledgers</a> 
 Verifiable Credentials 
 
 
 
<p>As <a href="https://northernblock.io/introduction-to-digital-trust/">Digital Trust</a> ecosystems evolve, they will naturally require many technologies to coexist and cooperate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders and users will not care about incompatibilities – they will simply wish to take advantage of the benefits of digital trust.</p>
<p>Interoperability ultimately means more than just Aries agents working with each other. It covers worldwide standards and paves the way for broader compatibility.</p>
<p>Interoperability will drive scalability while identities/subjects make self-sovereign choices. The technology must ensure that these choices don’t result in digital trust ecosystems losing trust.</p>
<p>To prevent vendor lock-in, interoperability must enable different ledger (and non-ledger) choices, and credential formats provided by identities/subject to co-exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today if we have to present two forms of ID at a bank, we have to present two seperate documents. The bank requires two different verification technologies/processes to ensure the two documents can be trusted. This process is very expensive, time consuming, and it also drives unique training needs – an additional cost. In this example, interoperability means that the same document reader can read both a Driver’s Licence and a Passport – a very cost efficient and trusted process for the economy.</p>
<p>If Hyperledger Aries is to continue to flourish, these are the five drivers that we think must be taken into consideration when talking about interoperability:</p>
 
 
 
 Drives Scalability  
 Maintains Privacy &amp; Security  
 Avoids Diluting Other Standards’ Principles  (e.g., if Aries should be interoperable with mDL, you can’t dilute the principles of mDL) 
 Drives Adoption through Cost Efficiencies  
 Ensures Tech Stack has long-term viability  (not a short term bridge solution)

2&nbsp; How We Achieved AIP 1.0 
<p>Towards the end of 2021, Northern Block demonstrated AIP 1.0 Compliance of its Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet against the Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH) (<a href="https://northernblock.io/nb-orbit-mobile-wallet-demonstrates-aip-1-0-compliance-with-digital-identity-laboratory-of-canada/">here</a>).</p>
<p>Interoperability is assessed using the Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH), which is an open-source software that runs a series of Aries interoperability tests and uses a <a href="https://aries-interop.info/URL">Behavior Driven-Development</a> (BDD) framework to run tests that are designed to exercise the community-designed Aries Protocols, as defined in the <a href="https://aries-interop.info/[https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs)">Aries RFC</a> GitHub repo.</p>
<p>We additionally tested this interoperability in action between organizations using the BC Gov Business Partner Agent (BPA) and the <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet</a>.</p>
  
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkPuEuf9K3Y">SSI Interoperability Demo – NB Orbit Mobile Wallet, PwC, Copper Mountain &amp; BC Mines</a></p>
<p>AIP currently has two versions:</p>
 
 
 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile#aries-interop-profile-version-10">AIP 1.0</a>, defines how Aries agents communicate with each other using a single type of verifiable credential, and 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>, builds on AIP 1.0 including how Aries agents can exchange several types of verifiable credentials, including W3C standard verifiable credentials. 
 
 
 
<p>Our work since these demonstrations has been to move the needle towards AIP 2.0 Compliance for both our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet and <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">Enterprise SSI Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
 <br>
3&nbsp; Why We Chose Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) 
<p>To achieve AIP 2.0, Northern Block needed both our Cloud and Edge agents to support it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Enterprise SSI Platform (Cloud Agent) is based on ACA-Py 0.7.3, which already provides support for AIP 2.0. However, ACA-Py can only run in the cloud – so it wasn’t an option for our mobile environments.</p>
<p>This section explains the reasoning behind why we chose Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) for our Mobile Wallet Agent to move us to AIP 2.0.</p>
 3A&nbsp; Vibrant Community 
<p>The first thing we looked at was the activity happening in the multiple Aries projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wished to become contributors to a project with lots of activity so that we wouldn’t be amongst the sole/few contributors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We realized that there remained a lot of work to do on these frameworks; and we wanted to share the load with others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We saw that there were multiple contributors working on AFJ with tons of recent, and real-time activity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This not only creates benefits for Northern Block, but also for our network of partners and clients. To avoid vendor lock-in scenarios, we recommend to our clients that if we build a product for them and for whatsoever reason they decide to no longer work with us; their code base will remain on an active open source framework and will likely continue to be maintained by us – meaning they will continue to reap the benefits of the framework updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all the activity happening in AFJ, the AIP 2.0 support was where we needed it.</p>
 3B&nbsp; Multiple Credential Format Support 
<p>In our <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/">NB Orbit Solutions</a>, we are agnostic to credential formats, as we want to make it as simple as possible for anyone to securely transmit verifiable data between two entities.</p>
<p>There are use cases where one would rather use an Indy AnonCreds credential (based on CL signatures) versus using a W3C JSON-LD credential (based on Ed25519 signatures).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 
 
 Indy AnonCreds are well suited when privacy-preserving and non-transferability are required (this makes them really well suited for government-issued credentials) 
 W3C JSON-LD – these are heading towards being privacy-preserving, but are transferable (this makes them better suited today for when identity binding is not a requirement, but verifiability and trust are still important. For example: a ticket, or a medical prescription.) 
 
 
 
<p>This factor eliminated agents such as <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go">Aries Framework Go</a>, which could have also been a valid option, but it doesn’t support Indy credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are some of the trade-offs that must be taken into consideration when comparing various Aries implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AFJ has both Indy and W3C support and it works in React Native – which brings me to the next factor.</p>
 3C&nbsp; Team, Technology and Skill Set 
<p>What you’re already familiar with and what you’re building can have a big impact on what library you choose.</p>
<p>Our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet is built in React Native. We chose React Native for our mobile wallet because:</p>
 
 It’s a popular language choice amongst developers (making it easier to find developer talent), 
 We wouldn’t have to create native mobile apps for different operating systems (e.g., one codebase for Apple, another code base for Android), 
 It has tons of widely used third party libraries (e.g., internationalization support). 
 
<p>Other agents such as <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a> limits you to writing your application in .NET. From past experiences, we can claim that .NET is a good platform to build mobile apps in and it’s built for enterprise usage. If you already have a mobile app, or you have infrastructure, or you have developers that are familiar with Go then you probably pick Go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It really comes down to developer preference.&nbsp;</p>
 <br>
4&nbsp; What Excites Us About AIP 2.0 
 4A&nbsp; Out-of-band With Connection Reuse 
<p>One of the really big advantages of AIP 2.0 is the ability to conduct out of band communication with connection reuse, in a standardized way.</p>
<p>Out-of-band (non-Aries) communication channels are available between the Verifier and the Prover(s), to allow the Verifier to provide a URL to the Prover.</p>
 
 
 
 Could be an email with a QR code to be scanned by a wallet and a link to be opened on a mobile device to be handled by a wallet 
 Could be a web page displaying a QR code 
 Could be a QR code printed by the verifier and posted 
 
 
 
<p>In-band connection will use a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of DIDs: <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>.</p>
<p>The outgoing messages are based on DIDComm Messaging, however it doesn’t use the in-band routing and encryption as defined by the DIDComm spec – but the replies are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as a first step, while there is no connection, you’re able to send a message using an out-of-band technology. And then you establish the DIDComm connection.</p>
<p>AIP 1.0 was missing a standard way to reuse connections. Labels could be used to identify the requester of the connection, and to not create duplicate connections when the same requestor sent connection requests. Hence techniques such as labels were used as a way to drive connection reuse – resulting in proprietary implementations to achieve connection reuse – a weak point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In AIP 2.0, the RFC added standard out-of-band for connection reuse as part of the protocol. It can be used as a generic out-of-band invitation to either create a connection, do connectionless exchanges, or both. It’s something that the end user does notice and makes UX a lot better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to sign in to a website, so you scan a QR Code</p>
<p>You create a connection and then you show a proof of a credential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following week you want to sign in from a different computer so you create a connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what used to happen in AIP 1.0 is you would create a new connection, resulting in two connections that would show up in your wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you can reuse the connection, and you can sign in using that connection again, you won’t have to manage multiple connections for the same entity.</p>
<p>Of course we know that there exists use cases where you don’t want connection reuse (e.g., cases where you don’t want to be correlatable across connections). We wrote a recent blog post that scratches the surface of this: <a href="https://northernblock.io/why-credential-issuance-should-be-holder-driven/">https://northernblock.io/why-credential-issuance-should-be-holder-driven/</a>.</p>
 4B&nbsp; Credential Format Agnostic 
<p>This enhancement makes it flexible for implementation teams who would like to use Aries, but have requirements for a specific credential type. A couple differentiations in an above section were described in relation to Indy AnonCreds vs W3C JSON-LD credentials.</p>
<p>Generally in AIP 2.0,&nbsp; a lot of focus has been on removing the dependencies on Indy, making it more standards based to support formats such as the W3C credential. This big enhancement happens through the Issue Credential and Present Proof v2 RFCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The v1 protocol was specifically Indy-focused, meaning you could only use it with AnonCreds credentials. The v2 protocol now supports JSON-LD credentials and it could be defined in such a way that any more could be added later on, making it credential format agnostic.</p>
<p>Now, on the same issue credential protocol, you can now support multiple formats – you can send the credential as either an AnonCreds with an AnonCreds-based signature, as a W3C supporting different signatures, as an mDL, or any other credential format. If both agents support the signature and the message format, then they are able to decrypt what they have received.</p>
 4C&nbsp; Support for 90+ DID Methods 
<p>In AIP 2.0, we’ve also been able to remove the dependency on legacy Indy DIDs and legacy Indy Peer DIDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This wasn’t really adopted before, and now these new protocols use DID Exchange built on top of the W3C DID Core specifications, instead of the connection protocol, and always fully uses qualified DIDs that follow the RFC.</p>
<p>DID Exchange allows you to exchange DIDs and DID Documents. The connection protocol from AIP 1.0 wasn’t very well suited for standards compliant like non-Indy or Pairwise DIDs (this was more a limitation of the implementations and that it was an old protocol leaning on an unreleased/older version of the DID Core spec. There was nothing preventing the protocol to be used with other DID Methods).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DID Exchange protocol supports all DIDs – any method can be used. Of course both agents communicating must support DID Exchange. Peers must support the same DID Methods so that they can resolve the DIDs. For example, if Alice uses did:key and Bob doesn’t support did:key, then it can’t be resolved.</p>
<p>DID Exchange is much more generic – meaning DID exchange opens the door for all DID methods that are registered in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">spec registry</a>, so that 90+ DID Methods could be used.</p>
<p>This is an important upgrade to Aries for staying on top of evolving standards.</p>
<p>And here’s another reason why this upgrade is important.</p>
<p>If you are the Holder of a Bank ID Credential, it’s likely that you can present this ID to a Government Tax Agency and they will trust it. So if you have a did:bank ID which can only be used within their ledger and their governance, the tax agency will accept it since they trust the process that the bank would have done to verify claims and issue this ID to you.</p>
<p>We can draw parallels to how the first numbers on a credit card typically represent the issuer identification number. Using the standard format provides interoperability because you’re not tied to one to a federated ID or a centralized slash. If I’m only using did:sov, it can become a federated ledger if it’s the only ledger which can resolve the DID (identifier).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the end user can select the DID Method, then they’re not tied to a federated model, it’s completely decentralized.</p>
 4D&nbsp; Bring Your Own Identifier! 
<p>The purpose of supporting DID Exchange is to give the end user the freedom to choose their own identifier for the relationship; enabling them to use less/more secure or different DID Methods as their identifier.</p>
<p>It allows you to choose your own identifier for the relationship to avoid the centralized model (e.g., when you sign up for Facebook they give you an identifier).</p>
<p>In this decentralized model, you inform the other party of your identifier you wish to use, and they just have to resolve it.</p>
<p>This now gives end users much more flexibility; allowing the end user to create multiple personas around DIDs and present them as they wish.</p>
<p>Of course with Connectionless you don’t need to do that bootstrapping because you are not creating a connection; you’re creating a key that you’re only going to use for this single exchange, and then you’re going to throw it away – similar to a temporary email that you may use for a single purpose.</p>
<p>The single/temporary key usage can also be true for connection-based exchanges, which brings in the ability to conduct Key Rotation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other party could update their DID Document on the ledger, remove the previous key and update it for a new key. The next time they wish to send you a message, you resolve the DID Document and your agent can know that they changed their keys. Your agent will then begin using this new key to encrypt messages for them, allowing them to rotate keys as needed without informing you.</p>
<p>This brings added security benefits by reducing the chances that your keys get compromised. It’s a concept that’s similar to switching your password every 60 days for online services. If someone gains access to your keys, they can decrypt your messages</p>
 4E&nbsp; Standardized URL Shortening 
<p>Another thing which has been standardized in AIP 2.0 is the URL shortening mechanism.</p>
<p>This standardization is part of the Aries RFC 0434: Out-of-Band Protocol 1.1.</p>
<p>URL shortening is used to make payloads simpler and smaller (e.g., in QR Codes). We ran into issues at Northern Block in the past in which our QR codes would get too heavy, making them impossible to scan from a mobile device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because URLs weren’t standardized in AIP 1.0, we were forced to create our own mechanism. And so did other vendors, which made it difficult to do interoperability.</p>
<p>Standardizing the way you shorten the URLs whether it’s an invitation, a proof request, or whatever that may be provides interoperability so people are not doing things their own way.</p>
 4F&nbsp; Standardized Mediator Coordination 
<p>Mediators are a store and forward system that provide mobile wallets with a static endpoint. Mobile devices are not guaranteed to be available online when a cloud agent needs to communicate with them. The mediator acts as an answering machine for the mobile wallet and will forward on the encrypted messages it has received when the mobile device is back online.</p>
<p>There’s now a standard protocol for that which is why you can use ACA-Py as the mediator and AFJ on the client-side. It’s not something the user will notice but it makes the infrastructure easier.</p>
<p>There was previously no standard way of registering my routing keys and endpoint with 3rd party mediators. There’s now a discovery protocol for the edge wallet to find the mediator and register itself using a standard protocol.</p>
<p>The Recipient (edge wallet) must know which endpoint and routing key(s) to share, and the Mediator needs to know to which endpoints messages received with a key need to be routed to.</p>
<p>This allows edge wallets (holders) and issuers/verifiers to connect with any third party mediator that supports this protocol, avoiding vendor lock-in.</p>

 Growing the Community 

<p>The Blockchain Commons community continues to grow to the benefit of all of our members.</p>

<p>Welcome to Chia. A big welcome to our newest sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://www.chia.net/">Chia Network</a>, Bram Cohen’s blockchain company. Chia joined mainly because of what we’re already doing, including our work on advocacy and our history with DIDs. We’re thrilled to have them not just because of the interest in our current efforts, but also because of their cutting-edge blockchain work, including the innovative Chialisp smart-contract language, work with pairing-based cryptography, and their <a href="https://www.chia.net/greenpaper/">Proofs of Space and Time algorithm</a>. Blockchain Commons supports the heterogeneity of the blockchain space. We want to make wallets work with multiple blockchains that are built in multiple ways, and having someone like Chia onboard makes that possible.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon. Community growth allows us to hold events to bring that community to share their knowledge. Thus, our first quarter welcoming of <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a> and <a href="https://www.proxy.com/">Proxy</a> allowed us to hold our first Silicon Salon, where semiconductor manufacturers, hardware-wallet makers, and other interested parties joined together to discuss the future of semiconductor design and how it can better support cryptographic functionality. The <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon website</a> contains complete information on the June 1st event, including <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/presentations/">videos, slides, and transcripts of all the presentations</a> as well as an <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/#discussions">overview of the discussions</a> with quotes.</p>

<p></p>

 Evolving our References 

<p>Our reference apps demonstrate how the Gordian principles can be used in functional applications; while our reference libraries make it easy to use our specifications. We continue to upgrade and expand both with the support of our community — and occasionally deprecate some when they’ve served their purpose.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool 1.5. We upgraded our premiere Gordian app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Gordian Seed Tool</a>, to 1.5. This upgrade implemented new experimental functionality related to NFC Tags. You can now write to and read from NFCs by just tapping them with your phone. There are still a number of questions about NFC security, but we’re always interested in testing out the newest technology and considering how it could integrate into our secure architecture — and that type of experimentation is one of the major purposes of our references.</p>

<p>Gordian Server 1.0.2. One of the challenges of producing an application like <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a>, which makes it easy to install and use Bitcoin Core on your Mac, is that we’re vulnerable to any changes in Bitcoin Core itself. Some minor changes in the file names for Bitcoin Core 23.0 required us to do some updates to both Gordian Server and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup Scripts</a>, but everything is now up-to-date, allowing easy installation of a Bitcoin Server that will allow you to work with new Bitcoin technologies such as Taproot and Schnorr signatures.</p>

<p>Gordian QR Tool Deprecation. The maintenance load for apps results in us occasionally deprecating something, and that was the case this quarter for our QR Tool app. We originally released Gordian QR Tool to demonstrate the Gordian principles of resilience and independence in a simple, easy-to-use way. This included a way to store seeds and other vulnerable data as QR codes in a secure vault. However, Gordian Seed Tool has evolved so far since the debut of the two apps that we’ve decided QR Tool doesn’t hold many advantages any more. Thus, we’ve deprecated QR Tool so that we can instead focus our attention on Seed Tool.</p>

<p>Lifehash for Python. Thanks to the support of our sustaining sponsor <a href="https://cramiumsolutions.com/">Cramium Solutions</a> and the work of long-time Blockchain Common contributor &amp; supporter <a href="https://github.com/kanzure">Bryan Bishop</a>, Blockchain Commons is now able to offer a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash-python">Python implementation of our Lifehash library</a>. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info#readme">Lifehash</a> is a Blockchain Commons specification that creates beautiful visual hashes that make it easy to identify data at a glance. Thanks to Cramium for making this methodology available to Python programmers!</p>

 Evolving Smart Custody 

<p>Smart Custody is one of Blockchain Commons’ oldest projects, and it continued to see new life in the last quarter.</p>

<p>Full Draft of Multisig. We have completed the first draft of our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">multisig scenario for self-sovereign #SmartCustody</a>. Since our rough draft last quarter, we’ve added dozens of illustrations and responded to reviews, creating a new draft that’s hopefully more usable and definitely more accurate. Though we’re thrilled to now be able to advocate for a multisig solution for self-custody, in the process we’ve learned both that its complexity can be intimidating and that the specificity of required devices can make it unapproachable. So expect both more expansions in the future (to support more variants), as well as some bigger Blockchain Commons projects that will start to demonstrate how we can make multisigs simple.</p>

<p>Outline for #SmartCustody 2.0. We’ve been thinking about a second edition of our 
<a href="https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101">Smart Custody book</a> for a few years and have recently created <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md">a new outline for SmartCustody 2.0</a>. We’re not quite sure when we’ll be able to dedicate time for it, but these are our current thoughts on documenting SmartCustody for the future. In the meantime, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody#smartcustody-scenarios">Smart Custody Repo</a> for the scenarios, tools, and case studies that we’ve written in the last year and which will eventually appear as modules in the #SmartCustody 2.0 book.</p>

<p></p>

 Welcome to New Interns 

<p>For the third year in a row we’re running a Blockchain Commons virtual-intern program this summer.</p>

<p>The Third Cohort of Blockchain Commons Interns. Welcome to our latest cohort of Blockchain Commons interns, which this year includes 16 interns out of twice that many applications. We’ve always wanted to broaden our internships to go beyond just software engineers, and we’ve been pleased with the success of that this year, with a pre-law intern now leading a whole group in the support of our advocacy work in Wyoming. Projects our interns are working on include: the support for that legislative work in Wyoming and elsewhere; expanding Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line for new Taproot and Schnorr technology; exploring the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0322.mediawiki">BIP-322 proposal</a> to leverage Bitcoin Script to sign arbitrary messages; updating <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">Spotbit</a>; and writing use cases for human-rights workers such as emergency and medical personnel, monitors, press, and advocates. We look forward to reporting back on these projects at the end of summer.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Pre-Updates. To get the Learning Bitcoin course ready for our newest interns (and for their own work on it), we updated Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line for all recent PRs and to address all recent issues (most of which had to do with updates to Bitcoin Core over the last year). Thank you to everyone who has helped us to keep the Learning Bitcoin module up-to-date and correct over the years! We haven’t flagged an official release yet, as we’re hoping to at the end of summer, but the Learning Bitcoin course should now be more accurate and up-to-date with Bitcoin Core 23.0 commands.</p>

 Working with Wyoming 

<p>We’ve been thrilled to continue working with the Wyoming legislature, with support from our new interns. Christopher Allen and one of our interns gave new testimony on a variety of topics this June, with support from the legislative intern team.</p>

<p>E-Residency. We’ve spoken several times in Wyoming to advocate for e-residency, which will allow corporations to take advantage of the excellent digital business &amp; privacy laws that Wyoming has been advancing in the last several years. A local paper gave <a href="https://www.thesheridanpress.com/news/local/wyoming-considering-following-in-estonias-footsteps-with-new-program/article_fa2161e0-ed7f-11ec-b22a-db4cbe8144e0.html">good coverage</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>WRDAs. We also advanced new ideas on Wyoming Registered Digital Assets (WRDAs), which will improve Wyoming’s treatment of digital assets by allowing for perfection under the UCC. Here’s our <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061408-03WyomingWRDASlides.pdf">slides on the topic</a>.</p>

<p>Private Key Protections. Finally, our most important testimony for Wyoming may have been about protecting private keys from disclosure by courts. The problem is that courts are current endangering digital assets, information, and identity by demanding the turnover of private keys, often as part of pretrial motions. They’re not the proper tool, and they’re not being used in the proper way. Because this is such an important topic, we’re currently working on a position paper that will better explain why private keys are not appropriate for this usage.</p>

<p></p>

 Looking toward the Future 

<p>A lot of our work in Q2 was forward-looking, developing specs and architectures that we hope will be the next generation of responsible key management on the internet.</p>

<p>We expect to advance three major projects in the third quarter based on this work.</p>

<p>CSR. Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR) is the first step in the development of our next-generation Smart Custody architecture. The <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/149">CSR Project</a> is intended to automate the sharding and recovery of seeds and other essential metadata, with options to support shard-recovery services: interopable services will hold envelopes of data containing shards of the data required for wallet recovery and only return them to users following sufficient authentication. This work is currently being done in conjunction with Bitmark and Proxy.</p>

<p>Hardware API. The varied APIs of hardware devices can cause numerous integration problems for developers (the so-called “NASCAR Problem”. Thus our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/158">Hardware API Project</a> seeks to develop a  unified wallet architecture &amp; APIs that will work with a variety kinds of devices. We also plan to leverage URs and crypto-requests and to support device capability discovery. The first steps will be analyzing and assessing current hardware APIs, abstracting out functionality, and simultaneously leveraging new work such as that being done by CrossBar for silicon support. This work is currently being done in conjunction with CrossBar and Proxy while Blockchain Commons contributes specs and coordination.</p>

<p>Reference Upgrades. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/159">Automated multisig round-trips</a> are meant to expand the work Blockchain Commons has already done on Uniform Resources (URs) by using <code>crypto-requests</code> to automate the creation and usage of a classic (pre-Taproot) Bitcoin multisig. This will be done through the development of a new reference app, Gordian Coordinator, which will be a transaction coordinator that holds no private keys, and through the expansion of Gordian Seed Tool. Our ultimate goal is to demonstrate the ease of use possible with a fully integrated system of <code>crypto-requests</code>.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to the development of these exciting new architectures and designs for the future!</p>

Our CTO and co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley frequently presents on the topic at conferences and seminars.</p>



<p>On 30 and 31 May 2022, Dr Ashley was honored to present a keynote address at the&nbsp;<a href="https://symposium-dlt.org/bafw/">Workshop on Blockchain Applications and Fintel</a>&nbsp;in Brisbane, Australia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshop, hosted by Griffith University, was a platform for sharing knowledge, innovations and practical experiences for industry, government and academia on the opportunities and challenges of real-world applications of blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



 What is blockchain? 



<p><a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain">Blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a database for recording information so it can’t be changed or hacked (immutable). It’s how we establish&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in decentralized systems. You might have heard of blockchain in relation to bitcoin.</p>



<p>Blockchain is a type of decentralised database that multiple participants (computers in a network) manage. It can be used for almost anything valuable such as supply chains, payments, accounts, production, orders, decentralized exchanges, smart contracts, etc. Blockchain has many benefits to users, including that it’s cost effective and lower risk than a centralized database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchains are unlimited in number and increasing all the time. Right now, about 1,000 blockchains exist in the world, with four different&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/What-are-the-4-different-types-of-blockchain-technology#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20main%20types,benefits%2C%20drawbacks%20and%20ideal%20uses.">types of blockchain network</a>&nbsp;(public, private, consortium and hybrid). Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain">this</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-blockchains-are-there/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20there%20are%20at%20least,platforms%20provided%20in%20this%20industry.">this</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>



 Dr Ashley discussed where the world is at with decentralized identity, one of the most important uses cases for blockchain&nbsp; 



<p>At the Brisbane workshop, Dr Ashley presented on the&nbsp;“Progress and Pitfalls on the Path to Decentralized Identity”. He discussed:</p>



  Improving privacy in the surveillance economy  What decentralized identity is, and the transition from centralized to decentralized identity management  Decentralized identity wallet&nbsp;  Decentralized identity blockchain  Decentralized identity verifiable credentials (or digital ID documents)  Decentralized identity standards  A case study on Block’s tbdex decentralized exchange protocol.  



<p>Dr Ashley concluded:</p>



  With the continued rise of the surveillance economy, the world needs solutions that improve privacy for everyday internet users.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Decentralized Identity is the most important privacy technology innovation for the next decade, giving users control of their personal data.&nbsp;  Decentralized identity-based applications rely on blockchain as the anchor of trust and therefore decentralized identity is one of the most important use cases for blockchain technology.&nbsp;  Although there has been a lot of progress in decentralized identity in the past few years, there are still many pitfalls that need to be overcome, including interoperability and ease of use for the everyday user.  



 Anonyome Labs offers decentralized identity capabilities in Sudo Platform 



<p>Dr Paul Ashley was an obvious choice for the keynote address on challenges and benefits of real-world applications of blockchain and decentralized identity as a use case for it. Anonyome Labs&nbsp;is enhancing its&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;digital identity with decentralized identity capabilities, to help&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/04/part-1-how-the-sudo-digital-identity-can-help-stop-the-attack-on-personal-privacy%ef%bf%bc/">stop the full-scale attack on personal privacy</a>. This functionality is available through our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;SDKs, to help enterprises rapidly develop and deploy customer privacy solutions.</p>



 Beyond Sudo Platform, Anonyome Labs supports the ongoing development of decentralized identity by: 



  Helping to run three decentralized identity-focused blockchains  Being an active contributor to the decentralized identity standards organizations  Contributing source code back to the decentralized identity open source community.  



<p>Decentralized identity is considered the most important privacy innovation for the coming decade since it provides the foundation for great improvement in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>. Learn more on our blog, or go straight to:&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the evolving world of open banking, it’s easy for businesses to get lost in the endless possibilities. Who do we partner with to provide services at scale? How do we make it easier and faster for our fintech, merchant and lender partners to use our services? What is the most effective way to deploy the power of open banking? <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html">Mastercard</a> today announced an expansion of its <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/engage/#/en/home">Engage</a> partner network to help businesses decide who they can count on for technology integration of open banking services. We connect platform providers and ecosystem partners and help them provide open banking services at scale, making it easier and faster for fintech, merchant and lender clients to utilize consumer-permissioned data to offer new and improved financial services.</p>
<p>The Engage network offers businesses easy access to financial technology partners that can quickly build and deploy open banking services for payments and lending decisioning use cases at scale. The initial partners to join Mastercard Engage for open banking include <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>, <a href="https://fintechautomation.com/">FinTech Automation</a>, <a href="https://www.i2cinc.com/">i2c</a>, <a href="https://www.link.money/">Link Financial Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.loanpro.io/">LoanPro</a>, <a href="https://www.novacredit.com/">Nova Credit</a>, <a href="https://www.provenir.com/">Provenir</a>, <a href="https://synctera.com/">Synctera</a>, <a href="https://www.ternitup.com/">Tern</a> and <a href="https://usio.com/">Usio, Inc</a>.</p>
<p>Through this new program, these providers benefit from fewer contracts, faster access to customers, data security and access and overall flexibility to better leverage Mastercard’s robust open banking services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard has a long-standing track record of working with technology and fintech partners to build the future of financial services and enable more choices for consumers. With three billion cardholders and 93 million merchants, the more partners Mastercard has, the more powerful the flywheel of our network becomes. Since 2018, nearly 150 partners around the world have joined the Mastercard Engage program. In the last year alone, nearly 100 Engage partners have helped their customers deploy new, innovative solutions on more than 250 million accounts with Mastercard digital services, including all-digital consumer payments experiences, tokenization, digital wallet, mobile POS solutions and now, open banking.&nbsp;</p>
 Implementation Choices to Fit Your Needs 
<p>Open banking through Mastercard and its technology partners allows businesses to establish direct consumer-permissioned connections with their customers’ bank accounts. Through these consumer-permissioned connections, businesses can verify accounts for payments and payouts, check balances to reduce payment failures, and cut fraud by confirming bank account ownership. This has improved the payment experience for both the businesses and their customers. </p>
<p>Similarly for lending, borrowers can directly permission data and insights through the ecosystem to support their lending decisioning processes. This also means a better lending experience for both the lender and borrower, as it provides financial insights, expanded data sets not available through paper submissions, increased financial inclusion, and a simplified experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Engage program provides two implementation options for open banking technology integration partners. The first two offerings are Partner Linked and Partner Direct. These methods provide a seamless and secure implementation of consumer-permissioned data through Mastercard’s open banking platform and can be used together or separately, depending on the preference of the financial technology provider.</p>
<p>Partner Linked provides broad ecosystem access, allowing business clients to quickly begin using the solutions through their preferred platform partner. This integration is an agreement with a partner and a direct agreement with the business. Engage partners can integrate to Finicity, Mastercard’s wholly-owned subsidiary with a customer-supplied access key, shielding their businesses from needing to handle user credentials. This method provides simple integration for our partners and the business contracts directly with Finicity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Partner Direct is a reseller agreement that allows for greater customization than the Partner Linked integration, and direct access to provide business clients with a single integration for all open banking data, lending and/or payment services. Partners can directly embed and/or resell Mastercard open banking services and offer a customized experience for their business customers, wrapping additional value-added services around Mastercard’s open banking platform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As an Engage technology partner, you can expect:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Go-to-market collaboration – Helps technology providers sell and deploy their solution in new markets and find new customers.&nbsp; 
 Promotion – Partners are featured on Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/engage/#/en/home">portal</a> to gain visibility and credibility with all Mastercard customers. 
 Training &amp; insights – <a href="https://academy.mastercard.com/events/mastercard-academy-north-america/event-summary-86538b8600e74bc4877f7af7ca3366a0.aspx?dvce=1">Mastercard Academy</a> gives partners access to a series of product and solution training sessions. They can also participate in regional forums with insights from Mastercard and its partners around value and product propositions as well as market priorities.

<p>Athens is the cradle of Western civilization. So, it’s only fitting that the technical seeds of new democratic structures, rooted in blockchain, would begin to grow at <a href="https://twitter.com/GrapeAthensDAO">AthensDAO</a>.</p>



<p>Our Berlin-based engineers, Dan Kelleher and Alexis Raptarchis, recently journeyed south to take part in the Grape Protocol sponsored hacker house. Familiar with the many aspects of managing DAOs in both the physical world and in Web3, they were happy to connect with projects working to solve some of the same challenges.</p>



<p>During the week, the pair met with <a href="https://realms.today/realms">Realms</a>, a DAO governance platform on Solana. Together, they integrated our flagship product, Civic Pass, in order to introduce a veritable Swiss Army knife of tools to DAO admins and <a href="https://youtu.be/WauMPATsylA?t=14121">an enthusiastic hacker house</a>. Civic Pass allows real-world constraints and permissioning to be added to a DAO’s membership, based on digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because DAOs have flat organizational structures and shared bank accounts, decision-making can become more transparent and trusted — in part because of the smart contracts executing the decision-making. In practice though, delegating authority to a DAO can add unexpected challenges, from issues surrounding everything from human disagreements to cyber attacks on the system itself. Civic Pass helps alleviate some of these challenges.</p>



<p>Sybil resistance</p>



<p>Sybil attacks, which use large numbers of pseudonymous identities to gain unfair influence and voting rights, may be prevented with liveness and uniqueness verification by Civic Pass. Sybil resistance is essential for enabling systems like quadratic voting and one-person-one-vote systems. It is essentially the core benefit of uniqueness on DAOs.</p>



<p>Trusted decision-making processes</p>



<p>After a DAO makes a choice to be Sybil resistant, the DAO may enable one-person-one-vote and quadratic voting systems.</p>



<p>One-person-one vote</p>



<p>Checking for uniqueness can also prevent members from accumulating more than their allotted share of one vote. This may help prevent whales or individuals with a large number of wallets from voting more than once.</p>



<p>Quadratic voting systems</p>



<p>An upgrade on the standard on-person-one-vote system that most collectives employ, quadratic voting allows for voters to express the degree of their preferences, which helps eliminate majority rule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Location and age gating</p>



<p>DAOs may need to keep out minors or members from certain locations, based on local laws or other criteria. Civic Pass helps by verifying this information, while keeping other user information private.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC requirements</p>



<p>DAOs may need to adhere to local laws related to compliance. If they are subject to compliance, Civic Pass can help provide inputs to satisfy requirements.</p>



<p>In sum, we’re thrilled about this integration. Civic Pass helps DAO leaders set expectations around how voting will be conducted and protect the DAO at the same time. We are looking forward to hearing about how these features are put into practice.</p>

 Meet the Team — Todd Collins, Head of&nbsp;Design Todd Collins<p>Meet the Team is our ongoing series of employee profiles. It’s an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little better. As a remote company with employees around the world — from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand — it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>We’re excited to introduce Todd Collins, Head of Design at GlobaliD. Todd has an art school background with a focus on industrial design. He spent the early part of his career as a marketing designer with companies such as E-Trade and Oracle before helping design and launch Feedbin, a popular RSS&nbsp;reader.</p><p>Now, he’s a central part of our team working on the future of digital identity. During our conversation, Todd discussed the challenge of reimagining what identity looks like, developing language and visuals that appeal to people, but are also easily understood, and what attracted him to his role at GlobaliD.</p> Introducing Todd&nbsp;Collins <p>I’m Todd Collins, Head of Design. My responsibility is to own the user experience and user interface around the GlobaliD&nbsp;app.</p><p>When I first got the position, Greg [Kidd] told me that we needed to define what a credential is in this space, that I needed to define the future of what digital identity and credentials look and feel like, because these things didn’t yet exist in the world — at least not in the way we think it&nbsp;should.</p> On how designing in the world of digital identity is&nbsp;unique <p>This is sort of a unique position to be in, design wise. Typically, you’re working on things that already exist, that you can get easy inspiration from. But with digital identity, you’re really carving out your own path into a jungle. You have a machete and you’re cutting your way through, and people are going to be following you versus the other way around, which is part of the&nbsp;fun.</p> Why GlobaliD appealed to&nbsp;him <p>I’m at GlobaliD because it sounded really murky, really undefined. I don’t want to work at some other tech company and just do optimizations, post-market fit and all that. In that situation you’re just kind of making the company more money — optimizing, making more money, optimizing. This was not that, and that was very attractive to&nbsp;me.</p> What he likes about self-sovereign identity versus the convenience of big&nbsp;tech <p>I think Big Tech has caused a lot of issues with how they’re rolling out identity and how they’re managing it, which is very profitable for them, but I love the idea of controlling your own&nbsp;data.</p><p>There are conveniences with Big Tech, like using Google to log in across the web, but that means they get even more of your&nbsp;data.</p><p>What’s really cool about the notion of web3 is being able to connect to things and share just bits and pieces of info that are relevant. Hopefully, in the future, sharing data will be beneficial to me, and I’ll control it. There’s nothing wrong with getting a very good targeted ad as long as I’ve given you permission to access my data and only the data that I want you to&nbsp;see.</p> On his design priorities — make it relatable <p>I don’t want to build products for the San Francisco tech elite. It needs to be something that folks can actually use. How would this work if my mom was using it? How can I avoid making this some sort of technical thing? Those are the questions I think&nbsp;about.</p><p>I need to take this very complex concept, this challenging mental model, one that’s intimidating for anybody coming into it, and remove a lot of the complexity. So that in the end, folks understand what they’re doing and what’s happened.</p><p>There’s a lot of terms that get thrown around in the web3 space, and they just feel like gatekeeping to me. Like gas — that’s just a fee. If we ever have gas involved in our wallet I don’t want to use that term. I want to use terms that people understand. Just call it a fee. We all understand what a fee is. My mom knows what a fee&nbsp;is.</p><p>So, it needs to be relatable. That’s always going to be a big thing for me in my design philosophy.</p> Bridging the gap between physical ID cards and our digital&nbsp;future <p>The way I think about it is that we’re in a transitional phase between what we’re used to in the non-digital ID world and what we’re bringing over to the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Which is why right now, in our ID wallet that will be launched later this year, we have cards. Those are what we call the level ones. They look like cards, but they don’t look exactly like the ID cards in your wallet because we’re not interested in remaking a digital version of&nbsp;that.</p>Preview of the upcoming GlobaliD ID&nbsp;Wallet<p>We’re using a skeuomorphic approach, which is when you take a physical object and mimic it in the digital world so it’s easier for the user to interact with it. The early versions of Apple Books used this approach when they first launched to make folks feel comfortable with the idea of a digital book. These days, folks are very comfortable with these things and the skeuomorphic approach is not as needed&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>I see the card thing for the next couple years as the same kind of bridging approach where we’re helping people get used to the idea of digital IDs, but in the long run, I don’t even want to see the&nbsp;cards.</p> Making credentials, ID wallets and digital identity&nbsp;cool <p>We need to make this something that people covet, and that will open up the door to more people adopting digital identity.</p><p>We have plans after the initial launch to really beautify the credentials you’ll keep in your ID wallet, to put some cool designs in there. That way, if you’re at the coffee shop and you show your ID, or you’re at the bar and you show that digital version of it, people are like, what the heck is that? That’s super, that’s awesome. I want one of those! That’s what I’m trying to achieve right now in the short term with the&nbsp;team.</p> What the digital form factor can bring to&nbsp;identity <p>It’s important that we take advantage of the digital form factor, that’s key. With something digital we can bring in motion, we can bring in animation and other dynamic pieces to it. We can constantly update the look and feel of it. Whereas with physical IDs, you can’t do any of that. It’s a physical artifact that can’t change once it’s been made. So, it’s important that we really utilize the opportunities that come with designing digital products.</p> On his education background and early&nbsp;career <p>I actually started out as a musician. I was a drummer, and I was playing in bands, but then I decided I should go to college. I went to art school and studied industrial design, and I loved it. I liked working with my hands. I got to design and build a lot of physical things, work on computers, things like&nbsp;that.</p><p>After graduating I immediately went into marketing design. I worked for all sorts of Bay area companies like E-Trade, Oracle, Lyft, Samsung, and a bunch of startups as well. I was building marketing websites, doing product discovery and always working on something new. I really loved being in that&nbsp;space.</p> How he helped build the Feedbin RSS&nbsp;reader <p>Ben, a developer I was working with at the time, told me he was developing a project and asked if I could do some design work for him. He ended up creating Feedbin, a web-based RSS reader, because he got the feeling Google had stopped working on Google Reader, their own RSS&nbsp;service.</p><p>He announced it, and shortly afterwards, Google said they were shutting down Google Reader. All of a sudden we were getting thousands of people signing up for our service. Next thing you know, he started charging for it and generating revenue. He asked if I would help him out moving forward, and here we are 10 years later. We’ve got over 10,000 paying customers including prominent CEOs and journalists. There’s also a mobile app and a Feedbin podcast app is on the&nbsp;way.</p> What he’s most excited about for GlobaliD moving&nbsp;forward <p>I want to bring GlobaliD to the next level. I think that our users are in a good spot for 2022. We’ve set them up for success with the beautiful wallet we’ve created, but I’m very excited to bring on more verification partners. I really want to connect with businesses and provide a product they see as a legit solution to their problems. That’s what I see as the biggest challenge and opportunity moving forward — really serving those business needs, and then beyond, working with credentials issuers as well. That’s what excites me right now, trying to make that work and bring these awesome products to&nbsp;market.</p><p>We’re hiring!

				  Soul-bound tokens are not designed for privacy, verifiable credentials are—and they can be deployed now  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Privacy by design means, as the European Union explains, “nothing more than ‘data protection through technology design.’” But in this case, “nothing more” means quite a lot. As a company building identity solutions for enterprises around the world, privacy by design is non-negotiable. Privacy preserving technology is seen as a given technological starting point and not a bolt-on feature. The business vibe shift, so to speak, is that privacy is a digital right and that decentralized identity technology is a superior solution to the imperfections of data privacy law. With decentralized identity, you get authentication and you get privacy by design in a way that generates security by design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what is there to say about a new technology that doesn’t do this? Apparently lots. The paper “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul</a>” has generated much discussion as a more advanced and beneficial way of applying an NFT-type technology to encode “social relationships of trust” in Soul-Based Tokens.</p>
<p>It’s a thoughtful and provocative paper with many interesting ideas that go beyond the scope of the single, critical point we wish to address. So, we’re going to go straight to section 8.4 where the arrow strikes Achilles in the heel. Soul-Based Tokens, the authors admit, “ are initially public[,] making them inappropriate for sensitive information like government-issued identification.”</p>
<p>In fact, it’s worse than that. Anything rendered as a Soul-Based Token can be correlated by virtue of being recorded on-chain. It’s a recipe for creating honeypots of personal information that can be read, anonymously, by anyone. Even little bits of what might be considered ‘mostly harmless’ private information when correlated can present unexpected privacy problems. What this means is that the only information safely applicable for use in a Soul Bound Token is so impersonal as to be of little practical use.</p>
<p>This is a marketplace non-starter. (not that there is a market-ready Soul-Based Token system to deploy). The ability to share sensitive information in a privacy preserving way and without writing any of it to a blockchain is precisely what companies and governments want from decentralized identity solutions and it’s what verifiable credential technology gives them.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials enable “social relationships of trust” (what we at Indicio call “Trusted Digital Ecosystems”) because they are verifiable without checking in with the source, they give the data owner control of their data, and they enable that data to be shared through privacy preserving mechanisms (selective disclosure and zero knowledge proofs).</p>
<p>Again, we focus on this section of the paper because it is the flaw that stops the vision taking flight. New ideas have to be evaluated in terms of the technologies we have available today and the issues that exist in the identity space and the marketplace. Verifiable credential technology is being implemented right now because it works to solve the issues that currently exist in the identity space and in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Don’t misinterpret our focus on delivering technology today as a lack of enthusiasm for the technologies of tomorrow. Every technology we have today was once a new idea that developed over time, and we look forward to seeing how the ideas animating Soul-Bound Tokens (and other new developments) will mature over time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’re focused on delivering solutions now, and we’re <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">happy to explain</a> why open source verifiable credential technology is the best solution available.</p>

 KYC and AML solutions are playing an increasing part in tackling money laundering in Germany. But are Germany’s strict regulatory requirements holding its financial services back? IDnow investigates. 



<p>Every year around <a href="https://www.linklaters.com/en/insights/blogs/businesscrimelinks/2021/february/the-recent-reform-of-german-money-laundering-law">€100 billion of laundered money</a> circulates throughout the German economy.</p>



<p>Money laundering and other types of financial crime are rapidly growing problems that threaten the stability of the global economy. In fact, according to the United Nations, money laundering accounts for 2-5% of global GDP (around US$800 billion to US$2 trillion). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulations have long been in place to help prevent money laundering activities. These began with rules from the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/">Financial Action Task Force </a>(FATF) in the 1990s and have evolved and been adopted by many countries since then. As an EU member, Germany follows the European Parliament’s Anti-Money Laundering Directives (AMLD), which are implemented in German law through the German Anti-Money Laundering Act, known as <a href="https://www.brd.nrw.de/themen/kommunales/handel-handwerk-gewerbe/neues-geldwaeschegesetz">Geldwäschegesetz</a> (GWG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oversight and regulation in Europe are handled at a country level. Read our blog to discover more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-aml-kyc-challenges/">how KYC technology is being used to cle</a>an up the UK’s financial services sector. In Germany, <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">BaFin </a>is the regulatory body overseeing and enforcing financial institutions’ compliance with AML and KYC regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although AML and KYC compliance is a legal obligation, there are other important reasons why banks should adhere to compliance rules. Adhering to regulations helps protect banks and fintechs, and their customers from harm, and is likely to enhance the reputation and trustworthiness of the company in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 



  



 What is BaFin and the Geldwäschegesetz?&nbsp; 



<p>AMLD regulations were first introduced in 1991 and have passed through several iterations, each of which has offered improved regulation and coverage, alongside changes in criminal behavior and improvements in technology. The latest 5AMLD regulations and 6AMLD regulations were introduced in 2020 and 2021, and like the upgrades before them, made significant improvements, including a greater focus on Politically Exposed Person (PEP) screening, and sources of finance, while creating consistency and understanding across the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Germany, the GWG Act has been updated several times to reflect changes in AMLD regulations – most recently to reflect the new requirements for enforcement and punishment under 6AMLD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Germany regulatory body known as <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">BaFin</a>, (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), or the Federal Financial Services Authority, reports to the Ministry of Finance, and the Federal Government appoints its president.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BaFin’s responsibilities include AML and KYC but is also responsible for issuing licenses for financial institutions, controlling audits and financial statements, enforcing penalties for financial institutions, and protecting consumers.&nbsp;</p>



 What is the current legal framework for AML in Germany?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>AML law in Germany is implemented through GWG, which covers all aspects of AML and KYC legal compliance, including:&nbsp;</p>



  Definitions and scope of money laundering and AML activities, and obliged entities.  Requirements for customer due diligence, risk assessment, and monitoring.  Escalation and reporting of suspicious activity requirements.  The involvement of the German Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), responsible for analyzing and recording suspicious transactions. It also maintains a centralized database.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Enforcement and criminal liability.  



<p>One area where country-specific regulations can differ significantly is the technical implementation of AML and KYC procedures. AMLD guides the required procedures and scope of AML and KYC, but does not specify the technologies to be implemented, or permitted levels of automation. This is left to the discretion of the national regulator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>BaFin takes a more conservative approach than other regulators, such as UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, by only allowing automated verification via video review, which requires a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature</a> (QES) and a small bank transfer as part of onboarding.</p>



 <br>How to comply with AML regulations in Germany&nbsp; 



<p>The GWG Act specifies a risk-based approach to AML. It requires the development of a risk management system and process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such processes must be embedded in the organizational infrastructure and followed by all relevant employees. BaFin gives instructions and requirements for staff training in AML, but it is left to organizations to decide on the best training format and timing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Processes must also be in place for the escalation and reporting of suspicious customers and transactions – both internal and to authorities. In Germany, such cases must be reported to the <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/Geldwaeschepraevention/Verdachtsmeldewesen/Verdachtsmeldewesen_node_en.html">Financial Intelligence Unit</a> (FIU).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the KYC process, three main stages, or components, must be set up, which are standard in regulations across Europe:&nbsp;</p>



 
 
  Identity Verification, or the Customer Identification Program (CIP). The first step in the KYC process is to prove that the customer is who they claim to be. This includes both individual and corporate customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Customer Due Diligence (CDD). This takes verification one step further and aims to prove whether the financial institution can trust the customer. CDD is about defining a customer’s risk level, and to what extent they can be trusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
 



 
  CDD includes AML screening to check that the potential client isn’t on any sanctions or Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists. Customer addresses can also be checked. Customers considered to be of higher risk will undergo further checks under Enhanced Due Diligence, which can include checking PEP, sanction and watchlists, and monitoring adverse media.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Ongoing Monitoring. AML and KYC compliance is not just about checking new customers during onboarding. Financial institutions must have a program in place for ongoing KYC checks and monitoring. This can include further sanction and PEP checking and regular monitoring of transactions.&nbsp;  
 
 



 How to perform KYC/AML checks as a financial institution or fintech in Germany&nbsp; 



<p>As most new banking customers in Germany are onboarded and verified digitally, the eKYC processes must follow regulatory guidance and feature the three main components described above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customer onboarding and identity verification involves collecting identity documents and checking their authenticity by ensuring the customer and document identity match. In processes that are fully or partially automated, this is increasingly taking place online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CDD must be carried out for all new business relationships (whether this is a person or business). It must also be undertaken in several situations defined by BaFin, including for suspicious or large transactions (over €15,000) or with changes in customer circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Risk assessment procedures must be in place, and further EDD carried out, when the risk is determined to be high. Guidance from BaFin for factors triggering EDD includes:&nbsp;</p>



  Identification of customer or company beneficial owner as a PEP  Complex or suspicious transactions – including those that are unusual or have no apparent economic purpose.&nbsp;  Links or partnerships with a business identified as high risk or located in high-risk countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>BaFin sets several requirements for conducting EDD when necessary. These include involvement from senior management in approvals, enhanced monitoring, and further checks on sources of funds and company relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some notable differences in KYC/AML checks under German regulations compared to other jurisdictions. Rules that financial institutions in Germany need to be aware of include:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Video-based verification. In 2014, Germany was one of the first jurisdictions to permit video onboarding. It is still considered the standard in Germany, as BaFin does not permit the use of artificial intelligence and biometric-based verification that other regulators (including the UK) do, but this is likely to change soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BaFin sets strict standards for video identification procedures, including the stipulation that video identification must take place in real-time, with no interruptions, using end-to-end encrypted channels. Other requirements include standards for video quality, lighting levels, and training of employees to conduct identification. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Use of QES and bank transfer. GWG regulations add an extra layer of protection to AML and KYC. When onboarding and verifying a new customer, a small bank transfer from a named German account must be used as verification support. This simplifies the process of opening additional accounts in Germany, while maintaining a high level of security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reading of ID cards using NFC. Although commonly used throughout the Nordics, the use of identity cards is almost nonexistent in the UK. In Germany, however, identity cards are rolled out to all German citizens, and can be used as a means of verification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What trends and challenges for German KYC and AML practices are coming up?&nbsp; 



<p>AML and KYC processes and techniques have been continually improving since they were introduced to keep pace with changes in criminal behavior, and the regulatory requirements to combat them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technical solutions that make use of increasing degrees of automation will also continue to improve. Several European countries, including the UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Spain now allow the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based methods of verification to check the authenticity of identity documents and biometric verifications of identity. Germany’s BaFin will likely follow suit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other sectors in Germany, change is already happening. In mid-2021, Bundesnetzagentur, the national regulator for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post, and Railways <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-welcomes-bundesnetzagentur-decision-and-predicts-turning-point-for-digital-identity-verification/">authorized</a> the use of AI-based solutions for the verification of certain customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a likelihood that some of this will be addressed in EU-wide AML regulations (including the current draft EU regulation 910/2014), as the EU aims to bring different national AML regulations together to better address fraud and enforcement criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other trends likely to affect AML and KYC include growing privacy concerns in Europe. Any development and updating of GDPR regulations will likely impact data access and data collection and storage as part of customer verification and risk assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 







 Using IDnow for automated identity verification in Germany&nbsp; 



<p>As a global leader in the identity verification industry, IDnow has been focused on improving KYC processes since 2014. To meet the recent shift to eKYC, IDnow has created a comprehensive suite of identity verification and document signing solutions to enable organizations to comply with the latest regulatory requirements, in Germany and elsewhere. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s solutions have been designed to offer fully compliant identity verification in many jurisdictions – including Germany. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/produkte/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a> was developed to be compliant with Germany’s early video-based verification regulations, while IDnow’s main product for customer onboarding and verification, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> offers full automated onboarding and verification solutions, with modular add-ons for increased functionality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AutoIdent is available with several highly regulated use cases, such as in German financial services, and with functionality including supervised video verification, use of QES, and verification of existing bank accounts, it fully meets German GWG requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While IDnow’s solutions have already received positive <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-welcomes-bundesnetzagentur-decision-and-predicts-turning-point-for-digital-identity-verification/">feedback</a> from the German regulators that do allow more automation, they are also, of course, in full use in other jurisdictions. IDnow remains committed to make the connected world a safer place and is excited and optimistic about future enhancements in German financial markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Could KYC technology finally clean up the ‘dirty money capital of the world’? IDnow investigates. 



<p>As London is one of the largest financial centers in the world, it is no surprise that the UK continues to be a progressive adopter of new innovations in AML and KYC, and a global leader in promoting corporate transparency. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, London is also known as the “dirty money capital of the world,” with good reason as the National Crime Agency believes money laundering costs the UK <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/national-economic-crime-centre-leads-push-to-identify-money-laundering-activity">over £100 billion</a> every single year. </p>



<p>Money laundering, identity fraud, and other types of financial crime pose a significant threat to the stability of not only the UK’s, but the global economy. In fact, the United Nations reports that <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">financial crime accounts for 2-5%</a> of the global GDP (around US$800 billion to US$2 trillion).</p>



<p>In a bid to prevent financial crime, regulations and AML programs are regularly updated to reflect new techniques and changes in criminal behavior. However, AML and KYC compliance is not just a legal obligation. Adhering to regulations helps protect banks and fintechs, and their customers from harm. It can even enhance the reputation and trustworthiness of an organization.</p>



 AML and KYC obligations for a financial institution or fintech in the UK&nbsp; 



<p>AML is enacted in UK law through several legal acts, principally:&nbsp;</p>



  The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.&nbsp;  The Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Regulations (2019).&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017.&nbsp;  



<p>Compliance is monitored by the government regulator, the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a> (FCA), which regulates both financial institutions and fintechs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, the FCA is regarded as one of the most open and forward-thinking regulatory bodies in the world. It adopts standard global AML procedures, regulations and coverage (largely in line with guidance from the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/">Financial Act Task Force </a>[FATF]). It has also introduced several new concepts, such as RegTech, launched a separate regulatory sandbox environment, extended regulatory coverage to cryptocurrencies, and introduced or approved several automated verification techniques.</p>



 What changes were made to the AML framework after Brexit?&nbsp; 



<p>The UK left the European Union on 31st January 2020, and the transition period ended on 31st December 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, there have been no major changes to UK AML law, as it was mostly introduced before Brexit. Regulations from the European Parliament’s Anti-Money Laundering Directives, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/financial-services/articles/fifth-anti-money-laundering-directive.html">5AMLD </a>(introduced in Europe in 2020) are fully covered by UK law, while the relevant parts of 6AMLD (introduced in Europe in 2021) were already covered by UK law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There have been some small post-Brexit changes to UK AML law though, including:&nbsp;</p>



  EU countries are now classified as “third countries”, so are treated with different risk factors.&nbsp;  The list of high-risk third countries is managed by the UK, while previously it was managed by the EU. The only EU country currently included on the EU list is Malta.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) regulates the EU-UK relationship and has several provisions for information sharing and common AML standards. This includes maintaining central registers of beneficial ownership.&nbsp;  



 How to perform KYC, AML checks as a financial institution or fintech in the UK&nbsp; 



<p>While UK laws and regulations do not prescribe the exact technologies or method of implementation, they do define the essential parts of a KYC process. In general, there are three main stages, or components:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity Verification, or the Customer Identification Program (CIP). The first step in the KYC process is to prove that the customer is who they claim to be. This includes both individual and corporate customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity verification involves collecting identity documents and checking their authenticity by ensuring the customer and document identity match. In processes that are fully or partially automated, this is increasingly taking place online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customer Due Diligence (CDD). This takes verification one step further and aims to prove whether the financial institution can trust the customer. CDD is about defining a customer’s risk level, and to what extent they can be trusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>CDD includes AML screening to check that the potential client isn’t on any sanctions or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons</a> (PEP) lists. Customer addresses can also be checked. Customers deemed to be of higher risk will undergo further checks under Enhanced Due Diligence, which can include PEP screening, checking sanctions and watchlists, and monitoring adverse media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ongoing Monitoring. AML and KYC compliance is not just about checking new customers during onboarding. Financial institutions must have a program in place for ongoing KYC checks and monitoring. This can include further sanction and PEP checking, and regular monitoring of transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 







 The rising use of automated techniques in verification&nbsp; 



<p>Increasing numbers of services have become automated in recent years, especially in the financial services sector. In fact, global consultancy firm, McKinsey &amp; Company believes that companies are now <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">seven years ahead</a> in digital transformation efforts, with the acceleration partly explained by the sudden demand caused by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AML and KYC are areas that are also rapidly changing. Although eKYC, which refers to the digitalization and automation of KYC processing, began by simply moving documentation collection and verification online, it now involves many automated processes and technologies, including video-based verification, followed by artificial intelligence-based techniques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Advanced KYC technologies include:&nbsp;</p>



  Automated validation of identity documents, including checking built-in security features&nbsp;  Biometric and liveness checks to match the user with the identity document&nbsp;  Reading and processing NFC data from cards&nbsp;  Automated AML screening checks, including PEP, sanction list checks and watchlists&nbsp;  



<p>The use of automated techniques in verification varies around the world, with regulators taking different views on whether it is acceptable. As one of the most forward-looking regulators, the FCA generally permits fully automated verification, but this view is not necessarily shared throughout Europe, where only some countries (including Belgium, France, Netherlands, and Spain) allow full automation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automation has many benefits. As it is primarily faster and more secure, it can lead to lower costs, improved customer experience, and increased conversion rates (vital for any bank or fintech). The recognition of improved security is a leading reason for its growing acceptance by the FATF and national regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What trends and challenges for KYC &amp; AML are coming up in the UK?&nbsp; 



<p>While there have been some operational changes to AML since Brexit, there has certainly been no let-up in the attempted monitoring of money laundering in the UK. Indeed, in 2021 the FCA issued <a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/fca/2021/12/20/fca-fines-increase-nearly-four-fold/">400% more fines</a> than the previous year (£577 million in total). Over half of which were for AML compliance failures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UK’s strict regulatory oversight is likely to continue, as is the trend for new techniques and applications of technology. Read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/germany-aml-kyc-regulations/">blog </a>to discover how KYC and AML solutions are playing an increasing role in tackling money laundering in Germany.</p>



<p>As technology develops, changes to regulation will also certainly follow. Many recent changes have focused on enhanced customer checking (including the concept of PEPs), corporate risk and ultimate beneficial owners, and the rising use of cryptocurrency. Future changes are likely to address the increasing use of technology in areas like customer onboarding and automated verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other trends, such as growing privacy concerns, will undoubtedly affect AML and KYC in the UK, and elsewhere. Changes to processes, data collection and storage for customer due diligence, as well as data sourcing for more advanced checks, are likely on the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Existing KYC processes will, of course, continue to develop and improve in tandem. Ongoing monitoring, for example, is already making a significant difference to AML, as monitoring and analysis becomes increasingly automated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Una soluzione unica, frutto della collaborazione tra la prima Certification Authority in Europa<br>e la società leader nei processi di KYC (Know Your Customer) in ambito bancario</p>



<p>Roma, 13 luglio 2022 – InfoCert – Tinexta Group, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea e società leader in Europa nel mercato del Digital Trust, e CRIF – azienda globale specializzata in sistemi di informazioni creditizie e di business information, analytics, servizi di outsourcing e processing nonché avanzate soluzioni in ambito digitale per lo sviluppo del business e l’open banking – annunciano di aver completato il processo di integrazione delle rispettive piattaforme tecnologiche in ambito KYC (Know Your Customer) con l’obiettivo di offrire al mercato la più evoluta soluzione per i processi di identificazione, contrattualizzazione e verifiche antiriciclaggio per l’onboarding di clienti in ambito Financial Services.</p>



<p>La progressiva digitalizzazione nel rapporto cliente-banca impone una rivisitazione dei processi di onboarding dei clienti e delle relative verifiche di compliance. Tale tendenza, accelerata negli ultimi anni dalla pandemia, è destinata a crescere ulteriormente nei prossimi anni spinta anche dalla rapida diffusione degli strumenti di identità digitale.</p>



<p>InfoCert e CRIF, entrambi leader nelle diverse fasi della catena del valore nei processi di compliance bancaria, da oggi uniscono le forze per proporre al mercato una soluzione di digital onboarding ancor più completa, integrata, secure by design e conforme a tutte le normative nazionali e comunitarie.</p>



<p>InfoCert contribuisce alla partnership con le competenze verticali, la proprietà intellettuale dei suoi 22 brevetti e la piattaforma TOP® – Trusted Onboarding Platform per l’onboarding e la contrattualizzazione remota, adottata da oltre 120 clienti in 30 paesi e con oltre 20 milioni di onboarding già completati.</p>



<p>CRIF, dal canto suo, porta in dote alla partnership le proprie avanzate competenze analitiche, il proprio ecosistema di credit &amp; business information proprietarie nonché un set di soluzioni innovative per la gestione dei processi di KYC per l’onboarding della clientela retail.</p>



<p>Tra i principali benefici derivanti dalla partnership, oltre alla semplificazione dell’offerta, va sottolineata anche la comodità di potersi affidare ad un’unica piattaforma integrata e pacchettizzata, dotata di avanzate caratteristiche di sicurezza, adatta a rispondere alle esigenze di clienti di qualsiasi dimensione. Inoltre, la piattaforma di InfoCert-CRIF è già predisposta per supportare i futuri schemi di identità Europea basati su digital wallet e credenziali di identità.</p>



<p>Danilo Cattaneo, CEO di InfoCert: “L’unione di due champion del panorama Europeo consente di offrire ai clienti, in un settore strategico come quello dei Financial Services, la possibilità di affidarsi ad una soluzione sviluppata e gestita in Italia, un fattore strategico ancora più rilevante nell’attuale momento storico: viste le elevate tensioni geopolitiche, è alto il rischio di ingerenze nelle infrastrutture critiche di un paese ad opera di soggetti con logiche gestionali e governance dei dati ubicate al di fuori dei confini nazionali o europei. ”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simone Capecchi, Executive Director di CRIF: “Questa partnership nasce dalla volontà di offrire al mercato soluzioni sempre più avanzate oltre che in linea con le recenti novità tecniche e regolamentari. Ognuno dei nostri reciproci clienti si caratterizza per un modello di business diverso, un approccio commerciale unico, una specifica visione del modo con cui si interfacciano digitalmente famiglie e imprese. Pertanto, per poter soddisfare queste esigenze, è necessario un mix di tecnologie, processi, dati e competenze in continua e costante evoluzione che solo due player come CRIF e InfoCert, con la loro consolidata esperienza sui mercati più avanzati e competitivi, possono mettere a disposizione di tutti gli operatori europei e non solo. Per noi, questa partnership tra due leader di matrice italiana, è anche un motivo di grande orgoglio, per il nostro Paese e per la nostra comunità digitale”.</p>



<p>InfoCert SpA</p>



<p>InfoCert, Tinexta Group, è la più grande Certification Authority europea, attiva in oltre trenta Paesi. La società eroga servizi di digitalizzazione, eDelivery, Firma Digitale e conservazione digitale dei documenti ed è gestore accreditato AgID dell’identità digitale nell’ambito di SPID (Sistema Pubblico per la gestione dell’Identità Digitale). InfoCert investe in modo significativo nella ricerca e sviluppo e nella qualità: detiene un significativo numero di brevetti mentre le certificazioni di qualità ISO 9001, 27001 e 20000 testimoniano l’impegno ai massimi livelli nell’erogazione dei servizi e nella gestione della sicurezza. Il Sistema di Gestione della Sicurezza delle Informazioni InfoCert è certificato ISO/IEC 27001:2013 per le attività EA:33-35. InfoCert è leader europeo nell’offerta di servizi di Digital Trust pienamente conformi ai requisiti del Regolamento eIDAS (regolamento UE 910/2014) e agli standard ETSI EN 319 401, e punta a crescere sempre di più a livello internazionale anche mediante acquisizioni: detiene il 51% di Camerfirma, una delle principali autorità di certificazione spagnole, il 60% di CertEurope certification authority leader del mercato francese e il 16,7% di Authada, Identity Provider tedesco all’avanguardia. InfoCert, infine, è proprietaria dell’80% delle azioni di Sixtema SpA, il partner tecnologico del mondo CNA, che fornisce soluzioni tecnologiche e servizi di consulenza a PMI, associazioni di categoria, intermediari finanziari, studi professionali ed enti.</p>

  <p>In an effort to cut costs, improve efficiencies, and cater for a mobile and remote workforce, businesses are adopting cloud services from multiple providers. This has created a host of challenges in managing identity and access across multiple clouds, and has introduced several risks that need to be addressed urgently.&nbsp;Join experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and ARCON as they discuss the security implications and the need for processes and controls to ensure that Identity and access are managed effectively and easily across a multi-cloud environment. They will also consider how a unified management strategy can dramatically reduce cybersecurity vulnerability in a multi-cloud environment.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at how the identity and entitlement management of multi-cloud environments is changing radically. He will also explain what security managers can do to keep on top of this change.&nbsp;Mr. Anil Bhandari, Chief Mentor at ARCON will discuss the challenges in administering and governing multiple user IDs in an ever-expanding multi-cloud world in the current context, and explain how ARCON’s Cloud Governance platform can help to overcome those challenges.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/multicloud-identity-governance"></a>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — July 4th to July&nbsp;10th  Stablecoins, Global Crypto Regulation and Demands for Stricter Frameworks in this Week’s&nbsp;Recap <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s Weekly Regulatory Recap. The crypto prices were comparatively stable last week. Yet, there was no stopping the regulatory blitzkrieg from taking shape as calls for strict regulations continued from various authorities globally. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> US Treasury Pitches a Framework for Global Crypto Regulation <p>In a move that announced the United States’ intention to lead from the front in shaping global crypto regulations, the US Treasury published a fact sheet consisting of a blueprint on how international regulators could team up to tackle the challenges presented by the growing market of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Based on US president Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto, the fact sheet aims to ensure global interoperability for better protection of crypto consumers, investors, and businesses. It also seeks to stop the use of digital assets in illicit activities, such as terrorist financing and money laundering, among other&nbsp;things.</p><p>All in all, this fact sheet will “…reinforce U.S. leadership in the global financial system.”</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/07/us-treasury-develops-framework-for-international-crypto-regulation/">https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/07/us-treasury-develops-framework-for-international-crypto-regulation/</a></p> Bank of England Demands Tough Regulations Citing $2 Trillion Drop in Global Crypto Market&nbsp;Cap <p>The $2 Trillion drop in the global crypto market cap has attracted the attention of international financial regulators, with the recent one being the Bank of&nbsp;England.</p><p>The United Kingdom’s central bank demanded stricter regulations highlighting a brutal crypto market meltdown. It noted that such a massive fall in the global market cap shines a light on the high vulnerability of crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Although the central bank agreed that the overall health of the financial market remains very much unaffected by the falling crypto prices, it went on to say that in time both sectors will become much more intertwined, which will affect the country’s financial stability. Thus, stricter regulation is the need of the&nbsp;hour.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2022-07-05/bank-of-england-crypto-crashes-show-need-for-tougher-rules">https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2022-07-05/bank-of-england-crypto-crashes-show-need-for-tougher-rules</a></p> Singapore Considers Taking Tougher Measures Against Digital Assets Amid Falling Crypto&nbsp;Prices <p>Known for being one of the most crypto-friendly countries, the Singaporean government is now compelled to act tough against the digital assets market amid a drastic fall in the crypto market&nbsp;cap.</p><p>Previously, it had barred crypto service providers from advertising in public spaces. And last week, Senior Minister and Minister in Charge of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Tharman Shanmugaratnam, said that such an unprecedented drop in crypto prices demonstrates the clear need for strict regulatory measures.</p><p>The measures may include retail trading limits and outlawing crypto leverage in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://zeenews.india.com/international-business/crypto-friendly-singapore-mulls-tougher-restrictions-amid-meltdown-2482176.html">https://zeenews.india.com/international-business/crypto-friendly-singapore-mulls-tougher-restrictions-amid-meltdown-2482176.html</a></p> UK Stablecoin Regulation is Likely to be Introduced in&nbsp;August <p>Reports indicate that the UK Treasury is collaborating with the Payments Systems Regulator, the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority, and a few more to prepare a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The legislation is likely to be introduced in&nbsp;August.</p><p>The stablecoin legislation could have been rolled out much earlier. But it was affected by the recent changes in the UK government, such as the resignation of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson &amp; Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi&nbsp;Sunak.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/uk-stablecoin-regulations-only-weeks-away-from-taking-shape-a13687a3ed6d">https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/uk-stablecoin-regulations-only-weeks-away-from-taking-shape-a13687a3ed6d</a></p><p>Although the crypto market cap was comparatively stable last week, with minimal downward pressure, regulators continue to demand stricter regulations to protect investors and the broader financial market. Thus, Virtual Asset Service Providers must prepare themselves for the uphill task of complying with a plethora of national and international crypto regulations. But before that, start complying with current digital asset regulations.</p><p>When it comes to international digital asset rules, begin with the FATF’s Travel Rule, a global piece of law that aims to put an end to the use of digital assets for terrorism financing and money laundering. And the first thing that a VASP will need to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Solution Provider.</p><p>Interestingly, we have a world-class TRSP to suggest — Veriscope! It is the only solution to the “Sunrise Issue” that almost all VASPS suffer from while complying with the Travel Rule.

 Earn by locking OCEAN and by Curating Quality&nbsp;Data  1. Overview <p>ve tokens have been introduced by several projects such as <a href="https://curve.fi/">Curve</a> and <a href="https://balancer.fi/">Balancer</a>. These tokens require users to lock project tokens in return for ve&lt;project tokens&gt;.</p><p>In exchange for locking tokens, users can earn rewards. The amount of reward depends on how long the tokens are locked for. Furthermore, veTokens can be used for voting in grants DAOs or for asset curation.</p><p>We are rolling out veOCEAN to give token holders the ability to lock OCEAN to earn yield, curate data, and vote on OceanDAO proposals.</p><p>People lock their OCEAN up to 4 years to get veOCEAN. If someone locks 1,000 OCEAN, they get 1,000 OCEAN back at the end, plus rewards along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>veOCEAN supports passive staking by default. Active staking can lead to higher&nbsp;yield.</p><p>Going forward, veOCEAN will be the main mechanism for staking OCEAN, and for curation of datasets. It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools to achieve similar benefits.</p><p>We aim to launch veOCEAN, including the DF features within 3&nbsp;months.</p><p>The rest of this article elaborates as follows. Section 2 gives design goals. Section 3 gives the veOCEAN design, and section 4 frontend mockups. Section 5 is an FAQ. Section 6 concludes. The appendix discusses Ocean pool&nbsp;risks.</p> 2. Design&nbsp;Goals <p>Ocean pools recently suffered some attacks, which illuminated their risks and the community’s related concerns. Ocean pools are getting wound down, and Data Farming paused until veOCEAN ships. The appendix has&nbsp;details.</p><p>We see this as an opportunity to make some changes! An opportunity to not only resolve the concerns about pools, but to refine the Ocean &amp; OCEAN architecture to make staking itself much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Here are the design goals for&nbsp;veOCEAN:</p>  Make staking much safer. If someone locks 1,000 OCEAN, they get 1,000 OCEAN back at the end, plus rewards along the way. Stakers can only&nbsp;gain.  Offer paths for passive and for active stakers. Some people want to just stake OCEAN in one place and be done. Others people want to engage more, for higher potential returns.  Leverage stakers to help curate datasets — staking on datasets is useful to help identify higher quality datasets but it must be&nbsp;safe.  Reconcile short- and long-term incentives — the longer someone locks their tokens, the more reward and voting power they&nbsp;get.   3. The Design:&nbsp;veOCEAN  3.1 Background <p>We’ve been exploring ve and related ideas in the background since 2021. Other candidate designs include tokenized vaults, bonding curves, and AMM varieties.</p><p>The ve pattern originated with Curve more than two years ago. Since that time, it’s become battle-tested, with millions locked, and billions transacted. Many teams have adopted the <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html">veCRV</a> model, including our friends at <a href="https://app.balancer.fi/#/vebal">Balancer</a> and <a href="https://ve.neworder.network/">New Order</a>. We’re adopting ve for&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> 3.2 Core&nbsp;Idea <p>The core idea is: stake longer for higher rewards and more voting power. A staker can be passive, though they earn more if&nbsp;active.</p>  stake OCEAN for 1 week → get 0.0048 veOCEAN = 1 / (4 *&nbsp;52)  …  stake OCEAN for 1 year → get 0.25&nbsp;veOCEAN  stake OCEAN for 2 years → get 0.50&nbsp;veOCEAN  stake OCEAN for 3 year → get 0.75&nbsp;veOCEAN  stake OCEAN for 4 years → get 1.0&nbsp;veOCEAN  <p>veOCEAN cannot be unlocked before the pre-set time. veOCEAN is non-transferable.</p><p>For OceanDAO grants, people will vote with veOCEAN. This is the “v” in&nbsp;ve.</p><p>veOCEAN holders have earnings from community fees, and from Data Farming. (The next sections give details.)</p><p>Taken together, these mechanics align near-term incentives with long-term incentives to around Ocean and&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> 3.3 Earnings from Community Fees <p>Every transaction in Ocean Market and Ocean backend generates transaction fees, some of which go to the community. 50% of the community fees will go to veOCEAN holders; the rest will go to OceanDAO grants,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>All earnings here are&nbsp;passive.</p> 3.4 Earnings from Data&nbsp;Farming <p>veOCEAN holders will get each weekly DF rewards allocation, except a small carveout for DF&nbsp;Crunch.</p><p>veOCEAN holders can be passive, though they will earn more if&nbsp;active.</p><p>“Being active” means allocating veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs). Then, rewards follow the usual DF formula: DCV * stake. But now, stake is the amount of veOCEAN allocated to the data asset, rather than liquidity in a datatoken pool. (And this stake is safe: you can’t lose your OCEAN as it is merely&nbsp;locked.)</p> 3.5 Evolution of Earnings&nbsp;Volume <p>Earnings from OPC revenue (1) is smallish in the near term but grows to be large in the longer term as DCV&nbsp;. Complementary, DF earnings (2) will be large in the near term (once the DF rewards ramp), and will shrink over time as DF rewards follow a Bitcoin-like distribution curve.</p> 3.6 Flow of&nbsp;Value <p>The image below illustrates the flow of value. On the left, at time 0, the staker locks their OCEAN into the veOCEAN contract, and receives veOCEAN. In the middle, the staker receives OCEAN rewards every time there’s revenue to the Ocean Protocol Community (top), and also as part of Data Farming rewards (bottom). On the right, when the lock expires (e.g. 4 years) then the staker is able to move their OCEAN around&nbsp;again.</p>Flow of&nbsp;value<p>The veOCEAN design is in accordance with the<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e"> Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>, which Ocean uses as its system-level design.</p><p>The veOCEAN code will be forked from the veCRV code. veCRV parameters will be the starting point. To minimize risk, tweaks will be circumspect.</p><p>This is the current design. We expect changes based on feedback from the community, and learnings during implementation.</p> 4. veOCEAN Frontend&nbsp;Mockups <p>Ocean’s Data Farming webapp will be expanded to support veOCEAN, for both veOCEAN lock/unlock and for allocating veOCEAN to data assets. The following mockups illustrate. They may change significantly before final release; we’re sharing them now to help the community understand what veOCEAN might look&nbsp;like.</p>Mockup for veOCEAN lock/unlock. Steps to lock are (1) approve (2) set amount and duration (3) commit the&nbsp;lock.Mockup for allocating veOCEAN, evolved from <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">https://df.oceandao.org</a>. 5. veOCEAN&nbsp;FAQ  5.1 Pricing&nbsp;FAQs   Q: in this scheme, can people stake on fixed-price datasets?  A: yes. They allocate their ve to datasets. Then DF rewards follow the usual DF formula: DCV * ve&nbsp;stake.  Q: does this work for other pricing&nbsp;schemes?  A: Yes, from the get-go! It doesn’t matter how data is priced, this works for all&nbsp;schemes.  Q: With pools getting wound down in Ocean Market, will fixed-price be its only pricing&nbsp;scheme?  A: For now in Ocean Market, yes. However people can price datatokens however they like, leveraging whatever DeFi tools they like. For example. do an IDO via <a href="https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-lbps">Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool</a>, ending up in an unmodified Balancer AMM. And we will continue listening to the community, to understand best where to focus our&nbsp;efforts.   5.2 Staking&nbsp;FAQs   Q: what about passive stakers — people who just want to stake in one place and be&nbsp;done?  A: Earnings are passive bey&nbsp;default  Q: what about active stakers — people who want to do extra work and get rewarded?  A: it works. Half the DF revenue to ve goes to ve stake that users can allocate. Allocate well → more&nbsp;$$   5.3 Third-Party Market&nbsp;FAQs   Q: What do you think could be the monetization / incentive options for third party dApps and Data Markets that build on top of&nbsp;OCEAN?  A: People pay fees on fixed-rate exchange and in consume. 3rd party markets can get a cut of both. More info at <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;docs</a>.  Q: Staking veOCEAN will be an important part in curating the most valuable datasets. Which earning opportunities will stakers have other than DF and fees generated from consume transactions?  A: veOCEAN holders’ earning potential via fees and DF on their own could be quite substantial, eg given that a large portion of OCEAN supply is directed towards DF. No need for more ways per se. There won’t be a fee on locking OCEAN for veOCEAN, because adding that code would have meant changes to veCRV contracts, something we’re not doing for security reasons. Re ALGA or other apps making money on facilitating veOCEAN: there are several ways, the best way to get inspiration is to look at projects on top of base ve tokens, such as <a href="https://www.convexfinance.com/">Convex</a>, <a href="https://aura.finance/">aura</a>, <a href="https://www.redactedcartel.xyz/">Redacted Cartel</a>, and&nbsp;more.   5.4 Chains   Q: Will the Market still need to be multi-chain?  A: Yes, Ocean Market still needs to be multi-chain: all the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">reasons</a> that we went multi-chain for are as valid as&nbsp;ever.  Q: Which chain will veOCEAN be deployed&nbsp;on?  A: Current plan is for veOCEAN core contracts will only be on Ethereum mainnet, and allowing to allocate veOCEAN tokens to any&nbsp;chain.  Q: Which chain should fixed price assets be deployed now in order to be ready for veOCEAN deployment and DF in 3 months&nbsp;time?  A: You can publish assets to any chain that Ocean supports.   6. How the veOCEAN design meets the&nbsp;goals  7. Conclusion <p>veOCEAN is coming. It will mean safer staking. People can earn by locking their OCEAN and by curating quality&nbsp;data.</p> Appendix: Ocean Pools Aims and&nbsp;Risks <p>Ocean V4 has three out-of-the-box approaches to pricing data: free, fixed-price, and dynamic. Each has its use cases and since datatokens are ERC20 tokens, the Ocean backend supports many pricing approaches (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/lets-talk-about-data-pricing-part-i-bbc9cf781d9f">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/value-of-data-part-two-pricing-bc6c5127e338">2</a>).</p><p>We made AMM-based pools a core feature of Ocean Market for these benefits:</p>  Dynamic pricing of data. Automatic discovery of price, based on supply and&nbsp;demand.  Staking. LPing in pools has served as the main vehicle for staking. The Ocean community really wants&nbsp;staking.  Curation. The amount of stake in a pool is an proxy signal for quality of a dataset, to help dataset discovery.  <p>Pools bring risks. First, data price in pools can have high variance, especially in low-liquidity pools. On some occasions since V4 release, LPers that added OCEAN liquidity, and removed it later were surprised to see a drop in their OCEAN. This is impermanent loss (IL). While IL is expected behavior in AMMs, it makes pools less attractive to people who simply want to stake and know that they will get back the same number of tokens as they injected.</p><p>Second, we’ve come to understand that stakers who are not consuming the data should not determine the price of the data. Ocean V3 did this; V4 solved it with one-sided staking. However, Ocean V4 staking still affected pricing: e.g. the more staked on a dataset, the harder it is to move its price. Deep liquidity is a double-edged sword.</p><p>Third, over the past weekend, a new attack vector emerged. A malicious actor found a way to drain OCEAN from pools. The actor did the sequence: (1) stake OCEAN, (2) buy datatokens, (3) unstake OCEAN, (4) sell datatokens. With amounts set just right, the attacker was able to drain a small amount of OCEAN from the pool. Repeated several times, it became a large amount. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-changes-3384fd7e113c">This blog post</a> has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Given the risks, we are winding pools down in the frontend. (They remain active at the chain level, of&nbsp;course.)</p><p>Accordingly, Data Farming will get paused. Counting has stopped on DF4 (the current round as of 12.01am today, Jul 12). All other DF4 parameters will remain the same, including the 10K of OCEAN rewards are available. Rewards will be dispensed on Jul 14, as&nbsp;planned.</p><p>DF will resume when veOCEAN launches.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> for project announcements.

This has put defenders at a disadvantage because malicious actors have increasingly made IAM solutions a primary vector of attack in their campaigns over the last several years. The best path forward for all organizations is to take a unified Identity &amp; Security approach to increase efficiency and reduce mean time to detect threats and respond on time. In this paper, we will consider the innovative methods by which CrowdStrike, a leader in Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response technologies, brings a broader security platform approach that converges and correlates threat signals across endpoints, identities, and workloads.

 What Are the Risks and Challenges of Using Passwords? 
<p>Passwords are the most common form of authentication still on the market today. And this fact makes a lot of sense. Passwords are easy to implement, low cost (on the front-end), and complementary with other authentication methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in many ways, passwords are an artifact of an older time in computing, one where users interacted with local or network machines on a much smaller scale. Modern technology, based on users engaging with dozens of accounts, is demonstrating some of the key weaknesses of password-based authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these fall into recognizable categories:</p>
 
 Social Engineering: Phishing is one of the most prevalent forms of cyberattacks globally, counting on the fact that people will fall for official-looking communications. The success of these attacks also relies on the reality that passwords are completely compromised once given away, and it only takes a few minutes to lose control of an account or a system. 
 Database Theft: Passwords need to be stored somewhere. That “somewhere” is usually a central database—a database that has a huge target on it, depending on its owner. Once a database is hacked, even encrypted passwords will eventually be compromised.&nbsp; 
 Lack of Identity Proofing: Passwords are a form of authentication that cannot guarantee the user’s presence. This means that whoever has the password will be considered authentic no matter where they are. Identity proofing and assurance are impossible with passwords alone.&nbsp; 
 User Experience and Bad Cyber Hygiene: One or two passwords are manageable. Dozens, perhaps a hundred, are not. To help users juggle these passwords, they often avoid following best password practices, like creating long, complex passphrases and using unique phrases for every platform. This leaves them vulnerable to brute-force attacks and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-spraying/">password spraying</a>. 
 
<p>So, while passwords are common, and there are ways to make better use of them, they also have some fundamental flaws across security, usability, and flexibility for compliance.&nbsp;</p>
 
 What Are Alternatives to Passwords? 
<p>Unsurprisingly, enterprise businesses will often provide complete alternatives to single-password authentication systems. Replacing passwords as the only solution for authentication doesn’t just protect the end user, it protects the company as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the more common forms of password alternatives include the following:</p>
 
 Personal Identification Numbers 
<p>Sometimes companies will call for a PIN alongside a password, essentially asking for two different forms of password-like identification. Typically, you won’t find an organization fully replacing passwords with PINs because, by and large, they serve the same purpose and introduce the same risks.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Multi-Factor Authentication 
<p>Multi-factor authentication uses two or more forms of different authentication. By calling for multiple forms of identity verification, the system can assure that both the author is who they say they are and that their credentials haven’t been stolen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For MFA to work, however, the authentication process must include two or more different types of credentials:</p>
 
 Knowledge: The user proves that they know something, like a password or PIN.<br>
 
 Ownership: The user confirms that they own or hold something, like a mobile device or email account.<br>
 
 Inherence: The user proves that they are someone through biometric evidence from their body or behavior.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By combining two or more of these categories, a system can reduce the risk of fraud or identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some common forms of MFA, including the most common two-factor authentication systems, will use passwords in combination with one of the following items:</p>
 
 One-time passwords: OTPs are delivered at the point of authentication, automatically generated by the system and sent to a location that only the user should have access to (ownership). These locations can include an email, SMS text, or automatically generating OTP through a mobile verification app.&nbsp; 
 Biometrics: Several biometrics categories (see below) serve as verification of “inherence.” 
 Geolocation: Some modern authentication methods will check a badge or mobile device for location and only allow authentication based on proximity to a physical space, like an office.&nbsp; 
 Physical Keys: Physical authentication devices differ from OTPs in that they can provide additional security based on cryptography while still serving as proof of ownership. These work well when a very close physical proximity to a device or security measure.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 Biometrics 
<p>Biometrics is the most rapidly expanding form of authentication on the market, mainly due to the proliferation of devices that can collect biometric data quickly. Biometrics are also popular because they are tough to fake—while some biometric information can be spoofed, it’s much more difficult to do than, say, stealing a password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometrics also short-circuit some of the weaker aspects of passwords, specifically that most biometrics require some sort of physical presence and reduce the threat of phishing attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some common forms of biometric authentication include the following:</p>
 
 Fingerprint Scan: Many smartphones, tablets, and workstations include the option for fingerprint scanners. While not 100% unique across the entire human population over time, fingerprints are still remarkably useful alongside or as a replacement for passwords.&nbsp; 
 Facial Recognition: Many modern devices, including camera-enabled computers, can perform facial scans, which are surprisingly unique when factoring in the size, shape and location of every piece involved (hair, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, etc.).&nbsp; 
 Iris Scan: Like facial recognition, iris scans use camera-enabled devices to scan the shape and contours of the iris, a part of the body that is as unique as, if not more than, a fingerprint.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;Voice Verification: Voice analysis was much easier to falsify than a facial scan. However, modern advancements in voice recognition with AI have made voice verification a viable tool for MFA solutions.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Single Sign-On (SSO) 
<p>The challenges of multiple passwords across multiple apps and platforms are monumental. Approaches to managing the complexity of this situation have led to solutions like federated identity, a practice of using a central identity and an authentication manager to log in to multiple platforms. The central organization does not broadcast password information. Instead, external partner sites will send assurance requests to that provider, and when approved, allow the user to authenticate using that set of credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a critical step in reducing the problem of weak passwords or password theft compromising multiple systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A smaller version of this, SSO, uses federated identity for authentication within a single domain. So, for example, while broad providers like Google can help authenticate against a wide range of apps, an SSO solution would do the same for all your accounts tied to your job (cloud apps, HR solutions, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>The rules, or governance, of a verifiable credential ecosystem dictate which participants are allowed in a given ecosystem and therefore, who can be trusted. With Trinsic’s Trust Registry Service, ecosystem governance is implemented and configured directly through the Trinsic SDK. This means our customers do not have to build a unique technical solution to solve governance in their ecosystem. It comes baked into our platform with interoperability guarantees, saving you time and resources. Below, we explain what a trust registry is and show what it looks like in action.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Fighting bad actors 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>One of the recurring questions we get at Trinsic is: As a verifier, how do I know that the issuer of a credential is trustworthy? Similar to how anyone could create a fake ID in the physical world, anyone could create a fake or unauthorized verifiable credential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This risk can be managed when verifiers only need to keep track of a few issuers. Those few issuers sign their public DIDs onto the credentials they issue, and those DIDs signify to the verifier that the credentials indeed came from the appropriate issuer. However, when a credential can be issued by hundreds or even thousands of issuers, it is not realistic to expect all verifiers in an ecosystem to maintain their own list of approved issuers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, imagine you are hiring from your local university—simple. But what if you got 100 job applicants from 100 different universities? How would you know which universities were reputable, let alone which were legitimate? Talk about a logistical nightmare.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Introducing trust registries 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>This is where a trust registry comes in. A trust registry is an approved list of issuers and verifiers that are authorized to issue/verify certain credentials in a verifiable credential ecosystem. Trust registries are created and maintained by an ecosystem’s governing authority, who is most often the ecosystem provider.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
									
																					In addition to creating the credential templates and the verification policies for a verifiable credential ecosystem, an ecosystem’s provider creates and maintains a trust registry—an approved list of authorized issuers for the ecosystem.
										
								 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>When a trust registry is in place for an ecosystem, verifiers no longer need to manage a list of valid issuers. They just need to trust one provider who manages the trust registry. If a credential does not come from one of the authorized issuers listed in the trust registry, the verification will be unsuccessful.</p><p><br>Simply put, a trust registry has the following characteristics:<br><br></p>  Adds issuers and verifiers and assigns the credential templates they’re allowed to issue/verify  Allows verifiers to query the registry and check if issuers are allowed to issue certain types of credentials  <p><br>Overall, trust registries are one of the important ways we are helping our customers solve governance concerns in their verifiable credential ecosystems. The video below is a short demo of Trinsic’s Trust Registry Service.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The importance of interoperability  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Trust registries also need to be interoperable. The <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> has a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-tf">specification</a>&nbsp;for an interoperable trust registry, and ours is the first implementation of this spec. Because of this, Trinsic’s Trust Registry Service is architected so that one ecosystem could reference or incorporate a trust registry from a separate ecosystem if needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, imagine you are a software vendor whose verifiable credential product is used by all the major universities in the U.S.. Since your product is powered by Trinsic, you have your own trust registry for your ecosystem. However, let’s say the U.S. university accreditation body all of a sudden decided they wanted to adopt the Trust Over IP Framework and create their own trust registry. Since Trinsic’s Trust Registry Service is based on the interoperable trust registry specification, you could seamlessly incorporate their trust registry into yours. Additionally, other software vendors that work with universities and related organizations may want to incorporate your trust registry. They could easily do so as well.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The future of trust registries 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>We are still in the early days of verifiable credential adoption, so we know that the role of trust registries will only expand as the number of verifiable credential ecosystems grow and the need for cross-ecosystem interoperability is necessary. Despite the ever-involving best practices around governance in verifiable credential ecosystems, you can rest assured that Trinsic’s SDK will include the necessary tools like trust registries, so you can spend less time thinking about how to implement governance and more time building your identity solution.

<p>Fake social accounts negatively impact users’ trust in social media platforms. Many times, users are forced to ignore or reject genuine connections because of the inherent inability to verify a connection’s personal data. Further, this has dented the trust in social media platforms. Predatory behavior, scams, fake news, and more problems are the result of such fake social accounts, so it’s a pressing problem that each of us can relate&nbsp;to.</p><p>So, how do we address this problem of fake social accounts? Is it possible to create a social platform with only genuine&nbsp;users?</p><p>At LemmaTree, we asked these questions to our interns — brilliant minds who were welcomed under our inaugural Internship Program.</p><p>This ideathon was specially designed as an exciting challenge for the Singapore interns and centered around trusted data. Here are some of the incredible solutions that the five teams came up&nbsp;with.</p><p>Group #1: Team&nbsp;Podium</p><p>Team Podium divided the problem into three distinct processes, namely, account creation, account maintenance, and user behavior, and produced a solution for each. They also crafted a module to eliminate fake news and false information on the news feed. The team understood the potential limitations of their proposed solutions and presented ways to address them, making their solution a well-thought-out one that spanned across different aspects of prominent social media platforms.</p><p>Team #2:&nbsp;Ups</p><p>The team had a noble idea of addressing predatory behavior commonly seen on social media which not only reduces the trust among users, but could cause permanent trauma to&nbsp;minors.</p><p>To address this behavior and to enhance the trust and safety of other users, the Ups Team proposed a VC-based solution to verify personal information and an API that should effectively filter inappropriate messages sent on social media. Both solutions would combine to enhance social networks to penalize users with malicious intent and safeguard users from predators, resulting in the strengthening of trusted connections on such platforms.</p><p>Team #3:&nbsp;Reliabae</p><p>As the name perfectly reflects it, Reliabae is the solution by the team that seeks to address the trust and reliability issues in online dating applications, returning reliability of the applications to users looking for genuine connections. Reliable is a VC-based dating app that eliminates fake accounts and identities using a two-pronged approach — incorporating APIs to fetch verified data and the use of deep neural networks for image recognition.</p><p>Team #4: Super&nbsp;Identity</p><p>Also looking to solve the challenge of fake accounts on dating applications is Team #4. And they’re doing it through their super solution, Super Identity. It is a Single Sign-On (SSO) application that provides an easy and secure way for users to verify their identity on social media. One of the key highlights of Super Identity is that it is scalable and can be used on other social media platforms beyond the dating&nbsp;scene.</p><p>Team #5:&nbsp;Protego</p><p>Team #5’s Protego is a community-based social media application, which requires users to verify their identity to access the full set of features on the platform, and helped to eliminate fake news using an NLP model. Users can request for Verifiable Credentials from trusted organizations like schools and institutions. The solution proposed by the team also had an elaborate timeline which showcased the thoroughness of the team in ensuring this solution’s success from&nbsp;launch.</p><p>All five solutions were well presented to the judge — Duy Dang, the Head of Engineering of Trustana, one of the entities under LemmaTree. Duy gave great advice and comments to the teams based on the judging criteria provided:</p>  Creativity and usability of the solution.  Does the solution leverage the concept of trusted&nbsp;data?  Were Lemmatree employees’ opinions incorporated into the solution?  Quality of presentation  Bonus: Practicality of the&nbsp;Solution  <p>In all, these solutions provide a glimpse into the power of trusted data and the limitless possibilities of what you can do with trusted data. We would like to thank all participants of the ideathon and we’re excited to see some of these solutions getting launched in the near&nbsp;future!</p><p>If you’d like to talk about specific use -cases or learn more about creating and using trusted data, reach out to&nbsp;us.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/interns-ideathon-solutions-to-build-trusted-social-connections-501b2404b6c7">Interns’ Ideathon: Solutions to Build Trusted Social Connections</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2022/06/192510-digital-identity-platform-unstoppable-domains-city-of-miami-providing-web3-education/">City of Miami Providing Web3 Education</a><br>Miami recently hosted “Miami for Everyone,” a three-day event on Web3 hosted by Miami Dade College. Unstoppable Domains, an NFT domain provider, partnered with the city of Miami to put on the event, with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez commenting that the goal was to&nbsp; “make Miami the ‘capital of capital’ with an economy that focuses on innovation, technology, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.” The event was focused on NFTs, with attendees being “taught how NFT domains can act as their digital identity, unlocking exciting opportunities across Web3,” said Sandy Carter, SVP and head of business development at Unstoppable Domains.</p>
<p>While many&nbsp; similar events offer workshops for people of different skill levels, Miami for Everyone took it a step further by including all ages and providing Spanish language versions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202206/economic-identity-are-digital-id-schemes-a-road-to-hell-asks-human-rights-report">‘Economic identity’: are digital ID schemes a ‘road to Hell?’ asks human rights report</a><br>Biometric Update draws our attention to a new report by the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, which comes in the wake of ID4Africa and raises concerns about some of the current trends in digital identity. Notably, rather than recognizing individuals’ rights via legal ID, digital ID campaigns “focus on fueling digital transactions and transforming individuals into traceable data.” Delegates to the conference, held this year in Marrakech, said that digital ID providers often “ignore the ability of identification systems to recognize not only that an individual is unique, but that they have a legal status with associated rights.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/dcms-publishes-beta-of-digital-identities-and-trust-framework/">DCMS publishes digital identities and trust beta framework </a></p>
<p>UK Authority, a publication that covers public sector use of digital data and technology in the United Kingdom, looks at some recent updates to the 2021 digital identities and trust framework by the UK government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS).</p>
<p>As described by the report from the UK DCMS, “The trust framework aims to make it easier and more secure for people to use services that enable them to prove who they are or information about themselves. It is a set of rules for organizations to follow if they want to provide secure and trustworthy digital identity and/or attribute solutions.”</p>
<p>Feedback from over 250 organizations has lead to some key changes from the alpha version released in 2021, include the addition of sub-roles for the three broad type roles that providers could play – identity, attribute and orchestration services to address concerns by service providers that they did not fit in the original three categories, as well as including a requirement that biometric technologies be held to an industry standard.</p>
<p>The UK authority added that policy development lead official for the program, George Muskat, was interviewed at the Think Digital Identity for Government conference, commenting that there are four areas they are focusing on for further policy development, the user agreement, ensuring that certifiers meet key principles, assessing risk from non-certified providers, and fraud management.</p>
<p>The original report is detailed and thoughtful and can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version#introduction">here&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>What is the future of biometrics, and are there opportunities for my business to become more secure through biometric authentication? Keep reading to find out.</p>
<p>What is the future of biometrics?</p>
<p>The future of biometrics will be adding facial, voice, or other types of biometric authentication to security for accessing sensitive data at work, applying for a bank loan, or using money management systems.</p>
 
 What Are Biometrics? 
<p>Biometric authentication is the use of physical characteristics to verify a user’s identity for authentication and authorization. Biometric authentication systems collect and store different physical characteristics in templates that can be used to verify users.</p>
<p>Biometrics are a rapidly expanding and reliable form of authentication because physical characteristics are, for the most part, much more difficult to falsify than passwords or PINs. Additionally, the ubiquitous implementation of biometric scanners on popular consumer devices (smartphones, tablets, and workstations) has made that much easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easy deployment, ready adoption, and increased security have made biometrics a major part of modern cybersecurity. Additionally, this increased focus on biometrics has resulted in continued innovation in several different areas of biometrics. New types of scanners, new software, and new AI have promoted various types of biometrics, including the following:</p>
 
 Fingerprints: Fingerprint scanners are common on workstations and mobile devices because fingerprints are unique. Likewise, modern computers and laptops often employ fingerprints as a baseline identity verification mechanism if not using other biometrics.&nbsp; 
 Iris Signature: The human iris features are considered equally unique, if not more than to fingerprints. Modern cameras on mobile devices can scan the iris for identity verification.&nbsp; 
 Facial Recognition: Much like iris scans, facial recognition scans use cameras on mobile devices or computers to match facial features (nose, eyes, ears, mouth, etc.) as a biometric fingerprint for identity verification.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In terms of security, facial and iris scans are somewhat more secure overall than fingerprints, if for no other reason than it’s much harder to fake a face (in theory at least—see our discussion on the challenges of biometrics later in this article).&nbsp;</p>
 
 Voice Recognition: <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-voice-authentication/">Voice recognition</a> has often been marginalized due to the relative ease by which a hacker could spoof a voice through a voice modulator. Modern AI, however, has strengthened voice recognition such that it has become a viable form of biometric authentication for select sensitive systems.&nbsp; 
 Handwriting Recognition: With the addition of document verification systems into security and privacy, handwriting recognition is an essential form of behavioral biometrics. While handwriting can often be faked by practiced forgers, matching handwriting on file against official documents is still a viable security measure in human-managed document verification.<br>
 
 Vascular Recognition: Some innovative sensors can record and identify vein patterns from different body parts using IR light. This form of biometrics overlaps with iris scans in that they both look for vein patterns as part of their operation.&nbsp; 
 
 
 What Are Future Trends in Biometrics? 
<p>While biometric authentication methods are becoming more common across consumer and enterprise systems, new forms of fraud prevention and advanced biometric approaches are filling in the gap for systems that call for higher levels of reliability and security.</p>
<p>Some of the future trends for <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-biometric-authentication/">biometric authentication</a> include the following:</p>
 
 Physical Identity Verification: The expansion of AI-driven biometrics, particularly facial and behavioral biometrics (gait, voice, and accent recognition), will fuel new forms of real-time <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-biometric-id/">biometric identity</a> verification through on-premises cameras.&nbsp; 
 Advanced Biometric Authentication: While there are reliable forms of biometrics and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/biometric-authentication/biometric-password">biometric passwords</a> in the market now, new technologies are focusing on drawing even more advanced biometric markers from the body, each providing another hard-to-fake marker to use for secure authentication. These can include odor recognition, heartbeat pattern recognition, hand geometry, and DNA signature reading. 
 Identity Proofing: One of the strengths of biometric authentication is the assumption that the user must be physically present to provide biometric data. Even stronger measures, like live identity verification or AI-driven video identity verification, layer additional “liveness” testing into the processes to thwart emerging forms of identity fraud.<br>
 
 Continuous Authentication: Authentication usually happens once, during login, or multiple times based on user access to different resources. Continuous authentication uses behavioral patterns or other markers to maintain authentication to guarantee continued user verification over time periodically.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These trends aren’t emerging in isolation: advanced biometrics drive innovation on continuous authentication, while identity proofing is fueling more advanced physical identity verification in areas like high-security compliance standards.&nbsp;</p>
 
 What Are the Challenges of Modern Biometrics? 
<p>While the future of biometric authentication looks bright, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t any speed bumps. Modern security methods will always introduce new threats, new problems, and new ideas to challenge new systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the common threats that we see arising include the following:</p>
 
 Physical Spoofing: One of the bigger challenges for image-based biometrics (facial scans, etc.) is using artificial methods to fool these systems. For example, a hacker may attempt to use the photograph of a user in place of that actual user to cheat the authentication system.<br>
While AI is playing a significant role in mitigating these challenges, physical spoofing of biometrics like faces, fingerprints, and even iris patterns have been proven, in controlled situations, to bypass even high-level biometric authentication systems.&nbsp; 
 Deepfakes: Modern AI is also fueling attack vectors like deepfakes. A deepfake is a faked video of an individual or event that has been modified to look shockingly real, particularly to the human eye. Deepfake videos combine advanced video-editing techniques and voice spoofing to create nearly real videos showing a famous figure saying something shocking or illegal. 
 
<p>The social impact of these deepfakes are apparent. However, the technical and security impact is also a huge problem. Deepfaked videos can be used to trick facial recognition tools or even video-driven identity proofing and liveness checks.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Civil and Legal Accountability: Modern biometrics can present a significant ethical issue depending on the information they gather. For example, a user may feel unease working with a system that constantly monitors typing patterns or their facial features for continuous authentication purposes.&nbsp; 
 
<p>New laws are coming into focus, at international, national, and local levels, to address these issues. Like the European Union, some jurisdictions are quickly moving to implement consumer-focused laws to protect end users from unlawful and unethical data-gathering processes. Many states in the Unitd States (like California) are moving quickly to follow the lead of the EU.</p>

Photo courtesy: Jernej Furman via Flickr (<a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/uk-regulate-stablecoins-payments-crypto-hub-push/">Source&nbsp;here</a>) Stablecoin regulations are expected to be introduced as early as&nbsp;August. <blockquote>Key Takeaways:</blockquote><blockquote>- The UK government will likely introduce legislation to create a stablecoin regulatory framework in&nbsp;August.</blockquote><blockquote>- The Bank of England (BoE), the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and a couple of more regulators are working together on stablecoin regulation.</blockquote><blockquote>- In April 2022, the UK Treasury said that the stablecoins would be regulated under the 2017 Payment Service Regulations, the 2011 Electronic Money Regulations Act, and Financial Services&nbsp;Act.</blockquote><p>Recent reports indicate that the UK Treasury is working on legislation to introduce a regulatory framework around stablecoins in partnership with the Bank of England (BoE), the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and a few more regulators. Stablecoin regulations are expected to be introduced as early as&nbsp;August.</p><p>The stablecoin regulatory framework could have come even earlier, but recent changes in the government, including the resignations of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, may have set back the planned schedule. Deputy BoE Governor Jon Cunliffe also confirmed the same at Qatar Centre for Global Banking and Finance’s annual conference, where he said that the plans on stablecoin regulations were delayed due to “recent&nbsp;events.”</p> Earlier Consultation on Stablecoin Regulations <p>The talks around stablecoin regulations began in the UK government circles in April 2022, with a consultation taking place in the same month. During the consultation, the Treasury said that the government is contemplating regulating stablecoins as a means of payment under the 2017 Payment Service Regulations, the 2011 Electronic Money Regulations Act, and Financial Services&nbsp;Act.</p> Global Standard on Stablecoin Payment is&nbsp;Next? <p>While speaking at Qatar Centre for Global Banking and Finance’s annual conference, BoE Governor Jon Cunliffe also said that the international panel known as Payments and Markets Infrastructure Committee, which he heads, will begin working on a global standard for stablecoin payments in the next few&nbsp;months.</p><p>The key topics that the panel will discuss include which asset types will be allowed for backing stablecoins, their redemption process, and the mechanism to test the safety and stability of stablecoins.</p><p>The current crypto market downturn, which saw the global digital assets market cap drop below one trillion dollars from three trillion dollars, has led to a worldwide consensus that digital assets could no longer be allowed to operate without regulatory oversight. Thus, we are seeing news about various countries regulating crypto-assets one after the other. This makes one thing clear. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must prepare to comply with a plethora of regulations at the country and global&nbsp;levels.</p><p>And when it comes to international crypto regulations, the FATF’s Travel Rule comes at the top, as it is already in implementation in 11 countries, with many more in the line to implement it. So, VASPs must start preparing to comply with the Travel Rule even if the country they are based in hasn’t implemented it yet. After all, with the FATF urging countries to speed up Travel Rule adoption, the day is not far when all nations will be on the same page in enforcing this global crypto-focused law.</p><p>The first thing that VASPs will require to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution Provider (TRSP). And we have the best solution available in the market — Veriscope! It is also the only solution to the much-dreaded “Sunrise Issue” that VASPs encounter while implementing the Travel Rule.

			 A Special Trip for a Special Team 
<p>Happy July! We are already halfway through the year, and I hope that you’ve been able to begin planning (or begin enjoying) your summer holidays.</p>
<p>This newsletter is a bit different and a bit more special than previous ones, as I want to tell you about&nbsp;Tokeny’s recent team building event that happened earlier this month in Barcelona.</p>
<p>As you know, the Tokeny team hails from around the world working in various countries remotely. We have colleagues from 16 nationalities and counting, with different experiences, cultures, and personalities that help make Tokeny the unique company that it is. Although we function very well remotely, it is important that we take the time to meet up in person to share, learn, and enjoy our time as a collective unit.</p>
 Why teambuilding is so important 
<p>Team building is crucial in any company, as it creates a moment where colleagues can&nbsp;shift their focus from their daily work objectives to a collective focus on the team itself. These activities bolster our motivation and provide opportunities that allow us to reconfirm our objectives and professional goals as members of Tokeny. And, of course, it gives us time to take part in fun activities both during and after the workday.</p>
<p>These activities are even more important for remote companies, as it is rare to have interpersonal interactions in this setup. Team building for remote teams, especially in a beautiful city like Barcelona, creates excitement and a more relaxed environment where we can express ourselves and communicate in a more enjoyable way. I strongly believe that remote work has boosted our productivity, but let’s face it: Brainstorms and chit-chats are extremely hard and boring via video calls.</p>
 An intensive program that united our team forever 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Throughout the three days, we took part in many activities which gave us better insight into our company goals – both long and short term – and a chance to form stronger bonds with each other.</p>
<p>When we arrived Sunday evening, it was immediately clear how excited we were to be a part of this trip. For many of us, it was the first time we saw not just new people from the company, but many people within Tokeny’s team.</p>
<p>Some of our activities on Monday and Tuesday brought us together to further strengthen our company vision and objectives. They included our monthly “CEO Talk”, a Ted Talk-style presentation called&nbsp;“Tedkeny”, and collaborative team building exercises.</p>
<p>We also wanted to create lasting memories together for each of us as a collective group. We all went on a catamaran in the early evening and sang karaoke at night which let us all bond with one another and discover some hidden skills.</p>
<p>As we gave our goodbyes Tuesday afternoon, we realized how splendid the team building trip was. Even though we all go back to our homes in different parts of the world, we each felt a bit closer together in our relationships and Tokeny’s vision for the future as we departed.</p>
 Final Thoughts 
<p>The excitement we had in seeing each other was truly remarkable. As our company grows in stature, so do we grow in numbers.&nbsp;Since January, our team has almost doubled in size. We could all feel the communal sense that we know our company and products are very unique, and as we continue to push forward, we will achieve our goals and overcome any obstacles in our way.</p>
<p>I would like to give a very warm thank you to the whole team for being part of our journey and showing everyday that we can push finance and blockchain further. Also, a special thank you to Ivie Satijn and Radka Tocikova for their incredible work in preparing this event. Finally, thank you to our Customers and Partners for the trust you put in our team.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity and payment provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=Nuggets">Nuggets</a> is piloting its Verified Self-Sovereign Digital ID solution with the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/global-assured-identity-network-gain">Global Assured Identity Network</a> (GAIN), a grouping of 150 financial institutions striving for globally interoperable digital identity mechanism for individuals and businesses. Nuggets’ approach requires both parties in every transaction to be verified via open standards, and has an eye to the metaverse.</p><p>Nuggets’ Verified Self-Sovereign Digital ID uses open standards such as W3C verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), zero-knowledge proofs and the encrypted communication standards of&nbsp;<a href="https://didcomm.org/">DIDComm</a>.</p><p>Both the originator and recipient of a transaction made within the GAIN pilot, whether for money or digital assets, would be required to be verified for the transaction.</p><p>During the transaction, the user’s identity is established through the creation of a unique Peer Decentralized Identifier (PeerDID). The verifiable credentials involved support selective disclosure. The transaction also uses zero-knowledge proofs. This means information supplied can remain anonymous while the users can also prove who they say they are without giving away any of their personally identifiable information.</p><p>As the use of DIDs as a digital identity standard becomes more widespread, Nuggets hopes its SSI service will be interoperable with solutions and could be used to combat ID fraud risks in the metaverse.</p><p>“For too long now business has relied on usernames, passwords and devices as the gateway of confidence to ensure authentication, leading to fraud and misuse,” comments Alastair Johnson, <a href="https://nuggets.life/founders.html">founder</a> and CEO of&nbsp;Nuggets.</p><p>“Securely engaging in the digital economy requires a user-owned and controlled ID solution that cryptographically proves everything from access to services to trusted transactions. It needs to be reusable, verifiable, portable, private and secure. It’s an important recognition that GAIN has ensured that self-sovereign identity will be a part of this moving forward.”</p><p>GAIN is currently undergoing consultation on its <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202111/gain-readies-for-december-launch-of-poc-group-for-digital-identity-interoperability">development and role</a> as financial institutions continue to&nbsp;join.</p><p>“GAIN and Nuggets share a duty to protect users from financial crime and uphold the law. By leveraging our user-centric and high-trust identity paradigm, financial institutions can satisfy adherence to global regulation while upholding the sanctity of user privacy,” Johnson&nbsp;added.</p><p>Nuggets was included in a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202101/nuggets-self-sovereign-digital-id-chosen-for-accenture-fintech-accelerator">fintech accelerator program</a> run by Accenture in early 2021 and during the pandemic launched a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202005/nuggets-brings-biometrics-to-delivery-confirmation-as-industry-offers-solutions-for-new-working-normal">biometric delivery verification service</a> to reduce fraud costs for ecommerce.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/nuggets-goes-global-with-pilot-of-its-self-sovereign-digital-id-platform-in-gain-fe21da637f47">Nuggets goes global with pilot of its self-sovereign digital ID platform in GAIN</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>In this tutorial, you’ll use JHipster to build a microservice stack and deploy it to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The microservices will use Java and Spring Boot for resource servers and Vue for the frontend. The server-side applications will use Spring’s Reactive technology stack. The microservice will include multiple databases and database types: PostgresSQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. You’ll secure the service using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC), with Okta as the OIDC provider. With Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code>, you’ll encrypt all of the secrets in the project configuration files. To generate the project, you’ll use JHipster CLI and the JHipster Domain Language (JDL).</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>Before you get started, install the required software listed below. You’ll need to sign up for an Amazon Web Services account and a free Okta account (which you will be able to sign up for later using the Okta CLI). The Kubernetes cluster required to finish this tutorial does not qualify for free tier on AWS. However, if you are careful about stopping and deleting the cluster when not actively working on the tutorial, the cost should be very small, only a few dollars.</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a>: you’ll need to have Docker Engine installed. 
   <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>: you’ll need a Docker Hub account to host the Docker images so that EKS can pull them. 
   <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11</a>: this tutorial requires Java 11. If you need to manage multiple Java versions, SDKMAN! is a good solution. Check out <a href="https://sdkman.io/install">their docs to install it</a>. 
   <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/">JHipster CLI</a>: you’ll use the JHipster CLI to bootstrap the application. To install with <code>npm</code> just use <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster</code> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI</a>: you’ll use Okta to add security to the microservice network. You can register for a free account from the CLI. 
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">Amazon Web Services</a>: sign up for an AWS account. 
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a>: Amazon Web Service CLI 
   <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl">eksctl</a>: you’ll use <code>eksctl</code> to create your cluster on EKS 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a>: CLI to manage Kubernetes clusters. As of the time I was writing this tutorial, there was a bug in <code>kubectl</code> version 1.24 that results in an “invalid apiVersion” error. You can avoid this error by installing version 1.23.6. 
 

<p>For more info on the <code>kubectl</code> error, see <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/6920">this issue</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>The error looks like this:</p>

 <code>2022-05-31 18:56:08 [✖]  parsing kubectl version string  (upstream error: error: exec plugin: invalid apiVersion "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
) / "0.0.0": Version string empty
</code> 

<p>On Linux, to install version 1.23.6, you can use the following commands.</p>

   <code>curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.23.6/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
</code>   

<p>For Windows and Mac, there are instructions on how to install specific versions on the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubernetes docs pages</a>.</p>

<p>Just so you have a general idea of what you’re going to do, the basic steps in this tutorial are:</p>

 
   Generate the microservice applications and Kubernetes descriptor files using JHipster 
   Build the apps and push the Docker images to Docker Hub 
   Configure the services to use Okta for OIDC authentication 
   Create an Amazon EKS cluster 
   Deploy the microservice stack to EKS (which will pull your Docker images and deploy them to AWS EKS) 
   Test the app 
 

 Generate the application using the JHipster generator 

<p>The JHipster generator makes it easy to bootstrap complex applications, including microservices with multiple services and domain models. You can read more about it in <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-app/">the JHipster docs</a>. In this tutorial, you are going to create a microservice using the JHipster Domain Language.</p>

<p>This will generate a microservice with four services:</p>

 
   JHipster registry 
   JHipster API gateway 
   Store 
   Blog 
 

<p>When you look at the DSL below, you might notice that there isn’t a registry application listed. The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster registry</a> is a standard application in the JHipster microservice stack that doesn’t need to be defined. It includes a Eureka server and a Spring Cloud Config server. The Eureka server is a <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/reference/html/">Spring Cloud Netflix</a> service discovery registry that allows services to find each other on the network. The <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/">Spring Cloud Config</a> server allows the centralization of service configuration. You’ll use it to centralize the Okta OAuth 2.0 and OIDC configuration, among other things, allowing you to configure all of the services to use the same OIDC application from the same configuration point.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/api-gateway/">JHipster API gateway</a> is the front-facing, public face of the application. It has a Vue front-end and a PostgresSQL database backend. The gateway also includes features like load balancing and circuit breaking. Public requests to the service go through the gateway.</p>

<p>The store and blog applications are backend resource servers with MongoDB and Neo4j databases (respectively).</p>

<p>Create a file called <code>app.jdl</code> in the root directory for the project. Paste the contents below into the file. You need to add your docker repository name at the bottom in place of the placeholder <code>{your-docker-repository-name}</code>.</p>

   <code>application {
  config {
    baseName gateway
    reactive true
    packageName com.okta.developer.gateway
    applicationType gateway
    authenticationType oauth2
    buildTool gradle

    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
  }

}

entity Blog {
  name String required minlength(3)
  handle String required minlength(2)
}

entity Post {
  title String required
  content TextBlob required
  date Instant required
}

entity Tag {
  name String required minlength(2)
}

entity Product {
  title String required
  price BigDecimal required min(0)
  image ImageBlob
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  Blog{user(login)} to User
  Post{blog(name)} to Blog
}

relationship ManyToMany {
  Post{tag(name)} to Tag{post}
}

paginate Post, Tag with infinite-scroll
paginate Product with pagination

microservice Product with store
microservice Blog, Post, Tag with blog

deployment {
  deploymentType kubernetes
  appsFolders [gateway, blog, store]
  dockerRepositoryName "{your-docker-repository-name}"
  kubernetesNamespace demo
  serviceDiscoveryType eureka
  kubernetesServiceType LoadBalancer
}
</code>   

<p>From the root project directory, run the generator.</p>

   <code>jhipster jdl app.jdl
</code>   

<p>This will probably take a minute or so to complete.</p>

<p>It should end with something like the following output.</p>

 <code>...

INFO! Alternatively, you can use Jib to build and push image directly to a remote registry:
  ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/gateway in /home/andrewcarterhughes/Development/okta/2022/aws-kubernetes/gateway
  ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/blog in /home/andrewcarterhughes/Development/okta/2022/aws-kubernetes/blog
  ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/store in /home/andrewcarterhughes/Development/okta/2022/aws-kubernetes/store

You can deploy all your apps by running the following kubectl command:
  bash kubectl-apply.sh -f

[OR]

If you want to use kustomize configuration, then run the following command:
  bash kubectl-apply.sh -k

Use these commands to find your application's IP addresses:
  kubectl get svc gateway -n demo

INFO! Generator kubernetes succeed
Congratulations, JHipster execution is complete!

</code> 

<p>If you look at the directories in your root project, you’ll see four subdirectories.</p>

   <code>├── blog
├── gateway
├── kubernetes
└── store
</code>   

<p>Three of the directories are the application projects for your services: blog, store, and gateway. Remember that the registry uses a stock image, so it doesn’t need a local project. The fourth directory, kubernetes, holds the descriptor files for the kubernetes deployments (YAML files that tell Kubernetes how to deploy your applications from the Docker images).</p>

<p>If you looked in that directory, you’d see four subdirectories (as well as some other files).</p>

   <code>├── blog-k8s
├── gateway-k8s
├── registry-k8s
└── store-k8s
</code>   

<p>These four directories hold the deployment descriptors for the Kubernetes services that correspond to the four applications in the microservice.</p>

 Update MongoDB headless service configuration 

<p>You also need to update the Kubernetes deployment definition for the store’s headless MongoDB service. This fixes a problem with the store not being able to find the database. This entry is at the bottom of the file.</p>

<p><code>kubernetes/store-k8s/store-mongodb.yml</code></p>

   <code># Headless service for DNS record
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
...
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  clusterIP: None
  publishNotReadyAddresses: true  # &lt;- ADD ME
  ...
</code>   

 Use Jib to build the Docker images and push to your Docker Hub registry 

<p>Kubernetes on AWS needs to be able to access your Docker images. The easiest way to do this is to push them to your Docker Hub account (which you should have already signed up for, if you didn’t already have one).</p>

<p>Gradle and <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-gradle-plugin">Jib</a> make this super easy. In fact, you have the commands you need in your console output. You can copy and paste them from there and run them in the correct directories. You cannot copy and paste the commands from my terminal listing above without replacing the docker repository name.</p>

<p>Make sure you are logged into Docker.</p>

   <code>docker login
</code>   

<p>The commands to build the Docker images and push them to Docker Hub are the following. You must replace <code>{your-docker-repository-name}</code> with your actual docker repository name and run these commands in the correct project subdirectories.</p>

   <code># in ./gateway
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/gateway
# in ./blog
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/blog
# in ./store
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image={your-docker-repository-name}/store
</code>   

<p>You’re only building the blog, store, and gateway, not the registry. This is because the registry using a stock image and you don’t have to build it.</p>

 Configure OAuth Security with Okta 

<p>Before you start, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>. Run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.</p>

<p>Then, from the root project directory, open a Bash shell and run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>.</p>

<p>The default app name is fine. Or change it. Also accept the default redirect URIs.</p>

<p>My output looked like this:</p>

   <code>Application name [kubernetes]: 
Redirect URI
Common defaults:
 Spring Security - http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta
 JHipster - http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc
 Quarkus OIDC - http://localhost:8080/callback
Enter your Redirect URI(s) [http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc, http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc]: 
Enter your Post Logout Redirect URI(s) [http://localhost:8080/, http://localhost:8761/]: 
Configuring a new OIDC Application, almost done:
Created OIDC application, client-id: 0oa7pu3434DasvWSo4x7
Creating Authorization Server claim 'groups':
Adding user 'andrew.hughes@mail.com' to groups: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN]
Existing group 'ROLE_USER' found
Existing group 'ROLE_ADMIN' found
|
Okta application configuration has been written to: /home/andrewcarterhughes/Development/okta/2022/aws-kubernetes/QA1/kubernetes/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>This command creates an OIDC application on the Okta servers for you. It also creates a <code>groups</code> claim on your authorization server and adds to groups: <code>ROLE_USER</code> and <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code>. The group names have <code>ROLE_</code> prefixed to them because of the way Spring Boot processes group names. You need these default groups for authentication to work.</p>

<p>Remember the name of the OIDC application. You’ll need to find it in the Okta Admin Console later. The <code>okta apps</code> command creates a config file named <code>.okta.env</code>. This should look something like the following.</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="0oa7pu3434DasvWSo4x7"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="09328uu098u4..."
</code>   

<p>The microservices use Spring Cloud Config to centralize configuration (this service is part of the JHipster registry). This means that you can configure the entire microservice to use Okta as an OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider in a single place.</p>

<p>Open <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>. Add the following at the end of the <code>data.application.yml</code> entry (before the <code>jhipster-registry.yml</code> entry), filling in the <code>issuer-uri</code>, <code>client-id</code>, and <code>client-secret</code> taken from the <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>

<p>This is the Spring Cloud Config file that the JHipster registry will serve to the entire microservice network.</p>

<p><code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code></p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
# app specific configuration
jhipster-registry.yml: |-
  ...
</code>   

<p>You also need to configure the registry to use OAuth. In the <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> file, add <code>oauth2</code> to the values under <code>SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE</code> (as shown below).</p>

<p><code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code></p>

   <code>spec:
  containers:
    - name: jhipster-registry
      env:
        - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
          value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

 Create an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes (EKS) cluster 

<p>Now you are going to create the EKS cluster on AWS using the <a href="https://eksctl.io/">eksctl</a> CLI.</p>

<p>You should have the AWS CLI and <code>eksctl</code> installed and configured already. Use the following command to create the Kubernetes cluster for the microservice. After you run the command, go get some coffee or lunch. This command is slooooow.</p>

   <code>eksctl create cluster --name okta-k8s \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --nodegroup-name okta-k8s-nodes \
    --node-type t2.xlarge \
    --nodes 2
</code>   

<p>This will take several minutes to run.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IMPORTANT: This cluster costs money as long as it is running. If you only keep it running for the hour or so you need to run the tutorial, the costs are small. If you forget and leave it running for a month or two, it could cost a lot more. Don’t forget to delete it when you are done!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are using a managed cluster with EC2 nodes. You are not using the newer, Fargate managed clusters because when I tried Fargate I ran into problems. There are reports of a compatibility problem between Fargate and Eureka. See <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/jhipster-dev/c/148uESs6vns">this google groups thread</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jussiseppala/eurekafargatesample">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>You can look at <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">the AWS docs on managed node groups</a> for more in-depth information. Basically, though, being managed means that you do not need to separately provision and register the EC2 instances in the node group. The EC2 instances and Kubernetes nodes are packaged together and managed as a unit. Unmanaged node groups allow you to separate the node group management from the EC2 instances, allowing for finer control but also requiring more direct involvement in instance management.</p>

 Troubleshoot problems using AWS CloudFormation 

<p>If you have a problem, you can log into the AWS console and search for the CloudFormation tool. CloudFormation is an AWS service that (according to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html">their docs</a>) “helps you model and set up your AWS resources.” It allows you to create templates for configuring and provisioning resources and can help with dependencies between AWS resources. The <code>eksctl</code> tool uses CloudFormation behind the scenes.</p>

<p>My console ended with this non-specific error.</p>

 <code>2022-06-17 09:32:51 [ℹ]  waiting for CloudFormation stack "eksctl-okta-k8s-nodegroup-okta-k8s-nodes"
2022-06-17 09:32:51 [!]  1 error(s) occurred and cluster hasn't been created properly, you may wish to check CloudFormation console
2022-06-17 09:32:51 [ℹ]  to cleanup resources, run 'eksctl delete cluster --region=us-west-2 --name=okta-k8s'
2022-06-17 09:32:51 [✖]  waiter state transitioned to Failure
Error: failed to create cluster "okta-k8s"
</code> 

<p>When I logged into AWS and opened CloudFormation, I saw this on the console.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The cluster was created successfully, but the node group failed. I clicked on the node group name. Then I selected the events tab. Scrolling down, I found the error.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The error reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Resource handler returned message: “Your requested instance type (t2.xlarge) is not supported in your requested Availability Zone (us-west-2d). Please retry your request by not specifying an Availability Zone or choosing us-west-2a, us-west-2b, us-west-2c. (Service: Eks, Status Code: 400, Request ID: 442805e0-f485-4503-a697-838dfbd690d0, Extended Request ID: null)” (RequestToken: 13e73586-c07b-6a2b-2209-a31bd1bc2560, HandlerErrorCode: InvalidRequest)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I needed to add an additional flag to my command to specify an availability zone. If you look at <a href="https://eksctl.io/usage/creating-and-managing-clusters/">the <code>eksctl</code> docs</a>, there’s a note about this for the <code>us-east-1</code> region. This was the first time I’d run into it in the <code>us-west-1</code> region.</p>

   <code>--zones=us-west-2a,us-west-2b,us-west-2c
</code>   

<p>I deleted the cluster and cleaned up using:</p>

   <code>eksctl delete cluster --region=us-west-2 --name=okta-k8s
</code>   

<p>And tried it again:</p>

   <code>eksctl create cluster --name okta-k8s \
--region us-west-2 \
--zones=us-west-2a,us-west-2b,us-west-2c \
--nodegroup-name okta-k8s-nodes \
--node-type t2.xlarge \
--nodes 2
</code>   

<p>You may have to rename the cluster. I found that sometimes even though the cluster resources have been deleted, the name is still unavailable.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are wondering, if you got this error, why I didn’t include the <code>--zones</code> flag in the original command. Was it just for the teachable moment? Not entirely. I wasn’t sure if the availability in the zones is consistent enough to warrant including the specific zones in the original command.</p>

 Deploy the JHipster Kubernetes microservice to EKS 

<p>Next you’ll use <code>kubectl</code> to deploy the microservice to AWS EKS. Before you do that, if you haven’t already, you should install a tool for monitoring the services. Both <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s">k9s</a> and <a href="https://k8slens.dev/">Kubernetes Lens</a> are great. Installing one of these tools isn’t strictly necessary. You can do everything from the <code>kubectl</code> if you want, but life is short. Live a little. Use a GUI instead of the CLI. Step away from the <code>vim</code> and try an IDE. Nobody will know. You’ll still be cool.</p>

<p>Open a Bash shell and navigate to the <code>kubernetes</code> subdirectory of the project.</p>

<p>Run the following command to update your local Kubernetes configuration with the AWS EKS cluster config.</p>

   <code>aws eks update-kubeconfig --name okta-k8s
</code>   

<p>If you don’t do this, you may see the following error.</p>

   <code>Kubeconfig user entry is using deprecated API version client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1. Run 'aws eks update-kubeconfig' to update.
</code>   

<p>Now you’re ready to deploy the microservice.</p>

<p>Run the following command (again, from the <code>kubernetes</code> subdirectory).</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>To use the CLI to check on the pods, you can use:</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n demo
</code>   

<p>Hopefully everything has a status of <code>running</code>. If not, something is wrong.</p>

   <code>NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

</code>   

<p>In K8s Lens, here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Another useful command is <code>describe</code> (I won’t replicate the output here). This is great for more detailed information for debugging.</p>

   <code>kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt; -n demo
</code>   

<p>You can also tail logs of a specific pod using the following command.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt; --tail=-1 -n demo
</code>   

<p>To access the Eureka registry service, you need to forward the port.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8761. You may have to log in if you aren’t already logged into Okta.</p>

<p>You want to see a lot of green.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If everything is good, <code>control-c</code> to stop forwarding the registry. Forward the gateway and open it.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Open http://localhost:8080</p>

<p>You’ll see the front page of the demo application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go to Account and Sign in.</p>

<p>If you are already logged into Okta, you won’t have to log in again. Otherwise you’ll be redirected to the Okta SSO sign-in page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you’re authenticated, you’ll be directed to the authenticated front page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To verify that the application works, try and create a product and a blog. Go to the Entities menu and click on Product. Click Create a new Product and fill in the form with dummy values. You should be able to successfully create a new product. Do the same thing with Entities and Blog. You should be able to create a blog and a blog post.</p>

<p>Remember that the blog application uses a Neo4j database backend and the store uses a Mongo DB backend. You’re accessing these services through the public gateway application, but this is forwarding the requests to the private services and their associated databases.</p>

 Protect sensitive configuration values using <code>kubeseal</code> 

<p>The microservice is working. The only thing left to do is to protect any sensitive configuration parameters that you don’t want to check into a repository. In this case, the main value that needs to be protected is the Okta OIDC client secret (and the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>, which, as you’ll see in a moment, is used to encrypt the client secret but which itself will need to be encrypted using <code>kubeseal</code>).</p>

<p>In <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, add an environment key-value pair (you can add it anywhere under the same <code>env</code> list that you edited earlier). Make up an encryption key. The longer the better. Generating a UUID is a good solution. Linux has a tool called <code>uuid</code> that can be used.</p>

   <code>- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  value: &lt;your-encryption-key&gt;
</code>   

<p>Redeploy the Kubernetes configuration. If you are still port-forwarding the gateway, <code>control-c</code> to stop it. Run the following from the <code>kubernetes</code> subdirectory.</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>Port forward the registry.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Open http://localhost:8761</p>

<p>Go to Configuration and Encryption</p>

<p>Copy your client secret (from <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code> or from the <code>.okta.env</code> file) and paste it into the text field.</p>

<p>Click Encrypt.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy that value, including the <code>{cipher}</code> part, and paste it back over the old value.</p>

   <code>registration:
  oidc:
    client-id: 0oa7i972cgX989i99u
    client-secret: "{cipher}515aaa9d9bd1b14d2f076e2ba6..."
</code>   

<p>You can redeploy your app (<code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code>) and verify that the encrypted client secret is working (by making sure you can still log in). However, unfortunately, because the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> is sitting there in the configuration files right alongside the encrypted client secret, this isn’t all that secure.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can use <code>kubeseal</code> to secure the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>. Matt Raible explains secrets management in Kubernetes in his post,  <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. He also includes a lot of great resources. Check out his post for more info. You can also take a look at <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">the <code>kubeseal</code> GitHub page</a> for more info. In this post, I’m just going to show you how to get it working.</p>

<p>Install <code>kubeseal</code> in the EKS cluster.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.17.5/controller.yaml
</code>   

<p>Retrieve the certificate keypair that this controller generates.</p>

   <code>kubectl get secret -n kube-system -l sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key -o yaml
</code>   

<p>Copy the raw value of <code>tls.crt</code> and decode it. You can use the command line, or learn more about <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/#base64-encode-the-client-id-and-client-secret">base64 encoding/decoding</a> in our documentation.</p>

   <code>echo -n &lt;paste-value-here&gt; | base64 --decode
</code>   

<p>You should get something like this:</p>

   <code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIEzTCCArWgAwIBAgIRAOTmN5wRwZak1XsbhMqpbBAwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQELBQAw
ADAeFw0yMjA2MTgwMzE1NTZaFw0zMjA2MTUwMzE1NTZaMAAwggIiMA0GCSqGSIb3
DQEBAQUAA4ICDwAwggIKAoICAQDKuios+wTX6cSQRmL7T4ebTQN37vCElL6CFps5
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</code>   

<p>Put this value in a <code>tls.crt</code> file.</p>

<p>Next, install Kubeseal. On macOS, you can use Homebrew. For other platforms, see <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/tag/v0.17.5">the release notes</a>.</p>

   <code>brew install kubeseal
</code>   

<p>Run the following command to encrypt <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>. Replace the placeholder with your actual encryption key value.</p>

   <code>kubectl create secret generic project-secrets \
  --from-literal=ENCRYPT_KEY='&lt;your-encryption-key&gt;' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>Convert the secrets to encrypted secrets.</p>

   <code>kubeseal --cert tls.crt --format=yaml -n demo &lt; secrets.yml &gt; sealed-secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>Delete the unencrypted secrets file.</p>

   <code>rm secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>The <code>sealed-secrets.yml</code> file will look like this:</p>

   <code>apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: project-secrets
  namespace: demo
spec:
  encryptedData:
    ENCRYPT_KEY: AgBElusDb+KI9pHVeqWpzBAMnj4ksNXqXKoHdGTUQRzHi+0mnPxG+jm51QHz/6RoAGVRwVZbVnC+YpsjenbyYjz2q0U1yf+K1p3qYoOg8FlEQZYcbDRR/mQWhSZgIHTj5tRknZMkgGGkTCXGJTY4Dpjw...
  template:
    data: null
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      name: project-secrets
      namespace: demo

</code>   

<p>Deploy the sealed secrets to the cluster.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -n demo -f sealed-secrets.yml &amp;&amp; kubectl get -n demo sealedsecret project-secrets
</code>   

<p>Update the registry configuration to use the encrypted value for the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>. Replace the previous entry for <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>env:
  ...
  - name: ENCRYPT_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: project-secrets
        key: ENCRYPT_KEY
</code>   

<p>Deploy the cluster again.</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>Wait a few moments. Forward the registry again.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Open the registry and make sure you can log in.</p>

<p>If that works, try forwarding the gateway again.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Open http://localhost:8080</p>

<p>Make a product. Or a blog. Everything should still be working.</p>

<p>Once you’re done, delete the EKS cluster. If you don’t do this, you’ll keep getting charged for the AWS resources.</p>

   <code>eksctl delete cluster --region=us-west-2 --name=okta-k8s
</code>   

<p>It wouldn’t hurt to log into the console and make sure all of the resources were cleaned up.</p>

 AWS, Kubernetes, and Spring Boot Microservice is done! 

<p>In this project you deployed a JHipster microservice to AWS EKS. You used the AWS CLI to create the Kubernetes resources, and you used <code>kubectl</code> to deploy the applications to the Kubernetes pods. You also used Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider to secure the microservice. Finally, you properly encrypted all of the sensitive configuration values using a combination of JHipster registry encryption, Kubernetes secrets, and <code>kubeseal</code>.</p>

<p>This project is based on two of Matt Raible’s tutorials, which were helpful for me when I was writing it.</p>

<p>Vinay Gupta, CEO of Mattereum and Ethereum launch co-ordinator in 2015 looks at what needs to be done to truly embed the blockchain into the&nbsp;future</p><p>During a<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa"> Perez Cycle</a> there is one very predictable way to make money: be the exchange. This is one form of the old saw about “during a gold rush, sell shovels.”</p><p>In the recent loops,&nbsp;that’s:</p>  Coinbase in its Bitcoin, altcoins, Ethereum, and ICOs&nbsp;phases  Uniswap (and all the rest) during the Defi&nbsp;phase  OpenSea during the NFT&nbsp;phase  <p>OpenSea got 2.5% of everything. Pushing $400,000,000 a month in fees at one&nbsp;point.</p><p>That’s no joke. That’s real money. But it’s essentially a toll road, and if the cars go somewhere else you don’t get a cut. Coinbase is doing NFTs but it’s going to have a hard time catching OpenSea. Maybe this deal with Mastercard will&nbsp;help.</p><p>But, really, this is just a tax on bubbles. You want to get into the bubble, you pay the gatekeepers. It’s generating real wealth by skimming a little on other people’s speculative activities. In a casino, this is called the vig. In roulette, it’s the green “00” where the house wins and takes all the money on the&nbsp;table.</p><p>In crypto it’s the commissions going to the people selling access to the speculative market. This is not a bad business to be in for the winners. It’s real&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>But it’s not actually wealth generating.</p><p>So how does crypto actually generate&nbsp;wealth?</p><p>Here’s the first argument: crypto is monetary policy as a service. Crypto makes money by literally making money. Bitcoin miners pull the stuff out of thin air, with enormous energy costs, and sell it. Money is a product. Now this argument was always solid, but the counter-argument was “but Bitcoin is worse money than the US&nbsp;dollar.”</p><p>And here we get into a&nbsp;thicket.</p><p>Bitcoin was a worse, more expensive, more volatile version of the US dollar for a long time. But the price, on average, kept going up. Bitcoiners would talk about scarce supply and historical inevitability, and the good and right-thinking people of the world would roll their eyes and say “but it isn’t really money” and move on, while the bitcoiners continued to be wrong and get&nbsp;rich.</p><p>The thing that kept the Bond Villains in the loop on bitcoin was the underlying fear that the US dollar was inevitably going to start inflating eventually. The 2008 bust had left the economy in a fickle, precarious position and the vultures knew it was only a matter of&nbsp;time.</p>Source <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart">https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart</a><p>Well, that time is now. 12% inflation is one hell of a thing. It was a global crisis that last time inflation was that high. It’s a global crisis&nbsp;now.</p><p>And the bitcoiners are clearly and visibly right about Bitcoin being “monetary policy as a service” while, at the same time, losing money hand-over-fist right now as the current <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa">Perez Cycle</a> bubble they are in bursts (again… for like the 5th time). They were making money when they were wrong. Now they’re losing money when they are&nbsp;right.</p><p>There’s no justice. But there is inflation.</p><p>For our younger readers: inflation means there’s too much money chasing not enough stuff. The price of the stuff starts to rise, and year-on-year everything gets more expensive. If wages rise at the same price as stuff, the people who lose are people with money in the bank. If wages don’t rise at the same price as stuff, the working class gets poorer and poorer, and the landlords get all the money. This was last a thing in the 1970s, and it led to the 1980s. What a disaster. And as for keeping wages rising through an inflationary period, who’s in a union these&nbsp;days?</p><p>So “monetary policy as a service” in bitcoin means this: by restricting the supply of money to below the availability of goods and services, the amount of goods and services a given amount of money can buy will keep going up. This is known as “deflation” — prices go down every year instead of up. Well, sure enough, with 12% inflation and worse on the way probably (stagflation! secular stagnation! contagion!) for the dollar economy, the bitcoin (and soon, Ethereum) “hard money claim” begins to look pretty good. There’s no doubt it’s a plausible model of the future: in-between the massive Perez cycle crashes, there is a massive on-going infrastructure built out and fundamental economic wealth creation from making and selling hard money during an age when all the governments will sell you is increasingly-soft money.</p><p>Back when the market cap of Bitcoin was around $500m USD people used to say to me “why is Bitcoin worth anything at all?” and I’d say “given the state of the world, does a $500m hedge against the dollar going horribly wrong seem unreasonable to you?” and usually they’d go “Ah. Hm. Alright then, sure.” It made a difference to their understanding of the situation.</p><p>So the argument here is that, even though Bitcoiners are losing money on the current Perez Cycle, they’re also right about inflation. Selling wealth preservation as a service is inherently profitable (if you’re any good at it) — just ask any professional wealth&nbsp;manager.</p><p>The long term trajectory here is WAGMI: Satoshi’s analysis of the inability of governments to control inflation in the long run was accurate, and the apocalypse that they predicted is&nbsp;here.</p><p>But Bitcoin prices are still going down because the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent, as they say in finance. It’s a hard&nbsp;life.</p><p>So that’s one half of “during a gold rush, sell shovels.” Bitcoin is the selling the gold part. I won’t say that’s going well, but it’s going as expected. There are huge issues, as always with bitcoin, but the nation state’s money isn’t all roses either: defense spending vs. bitcoin mining, you know? It is the same sort of spending: protecting value.</p><p>Here’s the other&nbsp;half.</p><p>Protecting wealth from inflation is only one kind of protection we&nbsp;need.</p><p>The other kind of protection we need is environmental protection.</p><p>Now here you say “but Bitcoin has horrible environmental externalities” and I’m not saying you’re wrong. It does. There is a paradox here, at no mistake, and we all have to live with it regardless of what position we take relative to Bitcoin. I’m very pro Proof of Stake systems including Avalanche and whatever we’re calling ETH2 these days, and have been for&nbsp;years.</p><p>Environmental protection is a big deal. The existing economic architecture of the world makes it essentially impossible to protect nature. I could go on for some time about how the key function of colonialism is to convince rich people that it isn’t unceasing violence that maintains their wealth but, at the end of the day, you either know how this world works or you don’t. I used to get into trouble for saying “what is the point of Free Software running on hardware manufactured by slaves” at open source conferences. You know&nbsp;me.</p><p>A system of sound money, no matter how outlandish or mainstream, is not going to save us alone. There is nothing about bitcoin that will stop us destroying ourselves with CO2 emissions, indeed many would argue (and I’m among them) that Bitcoin has done immense damage in this&nbsp;way.</p><p>We need a comprehensive overhaul of how things are done while the global system is in shock: there is a window of opportunity to start a reorganisation of trade the likes of which hasn’t been seen in about five hundred years. We need hard asset accounting to deal with fraud and asset bubbles, and we need to start counting environmental and social externalities on the same kind of basis that we account for payments. And it has to be the same system. (to read more about what an integrated blockchain-based environmental economics backbone would look like, see this Medium&nbsp;piece)</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Can the World Computer Save the World? Part 3: Building an Economy with a Future</a></p><p>But back to the hard asset economics. Here’s the core issue in a nutshell.</p><p>Nobody trusts anybody else’s&nbsp;money.</p><p>If you’re in China and signing a deal for 12 months in the future, what do you think the dollar is going to be&nbsp;worth?</p><p>So being able to see exactly what is going on with your counterparties is an increasingly good idea. If I’m being made promises about a supply chain, I want to be able to inspect it. Are you really going to be able to deliver me 1200 PC laptops at 200 a month, or is your vendor going to crap out? If you do fail me, can I get my money&nbsp;back</p><p>Uncertainty is high. All time high. Trust is low. All time low. The global system is stressed.</p><p>We restore trust by making the system transparent: visibility into our counterparties’ supply chains enables us to make a better guess about whether or not they’re going to be able to deliver. This kind of trust problem on trading and delivery is breaking out all over the place, in previously-unprecedented ways.</p><p>The answer, inevitably, is to use less volatile things to pay for less volatile&nbsp;things.</p><p>Absolute certainty about hard assets and their value is a precondition for being able to do trade. But you also need certainty about the value of money, and the risks of the goods not being delivered because of supply chain problems. No system can solve all of this, but strategically deployed cryptographic assets can. If I have a crypto token which translates to four ounces of gold in the form of a gold bar, and you have every reason to trust that token, I can use it to pay for two laptops priced in gold. If you prefer SDRs to gold, and you want to bake in some terms for inflation to index-link the price of the contract, no reason that can’t be done&nbsp;too.</p><p>Turning the&nbsp;corner</p><p>The crypto industry has two fundamental ways of making money: “scarcity as a service” to protect wealth from governments printing currency. That mode of wealth production should be strongly reinforced by 12% per year US inflation and similar rates in other wealthy countries. But 50% drops that apparently come out of nowhere make it hard unnecessarily hard to make that&nbsp;case.</p><p>The other, complimentary, approach is to get stuck in to the hard work of getting physical asset trade on chain. There are a huge range of benefits to tokenizing physical assets as NFTs or representing them as&nbsp;ERC20s.</p>  support for environmental economics  lowered fraud&nbsp;rates  guarantees there’s no slave labour in your&nbsp;stuff  circular economy benefits to reduce raw material&nbsp;usage  easier sales because people trust the stuff they are&nbsp;buying  <p>All this together turns the blockchain itself into the marketplace for the entire world. That’s how we win: we get the real estate, the gold, the land, the wine, the cars, the clothes and furniture and everything else flowing over the magnificent complex infrastructure that has been built up by the last 6 rounds of the Perez Cycle in the blockchain space.</p><p>We have world-changing infrastructure. Now we have to use it to change the&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-is-new-in-the-world-of-blockchain-64b482e1f9d7">What is New in the World of Blockchain?</a></p><p>My company, Mattereum, derisks physical assets as they are turned into tokens. We make Mattereum Asset Passports (MAP) which enable people to vouch (with their money) for the condition of physical goods, ranging from fine artwork to real estate. We combine cutting edge legal developments with blockchain technology so we can partner with merchants to add a MAP to every transaction — the MAP is a digital smart contract that legally binds the identity of an item being sold to its detailed specifications and value. Within the asset passport, each specification is backed by a warranty that is legally enforceable in more than 160 jurisdictions. This means it is no longer necessary to have to just rely on trusting the seller to tell the truth about an item, solving the problem of the lack of a trusted third party in sales on the blockchain. For the first time it enables purchasers to fully trust in the value, integrity and authenticity of on-chain merchant sales, which is of critical importance for the growth of metaverse and NFT transactions that will dematerialise and financialise the world’s physical assets, and allows an avenue for recompense if your on-chain asset is stolen. In addition, through engaging as a warrantor, brands and manufacturers can participate in recurring revenue streams from secondary market transactions.</p><p>Using MAPs we’ve helped our customers sell everything from gold bullion to a world-famous DJ’s trumpet. We are hard core economic realists: Vinay Gupta (CEO) spent years as a consultant on failed states; Anton Shelupanov (Managing Director) saw the economic troubles in former Soviet countries in the 1990s and early 2000s from an extremely difficult position: working alongside justice systems he witnessed the outcomes of economic collapse, which included uncontrolled hyperincarceration, leading to an amplification of the TB and HIV pandemics and the resultant harm to societies. It took respective governments and international organisations years and in some cases decades to put in place strategies to begin to recover from that&nbsp;harm.</p><p>We’re building the technologies, teams, and know-how to run the global economy in an era of unprecedented pressure. We have a circular economy service to make the physical goods we have work harder. We’re working on a large-scale scale play to take gold bullion from around the world and decentralize gold custody. We’re working on real estate, both so you can use real estate as collateral more easily, but also to make it possible to transfer real estate faster and with more certainty which minimises exposure to fluctuating purchasing power and interest rates. We’re getting stuff digitally tagged so you know exactly what you are buying. Soon, all kinds of machineries like futures and options on physical assets: the full Defi toolkit applied to the real world. And because we really believe in and understand ecological economics, because the assets we help sell have estimates of their environmental impact and integrated CO2 offsets, this is all Refi: “Regenerative Finance.” Documenting real things, including the environmental externalities, is critical to our model of the world. You can’t know the real value of a thing unless you fully understand and know its environmental externalities. And knowing real value is what we are all&nbsp;about.</p><p>I want to encourage all of you to join us. The real asset revolution is how crypto really generates wealth.</p><p>How, you say? Right now the global economy offers us no reliable global way to buy and sell things of substantial value around the world, with strong legal protections for both buyers and sellers, and excellent risk management to make sure people get paid if something goes wrong. We don’t gather and collect the information necessary for environmental economics and right-pricing of assets, discounted by any environmental damage they are causing. We know only the cost of everything, but the value of nothing, and it’s really harming&nbsp;us.</p><p>TradFi destroyed the world through systemic fraud of the kind that led to the 2008 financial collapse. It’s working on destroying the future through funding climate change. Defi built the tools for doing some amazing things, but underpriced risk to a scary degree. Refi is both “regenerative finance” but also, critically, Re-al Finance. Finance fully grounded in the real world, including all that messy environmental, social and governance stuff that TradFi and Defi conveniently left out of the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Everything that we can do to make transactions faster, more certain, more trustworthy, higher in information content, more international — all of that — generates real wealth by moving transactions from inefficient and data-losing rails (have you tried buying a house recently?) on to dramatically more functional infrastructure for the future of world&nbsp;trade.</p><p>And this is how we make the blockchain space valuable in an operational way, rather than a speculative way. This is how we move from a series of bubbles to enduring, stable wealth. We get into the real world, and we solve the transparency, accountability and trust problems which dominate real world trade and financial markets. This is the way&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Mattereum is up and running and open for business, creating MAPs for an ever-growing variety of assets.

 Ontology on Nasdaq Trade&nbsp;Talks <p>Ontology Head of Community, Humpty Calderon, sat down with Jill Malandrino to discuss decentralized identity as part of the Nasdaq Trade Talks. As blockchain based social media continues to grow, what is the role of identity and data? How can Ontology help solve some of the challenges with products like ONT ID? Read on to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p>Jill Malandrino: Welcome to Nasdaq trade talks. I am Jill Malandrino, global markets reporter at Nasdaq. Joining us for the segment we have Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology, to discuss if we should trust a centralized tech superpower with sensitive personal data. Humpty, it’s great to have you with us. Welcome to trade&nbsp;talks.</p><p>Humpty Calderon: Thank you so much for having&nbsp;me.</p><p>Jill Malandrino: You got it, and tell us about the work being done at Ontology.</p><p>Humpty Calderon: Yeah, so Ontology is a Web3 project that’s been building out this trust layer for Web3, so really building out the infrastructure both in terms of the identity and reputation side and decentralized data as well. They’ve developed quite a few different products in the space of DID with ONTID, Oscore, Wing Finance, and Saga, all of them seeking to decentralize the way that we use identity and reputation in the Web3&nbsp;space.</p><p>Jill Malandrino: How does Ontology establish trustless decentralized applications that store and share sensitive information securely?</p><p>Humpty Calderon: Ontology works with an open standard called DID, which has been created by the w3c foundation, and it is an open private composable interoperable protocol that allows for the use of identity systems like I have mentioned with ONTID and with Oscore. It does so all in ways that are private and secure because they are encrypted and they live off-chain. The only people that can access this information, the only people that can interact with this, is the person who is creating this identity and the person who is generating this data, so they are signed using your Web3&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Jill Malandrino: So, what are the real applications of blockchain technology and enhancing privacy use cases? How is this being used? Is it being deployed right&nbsp;now?</p><p>Humpty Calderon: Yeah, you can look at some of the different projects that have been building out with decentralized identity and reputation, such as what Ontology has been building with ONTID, allowing for you to be able to own your identity across a variety of platforms. So the best example that we like to use is if you think of something like what Facebook and Google are doing right, where you create these identities but these identities are not yours. At any moment, when this company decides to shut down your identity, your user, which they could definitely do, and all the data that is created on the back-end from that is not yours, it is all owned by these corporations.</p><p>They are then able to monetize them, aggregate them, and so on. With these decentralized identity solutions, it works quite the opposite of that. People can generate these identities for themselves and use them across a variety of web applications, say using DeFi for example, or across a DAO, if you are a contributor to an organization in decentralized ways. It could be NFT Marketplaces as well, and all of that data that is being generated on the back-end is yours and you can then give access to others in a permissionless way, to be able to use that data and to potentially even monetize it as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Jill Malandrino: That is really interesting because that could potentially impact business models. As we know that’s how today’s social media companies advertising works, how even targeted marketing towards consumers looks. I mean it totally changes the&nbsp;model.</p><p>Humpty Calderon: Yeah, there are quite a few interesting projects in the space right now, especially those that are working in the social space. They can create these more user-owned platforms, where you create an identity to connect with friends, you are able to create circles of friends within those networks that are more aligned to who you are, and the type of different projects and types of communities that you seek to associate with in the Web3 space, and also in the social&nbsp;space.</p><p>Jill Malandrino: And is that actively happening now for the average users such as myself, who has only access to Web2 social sites? How does it work now? Is it mainstream yet?</p><p>Humpty Calderon: Yeah, so that is the stage that we are at right. A lot of the conversations that have been happening over the last year are at the infrastructure layer. How do we allow for these protocols and platforms to be able to communicate with one another and for people to be able to generate these accounts and to be able to associate relationships with these accounts, and be able to own this data and use this data in ways that are private and secure? The application layer of it is what we are starting to build, so you can definitely start using these applications if you have a web wallet. You can sign into these applications, start using them, but it is not very user friendly and we realize this. We want to take the next leap into, you know, being able to onboard more people that are used to using maybe the more traditional social sites. Then, we need to create platforms that are very much akin in terms of the way that they function to those sites, but still supported by this backend infrastructure and technology that is being built by developers like Ontology.</p><p>Jill Malandrino: All right Humpty, we appreciate the insight. Thanks for joining us on trade talks. I am Jill Malandrino global markets reporter at&nbsp;Nasdaq.</p><p>Humpty Calderon: Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Check this out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcBiqSVa13A">Should We Trust a Centralized Tech Superpower With Sensitive, Personal Data? — YouTube</a></p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/should-we-trust-a-centralized-tech-superpower-with-sensitive-personal-data-41b15157a6b3">Should We Trust a Centralized Tech Superpower With Sensitive, Personal Data?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An Identity management process run with Dizme ID wallet, designed by InfoCert in collaboration with <a href="https://keyless.io/">Keyless Tech</a>, &nbsp;has been the most voted solution at #SHACK22 hackathon.</p>



<p>The hackathon held by INTEROPen, a leading organization to support &amp; accelerate the delivery and adoption of Interoperability Standards in health &amp; social, in partnership with NHS (National Health System) was aimed at developing innovative solutions for the management of access and safe mobility of staff in hospital facilities.</p>



<p>#SHACK22 was attended by twelve international teams from software vendors and consulting companies that competed to present their cutting-edge solutions to face off the challenge.</p>



 How to use DIZME for digital identity and access verification in the health care environment 



<p>As we know, access to health care facilities is highly regulated, this is to be able to ensure maximum safety and security for patients. But health care facilities are also a workplace for hundreds of thousands of workers.</p>



<p>Every day, doctors, nurses, and health care workers must be able to access hospitals in a certain and verified way and with full respect for their privacy.</p>



<p>Thanks to DIZME, a Digital Identity wallet, blockchain based, that combines the benefits of the SSI world as well as the compliance to eIDAS regulation perimeter, InfoCert was able to design a complete access management process that would guarantee total security, while fully respecting privacy and with a high-level of UX thanks to a smart and Passwordless approach.</p>



<p>DIZME’s disruptive approach to access process management enabled it to be voted as the best solution proposed at #SHACK22.</p>

 Practice data cleanliness to mitigate XSS 
<p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that continues to plague web developers. This vulnerability is a type of injection attack and is so common that it’s <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/">number 3 on the OWASP Top Ten list</a>.</p>

<p>How does this vulnerability work? In short, XSS happens when code pollutes data, and you don’t implement safeguards.</p>

<p>Ok, fine, but what does that mean? A classic example is a website that allows user input, like adding comments or reviews. Suppose the input form accepts anything the user types in and doesn’t appropriately safeguard that user input before storing and displaying it to other users. In that case, it’s at risk for XSS.</p>

<p>Imagine an overly dramatic but otherwise innocent scenario like this:</p>
<blockquote>
   
     A website allows you to add comments about your favorite K-Drama. 
     An agitator adds the comment <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('Crash Landing on You stinks!');&lt;/script&gt;</code>. 
     That terrible comment saves as is to the database. 
     A K-Drama fan opens the website. 
     The terrible comment is added to the website, appending the <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag to the DOM. 
     The K-Drama fan is outraged by the JavaScript alert saying their favorite K-Drama stinks. 
   
</blockquote>

<p>So, this is obviously awful. Least of all because we all know “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10850932/">Crash Landing on You</a>” is, in fact, wonderful. Also, this scenario exposes your website to the possibility of a colossal breach in which an injection attack can do all sorts of bad things. With JavaScript, the attack could grab cookies, dig around your browser’s local storage for authentication information, access your file system, make calls to other sites, and do even more harm.</p>

<p>In this case, we’ve show an example very clearly using a <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag to make it easier for us to talk about, but an attack can use anything that runs JavaScript, such as adding an HTML element with JS embedded in the attribute, adding JS to resource URLs, embedding JS into CSS, and so forth. This is the true stuff of nightmares!</p>

<p>How do we avoid these sorts of shenanigans? There are a few different defensive tactics, but the main one is to ensure you practice good data hygiene through escaping and sanitizing.</p>

<p>Escaping refers to replacing certain specific characters in HTML so they are read as text strings, such as replacing <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> with <code>&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;</code>). When you escape, the browser no longer treats the value as part of the code. It’s simply text or data. Although we’re talking XSS here, escaping is a good practice in general as it will protect you against SQL injection, a different type of injection attack.</p>

<p></p>

<p>– <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">xkcd</a></p>

<p>Sanitizing removes code that might be malicious, while preserving some safe HTML tags. The primary use case for choosing to sanitize instead of to escape the code is when you want to allow markup to display, like if you have a rich text editor on your website.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more to discuss regarding cross-site scripting, including types of XSS and mitigation technique specifics, so keep an eye out for a follow-up post with more details, including the built-in XSS security mechanisms provided in some SPA frameworks.</p>

 Dive into XSS 
<p>Can’t wait to read more about XSS? Check out these resources that cover how cross-site scripting works:</p>

 Validate requests for authenticity to mitigate CSRF 
<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is another well-known vulnerability in the <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/">top spot of the OWASP Top Ten, Broken Access Control</a>. CSRF allows attackers to exploit your identity to perform unauthorized actions. Sounds pretty bad, right? Well, yup, you’re correct.</p>

<p>The exploit works like this.</p>

<blockquote>
   
     You log in to the K-Drama site to upvote some recent shows you watched. 
     Then, in a loss of judgment, you open a spam email and click the link to transfer money to an agitator claiming to be your long lost high school sweetheart. (What were you thinking!) 
     The link takes you to a malicious site with a hidden form embedded within it. 
     The hidden form sends an HTTP POST request with terrible comments to the K-Drama site along with the active session cookie. 
     Since you have an active authenticated session on the K-Drama site, the POST completes as if you were the one adding terrible comments about “Hospital Playlist”! 
   
</blockquote>

<p>Luckily in this example, the unauthorized action isn’t irreversible or devastating. You can delete the terrible comments, and you can explain how it wasn’t really you who posted such comments to horrified “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11769304/">Hospital Playlist</a>” fans. However, you can see how dangerous and malicious this exploit would be if the target was something fundamental like a bank!</p>

<p>The only way to mitigate against CSRF is to ensure the request is legitimate.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we already have some tools and actions at our disposal that we covered previously, such as:</p>
 
   Prefer tokens in HTTP headers for authenticated HTTP calls and ideally store those tokens in-memory. 
   Configure tight CORS controls. 
   Protect your cookies! 
 

<p>These mechanisms are so good that some say <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/csrf-is-dead/">there’s nothing more you need to do for SPAs</a>!</p>

<p>However, CSRF relies on your backend not completing due diligence to verify the authenticity of the requests and allowing non-JSON payloads. Hackers are very clever, and you may need to allow <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> payloads in your backend, so you may need extra safeguards. When you do need extra guards, you can add a unique CSRF token for communication between your frontend and backend. The backend needs to verify standard authentication and authorization safeguards and verify the CSRF token’s legitimacy.</p>

<p>The token is generated by the backend and sent to the frontend. The frontend then uses the token in subsequent calls to the backend by adding it as a custom HTTP header.</p>

<p>For SPAs, getting that CSRF token from the server is the difficult part. In traditional web apps, it’s not a problem. But for SPAs, you don’t call your back-end API until after you load the application. You also want CSRF protection before logging in if you’re not delegating authentication to a third-party authentication provider. 😎</p>

<p>The recommendation is to have your client call an endpoint on your backend to get the CSRF token. The endpoint must be super vigilant about confirming the caller’s origin and keeping that CORS allowlist very strict.</p>

<p>Password attacks are becoming easier to achieve with most people having too many passwords to remember, leading them to use the same password over and over.</p>
<p>What is a password attack? Password attacks are malicious ways hackers attempt to gain access to your account. Examples of password attacks include brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and password spraying.</p>
 What Is Password Security? 
<p><a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person#:~:text=How%20many%20passwords%20does%20the,repeat%20passwords%20or%20password%20elements.">A study commissioned by NordPass</a> showed that most individuals are working with around 100 different passwords. It’s no wonder, then, that passwords are often the most attractive target for hackers looking to break into enterprise systems. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach">According to IBM</a>, data breaches cost businesses an average of $1.07 million.</p>
<p>As multi-user systems and the internet became the norm, system designers and admins used username and password combinations as a logical and simple approach to security.</p>
<p>This approach made sense at the time, when physical limitations meant that systems had limited users, and users, in turn, had little use for multiple system accounts. The explosion of online services like email, social media, e-commerce, cloud storage, and banking led to individuals having several accounts across dozens of platforms, each with their own unique account information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relying on passwords, essentially, led us to critical security issues:</p>
 
 Simple Passwords: Passwords should be hard to guess, but users faced with memorizing 100 complex passwords will often instead opt to create simple ones —simple passwords that are, unfortunately, easy to guess or break.&nbsp; 
 Reused Passwords: Even a handful of passwords are difficult to remember, and users aren’t prone to writing every single password down. Instead, as Infosecurity Magazine notes, <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/your-employees-reusing-passwords/">up to 65% of users reuse the same or similar username/password combinations across multiple accounts</a>. This includes reuse of credentials across consumer and work-related accounts.&nbsp; 
 Password Theft: Password systems aren’t interested in the actual user sitting at a computer, only that they have the right credentials. That means that passwords are much easier to steal and use without repercussion.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These practices prevent a unique problem for security experts and administrators. First, simple passwords are easy to hack, even with the simplest methods. Second, hackers who steal credentials from one platform can attempt them across several major platforms with a relatively high success rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relative strength of the password is also subject to the cyberhealth of the user, including how well they protect knowledge of their passwords.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the 8 Most Prominent Password Attacks? 
<p>Based on these three potential problems, a whole host of attacks have emerged to try and steal login credentials from users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to understand the impact that password attacks have on cybersecurity. We often have an image of hacking in our heads that comes from movies, one that isn’t quite based on reality. Instead of shadowy figures directly connecting to external systems, most breaches start when a hacker gets access to that system from password theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some of the most common password attacks:</p>
 Brute-Force&nbsp; 
<p>The simplest and slowest form of password attack is the brute-force method. Automated systems manually attempt several million, billion, or trillion combinations of letters and numbers in the hope of accidentally stumbling on an account password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This form of attack isn’t practical for online accounts for the most part, where page loading times and server security features (like limiting page requests) limit effectiveness. However, a brute-force method can potentially pose a threat to stolen hardware or databases where the hackers can mount attacks in real time without an internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent brute-force attacks:</p>
 
 Utilizing complex passwords with combinations of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols can make guessing difficult.&nbsp; 
 Using longer passwords is also preferable, as longer passwords add exponential layers of complexity to brute-force guessing.&nbsp; 
 Enact account lock if a user provides an incorrect password too many times. A locked account with limited cooldown time can thwart brute-force attacks.&nbsp; 
 Implementing multi-factor authentication and passwordless solutions can eliminate the effectiveness of brute-force attacks, as they require credentials that these methods cannot replicate.&nbsp; 
 
 Dictionary 
<p>Dictionary attacks try words from a predetermined list in attempt to brute-force an account’s password. These dictionaries, while including fewer overall words, will often focus on “common” passwords compiled by hackers over the years. The lists&nbsp; can also include terms from actual dictionaries, common names, or combinations of dates and locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent dictionary attacks:</p>
 
 Avoiding common passwords made of readable words, even if you are using combinations of common words.&nbsp; 
 Creating passwords out of random or seemingly random combinations of letters, numbers, and characters.&nbsp; 
 Enacting account lock if a user provides an incorrect password too many times. A locked account with limited cooldown time can thwart brute-force attacks.&nbsp; 
 Implementing multi-factor authentication and passwordless solutions can eliminate the effectiveness of brute-force attacks, as they require credentials that these methods cannot replicate.&nbsp; 
 
 Keyloggers 
<p>Keyloggers are types of software that monitor keystrokes on the host system and copy that information into a text file. These types of software can come from some other kind of hack, like an infected email attachment or something installed locally on the machine. A keylogger will expose any passwords typed by the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent keylogger attacks:</p>
 
 Scanning systems for malware or other malicious software using antivirus tools, and checking for unexpectedly installed software in the system.&nbsp; 
 Maintaining complete physical protection over physical computers, including strong authentication for workstations and physical security (locks, keypads, and cameras) in any area where computers are located.&nbsp; 
 
 Credential Stuffing 
<p>It’s common for a hacker, upon hacking one account, to attempt using those credentials on several other accounts. Similarly, hackers who steal passwords (through, for example, a database breach) will wait and, over time, attempt to use those credentials again, both in other systems and within the same system again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach assumes that at least some users will fail to update passwords after a breach and that more users will not change an identical username and password on a different system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent credential stuffing attacks:</p>
 
 Forcing users to change passwords after a breach. A mandatory change can mitigate the threat of old passwords causing a problem.&nbsp; 
 Requiring users to change their passwords at regular intervals and making it so they cannot reuse previous username and password combinations.&nbsp; 
 Making password managers mandatory if sticking with passwords as a primary security approach.&nbsp; 
 
 Phishing 
<p>Phishing has been one of the most prominent forms of cyberattack. It counts on users’ ignorance of modern security threats and their trust in official-seeming emails by spoofing these emails to request user passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one is invulnerable to these attacks, and phishing has been the source of some of the most significant cybersecurity events in modern history—massive <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/whale-phishing/">spear phishing attempts</a> have cost enterprises billions of dollars in stolen funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phishing itself is a widespread form of attack, with several different forms:</p>
 
 Email 
 SMS Texts 
 Video Conferencing Software 
 Voice Calls 
 Spoofed Websites 
 
<p>All of these approaches can use marketing messaging, spoofed email templates, spoofed email addresses, and additional measures to fool users into giving up their passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent phishing attacks:</p>
 
 Training team members, from salaried employees to senior executives, on how to recognize phishing attacks when they see them.&nbsp; 
 Implementing email-based warnings to provide alerts when employees receive emails from outside of the organization.&nbsp; 
 
 Password Spraying 
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-spraying/">Password spraying</a> tries to attack multiple accounts at once in search of weak passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A spraying attack will take a handful of common passwords (like a dictionary attack) but rely on regular patterns, like well-known defaults, birthdates, or simple phrases like combinations of numbers and the word “password,” and attempt to brute-force multiple accounts at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This “spray approach” will not have the same success rate as a dedicated dictionary attack. Instead, it counts on a numbers game: across hundreds of accounts, at least one of them is using weak password security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strength of this attack is that it only takes one set of stolen credentials to compromise an entire enterprise system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent password spraying attacks</p>
 
 Avoiding common passwords made of readable words, even if you are using combinations of common words.&nbsp; 
 Creating passwords out of random or seemingly random combinations of letters, numbers, and characters.&nbsp; 
 Requiring users to change their passwords at regular intervals and making it so that they cannot reuse previous username and password combinations.&nbsp; 
 Making password managers mandatory if sticking with passwords as a primary security approach.&nbsp; 
 Implementing multi-factor authentication and passwordless solutions can eliminate the effectiveness of brute-force attacks, as they require credentials that these methods cannot replicate.&nbsp; 
 
 Man-in-the-Middle 
<p>Man-in-the-middle attacks occur when a hacker gains control of an intermediary system between two parties, such as a user and an authentication platform, and steals information as it moves back and forth between them (including passwords). Unsecure channels of communication can make this information easily readable, and any attacker in the middle can read the information without alerting either party to the threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following methods can help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks:</p>
 
 Encrypting data entering and leaving the organization, and avoiding sending any information, including login credentials, over cleartext. 
 Leveraging virtual private networks for remote users accessing critical systems.&nbsp;

<p>Clone phishing is a dangerous attack that can easily make it into any of your employees’ inboxes. So what can you do to protect against it?</p>
<p>What is clone phishing? Clone phishing is a type of phishing attack that replicates a legitimate-looking email to entice the reader to click the link or open the attachment to allow the hacker to gain access to their account.</p>
 What Are the Different Types of Phishing? 
<p>“Phishing” is a cyberattack where the attacker uses fake communications to deceive individuals into providing information or access. The most common form of phishing is through email. Still, modern innovations in communication technology have seen a parallel expansion of phishing into areas like phone calls, video call software, and SMS texting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We often like to see ourselves as a well-educated and aware digital natives. However, the reality is that with the right combination of tools, lies, and luck an attacker can successfully fool a significant number of people and reap huge rewards. Phishing is so successful that a Cisco study reported that with 86% of respondents at least one person in their organization clicked a link in a malicious email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it only takes one click to expose an entire system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phishing attacks revolve around a standard set of tactics, and as such, there are a few primary forms of phishing that transcend technology:</p>
 
 Traditional Phishing: Traditional mass-communication phishing involves the attacker creating a fake message (typically an email) to fool users into providing authentication credentials or clicking links that steal that information.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These attacks are often the crudest form of phishing and target hundreds or thousands of users—which means that even with a success rate of 1% or less, they still end up with something to show for it.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Spear Phishing: Spear phishing is a form of phishing where the attacker targets high-profile users, like managers and executives.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These managers aren’t impervious to attack, and sufficiently sophisticated messages can convince them to provide system access to company resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spear phishing attacks have been the root of many major hacks, including the hack on the Democratic National Committee email servers during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/whale-phishing/">Whale Phishing</a>: The next step up in the phishing hierarchy is whale phishing, a form of spear phishing that targets the highest executives in an organization, often chief executive officers or chief financial officers. Whale phishing has cost enterprises millions of dollars due to executives sending money or other resources to hackers under false pretenses.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Businesses must understand that phishing is an issue that can affect an organization at any level. Phishing is the biggest threat most enterprises face in modern cybersecurity.</p>
 How Does Clone Phishing Differ from Other Forms of Phishing? 
<p>The previous examples of phishing differentiate themselves based on their targeting approach. Phishing types also break down across technologies. For example, “Smishing,” or SMS phishing, uses SMS texts to entice users to click links. “Vishing,” or voice phishing, uses digital voice or video conferencing software to trick users. Video software phishing on platforms like Zoom is quite common due to the apps’ prevalence in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>By and large, however, email is still the biggest platform for phishing attacks and where advanced techniques like clone phishing come into play. This is for a few reasons:</p>
 
 Cost: Email is cheap, simple, and easy to set up. Hackers can send thousands of emails with the touch of a button.&nbsp; 
 Ubiquity: Everyone uses email. Even people who rarely actually email have an email to manage accounts, and most business correspondence happens via email.&nbsp; 
 Spoofing: Email is relatively easy to spoof. First, the sender address and link URLs are relatively easy to obfuscate to prevent detection under a cursory inspection. Second, many people simply don’t pay close attention to emails.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Clone phishing leverages these facts to send sophisticated fake emails to users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider business email. When employees receive messages from internal parties, most do not investigate those messages. They assume they are from who they say they are from. In many cases, however, business emails are harder to falsify—they require an understanding of company personnel or access to an internal email account to spam users directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if the attacker has a copy of an email sent by someone in a business, they can copy that email and use it for phishing.</p>
<p>This is clone phishing. This attacker gains access to an official email using special formatting, branding, letterheads, or other official designations. They then change something about the email, like an attachment or a link, and resend it from a spoofed email account as an error correction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recipients who get the second email assume it’s identical to the first, other than some small changes, and trust it (along with any links or attachments included). This is the danger of cloned emails: they bypass some of the red flags we might see in other phishing attempts by using something we’ve already seen, a legitimate email, as a smokescreen.</p>
<p>Clone phishing is different from compromised business emails because a clone phishing email will still be sent from an outside location. With business email compromise, the attacker can send emails directly from a compromised account, so there isn’t a need to clone an email. That doesn’t make clone phishing any less dangerous, however.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While they may be hard to detect, some characteristics of clone phishing emails may include:</p>
 
 Link URLs to non-professional or unknown websites. 
 New attachments added to emails that previously had none. 
 Broken image links for references lost during a copy and paste job.&nbsp; 
 Email addresses that don’t match the original sender. 
 Added text with extensive typos. 
 
 How You Can Protect Your Organization Against Clone Phishing 
<p>Phishing prevention is one of the most critical security undertakings many organizations will take. Such security requires coordination of technology, training, and people. While clone phishing emails are much more sophisticated than spray-and-pray email phishing campaigns, many of these preventative approaches can mitigate them in the same way.</p>
<p>Below are a few critical steps that can prepare your organization for clone phishing attacks:</p>
 
 Phishing Awareness Training: Always have training programs and resources for employees to understand what a phishing email looks like. Users often need training on how to check email addresses (and not just those in the “From” field), use on-hover previews to check links, and recognize red flags like typos or bad copy-and-paste jobs. 
 Visual Email Alerts: Email filters are only so good at keeping spam out of a business network. Additional measures, like adding visual warnings that denote email from external email addresses, can signal users to pay attention to the email and its details.&nbsp; 
 Strong Multi-Factor Authentication: Hackers are usually looking for login credentials. In systems that rely on passwords or PINs, it’s much easier to steal that information. Strong MFA, like SMS tokens or, even better, strong biometrics, can make phishing attempts unable to gain access to a system.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">Passwordless Authentication</a>: As a step beyond MFA, you can use a passwordless system that doesn’t require that users maintain credentials. Instead, they can use dedicated authentication apps and device biometrics to access systems. A hacker can’t phish biometrics from users of a passwordless system.&nbsp; 
 
 Harden Your System Security with 1Kosmos and BlockID 
<p>Unfortunately, hackers don’t often rely on brute-force <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-spraying/">password spraying</a> or fanciful hacking attempts to undermine system security. They rely on the trusting nature of people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key to mitigating these kinds of email attacks is removing the user vulnerabilities. By eliminating passwords, relying on biometrics, and streamlining the authentication process for user devices, you can effectively mitigate many phishing attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While authentication systems won’t protect you 100% from clone phishing attacks that use attachments to deliver virus payloads, a technology like 1Kosmos BlockID, combined with proper email controls and training, can shore up your phishing prevention approach.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID provides the following features:</p>
 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Streamlined User Experience: 1Kosmos provides simple user onboarding and convenient access anywhere, anytime and on any device. The experience can be delivered via the BlockID app or integrated via our SDK into your custom app.

Then, “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-examples-c2d67a17b5f5">Ocean Data Farming Examples: DF1</a>” provided examples to better understand earnings, against the DF1 rewards formula and related settings.</p><p>We fixed a bug that affected results. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c#">In DF Launch</a> and since, we’ve specified “APY ≤ 125% for each LP at each pool”. That is, the maximum possible reward for an LP in a given pool is bounded by the amount staked in that pool (amount staked * WPY, where WPY = 1.5717%). Up until the fix, we’d only been bounding APY globally (stake of all LPs at once), rather than locally ( per-LP per-pool). We caught this bug, and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/commit/57f9662afce25412c3e186e0f48a2df68b1d396a">fixed&nbsp;it</a>.</p><p>Practically speaking, this meant that 5570.59 OCEAN was dispensed, rather than the 10000.0 OCEAN available. This is because in the pools that had consume volume, stakers didn’t stake enough to hit the max rewards. In fact, of the &gt;3M OCEAN staked in Ocean Market, &gt;1M was staked on pools which had no consumes at all. The rewards not dispensed remain in the OceanDAO treasury for future DF rewards or other community programs.</p> 4.

<p>At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s some of the latest from our development efforts:</p> Sign-In with Ethereum <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  We're currently in the process of designing and implementing a method of delegating object capabilities to a session key using a SIWE message. For more on session keys, check out:  <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/from-sign-in-with-ethereum-to-session-keys/">  From Sign-In with Ethereum to Session Keys  Session keys let users root all their digital interactions to their keys.  SpruceWayne Chang    </a>  We are currently working various fixes across our libraries such as an update for our Discourse plugin, updating some of our examples, and are in the process of releasing <code>v2.0.4</code> of our SIWE core library.   As mentioned in our previous update, our <a href="http://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/">community run identity</a> server via the ENS DAO has had a witnessed deployment and is currently set up on Cloudflare along with relevant access for witnesses. Additionally, the Sign-In with Ethereum documentation has been updated to point to this new server.  We are currently finishing work with a major wallet on a direct Sign-In with Ethereum integration, and are currently working on how Sign-In with Ethereum can support non-standard verification methods.   We're currently working on a new, ergonomic way to use Sign-In with Ethereum and session management for applications, and are currently in the process of setting up beta testing. If you're interested in trying this out, <a href="mailto:hello@spruceid.com">please get in touch</a>.   Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  We've rewrote the core SDK functionality in Rust, refactored out some core definitions from <code>kepler</code> to <code>kepler-lib</code>, and added support for CACAO-ZCAPs (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/116">kepler #116</a>)   We've implemented better bundling of the Wasm SDK dependency to improve developer experience, removing the need for specific configuration downstream. (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler-sdk/pull/40">kepler-sdk #40</a>)   SpruceID <p>SpruceID is a decentralized identity toolkit that provides everything you need for signing, sharing, and verifying trusted information.</p> DIDKit   We've added a basic UCAN implementation that takes advantage of <code>ssi</code>'s JWT/JWS and DID tools. (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/447">ssi#447</a>).  Various minor improvements and fixes.   Rebase   We have deployed the first demo example of a Rebase frontend that allows users to go through various workflows that result in the user receiving a valid Verifiable Credential.   The demo features credential workflows for Twitter accounts, GitHub accounts, DNS ownership, and demonstrating ownership over two Ethereum wallets.   We've fully documented the architecture, and have added guides on implementing new signers, witness flows, and schemas. This information will also be added to the core SpruceID documentation.   Our next step here is to contribute this codebase to the Rebase community initiative, allowing any organization to issue Rebase credentials.   Standards and Community   We congratulate the Decentralized Identity community on the DID-core specification moving forward to become a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/06/DIDRecommendationDecision.html">W3C recommendation</a>.    <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web. Through SpruceID and Kepler, Spruce provides an ecosystem of open source tools for developers that let users collect their data in one place that they control, and show their cards however they want.

 Vinay Gupta, CEO of Mattereum and Ethereum launch co-ordinator in 2015 looks at how to survive the Crypto Winter and come out the other end with new&nbsp;purpose <p>Around 2017 I was looking at starting a VC fund. I didn’t know exactly how to do it: I’d worked in a fund in the 1990s but there was a lot about the business I did not understand at the&nbsp;time.</p><p>As part of the research, I put about 100 people through their first VR experience. I wanted to figure out if it was time to invest in VR projects. It was market research.</p><p>I came to the conclusion that we were years away from VR being a workable technology. The hardware was clearly ready: Oculus Rift was a little clunky but it was the Apple IIe of VR: the thing that tells you The Revolution is Coming. That was&nbsp;fine.</p><p>But the software was appalling. Back in the day they made movies by putting a camera on a tripod and doing a stage play in front of it. It took decades to make movies. A whole new art form (cinematography) had to be invented. Shocking and amazing things happened decade after decade for a century to get us to where cinema is now. Those changes were often driven by technology, but they were delivered by actors and directors portraying the human experience in new ways, creating ever-more-compelling works. VR is not ready for artistic reasons, far more than for technical ones. I could go on about this for some hours, but the lack of a “virtual cinematography” makes most VR experiences as compelling as watching CCTV footage of mall parking lots. It does not matter if I’m looking at the wheat fields of Gondor and scouting for Nazgul, if it’s not telling me a story I don’t want to&nbsp;know.</p><p>Also violence is overwhelmingly overpowering in VR. It’s literally just too much and reducing the violent content of our video games to the point that it doesn’t traumatize people to play (Arizona Sunshine, I’m looking at you here) is also going to take&nbsp;time.</p><p>So my prediction is this: the Metaverse is going to fail. The pandemic is more-or-less over, people are back out in the world again, and everybody loves this place! The stay-at-home culture which VR is fundamentally rooted in doesn’t provide the lived experiences which people want. There is something very much like VR which people do want, but until VR has solved the artistic problems of storytelling in the virtual medium it’s just chat rooms with better graphics. I have an Meta Quest II, and it’s gathering dust: there’s just nothing to *do* in&nbsp;there.</p><p>Not yet.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/w0000CE0/status/1537401568328404993">@w0000CE0</a></p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, we have inflation. To inflate. The state of things being inflated.</p><p>The bubble of all&nbsp;bubbles.</p><p>Folks don’t remember inflation.</p>Source: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html</a><p>Realistically the <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts">US inflation rate is about 12%</a> right now, if it’s calculated using the same measures used back in the day. If that stays up for four years, each dollar in circulation loses half of its&nbsp;value.</p><p>The whole economy goes through what the Ethereum community has gone through in the last few weeks, over a couple of years. It is devastating. In theory wages adjust to keep up with inflation, and interest rates too. Practically speaking without strong labour unions to negotiate, workers get poorer year-on-year.</p><p>Pair that up with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/09/global-supply-chain-crisis-fuels-push-to-local-manufacturing-as-chinas-appeal-dims">global supply chain crisis</a>, including food, and you’ve got <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1119752">a recipe for global disaster</a>.</p><p>The middle class don’t just get to retreat into the virtual world. There’s nothing there that anybody&nbsp;wants.</p><p>No, we have to stand our ground and fight for the real world: it’s where we&nbsp;live.</p><p>The metaverse is not going to save us. If we re-inflate the tech-hype bubble around the metaverse, it’ll produce a brief flare of innovation, some very inflated prices for assets which are inherently extremely volatile, and another flame-out like the one that we’re in, just a couple of years down the road (at most.) I quite liked <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-axs-price-risks-deeper-losses-despite-90-drawdown-already">play to earn as a concept</a>. It didn’t seem inherently bonkers to me that the age-old practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming">gold farming</a> could be modernized by crypto into something that allowed essentially independent operators to do it in a defi way. But it’s stuck in the <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa">Perez spin cycle</a>, along with everything else, and people in developing world countries are losing their entire livelihood in this&nbsp;chaos.</p><p>We have to change how this&nbsp;works.</p><p>We have to take the hard path now: we have to start building the kind of wealth that Warren Buffet can understand, the rebuilding that outfits like Southwest Airlines specialized in.</p><p>We have to learn how to make&nbsp;money.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/build-back-better-8a1be80623b2">Build Back Better!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><br>
Introduction</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The main value of a platform such as Uber or AirBnB is that it reduces transactions costs for participants that use their network.</p>
<p>Before smartphones with connectivity and good map functionality, it wouldn’t have been economically viable to stand on a street corner and hope that a driver you don’t know would pick you up and take you to a predetermined place. Taxis were really the only solution – but you had to call one beforehand – sometimes far in advance and there was a price to that.</p>
<p>Platforms such as Uber come along and are able to use these technological advances to connect demand and supply, transfer value through cashless exchanges/credit card in-app; and create trust through a rating system. You can look at a platform like AirBnB with a similar lens.</p>
<p>I see what we’re doing in self-sovereign identity as further reducing the costs of business/transactions. And this incremental value value is achieved by reducing trust costs across silos.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image 1 – The cost of establishing trust reduces with the elimination of silos</p>
<p>How can an organization trust that a supplier located hundreds of kilometers away is who they say they are? Or, as a person, how can I verify that the organization receiving my personal data is indeed who I believe them to be?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a fundamental principle which often hinders development in the digital economy: trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the global economy continues to go digital, overcoming the challenges associated with digital identity management is crucial. The ability to accurately identify legal entities represents a huge part of that effort. Only by establishing trust between legal counterparties can the true benefits of a digitally enabled world be realized.</p>

 Helping data providers to package, price and market their&nbsp;data <p>With the latest version of Ocean Protocol — OceanONDA V4 live, we are announcing a new initiative to accelerate the adoption of Ocean as the orchestration layer for Data and AI. The Ocean Data Bounty program seeks to expedite the shift into a New Data Economy by incentivising data-driven insights and the building of algorithms on datasets geared toward solving complex business challenges.</p><p>This blog post gives an overview of 1) Ocean’s vision driving the program, 2) Ocean bounty phases, and 3) Expected process and benefits.</p><p>Preamble</p><p>Everyone has data but few know how to package, price and market the data. Research has shown that the entire value chain for data sharing is fraught with mistrust, risk and uncertainty. Data providers are very open to exploring data sharing but they are also looking for best practices and guidance because the Data Economy is nascent and data sharing is not a core business activity.</p><p>Our analyses have shown that the context around the data determines data pricing and packaging. Data is useful depending on who the end consumer is and what they need the data&nbsp;for.</p><p>To Build Trust — Develop Context Around&nbsp;Data</p><p>On its surface, data is simply a collection of numbers, words, images, vectors, etc. It is only when data is presented with a context that it becomes meaningful. With the proper context, decisions can be made based on the data but also based on what the data means. Data context is the network of connections among data points. Those connections may be created as metadata or simply identified and correlated. Contextual metadata adds value, essentially making it possible to receive information from&nbsp;data.</p><p>Context around data can be established when the following questions are answered:</p>  What could my data be used&nbsp;for?  How can I give data consumers more confidence prior to making a buy decision?  How can the data be combined with other data&nbsp;sources?  What are the most useful analytics, reports and algorithms that could be built around the&nbsp;data?  Which communities and industries might the data&nbsp;help?  What specific problems could the data be used to&nbsp;solve?  What is the most appropriate pricing model for a customer&nbsp;segment?  <p>If data context questions are answered, then fit-for-function data packaging and pricing schemes can be built around the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Source: Chris Dixon,&nbsp;a16z</p><p>As the diagram above hints, if several contexts of use can be established for different user groups, then multiple pricing schemes and products can be developed to capture and generate maximum economic value creation for everyone.</p><p>Examples of Various Contexts for a&nbsp;Dataset</p><p>With the release of OceanONDA V4 and the new tools that allow for more frictionless data sharing on blockchain technology, the following opportunities present themselves:</p>  Existing data providers can tap new markets or add a new distribution channel for their data services by leveraging web3.  New data providers can learn the various contexts around their data, to help them decide how to package, price and market their&nbsp;data.  Researchers can access fresh, private, untapped data — to test out their skills and generate novel algorithms, analytics and&nbsp;reports.  <p>Introducing the Ocean Data Bounty&nbsp;Program</p><p>To accelerate the shift into a new Data Economy, Ocean Protocol is launching the Ocean Data Bounty to data&nbsp;owners.</p><p>Data owners will provide data samples and schemas to Ocean’s 250,000-strong community of data scientists and crypto-enthusiasts, who will then be given the challenge to submit ideas on how the data could be used, combine the data with other datasets to generate novel insights, write algorithms and analytics against the data and even identify real-world problems that can be solved using the data. Each Ocean Data Bounty will also be promoted/featured outside the Ocean community, with targeted/relevant communities of researchers and data scientists.</p><p>It’s our contribution to discover and nudge along the learning so that the adoption of web3 can be accelerated.</p><p>The 3 phases of Ocean Data&nbsp;Bounty</p><p>We envision this program to be executed in 3 different stages: Ideation, Algorithm, and Problem-Solving.</p><p>Bounty Phases</p><p>Phase I — Ocean Ideation Bounty: The objective will be to gather ideas and encourage brainstorming on how particular datasets can be used. We will be looking to collect 10–20 ideas for further review from a pool of around 200 submissions that will then be rewarded bounties worth $5,000-$10,000 USD to be paid in&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Phase II — Ocean Algorithms, Analytics, Reports and Narratives Bounty: This second phase of the program will kick off after the successful execution of the ideation bounty where the initially selected ideas will be executed by building around 5–20 algorithms, analytics, reports and narratives on selected data sets. The amount on offer for this bounty will range from $10,000 — $20,000 USD to be paid in&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Phase III — Ocean Problem-Solving Bounty: This shall be the last stage of the bounty program where built algorithms, reports and analytics will be deployed towards the development of proto-products like — dashboard, alerts, monitoring or new data marketplace — all geared towards solving a problem or business challenge.</p><p>These bounty phases have been designed to help data owners discover these various contexts for their data; build a community around the data and then turn ideas into commercializable reality.</p><p>Ocean Data Bounty Process and&nbsp;Benefits</p><p>Publishers are invited to bring datasets to be evaluated by the core Ocean team. The bounty scope will be defined and then launched for the Ocean community. Submissions will be assessed and the next challenge will be defined and issued soon&nbsp;after.</p><p>With the Ocean bounty program, we want data providers and data scientists to benefit&nbsp;in:</p>  Familiarizing themselves with Web3 and cryptocurrency in a safe&nbsp;manner  Engaging the Ocean community of data scientists and crypto-enthusiasts to win prizes and contribute to Ocean’s&nbsp;adoption  Build context around data, toward commercializable business&nbsp;models  <p>We want to expose the latent potential of data to activate new discoveries, products, and services.</p><p>Final notes</p><p>Data alone, without context, is worthless. In specific contexts, data has immense value. The Ocean Data Bounty program is designed to help data owners discover various contexts for their data; build a community around the data and then turn ideas into commercializable reality.</p><p>Our global Ocean community can engage with real, live data to test their skills, deliver value and vie for&nbsp;prizes.</p><p>Ocean technology will get road-tested and hardened, with new features and functionalities identified to allow broader adoption and access over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The Data Bounty program will help build a framework for commercializing new data sources by optimizing the assessment, packaging, cleaning, pricing and context building around&nbsp;data.</p><p>Our mission is to accelerate the shift to a new Data Economy and onboard new data providers faster and in a scalable&nbsp;manner.</p><p>*For the purpose of this blog post, the terms data owners, providers and publishers have been used synonymously.*</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Vinay Gupta, CEO of Mattereum and Ethereum launch co-ordinator in 2015 looks at the latest Crypto Winter and how we got&nbsp;here. <p>Once again, crypto winter is upon us. Depending on how you count this is my fifth or eighth. Back in the 1990s there was ITAR and the crypto wars, where the US Federal Government basically killed the industry in America, back when crypto was a thing you did to emails not a shorthand for privately issued anonymous digital cash. The early days of bitcoin, when it hit thirty-something dollars then crashed to four and stayed there. The 2016 DAO crisis. I’ve seen it&nbsp;all.</p><p>I want to talk about how we wound up where we are today, and how we get off this nightmare ride of boom-and-bust cycles which are psychologically trashing our industry and making it so hard to build enduring value. We can stop the bleeding, but we have to be&nbsp;smart.</p> The psychology of the boom-bust innovation cycle. <p>Here’s <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/2018-year-in-preview-the-future-of-cryptocurrency-b99110480ff0">the piece I wrote in 2017 about the 2018 crypto winter</a>. Some of you may remember it. It lays out the same basic case I’m going to make here: crypto wins by solving problems that nobody else can solve, profitably. It has to win at three levels to&nbsp;survive:</p>  Ordinary people have to use&nbsp;it  It has to generate actual value, not just move value&nbsp;around  Governments have to tolerate it or use it themselves — either one will&nbsp;do  <p>If we can’t hit all three of those criteria WANGMI. We’re building a technology that needs a billion regular users to survive. The constants are huge: big engineering teams, big marketing budgets, complex legal and regulatory work. It all costs money and the only thing that can sustain the industry is real economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>It is still <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/02/16/warren-buffett-invested-1-billion-crypto-bank/">Warren Buffet</a>’s world — literally, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/berkshire-hathaway/marketcap/">he owns it</a>. His way of analyzing the world is to look at the fundamental valuation and profitability of assets. He’s so good at it, his company has roughly the same market cap as Ethereum had a couple of years ago. But Buffet’s company doesn’t 10x up and 4x down every couple of years: it’s plodded along fairly reliably for decades, incrementally growing&nbsp;value.</p><p>Now, you’ve gotta ask yourself, “why can’t Warren Buffet see crypto?” And it’s not because he’s old or doesn’t get tech. No, it’s because he’s smart about <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp">financial fundamentals</a>.</p><p>That’s all that boring stuff&nbsp;like:</p>  How much food will come out of the&nbsp;ground?  What’s the global market for machine tools going to look like next&nbsp;year?  How fast are people moving to the&nbsp;cities?  <p>Thinking about this stuff really carefully is how you figure out when a real-world asset is under-valued.</p><p>Buying things which are under-valued is how Warren Buffet makes&nbsp;money.</p><p>But Warren Buffet won’t buy bitcoin at any price. So we have to think about that. What do we know that Warren Buffet&nbsp;doesn’t?</p><p>Now let me introduce another big thinker about finance: <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/people/carlota-perez">Carlotta Perez</a>. Perez is good at valuing bubbles. Specifically, she’s good at thinking about how bubbles create value in the long run even though they all pass through horrible periods like&nbsp;this.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/">https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/</a></p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting</a></p><p>What Perez says, roughly, is that bubbles build infrastructure. There’s a massive surge of irrational enthusiasm during which water flows uphill, capital flows into the most improbable things, and the future seems so close you can touch it. Warren Buffet hates this stuff because it involves guessing about the future. During that initial lift, during the innovation burn period, the G-force is like sitting in a plane at take-off. It hits you right in the base of your spine. Here we&nbsp;go!</p><p>Then a little later nearly everyone goes bankrupt.</p><p>Then a bunch of grown-ups who know how to run business move in, buy up all the assets cheap, and turn all of this technological potential into profitable businesses.</p><p>It’s a fundamental change in the nature of the people that run the industry: it goes from innovators to operators. Risk tolerance goes way down because the technology already works but it needs people who can operate it profitably.</p><p>My company, <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> is in the middle of that process of transformation right now as our business team takes more and more responsibility for running the business, and the original innovators are now more integrated into product development and sales. Usually companies don’t make that transition under their own power — somebody has to come in and fire the CEO — but in our case we knew enough about how businesses really run to make those changes under our own power (without anyone firing&nbsp;me).</p><p>I’ll introduce a few members of our new senior leadership team in another Medium post&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>So we’ve been through basically six rounds of the Perez cycle in crypto in the past 15 years. These things come on each-other thick and fast. An enormous amount of underlying technological, financial and even social innovation has happened.</p>  Bitcoin  Altcoins  Ethereum  ICOs  Defi  NFTs  <p>And at the end of that we’re left with a rough copy of about a third of the global financial system. You could just about put together a mortgage loan and buy a house as an NFT if you really put your mind to it. It would take work and connections, but you could just about buy real estate as an NFT today, with financing. Mattereum is of course going to make that a lot easier real soon, but let’s deal with things as they are rather than as they’re going to&nbsp;be.</p><p>So in every one of these rounds of the Perez cycle we can see the future as clearly as all the folks who went bust installing “dark fiber” optic cables in the ground. About 20 years ago companies ploughed billions into the ground to lay fiber optic cables that nobody needed or would pay for. It was THE FUTURE. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/11/fiber-optic/">Then everybody went bankrupt</a>, grown ups bought the assets for a song, and slowly started to operate the fibre profitably. Same thing happened with airlines: again and again and again Southwest Airlines acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Southwest_Airlines">bankrupt airlines for a song</a>, with planes and routes, and operated them profitably.</p><p>In crypto we run this cycle super fast and with the same people in the room on each cycle. But the field keeps growing and changing, and all these ups and downs result in a most “interesting” phenomena: the All Time&nbsp;High.</p><p>During the All Time High, at crypto events, every single person in the room has made money. Everybody. You bought in yesterday, you’ve already made $5. You bought in six months ago and you look like a genius. The money just seems to take care of&nbsp;itself.</p><p>During a dip the “newbies” have lost money; the least socially connected 10% or 20% of the people in the room bought, then it dipped, and the old hands are buying at the current price. The newbies are a bit twitchy but the old hands are all looking greedy rather than fearful, and life goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>During a crash, and all-importantly after a crash, 70% of the people in the room have lost money. Some of them have lost 70% of what they invested: they took real money out of bricks-and-mortar assets and bought hype tickets, and then got rekt, to use current parlance. And in these periods the old hands aren’t buying anything; they’re sitting on their winnings and waiting for the rally somewhere on down the&nbsp;line.</p><p>The NFT space is now in this condition. At <a href="https://www.nft.nyc/">NYC.NFT</a> in June 2022 the mood was mordant. People have lost a lot of money, and they wonder if they’re ever going to make it back. Remember 2018, Ethereum people? The ICO craze had blown over because the massive promises made by those projects had failed to materialize, and people were gloomy as all hell. A long time passed until <a href="https://oecdonthelevel.com/2022/01/31/from-defi-summer-to-crypto-winter-leverage-liquidations-and-policy-implications/">Defi Summer</a> in 2020, and then the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">2021 NFT take-off a year&nbsp;ago</a>.</p><p>Most of the new folks in the space haven’t seen crypto winter before. 70% or so of the people in the room have lost money. The mood is down, down,&nbsp;down.</p><p>Welcome to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Revolutions_and_Financial_Capital">Perez Cycle</a>, kids. I’m sorry to be seeing you down here in the gutter one more time, but you’ll find a lot of old friends here, survivors of previous rounds of the&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>We stick together.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa">Winter Has Come</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Announcing the Launch of Veriscope 2.0 — A State Machine with An Enhanced VASP Experience  VASPs now have better and more flexible control over their p2p communications <p>We are very excited to announce the launch of the Veriscope State Machine. This major update enables counterparties, i.e., Originator VASPs and Beneficiary VASPs, to have better control over their peer-to-peer communications.</p><p>The update also enables VASPs to subscribe to several new webhook events that will trigger a response on their end, which includes instances such as a VASP requesting a signature or KYC/IVMS data and when a VASP receives or accepts encrypted IVMS data. Here, InterVASP Messaging Standard, known popularly as IVMS, refers to a framework set by the crypto ecosystem to standardize the exchange of Travel Rule&nbsp;data.</p><p>The new version of Veriscope includes improvements to how VASPs send encrypted KYC/IVMS data along with signature data, how they accept or reject an IVMS transfer, and allow them to subscribe to several new webhook events that will trigger a response on their&nbsp;end.</p><p>The Veriscope team is committed to providing the best-in-class Travel Rule solution to the industry; these key enhancements are a result of iterative testing between the team and participating VASPs during the integration testing phase. With this new launch, Veriscope once again demonstrates that it’s a solution built side-by-side with VASPs, taking their feedback and incorporating it into the product to serve them&nbsp;better.</p> Not Compatible With Previous Veriscope Version <p>The “State Machine” is a brand new release. Hence, it won’t support the previous iteration of Veriscope. VASPs using the earlier versions of Veriscope will have to upgrade to the new version before going live on the mainnet. This means that VASPs using earlier versions of Veriscope must delete the existing KYC templates &amp; implement the new webhook&nbsp;events.</p><p>Run the following command for the&nbsp;upgrade:</p> What’s Changed for the&nbsp;VASPs?  Flexible P2P Data Transfers <p>With the launch of the new “State Machine,” P2P Travel Rule data transfer between VASPs is much more flexible. Now, either VASPs (oVASP or bVASP) can share KYC/IVMS data first, and any of them can accept or reject a virtual asset transfer&nbsp;request.</p> Automated Processing Through Several new Webhook&nbsp;Events <p>The new version includes several webhook events that will automate transaction processing for VASPs. Some of the new webhooks are “Signature data requested,” “KYC data requested,” “Encrypted IVMS received,” and “Transfer accepted or rejected.”</p> Three new States to Keep Both oVASPs &amp; bVASPs Better Informed About the Status of Their Transactions <p>The three new states introduced in the latest update are KYC templates, which the VASP can update/accept/reject, data requests, and encrypted IVMS.</p> Proof of Address Coming&nbsp;Soon <p>Address Proofs (POAs) are currently in the development phase and will be made available soon.</p> About Veriscope <p>Veriscope is an open-source, decentralized travel rule solution that allows Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to comply with the FATF Travel Rule, preserve data integrity, maintain data sovereignty and enable a frictionless customer experience. It has been designed in collaboration with leading global cryptocurrency exchanges.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network is a public blockchain protocol designed to aggregate, embed, and leverage trust, validation, and discoverability to facilitate public and private data transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks. By encouraging individuals and enterprises to collaborate, Shyft Network successfully adds a layer of context on top of data, ultimately turning raw data into meaningful information.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShyftNetwork">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a> | <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a></p>

<p>The European Union has been looking forward to the rollout of a verified, cross-border digital identity for years now. The European Commission has seen the spread of digital commerce as well as its integration with social media and has rightly deduced that new systems and protections are required as we move into the 21st century. Such an all-encompassing ID certainly can provide benefits to private users as well as big businesses, but there hasn’t been a clear vision as to just what it would look&nbsp;like.</p><p>The ideas so far put forward found insufficient traction, and that sent regulators back to the drawing board. However, with the release of an updated framework comes an opportunity. The new techniques and ideas that are necessary to bring about such an identification system are already present in the Nuggets verified Self-Sovereign Identity platform.</p><p>eIDAS 1.0 Explained</p><p>The Electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS</a>) is an EU regulatory framework designed to govern both electronic identification and general trust services in the world of electronic commerce. Established in 2014, eIDAS comes along with the European Commission’s (ECs) broader mission outlined in Europe’s “<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/64/digital-agenda-for-europe">Digital Agenda</a>.” The ultimate purpose of this endeavor is to push innovation and generally bring the EU into the 21st&nbsp;century.</p><p>eIDAS specifically calls for the Union-wide adoption of a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Digital Identity</a>. Under this system, all citizens are given their own unique, verifiable digital credentials. These can then be used to securely access services online and offline across the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>This is not a brand-new development, and a public service-only version of this model is already being rolled out, but the adoption rate of this first attempt has been fairly poor. Only about ⅔ of EU citizens even live in a country that has enabled such an ID, and they don’t yet all work together. To add to the problems, there has also been some <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/244763/eIDAS-policy%20paper-EW+EDRi.pdf">general resistance</a> to the move, with detractors pointing out the potential abuses surrounding both user autonomy and general&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>It also doesn’t help things that the events of 2020 and 2021 have left an irreversible mark on society and how people interact with it. This all has led to the EC deciding to go back to the beginning and reimagine what this regulation really needs to look&nbsp;like.</p><p>How To Fix What Was&nbsp;Wrong</p><p>Those who have opposed the original framework for this universal eID have pointed to a variety of concerns, so let’s take a look at what those are right now. First of all, in its original form, the regulation described a unique ID that was linked to all aspects of a person and would ultimately follow them for their entire life. There wasn’t enough wording to describe how things like privacy or separation of different types of information would work, leaving the door open for companies to be able to see far too much, and the user could only do little about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Then there was the concerning part of the proposal that called for governments to be able to implement a form of “kill switch” on any given ID. The stated purpose was to cut off funding should illegal activity or terrorist financing be detected, but many still felt this was too far of a stretch. The possibilities for abuse or even honest mistakes leading to the “deletion” of a person in the system were just too troubling.</p><p>Lastly, the eID described in the original version also isn’t well optimized for the variety of use cases it has in the private sector. Too many limitations and complexities meant it couldn’t be an all-in-one solution for both public and personal use, and other IDs would likely be necessary. This will only stand to limit adoption and frustrate the general public. Nobody wants to use one ID to board a plane and another to make a verified purchase.</p><p>Fortunately, EC listened and has put forward a whole new model called <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281&amp;from=EN">eIDAS 2.0</a>. This is being done to address the failings of the original model and hopefully roll out a system that is safe, functional, and ultimately attractive to private citizens, businesses, and governments alike.</p><p>What To Expect From eIDAS&nbsp;2.0</p><p>eIDAS 2.0 will engage with the points of contention that brought criticism to its predecessor. For starters, this new framework now acknowledges the role of self-sovereign identity (SSI). The benefits of SSI sit with ownership and control of the individuals’ personal information. Additionally, having been based upon decentralized blockchain technology, eIDAS 2.0 is based upon concepts of reusability and interoperability.</p><p>This also brings in the added benefit of curbing the control that big tech companies like Facebook have over user data. Because of some of the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/facebook-data-misuse-and-voter-manipulation-back-in-the-frame-with-latest-cambridge-analytica-leaks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANwD9oHPeAK03BBZ9yYuCXw1IEvzo_AMDnfJb4QO-eYl-lSgMHRnSQrZajYX-QZkxLW2A9ObWuw_Ti1lV1GYZxhJeqFH1vksmcuWeIqPx6N4A3nbNAb3oN8RFV_QC3gLHmdlZ3GLc18Y5YEO45mX5q3Qj5tshPn3qZjbk2vqU6l">issues</a> surrounding how social media platforms handle this information, it is imperative that this new eIDAS system doesn’t hand them, even more, control and instead takes it away. This is especially true as eIDAS 2.0 is designed to incorporate many more types of personal data than any ID ever has&nbsp;before.</p><p>According to the legislation itself, any such ID would have to contain the bare minimum of the following information: name, address, age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality, educational qualifications, titles and licenses, professional qualifications, public permits and licenses, and financial and company&nbsp;data.</p><p>However, the potential use for SSIs goes way beyond these basic elements and can include things like medical history, purchasing, and browsing preferences. With strict measures in place that only allow this data to be accessed when and where the user&nbsp;decides.</p><p>As long as the end-user has final control over the private keys tied to their ID, then this system stands to empower them. This is likely the key to the broader adoption that the EC is looking for in such an eID. We’ve outlined many of the reasons and features that the new eIDAS will encompass, but how will it actually be developed? Well, fortunately, this is where Nuggets comes&nbsp;in!</p><p>How Nuggets Makes It All&nbsp;Work</p><p>Nuggets have already developed a multi-award-winning, verified self-sovereign digital identity and payment platform that can provide a persistent, interoperable, and verified digital identity. This new platform is designed for and compatible with Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and the rising Metaverse. In addition to verified digital identities, Nuggets also offers a personal cloud vault and auditable data.</p><p>This means that anyone using an SSI can demonstrate zero-knowledge proofs or selective disclosure of the minimum amount of data required for proof of identity or access instead of revealing everything and having to leave it behind. Combine this with verifiable credentials that cryptographically prove the validity of any information provided, a win-win situation for users and providers, and create a safer environment all&nbsp;around.</p><p>This stands to be the ubiquitous solution that is being described by the eIDAS 2.0 legislation. Because our platform is transnational, all credentials will be accessible anywhere with an internet connection. There is no need to “reinvent the wheel;” Nuggets already offers everything that the EC is looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>To make this system work, this SSI leverages a variety of technologies to bring to life the ideas outlined for eIDAS 2.0. For example, in order to limit access to data while still delivering verifiable proof of authenticity, Nuggets employs what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs</a>. This technique means that the ID can deliver an unfalsifiable confirmation of a person’s identification or right to access something without revealing the underlying data. ZK Proofs form a major cornerstone of how these IDs will bring full control of private information back to the users without sacrificing security for the platforms they engage&nbsp;with.</p><p>Furthermore, Nuggets leverages biometric data, such as a fingerprint or iris scan, to link these SSIs to the only person whom they represent. This will make it virtually impossible for anyone besides the actual individual to use them. Combining this type of veracity with ZK Proofs is how absolute validation is possible while still obscuring the underlying biometrics from any third&nbsp;party.</p><p>Nuggets packages all of these techniques with other powerful protocols, like W3C verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and the encrypted communication standards of DIDComm. By bringing together all of these features, Nuggets is safe to use as a personal financial wallet. What this also means is that consumers can confirm things like age or prove that they have a sufficient minimum balance to, for example, make a purchase or take out a loan all without ever having to reveal their actual bank account information.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We couldn’t be happier to hear that the European Commission has decided to revamp its outline for a European Digital Identity with eIDAS 2.0. Nuggets has already built a system that meets all of its specifications and even more. The platform is ready to use and easy for consumers to interface with. We fully support the need and possibilities that this new type of identification system can offer and can’t wait to bring verifiable, autonomous services to citizens in the EU and&nbsp;beyond.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/working-european-commissions-eidas-2-0-aligns-perfectly-with-nugget-s-technology-and-vision-996909bf9a36">Working: European Commission’s eIDAS 2.0 Aligns Perfectly with Nugget’s Technology and Vision</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining. Today, we are going to hear now what is next for identity and access management. And we have a guest who really does a lot of research and training and consultancy about specifically identity and access management. Our guest today is Simon Moffatt. He is Founder and Analyst at The Cyber Hut, a leading boutique industry research, analysis, and advisory firm focused on identity, access, and cybersecurity technology.</p>
<p>He has more than 20-year career experience within the identity and access management space, having worked for consultancies, start-ups, and global software vendors. He is a published author and contributor to identity standards as the likes of NIST and the IETF. He’s also fellow of the Chartered Institute of Information Security. His long running research is focused upon next generation authorisation and emerging authentication technologies, as well as having an interest in the history of code breaking, signals intelligence, and cyber warfare operations.</p>
<p>Hello, Simon.</p>
<p>Simon Moffatt: Hi, Oscar. How are we doing? It’s great to be here today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Pretty good. It’s a pleasure talking with you, Simon. So definitely, we want to hear what’s coming in identity and access management. So yeah, let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. And first, we would like to hear a bit more about yourself, especially what was your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, thanks. It’s such a fascinating area, identity. I’ve been fortunate to have been in it for just over 20 years, which is a little bit scary when I say that out loud. But I guess like any technology in any sort of technology trend, 20 years is an absolute lifetime. And there’s been so many changes in actual products that are available, the standards, how technology is used, it seems an absolute world away.</p>
<p>But I started my career back in 2001, working in industry, like most people probably do when they when they start their careers. And I was working for a large insurance company in the UK for three or four years. And I was essentially doing identity by hand. I was creating accounts on RACF mainframe, I was setting up access control profiles, and TSO IDs and job control language stuff, all this crazy stuff on the mainframe. And having to do this by hand, there was no sort of automation involved in account creation and managing permissions and things. And it was quite an eye-opening experience at the age of 20 odd, I guess, you know the starting my career doing all of these, these processes by hand, which were time consuming, really labour intensive, really error prone. And it was a really interesting sort of introduction to identity and management if you like.</p>
<p>And then essentially, from there, I spent a bit of time in consultancy. And then I ended up the vast majority of my career working for software vendors, making software to rid the world of all of those manual processes of having to set up accounts by hand and having to manage permissions and access management and single sign-on and authentication and all that stuff. And really had a good 14, 15 years building software in those landscapes around provisioning systems, governance and compliance, role-based access control, obviously more latterly, on things like authentication and MFA, and zero trust and some of the buzzing words which have become more prolific.</p>
<p>But it’s just been quite an interesting journey to go from doing everything by hand and doing it manually to sort of working on automating that stuff, really. And it’s just been good to see identity now become a really accepted part of the enterprise landscape. I think 20 years ago, for example, it was something which it wasn’t particularly automated, it sat within IT operations, and it was just something organisations had to do.</p>
<p>Whereas I think today, in 2022, identity is so pervasive, and it powers the consumer identity lifecycle, it’s integrating with IoT and privacy and a whole host of other things around defence and cyber warfare and all host of with the different angle’s identity is now taking. So, it’s been a bit of a privilege to being in a sector for so long and seeing all those changes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s quite interesting when you say that doing identity and access management by hand, right? It’s hard to imagine today. It will be crazy if someone does still by hand today. We have now, of course, the standards, we have the software who does that. Yeah, interesting. And also, one of the last things you said is that it started with IT, right? You were an IT manager or IT specialist when you are doing this by hand, but today, actually I think a lot of the identity and access management is not done anymore by IT, correct?</p>
<p>Simon: I think that’s a really, yeah, really good observation. I think when I started, it was definitely within the IT, the infrastructure operations part of the business. And I think, today, even in the B2E, the employee identity infrastructure, it’s very separate, it’s very different. There are their own identity specialists, identity architects, identity leads, maybe even Chief Identity Officers, perhaps in some organisations, but it certainly has its own domain. And I think with that brings responsibilities that there are new and different metrics around what success looks like for identity and access management. And then clearly, then we have this whole brand-new area, or more recent area around, things like consumer identity or the identity for devices too and that’s, I guess, driven these needs to have identity as a separate playing field really, it doesn’t just sit within IT anymore.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So now let’s explore some of the research that you have been involved recently. So, tell us about that, what did you discover.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, I mean, so at The Cyber Hut we work on, on looking at, emerging patterns that are happening in the broader identity and access management space. And it’s a pretty exciting space to be because there are so many new emerging themes, standards, use cases, vendors, solution providers, and there’s so much happening in there. But there’s a couple of interesting topics that we’ve been researching over the last sort of six or seven months or so. And one of them we released a report last year, looking at passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>And I think it’s an interesting topic, because we all hate passwords as end users and as consumers and as employees. But yet we use passwords every day. Every day of our lives, we log into to all of our web services, websites, our employee directories, our laptops, everything is still dominated by passwords and shared secrets. And this age-old way of authenticating. It’s been there since the mid ’70s when computing started its commercial journey. And I think we’ve been desperately trying to move away from passwords ever since, the best part of 50 years, I guess. And we still haven’t quite got there.</p>
<p>We started to look at this space and try to look at some of the vendors, and some of the use cases, and the technology that is now available and really trying to understand, are we really getting close now to being able to rid the infrastructure of passwords in its entirety? And it was a fascinating journey, really. And I think the technology is there today, I think there are numerous different solutions, whether it’s based on sort of biometrics, or perhaps standards, like FIDO and WebAuthn that provide us with the tools and techniques to rid ourselves of passwords.</p>
<p>But clearly, there’s a whole host of other factors involved, be it sort of psychological acceptability, the security angles, the integration angles, and so on. So, it was a fascinating journey. I think we are getting closer to killing the password. But unfortunately, we’ve all probably got stories of how we logged in today using the old way of doing it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, we’re hearing all the time of technology for getting rid of passwords. And yeah, hopefully in the near future, we would really be completely rid of passwords. Another topic I think you were exploring was authorisation, correct? Like, next-generation authorisation, so tell us about that.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, authorisation is a fascinating area. I think, on the authentication side, many organisations, that they do invest heavily in authentication technologies, login processes, and biometrics. And it’s interesting, the authorisation, you know, what happens after the person has logged in often was a little bit neglected. It wasn’t necessarily an area which received lots of investment from the enterprise, the number of start-ups involved. It wasn’t particularly huge. It wasn’t a particularly large market.</p>
<p>Whereas I think move forward to 2022, the authorisation has had a huge sort of re-invention, if you like, if that’s not too bold a word, so certainly a pretty extended evolution. And the authorisation aspects, you know, working out what access an individual has, or if the device, what access a device could potentially have, is now suddenly becoming vitally important whether you are talking about the B2E space and employees and how they perhaps operate in a distributed working environment on the back of things like COVID and a pandemic, right through to the consumer angle where we’re talking about privacy and data security there as well.</p>
<p>But authorisation has certainly had a huge re-investment, if you like, or a re-invention over last sort of 36 months, there are numerous different start-ups involved in here, lots of interesting VC funding. I’m really starting to see this emergence of external authorisation platforms and looking at things like adaptive access, contextual access control, and things like zero trust and identity-centric security is, I guess, driving the need to have a strong authorisation platform where you are handling permissions across on-premises systems, cloud systems, APIs, microservices, there’s a whole host of different assets that need to be protected.</p>
<p>And organisations are now figuring out that actually, if they get authorisation right, it allows them as a business to be more agile, allows them to increase the speed that they can deliver applications and services. And clearly, speed and agility are hugely important for most businesses, so they can essentially get to value and get to their customer bases as quick as possible.</p>
<p>So, I think authorisation, yeah, has certainly become vitally important. There is some interest in emerging patterns there around how you protect microservices, leveraging API protection clearly have things like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, which have been around for quite a while in protecting APIs. But there’s certainly interest in extending that and looking at things like contextual access and more dynamic and adaptive ways of giving access to different assets. And I think that that in itself is suddenly becoming very topical and very important I think for many CISOs and CIOs.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, and when authorisation is not a word that you hear so much, let’s say in marketing, at least. So, you don’t see them so much mentioned, you don’t see so much on the website. But for instance, you mentioned contextual access, what was that you mentioned just? What is that concept, for instance?</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, you’re absolutely right. You know, many people, they don’t think of authorisation as an object. They think of the business problem, which is, how do I get my staff or customers to complete a transaction, or gain access to the things that they need to do their job, or maybe perform a transaction online? So, the authorisation aspects, certainly from a contextual authorisation perspective is not just looking at the people involved, the identities involved, and the resources that they want to access. But it’s also starting to look at other data signals as well. So other pieces of information that could be leveraged to help make an authorisation decision.</p>
<p>So, we’re talking about things like the device characteristics, you know, the laptop and the mobile phone, is there anything from those devices that can be leveraged in the authorisation decision, things like device versions, operating system versions? Does the device have antivirus installed, for example, or what type of locking mechanism does the mobile device have? Or what potential apps have been installed on the device? And all of these little, small pieces of context and signalling essentially has helped the authorisation decision process become a lot richer, a lot more informed and allows that process to be more personalised, and more tailored.</p>
<p>And I think this context aspect is now starting to pull in information from the devices but also things like the environment, things like breach credentials, threat intelligence systems, anything really which can amplify the risk analysis process. And I think, if you can pull in more of that context during the authorisation decision, the authorisation output can be much more fine grained as well. And I think we’re certainly starting to move away from this very black and white allow and deny sort of model which we’ve had for a number of years, where, if something is slightly erroneous, or looks slightly risky, there’s a big block and deny comes down, the big 403, or a big interruption into the user journey.</p>
<p>Whereas I think actually, what we’re starting to see now is much more subtle degradation of the service. You may be allowed access, but some of the service may be removed, or perhaps you’re allowed access, but it’s only read only, or perhaps you are allowed access, but perhaps certain fields of the database have been removed, or certain attributes in a payload have been removed, because perhaps you’re on a public Wi-Fi and that has a high level of risk or something similar.</p>
<p>So, I think we’re certainly starting to see this leveraging more information during the authorisation decision. And then the output of that decision is much more fine-grained and much more personalised, I think. It’s just moving away from blocking access entirely to allowing access but… and it’s just having that “but” in there and allowing more personalised experience, I think, it helps the end users and I think it helps the security posture as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can visualise what you explained definitely also reduces friction because you get logged in with some level of authorisation. And of course, based on the algorithms or the system, it might lead you to a closer level of authorisation that you should have maybe it’s not the perfect, but you are logged in you have some level authorisation, and you can do at least part of your job and hopefully don’t need to contact the IT or whoever is administering that.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, exactly. That’s an interesting point as well, it’s allowing people to continue on their journey. And I think that’s become really important, I think, in both the employee space where, in honesty, a lot of people now are working from home, even though that the pandemic is easing. So, you do things remotely, you do things away from a central office. So, it isn’t easy is it to go and speak to the IT helpdesk, for example.</p>
<p>And certainly, in the consumer space as well. Last thing the consumer or the customer wants to do is have their journey interrupted, and they have to go and ring the help desk of their bank or their insurance company, or their, telephone company or whatever. So, I think it’s allowing journeys to continue but applying the necessary friction at the correct time, under the correct risk conditions. I think that that is certainly a winning combination, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. And what trends are you seeing emerge in identity and access management?</p>
<p>Simon: I think there are numerous actually. I think there’s the fact that we have a wonderful podcasts like this and lots of work and research everybody is doing in the community just amplifies that identity is now sort of pervasive. I think it is now the tentacles of identity and now being sort of placed into huge parts of the enterprise, be it data security, endpoint protection, privacy, consumer identity, employee identity, there’s a whole host of research around identity for IoT and identity for devices.</p>
<p>Now, I was at a conference this week in Paris, actually a defence conference. And there’s a whole host of discussions there around leveraging identity and access management and trust and assurance within this sort of space and defence sectors as well. So, under the whole host of research topics to think about. And you know, we talk about ourselves as consumers, and when we think of consumer and identity and consumer interactions, we’re talking about usability, we’re talking about privacy by design.</p>
<p>And these are quite new concepts really if you think about identity and security and that really occurred to most vendors or certainly most systems to think about the usability and the privacy enablement. It was a case of get the system working. And yes, we may think of security afterwards. But certainly now, things like privacy, enablement and privacy by design are vitally important and an identity is a huge part of how that would operate.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. It seems super interesting that now, it’s yeah, concepts like that are already on their agenda, on their minds of many decision makers, it’s fabulous. And seeing a bit more towards the future, let’s say in the next five years, for instance, how do you see now the identity and access management landscape evolving?</p>
<p>Simon: Oh, it’s a great question, isn’t it? As an analyst, you get asked this sort of question quite a lot around what does the future look like, and which technologies or standards are going to die off and which ones are going to survive and become real? And I think it’s always quite difficult to predict. And I think there are certainly some interesting meta trends, I think, certainly, identity is now hugely important to both the security architecture of the modern enterprise, but also things like usability, privacy, business agility. And then all of the enabling technologies that allow businesses to grow and compete and be agile, and to all the things which allow them to be successful. I think that is quite certainly a different way of looking at identity and identity-based security.</p>
<p>Whereas maybe three or four years ago, it was always leveraging technology to be restrictive and preventing bad things happening and stopping the bad guys from doing so. I think we’re definitely moving towards identity as an enabler for business growth. There’s a whole host of technology areas, I guess, things like decentralised everything, you know, decentralised internet, decentralised identity, and distributed identities. And then I guess, empowering the end user to have more control, essentially, over their identity data, be it things like wallets and ownership of how they share their identity data with governments and third-party services. And we’re certainly starting to see this emergence around decentralised identity perhaps is maybe the next way of handling identity information.</p>
<p>But there are certainly the other interesting areas, I mean, do we need things like Chief Identity Officers in the organisation? Interesting conversation I had a few weeks ago about that, you know, do we need to have a C-level executive who looks after identity? Maybe in three or four years we may see that happening as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Is there any now?</p>
<p>Simon: I’m not aware of any who have that particular label. I think certainly some of the larger enterprises, there are certainly executives who are leading the charge for identity, really looking to transform how identity is measured, how it’s reported into either the CISO or the CIO. I’m not sure they have the title, Chief Identity Officer, but it would be interesting to see how that emerges over the next few years though.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, there might be a top executive with kind of similar, very high-profile role in leading identity, especially as you said, in large organisations, but maybe not the CIO.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, we already have one of those. Yeah, yeah. Agreed.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what are the main challenges that need to be solved in this next, let’s say five years, on relatively midterm?</p>
<p>Simon: I think there’s some interesting, I guess, obstacles, which are starting to emerge. I think the pandemic has accelerated lots of different things, technology trends, investment trends. And there are certainly some meta characteristics that have come out of that process. You know, businesses want to be more agile. They want to be more responsive to change external change from the competition, or threats such as COVID-19 and other things.</p>
<p>So, they need to be agile. And what does that mean? Well, they’re going to be driving towards agile methodologies, maybe containerisation, APIs, microservices, outsourcing everything to cloud systems and subscription-based systems. And that all brings a whole magnitude of challenges from an identity perspective and having visibility of your identity infrastructure across hybrid cloud, containers, legacy systems, on-premises systems and so on.</p>
<p>And I think that being able to identify threat across that identity landscape is becoming more of an issue, because essentially, the identity infrastructure is becoming more complex. So how do you handle permissions across a multitude of different systems? How do you embed identity into IoT devices and privacy enablement systems? It’s hard to do that unless you have that visibility across that quite complex landscape.</p>
<p>So, I think there’s lots to do but I think equally, there are some good opportunities now. I think identity is well-known. It’s seen now as a really important part of many enterprises’ digital journey. So, I think there’s work to do, a lot of challenges ahead, but I think there are the right people, the personnel, the training, and standards available to make identity a vital part of every organisation over the next three to five years.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, we expect that will happen. It looks like it’s going in the right direction as you said.</p>
<p>Simon: I think so. I’m hopeful. I’m positive.</p>
<p>Oscar: Simon, we’re almost leading to the end of this interview, I’d like to ask you one final question for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Simon: Oh, wow, wow, can only have one? I could probably give 10 I guess, which probably doesn’t help people, does it? I think it’s just being aware of identity. I think many organisations certainly, particularly, the large organisations probably have identity projects running and technology in place. But even if you’re a smaller organisation, maybe mid-sized enterprise, looking, thinking about things like data security or endpoint security or privacy controls, it’s thinking that identity really is the foundation for those aspects. And just thinking like, thinking about the identity concept, looking at identifying your identity assets within the organisation be that people, permissioning systems, perhaps where you may identify contexts and how you can respond to contextual changes.</p>
<p>But I think just having an understanding of what your identity landscape looks like, I think is a good starting point, you know, where your authoritative sources of directory information are, which piece of context you may need to use, which assets do you want to protect? And I think that seems quite simple, but I think it’s actually it’s quite important because I think a lot of organisations start with a technology first mindset where actually they may want to start with really identifying their identity landscape. And then working out the problems with their identity landscape before they sort of look at technology selection. So, I think like anything just understand your landscape first and that’s a really good, a good starting point.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think it’s a great takeaway. Yeah, thank you for this super interesting conversation. I definitely enjoy hearing your passion about identity. I can feel it all the time when you when you talk, and you absolutely know a lot about this field and you are researching so thank you for sharing all this.</p>
<p>Finally, for our listeners who like to get in touch with you or learn more about what you’re doing, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, of course, it’s great to be here. I am passionate, it’s certainly it’s an exciting area to be in. And I guess the best place, I’m pretty active on social media, so reach out on LinkedIn, or on Twitter, or go direct to The Cyber Hut website at thecyberhut.com. We’re more than happy to reach out and then respond to any questions, comments or just interesting conversations people want to have around identity, we’re always open to those.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot, Simon. And all the best.</p>
<p>Simon: Thank you, Oscar. Thank you. Take care.</p>

  <p>There’s a lot of information floating out there about web security. But when I read through the material, I noticed some information wasn’t up to date, or it was written specifically for traditional server-rendered web applications, or the author recommended anti-patterns. In a series of posts, I will cover web security concerns that all web devs should be aware of, emphasizing client-side applications, namely Single Page Applications (SPAs). Furthermore, I’m not going to get into the nitty-gritty of web security, cryptography, and networking.  Instead, I’ll focus on the main takeaways and high-level to-do lists. I’ll also provide links to resources where you can dive in deeper.</p>

<p>So why do we worry about web security anyway? When we have vulnerabilities in our applications, it’s an avenue for exploitation by bad actors. In the wrong hands, exploiting the vulnerabilities can cause risks to your application, data, reputation, and bottom line. In the words of my coworker <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/authors/aaron-parecki/">Aaron Parecki</a>, it all boils down to one thing—liability. And we don’t want to expose ourselves, our applications, and our companies to liability. If you feel threatened, it’s a good time to read on and identify how to harden your application.</p>

 Use the OWASP Top 10 to identify the most common vulnerabilities 
<p>If you’re new to thinking about security, you may not have heard of the <a href="https://owasp.org/">Open Web Application Security Project</a> (OWASP). OWASP is a group that focuses on making the web a safer place. They maintain and publish a list of the most common web vulnerabilities named the “<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top Ten</a>” and have a new top ten list for 2021; their infographic shows how the top web vulnerabilities have changed from 2017 to 2021.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/">CC-by Open Web Application Security Project</a></p>

<p>As this is a list of web vulnerabilities, the entire list is pertinent to our work as web developers. However, a few critical vulnerabilities call for extra attention, and some vulnerabilities are less susceptible when the front-end is a SPA with a JSON-based backend API.</p>

<p>We will cover some of these vulnerabilities specifically, but I’ll also list general things to keep in mind that feed into the vulnerabilities listed here.</p>

 Leverage your browser and security headers 
<p>First, we need to set the stage for part of our vulnerability mitigation strategy by bringing up security headers. Modern browsers (buh-bye Internet Explorer!!) have a lot of security mechanisms already built in. We have to leverage the built-in security mechanisms and can enhance them with additional security headers. Security headers are HTTP response headers that provide instructions on how the browser should behave. They are defined on your web server.</p>

<p>There are quite a few security headers that we can apply. Something to note, SPAs are unique, so not all security headers apply in the same way as they would for a traditional server-rendered web application. I’ll call out the security headers that you’ll want to use when we discuss how to mitigate a specific vulnerability.</p>

 Dive deeper into security headers 
<p>Here are some great resources to learn more about security headers. Figuring out how to configure the security headers can be esoteric. I like these posts that are short and offer actionable steps to configure security headers.</p>
 
   <a>An Overview of Best Practices for Security Headers</a>

 Securely transport data using TLS/SSL 
<p>Using HTTPS should be the undisputed standard, but there are legacy systems where applications don’t use HTTPS. It’s essential to use the secure hypertext transfer protocol; after all, the HTTPS acronym is appropriately derived from Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. And it’s essential to be secure across your entire stack, not just when serving the front-end site (don’t ask me how I know this can be a thing).</p>

<p>When you don’t use an up-to-date Transport Layer Security within your application system, you expose yourself to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">meddler-in-the-middle attacks (MITM)</a>. In this type of attack, agitators intercept communication between unsecured systems to siphon data or impersonate communicating parties.</p>

<p>You might think this callout to use HTTPS is unnecessary because it’s such a standard for hosting web apps, but <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/">cryptographic failures that cause insecure communication are the second most common vulnerability in the OWASP Top Ten</a>! Note that it’s not enough to slap any old mechanism for HTTPS on your web server. You want a recent version of TLS. Your cloud providers might even force you to upgrade if your TLS version is old, which is good!</p>

<p></p>

<p>– <a href="https://xkcd.com/2634/">xkcd</a></p>

<p>What’s the takeaway here? Specifically, you’ll want to make sure you have functioning certificates, ensure you’re using the latest version of TLS, and make sure you use SSL/TLS over your entire stack. All of these steps might already be covered by your cloud hosting provider. You should also verify you’ve added the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) security header to the web server, which adds an extra layer of security beyond HTTPS redirection.</p>

 Keep your framework and external dependencies up to date 
<p>You knew this was coming, even though we might lament the work involved to stay up to date. The advice to update your dependencies sounds like “Don’t forget to floss,” but it’s essential (just like flossing). <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/">Vulnerable and outdated components take the sixth spot in the OWASP Top Ten list</a>. And there were some significant vulnerabilities from dependencies in the news recently. So you know deep down that burying your head in the sand is not a good action plan.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that we should update outdated components and ensure we don’t accidentally depend on a vulnerable dependency. We should pin dependency versions in our <code>package.json</code> and then generate and enforce the use of a lock file. That means running <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm i</code> to force the exact versions defined in the <code>package-lock.json</code>. If you use Yarn, you will use <code>yarn install --frozen-lockfile</code>. This way, updating versions is an intentional act.</p>

<p>That’s it. Just do it. It’s important. Outdated components are a source of liability.</p>

 Dive deeper into keeping your components up to date 
<p>Check out a step-by-step guide on dependency management for JavaScript developers by the OWASP team - <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/NPM_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html">NPM Security best practices</a>.</p>

 Load resources securely 
<p>Cross-origin resources are a particular concern for SPAs; this refers to resources your web app uses that are not hosted on the same origin as your web application. When all the resources the front-end needs are available through the same origin, we have confidence that the resources are secure. Hopefully, we’re not pwning ourselves! At least not intentionally, right?!</p>

<p>A typical pattern for setting up URLs for SPA communicating to back-end APIs might look like the following, where your front-end is</p>

   <code>https://myfavekdramas.com
</code>   

<p>and the back-end API URL is</p>

   <code>https://apis.myfavekdramas.com
</code>   

<p>But the API URL is a subdomain, so the request is cross-origin. Most browsers (once again BUH-BYE Internet Explorer!) protect us by allowing only specific cross-origin requests. We can configure resource access by enabling Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS).</p>

<p>Between your production environment setup resembling the above URLs, and local development using different ports for your front-end and back-end, you might be tempted to enable CORS to allow all sorts of requests. Unlike other security measures covered in this post, your browser already protects you in the strictest way possible. Enabling CORS loosens that restriction.</p>

<p>So the advice is to enable CORS appropriately with considered use of allowlists. Use proxies as appropriate (such as for local development). The concept of least privilege applies here too, and keeping a tight lid on things helps mitigate security vulnerabilities.</p>

 Protect your cookies from theft 
<p>Really, this advice is applicable outside of web development too. But since we’re talking about web development in this post, we’ll skip mitigation strategies about protecting your physical cookies from marauders and focus again on security headers.</p>

<p>Cookies can contain all sorts of goodies, such as chocolate chips and the tidbits of data that agitators love to have! Current authentication best practices favor using in-browser memory or web workers for authentication tokens over cookies, and cookies should never be used for secrets, but there might still be sensitive information stored in cookies. To help protect cookies, we can use attributes.</p>

<p>Cookies should be temporary. In particular, cookies with sensitive information should be as short-lived as possible. When you or your back-end bakes up a cookie, adding the attribute <code>Max-Age</code> defines the longevity of the cookie.</p>

<p>There are some more attributes you can bake in! Adding the <code>httpOnly</code> attribute means the browser only sends a cookie for HTTP requests, and JavaScript won’t be able to access cookies. Setting the <code>httpOnly</code> attribute is an excellent first step to guarding your cookies against a malicious script that can read your cookies.</p>

<p>Having the <code>httpOnly</code> attribute means that JavaScript can’t access the cookie, but it doesn’t mean your browser carefully curates which cookies to send to each HTTP request! It just sends them all, resulting in the possibility of a vulnerability!</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — June 27th to July&nbsp;3rd  The EU co-legislators finally agreed to Crypto AML provisions, and&nbsp;more… <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s Weekly Regulatory Recap. The crypto regulatory landscape continues to stay heated with the EU co-legislators finally agreeing to Crypto AML provisions. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> Crypto Travel Rule to be Implemented in the European Union by&nbsp;2024 <p>After months of discussions, EU co-legislators finally agreed on a provisional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) agreement based on the FATF’s Travel Rule, albeit with slight modifications.</p><p>Under the provisional agreement, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) will have to collect the personal information of both the originator and the beneficiary of the crypto transfer.</p><p>And unlike the Travel Rule, where the minimum ceiling limit for the regulation to kick in is $1000, there is no such limit in the EU’s version. Once implemented, VASPs will have to collect Travel Rule data for all crypto transactions in the EU, no matter the amount. That said, the provisional agreement won’t apply to the crypto transfers to unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Although the announcement made last Wednesday does not mention the exact date of the launch, it states that the aim is to roll out the EU-wide AML laws before the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA). And ECB President Christine Lagarde said during her recent testimony to the EU parliament that MiCA is likely to be implemented by&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Read more about it here: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/crypto-travel-rule-set-to-be-mandatory-in-the-eu-by-2024-aead21f46113">https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/crypto-travel-rule-set-to-be-mandatory-in-the-eu-by-2024-aead21f46113</a></p> FATF Asks Countries to Speed up Travel Rule&nbsp;Adoption <p>Financial Action Task Force, the global financial crimes watchdog, recently published a report highlighting the need for speedy adoption of the Travel Rule globally.</p><p>As per the report, only 11 countries have adopted the Travel Rule, a quarter of them will soon pass the law, and one-third have made no progress.</p><p>Citing increasing concerns around the growing use of digital assets, NFTs, and DeFi, the financial watchdog noted in its report that the “countries that have not introduced Travel Rule legislation should do so as soon as possible, and FATF jurisdictions should lead by example.”</p><p>Visit here to read more about FATF’s recent report demanding countries to fast rack Travel Rule adoption:</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/30/hurry-up-with-crypto-id-checks-fatf-tells-countries/">https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/30/hurry-up-with-crypto-id-checks-fatf-tells-countries/</a></p> Former Chairman of India’s Largest Bank Says International Co-operation the Only way to Regulate Cryptocurrencies <p>The surge in investments in crypto assets in India and globally during 2021, often termed the “Breakthrough Year of Cryptocurrencies,” attracted the attention of the country’s leading financial authorities, including the central bank and the finance ministry. And amid such careful observation by the authorities, the market tanked considerably in 2022, raising concerns about regulatory ambiguity around digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The recent high-profile executive to comment on digital assets is Rajnish Kumar, Former Chairman of State Bank of India, the country’s largest bank by assets. He welcomed the government’s decision to tax digital assets and deduct TDS as he believes these actions from the government will help allay fears around the use of digital currencies for money laundering &amp; terrorism financing.</p><p>While speaking about crypto regulations, Mr. Kumar said that “This (crypto regulation) is an area where no single country would be able to bring out the laws (alone). It requires international cooperation. For banking, we have the Bank For International Settlements. Similarly, for crypto, we need to have an international understanding, and a framework has to be established.”</p><p>Read more about it here: <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/crypto-regulation-requires-international-understanding-and-framework-former-sbi-chairman-rajnish-kumar/">https://inc42.com/buzz/crypto-regulation-requires-international-understanding-and-framework-former-sbi-chairman-rajnish-kumar/</a></p> Morocco to Publish Crypto Regulations Soon <p>Morocco is on the verge of completing the crypto regulatory framework and will make it public soon, as per Abdellatif Jouahri, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) governor. Bank Al-Maghrib is the central bank of&nbsp;Morocco.</p><p>Mr. Jouahri also said that the central bank had coordinated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank before drafting the regulations. As such, consultation with global financial bodies has enabled Morocco’s central bank to set a new benchmark regarding crypto regulations.</p><p>Read more about it here: <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-moroccos-central-bank-to-unveil-crypto-regulation-bill-soon/">https://news.bitcoin.com/report-moroccos-central-bank-to-unveil-crypto-regulation-bill-soon/</a></p><p>_____________________</p><p>There’s one thing absolutely clear amid the current crypto market downturn: the financial regulators &amp; governments around the world are 100% determined to bring crypto-assets within the regulatory net. It means Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must begin complying with local and international digital asset regulations, as there’s no way around&nbsp;it.</p><p>The most crucial piece of global digital asset regulation is FATF’s Travel Rule. And even if the country in which the VASP is based hasn’t adopted the Travel Rule, it is better to stay prepared. After all, with FATF pushing for faster Travel Rule adoption, all countries will begin enforcing it sooner or&nbsp;later.</p><p>The first thing that VASP will need to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution Provider (TRSP), and Veriscope is the best one out there.

<p>Dock is building a gateway to Web3 by providing simple solutions for businesses and developers to build, manage and present digital Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identities using blockchain. </p><p>Dock provides credentialing technology that can be used to create cryptographically secure and instantly verifiable digital credentials, including workforce certificates, academic achievements, identity documents, and KYC checks. <br></p> Problems With Existing Centralized Credential Systems <p>Identity management has been a major concern since the internet was invented. Centralized identity management has always been vulnerable to threats, cyberattacks, and privacy breaches with a single point of failure. Billions of dollars have been spent providing a private and secure space for digital transactions. </p><p>We also know that large companies and governments control this information on our behalf. This whole control of large organizations sparked the entire movement of decentralization that propelled the applications of decentralized technologies like blockchain. The movement started with financial data and gave its origin to Bitcoin. Now this whole movement is addressing the necessity of decentralizing ownership of every data and we are calling it Web3.</p><p>Web3 is an umbrella term for the next iteration of the internet that is blockchain-based, decentralized, transparent, secure, and provides true ownership of data to its users. This will also enhance the portability and security of our identity documents such as passports, educational certificates, driving licenses, social media resumes, and more. </p><p>This is one side of the problem. There is another side where the data is having no protection from getting forged and the documents produced in various industries are getting forged. Verifying a paper-based or pdf-based certificate/credential in a fast-paced environment like today is often time-consuming and prone to errors. Hence, you can see an interconnected web of problems where the centralized database of these documents is a goldmine for hackers, the documents can be easily forged and pirated for malicious purposes, and adding to this, there is no instant verification infrastructure available. </p><p>Right from our birth, we receive numerous certificates and credentials like birth certificates, driving license, national and taxation IDs, education degrees and transcripts, and medical certificates, to name a few. From an individual to an organization, the potential documents that need to be protected, kept private, and might need authentication verification are uncountable. This is where we need a blockchain-based cryptography-enabled solution that can make any document tamper-proof with instant verification, Verifiable Credentials (VC).</p> Introduction to Web3 and Decentralized Identity<br> <p>The Web3 movement is not only limited to ownership, it is also about how we establish trust. This vast amount of data and information individuals and organizations are generating at a massive scale remains unverified and unauthenticated. Billions of dollars have been spent only to establish 2 fundamental necessities in the ecosystem - Security and Trust. </p><p>Web3 is the next evolution of the World Wide Web that incorporates decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics. </p><p>Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that allows people to generate and control their own digitial identity without depending on a specific service provider. Web3 is about ownership and by using Dock’s technology, individuals can now truly own their most important documents and IDs and regain control over their data. </p><p>A major component of Web3 is blockchain technology. In fact, blockchain technology is the foundation on which Web3 is built since it revolves around decentralization. By building on a blockchain network, transactions are open, decentralized, and secure. Dock’s proof of stake blockchain is built for Web3. </p><p>Web3 is a newly popular term, but we have been working in this space since 2017. The Web3 Foundation recognized our efforts in the space and provided Dock with a grant to help organizations adapt and innovate in the Web3 ecosystem by helping them understand the true ownership of their data and making their documents, certificates, and credentials become digital, tamper-proof, and instantly verifiable. <br></p> What is Dock? <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> is a pioneer in the revolutionary Web3 space. Since 2017, we have been building cutting-edge Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Credentials (VC) technology, which will act as a gateway to Web3 in the future. We have been helping organizations to adapt and innovate in the Web3 ecosystem by helping them understand the true ownership of their data and making their documents, certificates, and credentials become digital, tamper-proof, and instantly verifiable. Web3 is about ownership and by using Dock’s technology, individuals can now truly own their most important documents and regain control over their data.</p><p>Dock has built a decentralized network for issuing credentials and decentralized identifiers. But what does that mean for someone like you and me? Well, in our daily lives we come across questions like these situations:<br></p>  Is the doctor who will treat me at this hospital board certified?  Is there an easier way to provide your necessary personal information for KYC for a bank or financial app?<br>   Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers Explained <p>A digital identity is the body of information about an individual, organization, or electronic device that exists online. Data that form a digital identity includes a user name, password, and online searches. Almost all of our digital identities are connected through devices, apps, and services. </p><p>Up till now, we have only interacted with centralized identity systems and IDs where you create an account to access a service and enter personal information. Then, you either wait to manually authenticate this information or wait for automatic processes that only create your identity but not reliably authenticate it. This may be your educational certificates, customer IDs, employee IDs, business operation credentials, passport, or driving license, and the list is endless. Even your email and social media accounts are also a form of digital ID that you create yourself automatically just by agreeing to the terms and conditions of the platform. However, all the data produced by you using these central identifiers are not completely owned by you and the authentication processes are taxing. </p><p>Decentralized identity systems allow users to gain control, store, and manage their own identities and data. Users decide how and when they share their data and with whom. Instead of being siloed in one place, data is decentralized to each user. </p><p>Users have a digital identity wallet that stores their credentials and documents as Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Verifiable Credentials are cryptographically signed digital documents that can be instantly verified and authenticated based on the identity and trustworthiness of the issuer. Using VCs, you can prove your identity, skills and achievements, and a verifier will always know that the file was not modified or faked.</p><p>This identity wallet can hold verified user identity details such as their name, age, address, education, employment details, and financial information. The possibility to share verified information unlocks new opportunities with financial, employer, legal, and compliance-related use cases.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.dock.io/importance-of-verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credentials here</a>.</p><p>Each issuer and user has a DID, a Decentralized Identifier. A DID is an identifier that belongs to you. It's like an ID, similar to your employer or student ID, and you can have more than one. The big difference is this:oday the university gives you your Student ID. But with the Web3 enabled by Dock you:</p>  Generate the DID for yourself  Fully own and control your DIDsit  Can even create a different DID for every online interaction<br>  <p>The DID is written on the Dock blockchain when you create your DID. For example you can have multiple DIDs for: </p>  Your personal interests like signing in with one DID to play on different gaming websites  Professional purposes where you can use another DID to show educational credentials to employers when applying for a job  Financial reasons where you create a DID to access and use financial services  <p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.dock.io/blockchain-for-decentralized-identity/">Decentralized Identifiers here</a>.<br></p> The Dock Solution <p>We say Web3 will solve the problems related to data ownership, management, and security but nobody is demonstrating how. Web3, the decentralized internet built on the foundation of blockchain and cryptography has the potential to make this data secure, self-owned, and trustworthy. </p><p>This is where Dock is needed and we have built a technology that demonstrates how. We saw this problem and started to address this problem by building cutting-edge technology to ensure the data source can be known using decentralized identifiers and guaranteed (verified) using Verifiable Credentials. We have built a decentralized network for creating, issuing, and managing both Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identifiers on the Dock blockchain.</p><p>Dock’s Verifiable Credential ecosystem has the following 4 participants:<br></p>4 participants of a Verifiable Credential ecosystem<p><br>As the name suggests, the issuer is an entity that has the authority to issue Verifiable Credentials. This could be your college university issuing you a diploma after you finish the course, governmental organizations issuing you a national ID, etc. &nbsp;</p><p>The holder is someone who owns the credential. They store and share the Verifiable Credential from their digital wallet, in our case the Dock Wallet.</p><p>Lastly, the verifier is the one who validates or authenticates the credential. This could be a hiring company you’ve shared your diploma with.</p><p>Watch the video below to hear directly from our CEO, Nick Lambert to learn about the 4 actors of the Dock’s Verifiable Credential ecosystem.</p><p>But how is the identity verified?</p><p>The issuer issues the Verifiable Credential and digitally signs it with a cryptographic key (private key) that only the issuer can use.</p><p>When the verifier receives a credential, they will verify its authenticity through the Dock blockchain, an immutable and decentralized database.<br></p>Architecture of a Verifiable Credential Ecosystem built on Blockchain The Dock Blockchain - Built for Web3 <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/technology">Dock’s Substrate-based blockchain</a> provides an open-source, decentralized, and low-cost platform for organizations and developers to build Decentralized Identity and data applications for the Web3. Substrate is the primary blockchain SDK used by developers to create the parachains that make up the Polkadot network.</p><p>It is fast, interoperable, secure, scalable, and cost-efficient. It forms the basis of trust by maintaining a verifiable registry of all Dock-issued DIDs as well as additional functionality supporting Verifiable Credentials. Its architecture prevents the unauthorized modification of any data that is associated with a DID and the use of cryptography ensures that Verifiable Credentials are not tampered or forged. </p><p>Everyone using Web3 will need their own Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The Dock blockchain serves as the entry point with a protocol layer for all things Web3. Our blockchain-based credentialing system adheres to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C standards</a>. W3C is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work to set international standards for the World Wide Web. They created standards for URL, decentralized identifiers, and others. </p>Features of the Dock blockchain&nbsp; The Nominated Proof of Stake Consensus <p>Dock runs its own <a href="https://www.dock.io/validators">validator</a> network and our blockchain is built on Substrate (which is the same framework used throughout the Polkadot ecosystem). It uses the consensus mechanism offered by Substrate, which is a hybrid as it separates block production and finality and achieves them through different methods. The blockchain has the same consensus and governance mechanism as Polkadot.</p><p>In simple terms, nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) is the process of selecting validators to be allowed to participate in the consensus protocol. NPoS is a Proof-of-Stake variant that is used in Substrate-based Blockchains like Dock, Kusama, Edgeware, and Polkadot.</p><p>Nominated Proof of Stake has two entities in its space, the Nominators and the Validators. Nominators select validators they would like to process transactions, produce blocks, and validate transactions. They do so by staking Dock tokens. Validators process transactions, produce blocks (by putting transactions in blocks) and finalize them. They also validate blocks produced by other validators.</p><p><a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance">Learn more about governance on the Dock blockchain here.</a></p> Consensus and Framework <p>Dock uses the consensus mechanism offered by Substrate. The finality is achieved through a finality gadget called GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement). It finalizes chains rather than individual blocks and offers provable finality.</p><p>When Dock transitioned into utilizing PoS, the block production algorithm changed from Aura to BABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension protocol) which selects a validator for each slot (interval of time) randomly using a VRF (Verifiable Random Function).</p> Dock Staking <p>There are 50 validators running the Dock blockchain at any given time. We are glad that Binance joined this group back in January 2022, which also includes highly regarded staking companies like Everstake, Stakin, Ryabina, My Container and others. All Dock token holders can participate in staking to earn rewards in the form of Dock tokens. <br></p> Dock Product Suite <p>Dock’s products are already capable of serving the largest organizations to instantly issue Verifiable Credentials and create decentralized identifiers on their own blockchain. We provide all of the necessary products for individuals and organizations to hold and manage these DIDs and Verifiable Credentials on a secure wallet app and verify these credentials.</p><p>Certs</p><p>We provide both ready-made and customizable VC and DID opportunities for companies and developers. Users can opt for whichever seems most convenient. Organizations that want to issue Verifiable Credentials without writing a line of code can simply use <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?utm_source=coinotag&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=guide">Dock Certs</a>. </p><p>Users can sign up for Dock Certs in a few clicks and start creating their Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. After the creation of the credential, organizations can send it to the user as a link in an email, a PDF or a JSON file. The JSON file can be saved in the user's digital identity wallet. Cryptography is used to ensure that the credentials were not modified since they were issued.</p><p>Certs API</p><p>Certs is available in both no-code and API versions. Dock offers developer-friendly APIs to easily and instantly issue, verify, manage, and revoke Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers on the Dock blockchain.</p><p>Wallet SDK</p><p>Using Dock Wallet SDK, developers can build a Verifiable Credentials wallet inside their own app and allow their users to store, receive, and manage their credentials as well as DOCK tokens. </p><p>Dock Wallet App</p><p>Individuals can store and manage these DIDs and Verifiable Credentials in a secure <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock wallet app</a>. With the Dock Wallet, you can now store your digital Verifiable Credentials and truly own your professional and educational achievements. </p><blockquote>All your data will not be stored on the Dock Blockchain. You will have complete control on your credentials via your personal app. <br></blockquote><p>This wallet can also be used to store, send, receive, and buy DOCK tokens.</p> Dock Partners and Clients <p>Currently, we are working with Seven Mile, an Australian-based organization that is using Dock Certs to issue educational qualification certificates to the students who are completing courses with their platform. </p><p>Winners of the prestigious Odyssey Momentum Hackathon, overhd has utilised our open-source software to implement and host a permissioned blockchain as well as leveraged Dock’s features of creating VCs and DIDs. </p><p>Dock has also advised Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, a German development agency commissioned by German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Dock assisted them with the technical architecture and features for a professional profile data wallet linked to atingi, a digital learning platform built by GIZ.</p><p>We have also announced several partnerships including Credenxia, an Australian workforce training company, and Xertify who is working on several pilots for COVID vaccine credentials in Mexico and Columbia. We are working with additional partners that will be announced later.</p> Dock Use Cases <p>Use cases for adopting Dock’s technology include healthcare, education, supply chain, finance, compliance, NFTs, DeFi, and many more sectors that rely heavily on credential data.</p><p>Let’s take the example of <a href="https://blog.dock.io/nfts-and-verifiable-credentials/?utm_source=coinotag&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=guide">NFT marketplaces</a>. Fraud is rampant both within and outside of the blockchain space, and NFTs are no exception with scammers setting up fake accounts and selling fake NFTs. A Verifiable Credential can be used to verify the identity of all parties involved in creating, buying, and selling NFTs, to ensure the reputation and authenticity of everyone involved without divulging private information. For example, an NFT creator could share a verifiable Credential that demonstrates a history of creating legitimate NFTs, or a seller can have a Verifiable Credential that shows a reputation score based on their previous NFT sales. And they can do this while remaining anonymous!</p><p>Here are some other examples of our use cases:<br></p>  Healthcare: &nbsp;Dock is working with a healthcare technology company that has created an ecosystem of credential issuers, employers, and individuals. We provide a platform to streamline credential issuing, verification and monitoring. With the use of Verifiable Credentials and blockchain, their product enables issuers to create digital Verifiable Credentials and a mobile app for individuals to store, share, and instantly verify in real-time. Learn more <a href="https://www.dock.io/case-study-healthcare">here</a>.<br>  Supply chain: &nbsp;Dock’s core technology can help businesses and government authorities ensure a legal and compliant supply chain with genuine goods and materials in addition to timely, reliable deliveries. The end results are significant savings in administrative expenses and increased profitability. Learn more <a href="https://www.dock.io/case-study-supply-chain">here</a>.<br>  E-learning / Education: The PDF certificate issued by e-learning platforms can easily be copied and imitators can fake their accomplishments. Adding a cryptographic signature by the issuer (the institute) using Certs or Certs API will make this certificate tamper-proof, instantly verifiable, and unique. Dock’s VC and VP can also help prevent cheating in academic and professional exams by confirming test taker’s identity.

This can simplify and speed up the hiring process for both job seekers and employers by enabling instant and reliable verification of candidates’ skills and experiences. The end results are huge savings in administrative costs and increased trust in the talent pool.<br>  Financial Services: &nbsp;Identification and compliance practices are extremely important in providing financial services. Dock provides the technology to solve these verification challenges in the financial industry. Using Certs, Verifiable Credentials can be issued to provide a spectrum of financial and identity information that individuals and companies can present in order to unlock access to services. Learn more <a href="https://www.dock.io/case-study-finance">here</a>.<br>   DOCK token <p>All transactions to the Dock Blockchain, like creating DIDs, updating Revocation Registries, and creating Schemas amongst others, require <a href="https://www.dock.io/token">DOCK tokens</a>. The use of DOCK extends further to other initiatives that include governance and staking. </p><p>The utilities of DOCK can be divided into 3 main categories:</p>  Governance: Token holders can actively participate in submitting proposals, voting, and electing council members  Network operations: &nbsp;Dock tokens are used to pay for transactions in the network such as creating DIDs, anchoring and revoking credentials, and sending payments  Staking and validating: Validators are paid emission rewards for validating and those rewards are shared with nominators who support them<br>  <p>The total supply of DOCK tokens is fixed at 1 billion. Out of which 70% is with holders, 15% is with the Treasury and Dock Association, and 15% is for emission rewards. </p><p>According to the team, the circulating supply is 770 million and the emission of the remaining DOCK will happen over 25 years distributing 25-30% per year. DOCK’s token emission schedule can be found <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">here</a>.</p> The Dock Team <p>The Dock Network is supported by two entities:</p>  ​​Dock Association: &nbsp;A Swiss non-profit Association dedicated to overseeing the network’s roadmap, establishing and providing ongoing governance, overseeing the promotion of the network and also driving its adoption.  Dock Labs: &nbsp;The team behind Dock working on developing the technology and driving marketing, business development, and operations to fulfill Dock’s vision.   <p>The team is led by Nick Lambert and Elina Cadouri who come with a wealth of experience in the blockchain and data tech industry. Nick, CEO at Dock, has been working in the blockchain industry since 2011 and was the COO of one of the earliest companies working in the Blockchain space, MaidSafe. Elina, COO of Dock, has remarkable experience in the data network industry. Lead Developer Lovesh Harchandani is an expert in the Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity industry creating one of the most innovative solutions at Dock, and previously at Evernym. You can read more about our team and our entities <a href="https://www.dock.io/about">here</a>.<br><br></p> Final Conclusions <p>Web3 is not only about the Metaverse and NFTs. It is also going to be largely about data ownership. Web2 uses centralized identifiers like social media accounts and email addresses to access websites and apps while a Web3 ID will enable you to surf, transact, or share your data securely on a decentralized internet while fully owning and controlling your digital identity. <br></p><p>This Web3 ID:</p>  Will carry your credentials, IDs, your reputation, and the linked data in a decentralized digital wallet  Opens multiple use cases in DeFi and NFT marketplacesEnables the ability to prove/verify transactions and ownership of assets without revealing wallet address or the entire history of transactions<br>  <p>Dock already has all of the &nbsp;technology and tools to support functionality for decentralized identities. Adding the support of Verifiable Credentials is a powerful and secure way to add trust and authenticity to every credential, document, or a certificate used in Web3 while ensuring the privacy of everyone participating.</p>

We should own and control our identity and&nbsp;data.<p>What is your identity? It’s the ability to represent to the world who you are. That can cover everything from what you wear to who you associate with to what country you are from. Your identity is a collection of attributes that describe&nbsp;you.</p><p>In practice, proving your identity is also the key to unlocking your social and economic potential — physically and digitally. Society has always been built on trust, and sometimes, we need to know who we’re dealing&nbsp;with.</p><p>As such, your identity is core to who you are and what you’re able to do, whether that’s buying something online, opening a bank account, or starting a business.</p><p>The problem is that the way we deal with identity hasn’t caught up to the modern&nbsp;world.</p><p>Part of the reason is that our most credible forms of identifying documents like driver’s licenses and passports still live in the analog world. The pandemic further shone a light on those limitations with places like the U.S. still reliant on paper vaccination cards, which are inefficient, difficult to verify, and easy to counterfeit.</p><p>One of the issues with analog identifying documents is that not everyone has them. The reality is that our current system <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/">excludes 1.7 billion people from basic financial services</a>, many of whom lack traditional forms of identity. For instance, migrant workers may not even have a home&nbsp;address.</p><p>Things aren’t much better in today’s digital world, where an abundance of online accounts means that our identity and personal data are scattered across servers vulnerable to attack. Outside of just giving away your email and phone number or accepting tracking cookies on your browser, some services collect more official forms of identity. Have you ever had to send a picture of your driver’s license or insert your passport number when buying something online?</p><p>The result? In just the first half of 2019, <a href="https://pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/2019-midyear-data-breach-quickview-report">an astounding 4.1 billion records were compromised</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, we don’t own the digital identities we create. The Facebooks and Googles of the world do and profit mightily from our data. And because they own our data on their proprietary platforms, we can’t easily bring our identity and data with us if we decide to go somewhere else. The reputation you created on Facebook Marketplace as a long time seller is stuck on Facebook. If you ever decide to sell on Ebay, you’re starting from&nbsp;zero.</p><p>The fragmentation of your digital identity extends well beyond popular websites. A pillar of the United States traditional financial system is the credit score — a system entirely predicated on centralized digital identity that you have no control over. Anyone who’s moved to the U.S. from abroad understands the challenge of trying to get a mortgage or even open a bank account — even if you had great credit in your home&nbsp;country.</p><p>Do you want to know the worst part? The digital identities described above aren’t even that credible in the first place. Most social media platforms are more concerned with expanding their user base than verifying accounts are owned by real people, contributing to society’s growing trust&nbsp;deficit.</p><p>What we need is a human-centric approach to digital identity, one that is easier, safer, and cheaper than the one we have&nbsp;today.</p><p>We need a digital identity that works for people and organizations alike.</p><p>Your digital identity should&nbsp;be:</p>  Self-sovereign. We should own and control our identity and data. Further, we should be able to decide who we share our data&nbsp;with.  Private, secure and encrypted. Our data should be private and safe, always. You should be confident that only you have access to the information you create, save, and share. Third party entities and bad actors should never have the opportunity to see your information in the first&nbsp;place.  Interoperable and portable. Our identities should be premised on globally accepted standards just like the internet is built on interoperable protocols that power the web and email. They shouldn’t be locked into proprietary, closed ecosystems dictated by corporations or governments. Moreover, we should be able to bring our identity with us to whatever platform we choose. Remember when your cell phone number was locked into your mobile service provider? Today, our phone numbers are portable. You can bring your phone number with you no matter what provider you choose. The same will be the case for our digital identities.  Built on verifiable credentials. You should be able to verify your identity once, receive a machine-verifiable credential, and reuse that credential many times over. This means you won’t have to redundantly verify your identity and re-share your data each time you interact with a new business or service. The best part is that those services never need to see your personal information to know it is true. That way, businesses can trust that you are who you say you are, and don’t need to store and manage your personal data on their servers. Less servers holding your data means a more secure identity.  Usable. What good is a fancy digital identity if it is impossible to use in your daily life? Digital identity and the associated credentials are going to take years to be adopted by 100% of establishments. That’s why it is crucial to make safer digital identity useful in the contexts we are living in today. That might mean making it easier to store and share a picture of your ID card. Tomorrow it could mean applying for a bank account. Next year, it might mean doing your taxes. Human-centric digital identity must meet the moment, wherever it may&nbsp;be.  Inclusive. Identity is a human right. Anyone, anywhere should be able to create one. Notably, your identity should grant you access to basic services such as banking and payments.  <p>It’s clear that the way we handle our identities today is broken. What’s incredibly exciting is that a convergence of developments across fintech, regtech, and web3 now enable a smarter, better, and more inclusive framework.</p><p>Human-centric digital identity is the key to a future that works for us, allowing us to set new standards for how we deal with issues like financial inclusion, communication and censorship, and even the integrity of our democratic elections.</p><p>Our identities are the building blocks for a modern society and economy. We owe it to ourselves and each other to get this&nbsp;right.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about how digital identity can work for you and stay up to date with the latest updates, sign up for the monthly <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">GlobaliD Insider newsletter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">GlobaliD 101: How digital identity should work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Revised July 1, 2022</p>
<p>This week, Freddie Mac announced the latest Loan Product Advisor® (LPASM) enhancement that includes on-time rent payments as part of the company’s purchase determinations.</p>
<p>Mastercard, a designated third-party service provider for Freddie Mac, is excited to provide two reports for lenders that include rent payment history.</p>
<p>Our<a href="https://www.finicity.com/demo/"> Mortgage Verification Services (MVS)</a> product provides the consumer-permissioned data necessary for LPA’s rent payment history credit assessment with no setup required for the lender. If you’re already using an MVS asset report, you will automatically send the data necessary for a rent assessment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html">Mastercard’</a>s open banking platform (provided by Mastercard’s wholly-owned subsidiary,<a href="https://www.finicity.com/"> Finicity</a>), is a designated service provider that offers a digital, single-vendor solution for assets, income and employment through both<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/"> Freddie Mac</a> and<a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/"> Fannie Mae</a>. By automating the asset and income assessment process, we can also provide transaction data for rent payment history, direct deposits and 10-day pre-closing reports for employment verification. These solutions help to streamline lenders’ loan approval process and increase homeownership opportunities to qualified borrowers.</p>
 Rent Payment History in Lender Credit Decisioning 
<p>By virtue of sheer numbers, millennials are defining the trends of today’s housing market. The age group now accounts for 43% of all homebuyers so far in 2022, according to a new report by the<a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf"> National Association of Realtors</a>. With approximately one-third of this demographic<a href="https://risk.lexisnexis.com/insights-resources/article/credit-invisibles#:~:text=Denying%20Credit%20for%20Millennials,millennial%20consumers%20are%20credit%20invisible."> being credit invisible</a>, there’s an opportunity to incorporate additional data sources to help establish creditworthiness and the ability to repay the loan. The integration of rent payment history into the mortgage lending process can be helpful to first-time homebuyers who have a strong track record of on-time rent payments, creating a new path to homeownership while still promoting safe lending.</p>
<p>In addition to this week’s announcement from Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae has included rent payments in their automated mortgage credit decisioning process in Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) since September 18, 2021. Fannie Mae identified recurring rent payments in bank statements and transaction data as a factor which could deliver a more inclusive credit assessment.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae said 17% of applicants who have not owned a home in the last three years and who did not receive a favorable mortgage recommendation could have instead received an “approved” or “eligible” recommendation if their rental payment history had been considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To take advantage of the rent payment history feature, Mastercard provides a Verification of Asset and Income (VOAI) and a Verification of Assets (VOA) report through its Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) that includes 12 or 24 months of transaction data that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae can use to identify rent payment history that may provide a more favorable credit assessment.</p>
<p>If they are using the VOA report, lenders have the freedom to access either two or 12 months of data to satisfy their own underwriting requirements. The reports can be called with a direct API or are available currently in ICE Encompass and Encompass Consumer Connect, as well as the SimpleNexus mortgage point-of-sale (POS) platform.&nbsp;</p>
 Integrated with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae Systems 
<p>Mastercard is a service provider for Freddie Mac’s automated underwriting system, LPA, which automates the assessment of borrower assets, income and employment using LPA asset and income modeler (AIM). By leveraging the expertise of service providers, AIM helps to deliver a simpler, more efficient loan origination process.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae’s DU validation service also accepts our mortgage verification services to independently validate borrower assets, income, and employment data—providing Day 1 Certainty® on validated loan components. By digitally validating secure third-party data through DU, you can help eliminate the paper chase and help get your borrowers approved quicker.</p>

We are focused on building the infrastructure and delivering the tools for Web3. Ontology’s high-speed, low-cost public blockchain is designed to increase privacy, transparency, and trust, aiming to be a public chain that puts the users’ security and privacy front and center, whilst also allowing for interoperability. We recently launched Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to increase Ontology’s functionality by adding an Ethereum account system, Ethereum transaction types, and Web3 APIs to the existing Ontology blockchain. This will reduce migration costs for developers, allowing them to enter EVM-based ecosystems on Ontology. With lower gas fees and faster block production, it promotes creating seamless connections between the Ontology chain and other EVM-based ecosystems, increasing cross-chain interoperability!</p><p>By partnering with Celer to bring bridging support to the Ontology EVM, we benefit from the Open Canonical Token Standard. Upon launch, users can bridge USDT, USDC, ETH, and WBTC, and we will extend to other tokens going forward, outlining a more secure and flexible approach to facilitate interoperability between Ontology and the broader blockchain space.</p><p>You can see the bridged Ontology EVM addresses via the new <a href="https://explorer.ont.io/tokens/orc20/10/1">Ontology Explorer</a>.</p> About Celer&nbsp;Network <p>Celer is a blockchain interoperability protocol enabling a one-click user experience accessing tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, governance, privacy solutions, and more across multiple chains.

 Rennes and Munich, July 5, 2022: IDnow Group, a European leader in identity proofing and digital identity, appoints Jean-Marc Guyot as Vice President of R&amp;D (Research and Development) at IDnow group. His main responsibility will be the further unification and development of one joint platform for the European market.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Jean-Marc Guyot’s appointment will engage a new dynamic in the R&amp;D department, with the aim of&nbsp;driving best in class engineering teams and meeting the group’s ambitions of leading the way in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His responsibilities will include: uniting the IDnow and ARIADNEXT engineering teams, located across several countries of the world, into a cohesive entity; orchestrating technological choices and orientations and defining architectures to meet the product teams’ requirements, including automatic, video and signature solutions; streamlining and combining all the Group’s existing and future verification solutions to optimise the new IDnow platform.</p>



<p>“I’m looking forward to building a high-performing engineering department at IDnow. The former IDnow and ARIADNEXT teams both have valuable benefits and skills and my job will be to bring this together into one platform that answers the needs of European companies across jurisdictions and use cases,” explained Jean-Marc Guyot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m especially excited to work with the teams in France and Germany and to meet the high standards in technology that are key for the IDnow Group,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jean-Marc Guyot started his career in 1995 as a system architect at LSI Logic, where he worked on the first Digital Terrestrial TV digital demodulation chip. He then joined NXP as Product Marketing Director.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2004 he founded Silembia, a high-tech startup, that he then sold to Silicon Laboratories (an American semiconductor company) and moved to the USA to manage the merger of the teams. Back in France in 2014, he joined ENENSYS to create the Telecom Business Unit with a focus on LTE Broadcast technology. There, he actively participated in the 3GPP SA4 standardisation committee. Early in 2019, he became Vice President of Engineering for Cloud-Based Security Services at WALLIX, before taking over the entire R&amp;D department. He created the R&amp;D site in Rennes which now employs more than 40 people and also re-sited the company in the future CyberPlace beacon building in Rennes. Finally, he and his teams won the “Grand Défi Cyber” with the OSCAR project and implemented the transformation of the R&amp;D teams into agile mode.</p>



<p>“Jean-Marc brings a wealth of technology and international leadership experience into his role. His arrival at IDnow will further accelerate the development of IDnow’s Identity proofing platform, starting with combining the best-in-class technology stack from all IDnow group companies. I’m looking forward to working with him,” commented Vikas Seth, IDnow Chief Product Officer.</p>

What a day! <a href="https://t.co/CVZsHOjBeL">pic.twitter.com/CVZsHOjBeL</a></p>— Kai (@Kai_dentity) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kai_dentity/status/1534543537680830464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>From 2021 until 2024, the German ministry of economics and climate action is funding four projects for “Secure Digital Identities”, each in a different part of Germany and executed by a consortium of different partners, stemming, respectively, from community administrations, industry sectors, tech providers, research institutions and use specific implementation partners. The four consortia are called ONCE, ID-Ideal, SDIKA and ID-Union.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ONCE consortium is one of the most ambitious of these four projects – led by the Bundesdruckerei they have the ambitious plan to be the first of the four SDI projects to wrap, by late summer of 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, with one year left and the pandemic-situation finally permitting to meet in person, it was time for an interim project meeting of the #ONCE2022 consortium. Altogether 65 participants gathered in Willingen from 8th – 9th June to discuss project milestones, next steps, and new developments. After multiple attempts and postponements, it was the first in-person meeting of the whole project team since the beginning of the implementation phase. As representatives from Jolocom, Kai Wagner and Ben Biedermann attended and presented our work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this get-together it was satisfying to see the progress made in the different work packages. From implementing first prototypes in the field of electronic identity (eID) or mobile driving license (mDL), to creating student ID’s, communal and resident credentials, as well as credentials for the tourism and hospitality industry: the past year has been a productive one. Aside from updating each other on our individual progress, in collaborative brainstorming sessions we also put our physical presence to effective use. One session was focussed on improving our future users’ journey by applying innovative approaches from different digital industries to the problems we tackle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Jolocom SmartWallet is the wallet of choice for all ONCE compliant use cases, but also in the broader SDI (Secure Digital Identity) ecosystem, with <a href="https://id-ideal.de/">ID-Ideal</a> and <a href="https://www.sdika.de/">SDIKA</a> using it as well. We saw six demonstrators for eID, mDL, and SSI credentials of all sorts from different partners. Furthermore, the Jolocom Agent is becoming increasingly popular among project partners as an efficient prototyping and implementation tool, be it as API or application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SSI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SSI</a> architectures don't change? Look closely. Iterations matter. We received good feedback when <a href="https://twitter.com/GETJolocom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GETJolocom</a> presented a perspective on the <a href="https://twitter.com/SDIKA_de?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SDIKA_de</a> solution at the <a href="https://twitter.com/once_identity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@once_identity</a> meet-up in Willingen earlier this month. <a href="https://t.co/CmtmnqZrYa">pic.twitter.com/CmtmnqZrYa</a></p>— Ben Biedermann (@ben_criticus) <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_criticus/status/1539541741585551371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>In Willingen, Jolocom was able to engage in and facilitate several technological discussions. Working together on the spot helped us generate new momentum and ideas for the upcoming months, where we are planning to move many of the use cases into pilots in our partner cities. We also engaged in fruitful conversations with representatives from ID-Ideal and SDIKA on issues pertaining to interoperability across the SDI ecosystem. These issues have previously been fostered by the Begleitforschung and are now picking up speed in bilateral projects and discussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All workshops benefitted from the constructive attitude of the participants. The event highlighted the&nbsp; productive and well-natured relationships that have been established in this consortium. State of the art conference rooms and facilities added to the friendly and inspiring atmosphere. On a personal level, our hike to the ski resorts of the region was a fantastic opportunity and reminder to connect beyond tiles on a screen and reconfirmed the importance of personal connections for developing safe digital identities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just yesterday, W3C Decentralized Identifiers were <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/06/DIDRecommendationDecision.html">approved to be released</a> as an official W3C Recommendation. As a W3C member organization, we are thrilled by this excellent outcome, and will celebrate it by sharing our favorite ideas about the next evolutions of DIDs that will make them more secure, composable, and friendly to implementers.</p>DIDs 101<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> is a URI that resolves to a JSON object called a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID document</a>, which describes how to authenticate as the DID’s controller for different purposes. When a service knows that it’s talking to the controller, it can use this fact as the consistent anchor point to construct a decentralized identity, enriching the session with related data referring to the DID such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials (VCs)</a> or any associated information found on a public blockchain.</p><p>Where do DID documents come from? Each DID specifies a “DID method” that describes an exact resolution procedure (among other actions) to interpret the DID’s “method specific identifier” and ultimately produce a DID document.</p>DID Documents 101<p>DID methods can retrieve data from a variety of sources: TLS-protected websites, public blockchains, or solely from the method-specific identifier itself. Over the past several years, dozens of different DID methods have emerged in practice, with proponents enthusiastic at how powerful and flexible DIDs can be to bridge disparate trust systems (e.g., Ethereum, GPG, and X.509), and detractors declaring an impending interoperability nightmare, with plenty of headaches for implementers. </p><p>However, there is a way we can prevent this impending interop nightmare!</p><p>Enter DID method traits: testable properties about DID methods that can help implementers tame complexity and choose the right DID method(s) for their use case. They can be used as requirements revealing which DID methods could satisfy the relevant constraints presented across different use cases. </p><p>For example, requirements to support certain operations for the NIST Curve P-256, NIST-proposed Curve Ed25519, bitcoin Curve secp256k1 could all be expressed as different DID method traits complete with test suites. Also expressible as DID traits is the guarantee that a DID method is “purely generative,” requiring no storage lookups as in the case of did-key and did-pkh, as opposed to those actively querying a network such as did-web, did-ens, and did-ion.</p><p>Finally, there may exist a DID method trait that ensures composability across different DID methods: that one DID may serve as the authentication method for another DID, such as <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">did-pkh</a> for <a href="https://medium.com/uport/ens-names-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids-724f0c317e4b">did-ens</a> or <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">did-ion</a>.</p><p>This means that a user can start with an Ethereum account represented as did-pkh, then “upgrade” to a DID method that supports key rotation such as did-ens or did-ion. This helps create a great user experience when using DIDs, as with this approach, users do not need to set up a new decentralized public key infrastructure just to get started.<br></p><p>Instead, they can start with whatever key-based accounts they have, leverage the corresponding DID methods, and graft their existing identifier to a more featureful DID method supporting this kind of composability whenever needed.</p><p>Previous work has been done on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/">DID method rubric</a>, which evaluates criteria as wide-ranging as underlying network decentralization, adoption metrics, and regulatory compliance. DID method traits may exist as a subset of possible criteria in the DID method rubric, or as a parallel spec used in conjunction.</p><p>I will be writing a paper on DID method traits as my submission to the forthcoming Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT) conference in The Hague. If you’d like to collaborate on this, please reach out!</p> <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web.

European Parliament room (Frederic Köberl/Unsplash) Crypto-Asset Service Providers will be obligated to collect the personal information of the originator and beneficiary of crypto transactions, no matter the&nbsp;amount. <blockquote>Key Takeaways<br>Once implemented, the provisional agreement will make it mandatory for Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) to collect personal information on both the originator and beneficiary of a crypto transaction.</blockquote><blockquote>Unlike FATF’s Travel Rule, there is no minimum ceiling limit for the AML-check-provision to kick&nbsp;in.</blockquote><blockquote>P2P crypto transfers won’t be subject to AML checks under the provisional agreement.</blockquote><p>After three months of discussions, EU Co-legislators finally agreed on AML measures to prevent the use of digital assets for money laundering and terrorism financing on Wednesday.</p><p>With this provisional agreement, Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) will be obligated to collect the personal information of the originator and beneficiary of crypto transactions, no matter the amount. This move will make crypto transactions traceable, which, in turn, will enable CASPs to flag and block suspicious transactions.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/ernesturtasun/status/1542217824613064704?s=20&amp;t=R1qcJkKQZIdb7YCKIFslEA">Image Source</a><p>Interestingly, crypto transfers to unhosted wallets won’t be subject to AML checks, which is surprising as EU authorities <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/31/eu-parliament-votes-on-privacy-busting-crypto-rules-industry-rails-against-proposals/">had initially vouched for</a> bringing both hosted &amp; unhosted wallets under the regulatory purview. Industry players and experts were largely against such a move, terming it overregulation.</p><p>The backlash may have resulted in authorities backtracking from their initial stance of subjecting private wallets to AML checks. That said, the provisional agreement will also set specific guidelines for all transactions between CASPs and unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>As for data protection, general data protection regulation (GDPR) will continue to apply to crypto transactions. There won’t be any separate regulations for it. It basically means that only CASPs will be allowed to store the Travel Rule data, which will impact how some Travel Rule Solution Providers (TRSPs) work. And this is what separates Shyft Veriscope from the rest of the solutions available in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>After all, Veriscope has been designed in such a manner that the Travel Rule data isn’t stored in its system. Instead, the exchange of Travel Rule data exclusively happens between&nbsp;CASPs.</p> Roll out by&nbsp;2024? <p>The co-legislators also agreed to sync the rollout of this provisional agreement with the EU-wide crypto regulation, Markets in Crypto Assets&nbsp;(MiCA).</p><p>Recently, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said in her testimony to the EU parliament that the Markets in Crypto Assets is likely to be implemented by 2024. Thus, the provisional EU AML agreement, which is in line with FATF’s Travel Rule, specifically Sections 4 &amp; 5, too may be implemented in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>The first proposal on EU-wide AML rules published under the title “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/210720-anti-money-laundering-countering-financing-terrorism_en">Anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism legislative package</a>” in July 2021 also states that “the AML authority should be operational in&nbsp;2024.”</p><p>Thus, the positive aspect behind the announcement is that CASPs will have a clear deadline to comply with EU AML regulations that aim to implement FATF’s Travel Rule within the boundaries of the 27-member bloc.</p><p>The first thing CASPs must do now is zero in on a Travel Rule Solution Provider (TRSP). And we have the best TRSP to suggest — Veriscope!

			  Ivie Satijn is Marketing &amp; Business Development Intern at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Ivie (pronounced “eevee”). I was born in the Netherlands, where I have spent my childhood, teenage years, and where I studied for my Bachelor’s Degree. I consider myself a lucky kid because my mother has shown me all the beautiful natural areas in the south of the Netherlands, and my father brought me on many trips all over the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After finishing high school, I went to South Korea to volunteer and when I returned, I began studying at University College Maastricht. Soon after starting this degree, I noticed that I was not happy. I needed a study program that was more practice-oriented; therefore, I decided to switch to International Business. This was a good choice because I really enjoyed learning about business and languages, and I had the chance to spend a semester in Colombia and another in Mexico. Also, I was able to have a side job as a sports instructor, which was a lot of fun!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last September, I moved to Luxembourg and started my Master’s Degree in Entrepreneurship and Innovation. I really like the city, and I feel that it gives me plenty of opportunities to start a career or launch my own business.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Two years ago, I coincidentally discovered an online course on bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I did not know anything about blockchain, so I decided to start it. Almost immediately, I realized that I was very interested in the topic and I continued learning. Step by step, my enthusiasm for web3 grew and when I started to plan my internship, I set the goal to land a position at a blockchain startup. I am very grateful that Tokeny offered me to work with them.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Interactive, high-paced, innovative, and nicely challenging. I am truly having an amazing time. As an intern, I am given many responsibilities and the Tokeny team is actively working on making my learning journey as valuable as possible. Also, even though we are working remotely, I feel like there is a very friendly atmosphere in the team. In Dutch, I would describe it as very “<a href="https://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/155-gezellig">gezellig</a>”.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To live somewhere surrounded by loads of nature and animals.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Accept the fact that you will feel thrown into the deep in the beginning. If you are open to learning, you will quickly catch up with the work style and the terminology. From then on, the fun can start!</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Personally, I am particularly looking forward to the point when ONCHAINID will become the identity standard for web3 activities, and I therefore never have to worry about losing my digital assets anymore.</p>

<p>Due to its immutability and censorship resistance, the Blockchain seems to be a suitable place to manage identities and credentials. However, querying the data on the blockchain in a trusted and efficient way is one of the most challenging issues every Web3 developer has to face while developing a DApp. Therefore, this article describes a simple approach to revoke verifiable credentials and a decentralized and efficient way to index and query those revoked credentials using the <a href="https://thegraph.com/en/">Graph protocol</a>.</p><p>We consider the knowledge of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and rudimentary knowledge of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver/blob/master/doc/did-method-spec.md">Ethr DID method</a> as a requirement for understanding this&nbsp;article.</p> Ethr DID and Credentials <p>The Ethr DID method uses Ethereum addresses as identifiers. By default, the DID of the issuer/subject does not require an on-chain registration and it is constructed from the Ethereum address and controlled by its private key. This feature minimizes the effort of integrating Identities in many on-chain use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>When an off-chain verifiable credential is created, the issuer entity must set the “issuer” property to its Ethr DID and the “credentialSubject.id” property to the Ethr DID of the subject.&nbsp;Example:</p> "verifiableCredential": {<br>    "@context": [..],<br>    "issuer": {<br>      "id": "did:ethr:0xf1232f840f3ad7d23fcdaa84d6c66dac24efb198"<br>    },<br>    "issuanceDate": "2022-07-2T12:00:00.000Z",<br>    "credentialSubject": {<br>      "id": "did:ethr:0x435df3eda57154cf8cf7926079881f2912f54db4",<br>      "degree": "Bachelor Of Arts"<br>    },<br>    "proof": { ... }<br>  } <p>After that as usual the issued credential will be used by the subject to generate a verifiable presentation. The verifier will verify the presentation and accept or reject it depending on its business&nbsp;logic.</p> Credential Revocation <p>Verifiable Credentials are similar to certificates, some of them have an expiration date and some don’t. However, in both cases, the issuer and the subject must be able to revoke them. To enable this critical requirement, we need a tamper-proof revocation data registry that is always available and cannot be censored by any of the mentioned parties. This can be achieved using the Blockchain. Such a registry can be implemented as a simple smart contract that stores a reference of the credential and a reference of the entity who revoked&nbsp;it.</p><p>The revocation process:</p>  Get the hash value of the issued verifiable credential using the keccak256 hash function after converting the credentials to bytes. This value will be used as the on-chain reference to the credential  Send a transaction to the revocation smart contract to call the revoke method revoke(bytes32 digest)giving the extracted hash value as&nbsp;input  The entity that revoked the credential is the address of the invoker and it can be matched with the issuer or subject of the credential based on their&nbsp;DIDs  <p>The additional important key that will help use indexing those revocations is that when a credential is revoked, the revocation smart contract triggers an event that includes the keccak256 hash of that credential and the address of the entity that revoked&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the Github <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/vc-revocation-graph">Repository</a>, we prepared a simple project&nbsp;that:</p>  Deploys a revocation smart contract that stores references to the credential and the entity that revoked&nbsp;it.  Uses the did-jwt-vc and ethr-did libraries to issue 3 off-chain verifiable credentials by 3 different issuers and revoke them&nbsp;on-chain  <p>Please check the&nbsp;./ssi-contracts folder and follow the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/vc-revocation-graph/tree/main/ssi-contracts">README</a> file. After following the steps you should have the address of the revocation registry smart contract deployed on the Goerli network. The 3 revoked transactions can be found on <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> using the address of the deployed contract.</p><p>Why do we need to index the revoked Credentials?</p><p>In a verification scenario, the verifier gets a verifiable presentation that includes 1 to n verifiable credentials from the subject. In addition to the normal validation process of the credentials, the verifier must also check the on-chain status of the credential at any time easily and efficiently. To do that the verifier could request the status of each credential by calling the methodrevoked(address issuer, bytes32 digest) in the revocation registry contract. However, this approach of getting the information is limited, costly, and not efficient for many reasons, some of which&nbsp;are:</p>  It requires knowledge of the Blockchain and Web3 technology  It is slow and limited because of the latency, number of requests, node capability  It requires running a blockchain node or relaying on a node&nbsp;provider  Duplicate requests for the same credentials are sent over and over&nbsp;again  It requires the verifier to be online all the&nbsp;time  <p>And this is when indexing comes into play to provide an easy, fast and simple way to iterate and query data. Indexing is especially needed in the Blockchain area where its underlying design makes it difficult to search for relevant&nbsp;data.</p><p>But How can we index the Blockchain?</p><p>One approach is iterating all transactions and checking if the transaction interacts with our revocation contract. This method is very slow and resource-intensive. The other approach which is used by most developers is to subscribe to events that are triggered by the target contract. This method is much easier, supported by tools and libraries like web3js, and is more resource-saving. Now we come to the second important question of who should do the indexing? There are some possible&nbsp;answers:</p><p>1. The verifier himself. But it is not a good solution because each verifier needs to build up and maintain its own logic and infrastructure. Furthermore, the server of the verifier that is responsible for the indexing is a Single-point-of-failure</p><p>2. External ingestion service that indexes the data on behalf of the verifier. Such a service could be very useful. However, it creates one of the most critical issues which is the lack of TRUST. Verifiers need to trust the ingestion service and relying on it eliminates the advantage of using the Blockchain</p><p>3. Decentralized indexing protocol like The Graph protocol, which enables decentralized applications to query complex data from the blockchain without having to develop and operate proprietary indexing servers or use a centralized service provider. This is the preferred solution in most use cases&nbsp;because:</p>  It is distributed and decentralized. Therefore it removes the Single-point-of-failure and the missing trust&nbsp;issue  It does not require advanced Web3 knowledge. Developers use only GraphQL requests to query the data from already implemented and indexed Subgraphs  The technology behind it has been designed specifically for the Blockchain. Therefore, it is quick and easy to query and&nbsp;filter  Cost-efficient because indexers are competing with each other to provide the best service for the lowest&nbsp;price  Can be used by many verifiers around the world with minimal latency because the nodes are distributed and&nbsp;public  <p>The creators of the Graph protocol recognized the indexing and querying problem at the end of 2017 and started working to solve it by defining and implementing a decentralized indexing protocol. The <a href="https://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/introduction/">introduction page</a> of the Graph protocol offers detailed information about the protocol and you can also join the free and very useful courses provided by <a href="https://thegraph.academy/courses/">The Graph&nbsp;Academy</a>.</p><p>Develop and Deploy a Revocation Subgraph</p><p>A Subgraph defines which data should be indexed from a blockchain, and how it should be stored. In our simple example, the core data the verifier requires is the hash of the credential and who revoked it. To make things easier for verifiers we could also add the timestamp and block&nbsp;number.</p><p>To keep the article simple we will deploy the subgraph on a <a href="https://thegraph.com/docs/en/hosted-service/what-is-hosted-service/">hosted service</a>. Hosted service can be seen today as a good and easy place to start with the development of Subgraphs because it is free to use and reduces the deployment and testing complexity of Subgraphs. Developers can at any time migrate their Subgraphs to the decentralized network.</p><p>The following steps to develop and deploy the Subgraph are described in detail with all the related files in this <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/vc-revocation-graph/tree/main/credential-revocation-subgraph-files">repository</a>&nbsp;:</p>  First, initialize a new sample project using the <a href="https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli">graph&nbsp;cli</a>  Then modify some of the configurations like adding a startBlock and checking the address of the&nbsp;contract  After that comes the main part of the development which is to define the entities and implement the handle method that will be executed when an event is emitted by a smart&nbsp;contract  In the end, build the project and deploy it on the hosted service using the graph cli and an access&nbsp;token  <p>When the Subgraph is deployed and synchronized we can query the indexed data using simple GraphQL requests.</p><p>Example: open https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/&lt;github-name&gt;/credential-revocation-graph in browser and run the following query to get the hashes of all credentials that are revoked by Issuer-A from&nbsp;./ssi-contracts</p>Query revoked credentials by an&nbsp;issuer<p>The results should contain only a single revoked credential unless you modified the scripts inside&nbsp;./ssi-contract or used an already existing contract for this query. You can also compare the results with the logged data of the executed script in./ssi-contract</p> Summary <p>In this article, we described one of many approaches on how to revoke issued credentials. This outlined approach benefits from the Ethr DID characteristic and it depends on the Blockchain as an immutable registry accessible for all parties. We also talked about the likely best way to index and query revoked credentials without relying on centralized services. And at the end, we showed how to develop a simple Subgraph that could run on the Graph protocol decentralized indexing <a href="https://thegraph.com/explorer/">network</a> and index the required&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> is a provider of crypto-economy solutions based in Stuttgart, Germany.</p><p>51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/indexing-and-querying-revoked-verifiable-credentials-e229dc2781d4">Indexing and Querying Revoked Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF2 rewards. DF3 counting has begun. Maxing&nbsp;APY.  1. Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (LPs / stakers) for higher data consume volume (DCV) and&nbsp;stake.</p><p>DF Round 2 (DF2) is part of DF Alpha phase. DF2 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 23, 2022, and ended 11:59pm Wed Jun 29, 2022 (one week later). 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were computed and sent to the claims contracts. LPs can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>DF Round 3 (DF3) is also part of DF Alpha phase. DF3 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 30, 2022, and will end on 11:59pm Wed Jul 6, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards is available.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, then details on DF2 and DF3. And, it has a special section on really playing the DF game, including exploring “wash consuming”.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As an LP (staker), here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  For each network with rewards (where you staked): select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)  <p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF2 Input Parameters <p>DF2 is the second week of DF overall, and second week of DF Alpha. DF Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>DF2 parameters were the same as DF1. The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included these parameters. Then, “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-examples-c2d67a17b5f5">Ocean Data Farming Examples: DF1</a>” provided examples to better understand earnings, against the DF1 rewards formula and related settings.</p> 4. DF3 Input Parameters <p>The rewards formula and related settings for DF3 are the same as for DF1 and&nbsp;DF2.</p><p>This may not always be the case: we can expect round-to-round evolution of the Reward Function and related settings, based on learnings.</p> 5. DF2 Output&nbsp;Stats <p>OceanONDA V4 currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid 1), Polygon (137), Binance Smart Chain (BSC: 56), Energy Web Chain (EWC: 246), and Moonriver (1285).</p><p>Only Polygon and EWC had nonzero DCV in DF1, so we focus on&nbsp;those.</p><p>Exchange rate was 0.1968 OCEAN/USD, taken from Binance&nbsp;API.</p>  Total Stake (averaged across 7 days). Polygon 1,224,440 OCEAN, EWC 5423 OCEAN, total 1,229,863 OCEAN ($242,037 USD). Stake grew through the week, from just over 1M OCEAN to about 3M&nbsp;OCEAN.  Total DCV (total across 7 days). Polygon 961.98 OCEAN, EWC 4.59 OCEAN, total 966.57 OCEAN ($190.22&nbsp;USD).  OCEAN rewarded to LPs. Polygon 9999.192 OCEAN, EWC 0.8080 OCEAN, total 10000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Rewards Stats. Rewards were dispensed to 138 LPs. The largest reward was 4393.86 OCEAN, the smallest 3.3e-20 OCEAN, average 72.46 OCEAN, median 1.119&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>For more info yet, see the <a href="https://market-git-fix-1562-oceanprotocol.vercel.app/asset/did:op:a3aa14de333ee1ecb3b8a842954033c1c0004f9e77020cacb861843478c1079c">DF2 csvs</a> published as a free asset in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> 6. How to improve your APY? Playing the&nbsp;game. <p>Among other things, Data Farming is a game. Understand it better to earn more. Let’s start with the following curious datapoint: a single LP earned 44% of this round’s DF rewards (4393.86/10000). What game were they playing? Then to flip it around: can you play it? Consider this an opportunity for&nbsp;you.</p><p>To understand DF better, you need to understand what governs your payout. This is the rewards formula. Roughly speaking, reward = DCV * stake. Therefore, increasing DCV increases your rewards, and increasing your stake increases rewards.</p><p>Then ask yourself: how do you increase DCV, or stake? For stake, it’s obvious: just stake more. What about DCV? Well, there’s real consume and fake consume (“wash consuming”). Real consume is when people buy datasets and use them for real. This is a core value proposition for Ocean Protocol: Ocean makes it easy to monetize data, without compromising privacy or control. And of course since Ocean is still relatively young, then there is tremendous upside potential for real DCV. Create real datasets and algorithms that people want to consume, and the rest will&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Some LPs have discovered that wash consuming is profitable right now. A few hundred OCEAN spent on “fake” consumes will increase DCV, and can lead to thousands in OCEAN&nbsp;reward.</p><p>When real DCV is still low-ish, then this strategy pays. Therefore in the near term, expect more wash consuming!</p><p>Over time, we can expect liquidity to migrate to pools with maximum real DCV. This is because every $ on real volume is a $ that the LP doesn’t have to spend to create fake volume. So, as real DCV rises and wash consuming grows, profitability of wash consume will shrink. Eventually, real DCV will get big enough that it won’t be profitable to wash&nbsp;consume.</p><p>The 3% fee rate on every consume establishes this&nbsp;limit:</p><blockquote>If Consume Fee &gt; weekly Rewards Cap, then problem solves&nbsp;itself</blockquote><blockquote>— Manan&nbsp;Patel</blockquote><p>Well put. The weekly rewards cap is currently 10,000 OCEAN. At a 3% rate, DCV needs to be &gt; 10000 / 3% = 333,333 OCEAN. Put another way, if there was a DCV of 333,333 OCEAN, it would mean that total fees gathered for consume are 333,333 OCEAN * 3% = 10,000 OCEAN. Wash-consumers have paid 10,000 OCEAN in fees, and get just 10,000 OCEAN reward. Any higher DCV and it’s unprofitable to wash-consume. However, real data consumers are happy to keep buying and using the data, because they get business benefit from it. In short: once weekly real DCV exceeds 333,333 OCEAN wash consuming won’t be profitable.</p><p>The DF core team considered several mechanisms to stop wash consuming. But each of these adds complexity. However, as discussed, evolution will shrink wash consume over time anyway! In the meantime, we see it as as an extra incentive for the Ocean community to learn about Ocean Market and Ocean DF more. Therefore, the core team has held back from intervening. Let’s let evolution happen:)</p> 7. Conclusion <p>DF2 has completed. To claim DF2 rewards, go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF3 counting has begun.

<p>Today (June 28, 0222), the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI issued a warning</a> stating that scammers may be trying to score jobs at companies to access customer or financial data, corporate IT databases, and/or proprietary information. It goes on to state that there has been an increase in complaints reporting the use of deepfakes and stolen Personally Identifiable Information data (PII) to apply for various remote work and work-at-home positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a solvable problem, beginning with strong identity verification during the hiring process. Unfortunately, while identity verification is a standard process, current practices have failed to keep up with fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>
 Contractor Fraud and the Rise of Remote Work 
<p>Many organizations require the use of contractors, known as third parties. Managing these non-employees through the HR system, the authoritative identity source for their IT ecosystem, can be burdensome. In addition, third-party individuals often require access to organizational resources such as shared tools, applications, or data sets to provide critical services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that this access is usually for a limited period. Third parties present challenges and bring additional risks, such as ensuring that access rights and permissions are managed correctly and, when required, deprovisioned quickly. With the rise of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, these concerns have only been exacerbated</p>
<p>Many companies assume that virtually checking a photo of a new contractor’s driver’s license and passport ensures that they are always the person logging in and working from home every day. Unfortunately, this isn’t necessarily the case. The increase in remote work in the last year has made it easier for fraudsters to attack your organization.&nbsp;</p>
 How Does Contractor Fraud Happen? 
<p>Let’s look at how identity fraud happens in an organization: When new contractors get hired, they receive access to numerous company resources like email and Slack. To gain access to these resources, they will likely use an active directory username and password and a 2FA tool.</p>
<p>What happens if this contractor outsources their work? The employee will provide a third-party outsourcer with usernames, passwords, and 2FA codes. It’s been done before, and with today’s collaboration technologies like Whatsapp and Slack, it can be done in seconds. This could be detrimental to an organization if this person found someone cheaper to do their work or got paid by a third party to let them into the organization to steal intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your company likely did a thorough background check of your employees and contractors. However, you did not do a background check on the subcontractor. This means that this individual could have a questionable background that is not suitable to work at your company. Your company resources and knowledge are vulnerable to the subcontractor.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Improve Third-Party Access Governance? 
<p>The reality is that nearly all organizations have a variety of these third-party individuals who need access to infrastructure, applications, and data. 1Kosmos improves the security of third-party access with our distributed digital identity platform that is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">FIDO2</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">NIST</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">PAD2</a> certified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefit of onboarding contractors with 1Kosmos BlockID is ensuring the highest degree of identity assurance in a virtual environment, eliminating fraudulent activities. Contractors who are bound to their proofed identity with 1Kosmos, they have identity-based biometric authentication and a passwordless experience. In practice, contractors can utilize their secure mobile device for physical or logical authentication and step-up authentication required for privileged access. As a result, each access event is associated with a real, verified identity. Overall, organizations will eliminate the risk of contractor fraud and extra security exposures contractors introduce.</p>
<p>Are you interested in learning more? I invite you to check out a webinar where we covered this very issue “<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/webinars/identity-based-authentication-journey-to-passwordless/">Identity-Based Authentication and The Journey to Passwordless</a>” where Edward Amoroso and Mike Engle discussed third-party access management and contractor fraud prevention. </p>
<p>Additionally, this <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/contractor-enrollment-and-onboarding/">whitepaper</a> covers our integration with Saviynt Third Party Access Governance. The combination of technologies ensures that when a contractor authenticates into the organization, you will have a high assurance that it is the contractor you hired, not someone else working on their behalf or a hacker!</p>

<p>Open banking is a big deal.</p>
<p>That means that Mastercard’s platform (which includes services from Mastercard’s wholly owned subsidiary, Finicity Corporation) is a combination of the work of many different disciplines like engineering, financial expertise, security and more. At the center of it all are product analysts like Kayla Kent, who began at Mastercard in December 2021, after moving to Utah from Northern Virginia.</p>
 What’re your responsibilities? 
<p>I’m on the consumer experience team, and we support the development of Mastercard’s open banking products. As a product analyst, I’m kind of the middleman between our development team, our design team, marketing, legal, etc, making sure basically that we’re on track and aligned with our product roadmap. I help support the team through the software development lifecycle with an agile project methodology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What kinds of challenges do you solve? 
<p>When we’re going through our backlogs and getting work ready for our development team, there’s a bit of planning that goes into that, so a project management hat goes on. And then we’re working with our design team and reviewing product designs and features that are going in, so I’m putting on more of a creative hat. When we’re doing competitive analysis and seeing how we can be better, I’m wearing an analytical hat.</p>
<p></p>
 How does your team exemplify Mastercard values like urgency? 
<p>Our team just gets the work done. If there’s something blocking us, we’ll escalate it immediately. We help each other out by seeing if there are ways to fix any issues that are keeping the project from progressing, making sure we’re pulling in the right people to address those problems and things like that.</p>
 What’s the culture like on your team? 
<p>We have a lot of team bonding social events. So we’ll do a lot of lunches together; we do a bi-weekly team social where we’ll play games and stuff, which is super nice. Because it’s not just like it’s all work between your colleagues. You’re kind of building a relationship past that and having that cohesive team feeling.</p>
<p>I think what’s really cool is that, like, on Slack, there’s all these various team channels, and there’s one that’s called “#misc_womenatfinicity” where we’ll share upcoming volunteering events or career development events that are going on. Another cool resource is Unlocked, which is a resource where you can build your profile and find other volunteering opportunities if you want to develop certain skill sets, or even find a mentor.</p>
<p></p>
 What does working at Mastercard enable you to do in your spare time? 
<p>There’s a good work-life balance at a Mastercard company, and my fiance and I wanted to live in the Salt Lake City area because of all the outdoor activities the area has to offer. So in my free time, we do a lot of skiing, hiking, camping and exploring the national and state parks down in southern Utah, which has been super fun.</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a slower-paced lifestyle here, which I like because you get a chance to breathe, whereas in Washington, or really in any urban area, you get really wrapped up in your work, you’re pulling a lot of overtime and you’re kind of consumed in that.</p>
 Why should someone consider joining the Mastercard open banking team? 
<p>I was interested in working in fintech because you get more opportunity to truly innovate, which you don’t get at every workplace. Another thing is that Mastercard has subsidiaries and offices everywhere, so you’re working with people in places like Europe or in India, and you get that different perspective or background from them. The four weeks of work-from-anywhere time is also really nice—since my family and a lot of my friends are based on the East Coast, it’s nice to be able to take advantage of that.</p>
 Interested in joining our team? 
<p>We’re growing! Search for and apply to our open positions <a href="http://adtrk.tw/tp/rj6.nMip-y-K">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, stay informed about news, events, and opportunities at Mastercard by <a href="http://adtrk.tw/tp/rj6-7SS8_y.K">joining our talent community</a>.</p>

				  Cardea is a complete, decentralized, off-the-shelf, open source codebase for sharing health data in a way that’s compliant with data privacy law  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Cardea emerged from a crisis, a law, and a technology.</p>
<p>The crisis was the global Covid pandemic, the law a US requirement that Americans must be able to access their health care data, and the technology was verifiable digital credentials, which enabled people to do just that—hold their data, share it in a privacy-preserving way, and have it authenticated without having to check in with the source of the data.</p>
<p>That’s a lot to unpack, which is why the community of developers who built and maintain Cardea have written a white paper to explain it all—the background, the mechanics of decentralized identity and verifiable credential technology, and the benefits.</p>
<p>While Cardea now has a <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">white paper</a>, it’s far from a theory: it has been built and you can deploy it right now. It was developed by Indicio for SITA, the world’s leading provider of IT to the air transport sector, and the government of Aruba, which saw it as a way to manage Covid testing, reopen the tourist-dependent island safely, and ensure traveler privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>The trials were successful. The solution <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-the-eic-decentralized-identity-award-means-for-indicio/">won</a> SITA the decentralized identity and verifiable credential award at the 2022 European Identity and Cloud Conference, and Indicio has been <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-crn-tech-impact-awards/">nominated</a> for a social impact award at the CRN Tech Impact Awards in September. The unique parts of its codebase were donated to Linux Foundation Public Health so that public health authorities anywhere had a decentralized, privacy preserving solution optimized for Covid testing and vaccination. That’s when it acquired a name, <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a>.</p>
<p>In proving that tamper-proof health data could be issued to travelers by their health providers and be verified by airlines and other countries without having to check back in with the health provider, Cardea has laid the foundation for something much bigger than Covid testing. Verifiable credential technology provides a way for all kinds of health data to be shared in a privacy-preserving and security-enhanced way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we call Cardea a Trusted Digital Ecosystem because it enables all the parties in the ecosystem to trust the data being shared and to do so without direct integrations with the source of the data. Trustworthy data means immediately actionable data. And that has revolutionary potential in health, travel, finance, and the public sector. <br></p>
<p>This is just a thumbnail sketch of what can be done with the technology; there’s a lot more, and we’ve striven to make the white paper as accessible as possible to the widest audience possible. <br><br>Download a <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">PDF here</a>.</p>

Brexit, COVID, and the war in Ukraine have worsened the problem. But it’s the long term trend towards an economy defined by asset ownership that means the poorest are being hit the hardest whilst landlords, energy companies, and large corporations continue to extract huge&nbsp;<a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/reports/prices-and-profits-after-the-pandemic">profits</a>.</p><blockquote>As <a href="https://autonomy.work/portfolio/berry-work-to-wealth/">Christine Berry</a> has written, rentierism — making money by controlling access to scarce assets — “is the preferred business model for today’s economic elite, since it is both easier and more lucrative than actually doing anything&nbsp;useful.”</blockquote><p>The institutions of collective action through which we might push back — primarily unions — are struggling to adapt to the asset economy. As part of the GLA’s <a href="https://challengeldn.london.gov.uk/challenge/604645abc2dfcb001c1539f9">Designing London’s Recovery</a> programme, Dark Matter Labs started an inquiry into the possibility of a new institution: the Neighbourhood Union.</p><p>A Neighbourhood Union would organise around the multiple forms of rent that are extracted from a local place: housing rent, utility payments, ground rents, service charges, small business rent. It would aim to build power through enabling people to identify and contact others who share the same rentier, and support them to take collective financial or legal action. Longer term, it would be a step towards greater neighbourhood democracy, and help empower residents to shape the development of their local&nbsp;area.</p><p>This blog summarises our work so far. There are many unanswered questions — legal, functional, organisational, digital, and more. But from all the conversations we’ve had, we are confident that there is something here. There is a gap, a need, a space to work&nbsp;into.</p><p>We know that to make Neighbourhood Unions a reality will be a collaborative effort with the thinkers, activists, funders and communities working on this&nbsp;already.</p><blockquote>This blog is an invitation. We are based in Hackney, so building Hackney Union first feels like a natural starting&nbsp;point.</blockquote><p>You could be a small business or resident in Hackney; a member of a local trade or renters union; a community group that wants to find new tools to campaign; or a funder interested in supporting radical, long term change for a new economy. You could be none of those, but just interested in exploring this with us, and working to make it a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>If so — we’ll be at Pub in the Park on Wednesday 13th July, and Thursday 18th August, from 6.30pm. We’d love to see you&nbsp;there.</p>Photo by Samuel Regan-Asante on&nbsp;Unsplash The problem: collection action in the asset&nbsp;economy <p>Rentierism runs through every part of the cost of living crisis.

The (often unfunded) struggles of marginalised groups — including communities of colour and working class communities — have frequently laid the foundations for the organising work that has succeeded in doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>However, the move towards the asset economy presents new challenges. The main vehicle of collective action — trade unions — are focused on employment. Whilst unions like <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/">IWGB</a> are thinking creatively about their options for collective bargaining in emerging sectors (such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/19/firms-urged-to-protect-workers-from-abuse-in-wild-west-uk-gig-economy">gig economy</a>) and finding new ways to exert leverage (such as targeting company owners and organising across sectors, as Alice Martin <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/newe.12256">documents</a>), they are still not focused on the relationship between owners and&nbsp;renters.</p><p>Other forms of union have emerged — in particular, tenants unions such as <a href="https://londonrentersunion.org/">London Renters’ Union</a> (LRU), or community unions such as <a href="https://www.acorntheunion.org.uk/">ACORN</a>. Whilst they have won many important victories, their organising model — based mainly on direct action, in-person peer and expert support, and public pressure of landlords — is hard to scale and lacks the ‘hard power’ of exerting real pressure on profits that traditional trade unions had via strike&nbsp;action.</p><p>There’s a gap: a need to focus on the asset owner-renter relationship and building collective financial power.</p> Our enquiry: The neighbourhood union as a new institution of solidarity <p>We began with the idea that neighbourhoods could provide a strong centre of gravity around which to organise. People often identify strongly with their local area, and remain there for a long time. Broad based community organising has always centred local leadership and&nbsp;place.</p><p>A Neighbourhood Union would aim to build the collective power of different groups — residents, small businesses, leaseholders — and connect their struggle to questions of local, democratic ownership. We see this as a complement to trade unions (organised around work) and renters unions (organised around&nbsp;tenure).</p><p>Our research — including interviews with members of London Renters’ Union, leaseholders, lawyers, policy makers, and think tanks — suggested three design principles for such an institution:</p>  Principle 1: Focus on one-to-many ‘relationships of&nbsp;power.’  Principle 2: Combine digital and social infrastructure  Principle 3: Provide practical tools &amp; services for collective action   Principle 1: Focus on one-to-many ‘relationships of&nbsp;power’ <p>As Deepak Pateriya has <a href="https://forgeorganizing.org/article/whats-your-power-analysis">argued</a>, understanding how power operates is a critical step in making change happen. Within a neighbourhood, there are a wide range of relationships that are characterised by a ‘one-to-many’ relationship between a rentier and a renter, resulting in a significant difference in power. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Corporate landlords (or managing agents) and residents. Many landlords own multiple properties, and the <a href="https://www.homeviews.com/business/industry-blog/the-6-build-to-rent-operators-rated-highest-in-the-uk/">build to rent</a> market is growing rapidly, in which each landlord has hundreds or thousands of tenants. Banks are increasingly getting in on the act, with Lloyds <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9dc9617-f059-4de6-b43a-d5e9978d8c0b">aiming</a> to become one of the UK’s biggest landlords in the next 10&nbsp;years.  Commercial landlords and small businesses. The level of <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/uk-corporate-debt-after-covid-19-what-might-the-impact-be/#:~:text=33%25%20of%20SMEs%20have%20debt,increased%20from%203%25%20before%20Covid.">SME debt</a> has massively increased since the pandemic, with 33% now sitting on debt more than ten times their cash balance, and the general <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-to-resolve-remaining-covid-19-commercial-rent-debts-now-in-place">moratorium</a> on commercial evictions ended in March. Whilst the government may be willing to take action to prevent commercial landlords from simply sitting on empty property, there is currently little scope for small businesses to engage in a collective conversation.  Freeholders and leaseholders. Many leaseholders have been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p09l35m3">shouldered</a> with extremely high costs for building repairs, which are often too high to pay and make it impossible to sell their flat. Some have started local groups, but often limited to their own building — as finding others with the same freeholder is hard to&nbsp;do.  Utility companies and customers. Energy companies have made huge profits as a result of the increase in prices while millions of people are struggling with bills. Water companies have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/england-privatised-water-firms-dividends-shareholders">paid out</a> £13billion in dividends in the last 10 years, whilst in 2020 Thames Water <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60046320">dumped</a> 400 Olympic sized swimming pools worth of raw sewage into the&nbsp;river.  <p>The advantage of focusing on the ‘one-to-many’ relationships is that it makes new forms of collective action possible. If my landlord only owns one property, then there are no other tenants with whom I could take action. If they own multiple buildings, then we could exert real pressure by withholding fees or bringing multiple legal&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The relevance of these one-to-many relationships will differ in each neighbourhood, and there may be others that are not included here. A Neighbourhood Union would aim to be a forum within which these power dynamics are analysed and coalitions built — with a focus on the possibility of disrupting flows of finance in an&nbsp;area.</p> Principle 2: Combine digital and social infrastructure <p>Our starting point in this work was that a digital platform could help address the problems of fragmentation and distance in trying to bring together people who might be scattered across a neighbourhood, and who do not work together. Organisations such as <a href="https://commonknowledge.coop/work/">Common Knowledge</a> and <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">My Society</a> are showing the potential of using digital tools to amplify the power of organisers.</p><p>We think a digital platform could&nbsp;offer:</p>  The ability to identify and connect with others who have your landlord. For example, by uploading information from a tenancy agreement, a platform could match you with other members who have the same landlord.  New participation pathways for those who would be unlikely to attend branch meetings of tenants&nbsp;unions.  An information hub that helps to signpost towards resources that might be helpful in a dispute with a landlord, utility company or freeholder.  Providing easy-to-access tools for collective action (see&nbsp;below).  <p>One message that came through clearly in our conversations, however, was that digital infrastructure alone would never be enough. Social infrastructure and interactions are vital to build trust, relationships, and solidarity between members. Places like the <a href="https://www.thefrontroom.cc/about/">Floating Front Room</a>, which acts as a long-term neighbourhood platform co-owned by local communities, provide creative inspiration for how to build the necessary physical roots in a place. The Local Trust’s work on <a href="https://localtrust.org.uk/insights/research/the-double-dividend/">social infrastructure</a> shows the critical role it plays in shaping residents’ sense of identity, fostering civic pride and building bonds that encourages peoples’ participation in their community. Groups such as <a href="https://www.right-here.org/">We’re Right Here</a> and <a href="https://renaisi.com/">Renaisi</a> are working on creating the conditions that communities need to&nbsp;thrive.</p><p>Whilst being digitally native would be the starting point, a Neighbourhood Union would need to have a physical home, or at least access to physical&nbsp;space.</p> Principle 3: Provide practical tools &amp; services for collective action <p>Our conversations highlighted some of the practical difficulties in organising. Leaseholders who were protesting against the astronomical amounts they were being charged by their freeholders spoke of the difficulty in finding others with the same leaseholder, and the lack of forums on which to communicate. Those that had managed to organise themselves were often doing so via WhatsApp — but one renter we spoke to said that their landlord had managed to infiltrate their WhatsApp&nbsp;group.</p><p>Managing a dispute is difficult enough when there is just one person. Collecting and documenting evidence, staying on top of communication with a landlord / company, filing the right legal papers — it all takes work. Coordinating that across a group who want to take collective action is a massive task. One benefit of being digitally native would be to offer tools and services that make it easier, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Collective case management (document storage, messaging);  Collective legal&nbsp;action;  Collective financial action (eg. withholding rent, bills or service charges).  <p>Unions have always provided practical and legal support — and the new unions mentioned earlier, such as IWGB, are also taking action to shape the law in new areas such as the use of <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/racist-facial-recognition/#:~:text=The%20Independent%20Workers'%20Union%20of,termination%20of%20darker%20skinned%20workers.">facial recognition technology</a> or Uber drivers’ employment status.</p><p>Neighbourhood Unions would aim to combine some of the best practice from new housing unions and new workplace unions in threatening the bottom line whilst working within a community.</p>Photo by Samuel Regan-Asante on&nbsp;Unsplash In the long&nbsp;term <p>The outline we have sketched above imagines a Neighbourhood Union as an institution that can push back against rentier asset owners. A group of leaseholders withholding service fees; a group of residents withholding their water bill; small businesses collectively negotiating rent. In the medium term, this would be an enormous win. But in the longer term, it could take a more proactive, positive role, and help shape local development. A Neighbourhood Union could — like a Community Land Trust — own assets on behalf of the community. Following Community Wealth Building principles, it could enable members to spend money collectively, for example on maintenance &amp; renovation contracts, in a way that retains money in the&nbsp;area.</p><p>Neighbourhood Unions of this kind would be part of the wider movement for civic organising that is taking root. There is growing recognition that the deep, structural and complex challenges we face require more than just policy change — although the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-deal-for-private-renters-published-today%5C">Renters Reform Bill</a> and the end of Section 21 no-fault evictions will be a massive step forward. But whether it’s responding to a pandemic, addressing the cost of living crisis or confronting the climate emergency, we need new institutions for collective actions as much as we need new&nbsp;policy.</p><p>If you’re interested in exploring this work further with us, please get in touch, or come and join us on July 13th at 6.30pm, at Pub in the&nbsp;Park.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/u/9dd85ed72d9e">Dan Wainwright</a> <a href="mailto:info@darkmatterlabs.org">info@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/u/3af4c23a5d6e">Tom Beresford</a> <a href="mailto:tom@darkmatterlabs.org">tom@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p><p>With thanks to all those we spoke to in writing this blog for their time, insight, and&nbsp;care.</p>

<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is the most important&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;innovation of the decade and it’s here now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is already introducing DI capabilities into its&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;privacy toolkit,&nbsp;which will be available as easy-to-use SDKs, sample apps and unbranded apps ready for fast deployment to customers. Our proven&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;digital identities&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">fit neatly with the DI story</a>.</p>



<p>But what is DI, really? And what do all its technical components mean? We drilled down into Anonyome Labs’ deep knowledge of DI to come up with these simple words for complex terms.&nbsp;</p>



 DI lets us control our own personal information. 



 It’s a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is trustworthy, and respects privacy. 



<p>Decentralized identity&nbsp;is the technology and standards that allow a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is more trustworthy and respects privacy. DI puts the user in sole control of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;that forms their identity. It’s&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;because there’s no central authority or single issuing agent.</p>



<p>DI allows a fully digital, universally accepted way of identifying ourselves online (e.g. to a web site or app) and in real life (e.g. at a bar or a border crossing) so:</p>



  We don’t have to use email or usernames and passwords to login, carry paper or plastic versions of our IDs, or give out our personal information to every organization we want to access.  No central authority (e.g. bank, airline, Instagram, Netflix) needs to collect and store our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal ID information</a>&nbsp;(e.g. name, DOB, SSN, address, phone number etc.) and abuse it or&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">risk losing it</a>.  We can take back control of our own IDs and personal information.  



<p>Another term for DI is&nbsp;self-sovereign identity, which simply means the system is&nbsp;self-governing – the user has full control over their personal information.</p>



 DI has 3 pillars:&nbsp; 



  verifiable credentials (or digital ID documents) and the digital wallet they’re stored in  decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and the methods used to verify them  blockchain/distributed ledger used as the anchor of trust.  



 Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 



<p>Digital ID documents with digital signatures that either replace or complement paper or plastic versions (e.g. digital driver’s license, digital passport, digital travel visa). They’re not tied to any one organization or central authority, the user stores and uses them autonomously, and they are easily shared and checked to confirm the holder’s ID to unlock services (e.g. proof of age at a bar, or proof of vaccination at an airport).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital wallet&nbsp;is like a leather wallet only it’s a digital app (usually mobile app) and on the user’s device instead of in their pocket. They use it to store, control, share and carry their digital ID documents, and establish trusted connections (say, between them and their bank or university).&nbsp;We are building a set of SDKs so our enterprise customers can quickly create their own digital identity wallet. We also plan on building an unbranded identity wallet app if an enterprise customer wants to get to market faster.</p>



Figure 1: Example use cases for verifiable credentials (digital ID documents).<br>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>.



 Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) 



<p>You’ll recall from the digital wallet definition that a DID is the unique identifier that identifies a user or service. DIDs are generated&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/01/what-is-encryption-and-why-is-it-important/">cryptographically</a>&nbsp;– so each digital identity has a unique DID and a unique private/public key pair. Attached to the DID on the blockchain is a DIDDoc which contains the public key and also an endpoint address where a message can be sent. The issuer of a digital ID document would write their DID information (including their DIDDoc) onto the blockchain.&nbsp;<br><br>DID methods&nbsp;– This is the interface description of the decentralized ledger or blockchain. It describes how to write and read from the blockchain to use it for decentralized identity applications. For example, it explains the format of the DID, the DIDDoc (public key and endpoint user address for communication), how to write a verifiable credentials schema, credential definition and issuer DID.&nbsp;</p>



 Blockchain&nbsp; 



<p>Perhaps the most used term because it enables cryptocurrencies like bitcoin,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain">blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a database for recording information so it can’t be changed or hacked (immutable). It’s how we establish&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in DI systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain is a type of decentralised database managed by multiple participants (computers in a network). Blockchain can be used for almost anything valuable such as supply chains, payments, accounts, production, orders, decentralized exchanges, smart contracts, etc. Benefits to users are that it’s cost effective and lower risk than a centralized database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchains are unlimited in number and increasing all the time. Right now, about 1,000 blockchains exist in the world, with four different&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/What-are-the-4-different-types-of-blockchain-technology#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20main%20types,benefits%2C%20drawbacks%20and%20ideal%20uses.">types of blockchain network</a>&nbsp;(public, private, consortium and hybrid). Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain">this</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-blockchains-are-there/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20there%20are%20at%20least,platforms%20provided%20in%20this%20industry.">this</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>



<p>Decentralized or public ledger&nbsp;– Similar to a blockchain, this is an encrypted, unalterable record-keeping system which is open to any internet-connected participant. It is secure and anonymous and is like a record book of all transactions between participants.&nbsp;It’s called a public ledger because no central or single authority (e.g. bank or government agency) owns, maintains or monitors it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main difference between a ledger and a blockchain is that a blockchain is fully public and permissionless, whereas a ledger is usually public and permissioned (limited assigned validators/endorsers on the network).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Putting it all together 



<p>That’s the basic concepts covered; now let’s look at who does what in a DI system.</p>



<p>DI needs 3 players:</p>



  Issuer&nbsp;– an authority that asserts a person is who they say they are and issues a digital ID document (e.g. driver’s license)  Holder&nbsp;– the person who owns and stores the digital ID document, and uses it where they want to unlock services (e.g. prove their age at a bar)&nbsp;  Verifier&nbsp;– a person, organization or device app such as a QR code scanner that checks the holder’s digital ID document and unlocks services.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



Figure 2: The 3 players involved in a DI system.



<p>You’ll see that both issuers and verifiers of a digital ID document interact with the blockchain: the issuer uses it to list its DID, schema and credential definition of the digital ID documents it is issuing, and the verifier uses it to check the digital ID document originated at the issuer and has not been modified.</p>



 Some other DI terms you might want to know 



  Verifiable data registry&nbsp;– In DI, this is the system that provides the source of trust for digital ID documents, encryption keys, and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys, etc. Blockchain is one example of a verifiable data registry.&nbsp;  Identity hub&nbsp;–&nbsp;Identity hubs are an additional data store beyond the digital wallet. They’re decentralized off-chain personal data stores which the user has total control over. In their identity hub the owner can securely store all their sensitive data in a way that prevents anyone from using it without their permission. The user can securely share their data with other people, apps, and businesses, and decide to give access to only the minimum data necessary and retain a record of who has access to what.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/identity-hubs-as-personal-datastores/ba-p/389577">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;is doing a lot of work in this space.  DI standards&nbsp;– The rules for exchanging information uniformly via DI systems across the internet. Anonyome Labs&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity-development/">actively contributes</a>&nbsp;to the DI standards area.  DI relay&nbsp;– A DI relay allows DI peer-to-peer messaging even when a user’s device (edge agent) is offline.&nbsp;Relays receive and store messages for when the user comes back online. We just introduced the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo Platform DI Relay</a>.  Edge and cloud agents&nbsp;–&nbsp;These are software components that users and services in the decentralized identity ecosystem leverage, including to set up relationships and handle communications.&nbsp;An&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">edge agent</a>&nbsp;is an application that sits on an edge device, such as a user’s mobile phone. Edge agents can provide an array of DI functionality such as providing wallet and peer-to-peer services.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">Cloud agents</a>&nbsp;are similar to edge agents but provide cloud-based&nbsp;services that are always available – they&nbsp;do not need relays because they are always connected to the network.&nbsp;  Zero knowledge proof&nbsp;– This is a privacy-preserving way of proving something without revealing the actual information. ZKPs make it possible to post confidential transactions to the blockchain by proving the transaction was carried out correctly without revealing the actual information involved in the transaction (e.g. addresses, dollar amounts, etc.).  Peer-to-peer&nbsp;– This simply means two users interacting without a third party in between, for communications, payments etc.&nbsp;  



<p>Some terms in an effective DI system:</p>



  Verifiable&nbsp;– It can prove the validity of a digital ID document (i.e., that a trusted issuer created it and it hasn’t been modified).&nbsp;  Trustless&nbsp;– There’s no requirement on the user to place their sole trust in any one third party in order for a network or payment system to function.  Self-governing&nbsp;– The user has full control over their personal information.&nbsp;  Permissionless&nbsp;– There are no restrictions, and no central authority or administrator controls participation.  Distributed and robust&nbsp;– It uses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;technology, with a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network (as used in cryptocurrency).  Stateful&nbsp;– Transactions can’t be changed (immutable) and are stored in the distributed database of the network.  Native built-in payments&nbsp;– It facilitates the exchange of payment information.  Standards-based and open source&nbsp;– It uses set “rules” so it can work across web sites and services.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p>Verantwortliche für Cybersicherheit sehen sich mit wachsenden Herausforderungen konfrontiert, da die Cyberkriminellen immer kreativer werden und mit einem anscheinend unendlichen Arsenal an Ressourcen bewaffnet sind. Die rasante Digitalisierung in der Folge der Pandemie und die unsichere geopolitische Situation zwingen die Verantwortlichen, ihre Cybersicherheitsstrategien zu überdenken. Trotz eines deutlichen Anstiegs bei den Cybersicherheitsbudgets werden Unternehmen weiterhin Opfer von Cyberattacken. „Den Feind und die eigenen Schwachstellen erkennen und verstehen“ ist der Schlüssel zu wirksamen Verteidigungsstrategien und dafür, einen Vorsprung vor den Cyberkriminellen zu bekommen. Organisationen müssen einen vollständigen Einblick in die externe Bedrohungslandschaft haben und wissen, welche potenziellen Angriffe ihnen drohen. Diese vorausblickende Fähigkeit ermöglicht es Organisationen, sich auf die größten Risiken zu fokussieren und zumindest die schwerwiegendsten Schäden durch Angriffe zu vermeiden.

 Celebrate in your OWN&nbsp;way <p>Welcome to the Ontology 4th Anniversary Carnival! This year, we decided to let you OWN your own celebration. The celebrations are going to be great, with plenty of activities and prizes for you to earn. For all the new people here, welcome to our Ontology family, let us start with introductions.</p><p>In the four years that Ontology has been on MainNet, the focus has been on building the infrastructure and tools for Web3 via decentralized digital identity and data. With the growing popularity of Web3 and the Metaverse, the need for these solutions has become more important than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>To fully realize this solution, and to provide access to this exciting new iteration of the internet, we have recently launched our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/building-decentralized-society-own-your-value-c5be7088ac95">Ontology Web3 Network (OWN) infrastructure framework</a> to enable barrier free development and access to Web3, the Metaverse and beyond. The OWN infrastructure consists of three solutions: the secure, fast and cheap public blockchain, a collection of out of the box protocols to speed up development and ensure compliant implementation of identity and data solutions, and tools to access Web3 and the Metaverse.</p><p>We thought that the best way for you to get to know the OWN infrastructure was to play a few games and reward you with ONG for taking part. What better way to celebrate our birthday? It’s time to explain how you can take part, in your OWN&nbsp;way.</p><p>The Ontology 4th Anniversary Carnival is made up of 6 events for you to take part in, each with individual ONG rewards. 4 of the events will also reward participants with special NFTs, and people who collect all 4 will also receive the ultimate 4th Anniversary NFT. In total there are up to 9300 ONG to be won, let us explain&nbsp;how.</p> Event 1: Fiendish Math Quiz (Rewards: 200&nbsp;ONG) <p>We start off by warming up your OWN brain with our Fiendish Math Quiz. Can you solve the Ontology inspired puzzle, and be one of the randomly selected 10 winners who will win 20 ONG&nbsp;each?</p> Event 2: Let’s explore the Explorer (Rewards: 500&nbsp;ONG) <p>Now that you’ve warmed up your brains, we want to help you to explore your OWN Ontology Explorer. We will be hiding questions linked to an Ontology blockchain address that we will publish. Use the Explorer to discover the questions, and then transfer the amount of ONG that corresponds to your&nbsp;answer.</p><p>All participants will receive the EXPLORER NFT for this event and 200 random winners will win 2 ONG each, with a further 100 ONG shared between those who answered all 8 questions correctly.</p> Event 3: Stake More to Win More (Rewards: 3000&nbsp;ONG) <p>Ontology is a proof of stake network. This means your ONT can help secure the network, be an important part of governance, and earn you ONG rewards. This event is all about helping you to establish your OWN&nbsp;stake.</p><p>All participants will receive the STAKER NFT for this event, with the top 200 stakers, and top 3 nodes earning a share of 3000&nbsp;ONG.</p> Event 4: A Bridge to the EVM (Rewards: 3000 ONG, $1000 CELR, $10,000 UP and $1000&nbsp;WING) <p>The future of Web3 is multi-chain, and a key aspect of this is being able to bridge your tokens easily. This event is designed to help you bridge your OWN tokens, and make use of some of the protocols on the Ontology&nbsp;EVM.</p><p>You will have the opportunity to use cBridge, uTrade, and Wing Finance, and earn prizes for doing so! All participants will win the EVMER NFT, and 2500 ONG will be shared between the first 250 participants, with a further 500 ONG shared with those who use all 3 of our partners. Depending which partner you use, you also have the chance to earn $1000 CELR, $10,000 UP, and $1000&nbsp;WING.</p> Event 5: I am the #xxx, I am Using ONT ID Since (Rewards: 800&nbsp;ONG) <p>We’ve told you about us, and helped you to experience some of the things we do. Now, we want you to tell us about your OWN self. Tell us who you are, what you do, and when you first started using ONT ID — our digital identity solution.</p><p>There are 800 ONG up for grabs, and whilst we offer some advantage for the ONT ID OGs, anyone can win a share of the prize. If you haven’t already, set up your ONT ID and participate.</p> Event 6: DID in Web3 and the Metaverse (Rewards: 1500&nbsp;ONG) <p>Now that you have set up your ONT ID in event 5, it’s time to see how it has been used to access Web3 and the Metaverse. The more Ontology chain transactions, NFTs, the more tokens you hold and stake, the higher your&nbsp;score.</p><p>All participants will receive the IDENTIFIER NFT, and the top 100 ONT ID users will share 1500&nbsp;ONG.</p> The 4th Anniversary NFT <p>If you have collected all 4 NFTs from our events, then you deserve the ultimate 4th Anniversary NFT.</p><p>Congratulations!</p><p>We will also randomly select three 4th Anniversary NFT winners to receive a further 100 ONG&nbsp;each.</p><p>Don’t hesitate to get involved in our birthday celebrations, and remember to stay tuned on Twitter or Telegram for further&nbsp;details.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/our-very-own-mainnet-4th-birthday-e74a55468ad6">Our Very OWN MainNet 4th Birthday</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Wenn die Eingangstür bestmöglich gesichert ist, dann brauchen Sie vielleicht nie wieder Schlüssel für weitere Türen. Durch die Verwendung komplexer Passwörter verschwenden Unternehmen Zeit, Geld und Ressourcen für deren Rücksetzung und verringern die Produktivität ihrer Mitarbeiter. Die sichere Anmeldung bei Anwendungen ist wichtig, aber der erste Authentifizierungspunkt für die meisten Mitarbeiter ist der Laptop, Desktop oder die Workstation selbst. HYPR bietet mit seiner passwortlosen und phishing-resistenten MFA-Lösung eine einfache und dennoch sichere Anmeldung, die den Benutzer am Desktop identifiziert und die Eingangstür absichert. Die Desktop-MFA kann verwendet werden, um sich einfach und sicher an einem Gerät anzumelden und den reibungslosen und sicheren Zugriff auf Anwendungen zu ermöglichen.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Recently deepfakes made a splash in the headlines: Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kiev held one-on-one virtual interviews with several European leaders – or so they thought. In the days following the interviews, it came to light that the Ukrainian official was not actually conducting the interviews, but an unknown party had presented a false representation of Klitschko – with possibilities ranging from a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/25/european-leaders-deepfake-video-calls-mayor-of-kyiv-vitali-klitschko">real-time deepfake</a> to a <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/vitali-klitschko-zweifel-an-giffeys-deep-fake-these-2206-166427.html">re-edited version of existing video footage</a> called “shallow fakes” – that lasted approximately 15 minutes. One of the interviewees became suspicious of Klitschko’s authenticity and broke it off early, but others had no suspicions and continued the interview until its conclusion.</p>
 Deepfakes pose risks for businesses 
<p>More detailed information is not available about the falsified Klitschko, but it opens up many questions about the implications of shallow and deepfakes in politics and across all industries. It adds to the ongoing discussion: how do we know who we interact with digitally, be it our customers, employees, partners, or board members?</p>
<p>Access being granted to an impostor poses severe risk to an organization, be it in this case an impostor gaining audience with mayors of major European cities, or in countless other scenarios such as impersonating a CEO to authorize a funds transfer. Risks like these are clear calls for Zero Trust architectures, described at its simplest as “trust nothing, verify everything”. What options do organizations have to verify the identity of those they interact with digitally?</p>
<p>Remote identity verification is popular in industries like financial services, retail, and health care for consumer-facing interactions, and is gaining traction in many others to cover use cases such as external partner/organization onboarding, employee onboarding, and authentication bound to a verified identity. These solutions typically onboard the person in question by scanning a government-issued identity document (with OCR, NFC, or other means) and compare it against government registries and a real-time selfie of the individual for both biometric measurement and liveness detection. Although this is a market segment that is still maturing, the technologies are well established and continuously being improved. But are they robust enough to detect and reject deepfakes?</p>
 Deepfakes vs. liveness detection 
<p>The biometric onboarding and liveness detection portions of remote identity verification solutions are designed to address presentation attacks, but are not yet always equipped to fend off deepfake attacks.</p>
<p>The concept of detecting liveness is to confirm that the correct individual is physically present at the time of the transaction, and is not misrepresented by a photo, video, or mask, and sometimes synthetic representations (like a deepfake). Usually, the individual is asked to take a live selfie with their mobile device providing real-time evidence that the correct individual is conducting the transaction. Checks such as audio and facial synchronization, consistent blinking, and biometric inconsistencies help to indicate if a synthetic video or deepfake has been presented.</p>
<p>A deepfake could be injected via a faulty API, bypassing the device camera, or infecting the computer with malware. In this case, a selfie (injected by the attacker) may not be interpreted as fraudulent. For additional security against such deepfakes, either active or passive liveness checks should be completed. The individual may be asked to follow directions like blinking, turning their head, saying a series of random numbers, and so on to detect if the person is real and can respond to spontaneous instructions. This is referred to as active liveness, since the individual is asked to actively do something to prove their presence, to which a deepfake may not always be able to dynamically respond. Passive versions exist as well such as flashing a random sequence of colors on the individual’s face as they take a selfie. If a deepfake video was injected into the communication stream, this series of colors would be interrupted and indicate an attack.</p>
<p>Both deepfakes and liveness detection are improving, making it a game of chess to stay ahead of attacks.</p>
 Do deepfakes require adoption of identity verification? 
<p>The simple answer to this is yes, the more deepfake attacks increase in volume and sophistication, the more businesses can counteract with identity verification. However, the reality depends on factors:</p>
 
 The high cost of producing deepfakes 
 The scenarios deepfakes will be used in 
 The willingness of normal, non-fraudulent users to verify their identity 
 The different circumstances that non-fraudulent users are willing 
 
<p>Currently, believable deepfakes are labor-intensive to create, and do not scale well compared to other presentation attacks like static images, videos, 2D or 3D masks, injection attacks, or replay attacks. Deepfakes will likely play an increasingly threatening role in social engineering attacks and spear-phishing, since the resources required to develop it can be focused on a particular target. But largescale attempts to onboard or authenticate fraudulent users may not be the most common use case for deepfakes. Additional protection against deepfakes for high-profile people, politicians, celebrities, and C-level members of organizations may be considered, but may not be necessary when general public onboards or authenticates.</p>
<p>It may be prudent to ask if a political leader would subject themselves to remote identity verification conducted by another sovereign nation. Would it be viewed as a security risk for country that they represent, or seen as a gesture of goodwill? The same could be said for C-level members being verified by an external organization that they wish to do business with. And if these individuals refuse to agree to an identity verification step, will the other party rely on increasingly passive methods, which are arguably more invasive as collecting appropriate consent becomes more difficult?</p>
<p>While certainly not a complete answer to these questions, interoperability and standard credential formats can help ease the reluctance of one party being verified by the system of the other, mainly by allowing the identity verification step to be conducted internally, and shared with the other party in a standardized format. Initiatives like <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81119/gain-explained">GAIN</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81204/guide-to-implementing-decentralized-id">Verifiable Credentials</a> are making steps towards establishing globally interoperable <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity">reusable verified identity</a>.</p>
 What changes do we need? 
<p>As the quality and scalability of deepfake attacks increase, we must increase the defensive detection measures. While some current identity verification solutions claim to detect deepfake attacks, most are geared towards deterring more scalable attacks like spoofing, fraudulent documents, or masks. Especially notable is synchronous video identification, where the individual joins a video call with a live agent. These solutions rely on manual verification only, and while agents are trained in verifying documents and passports, they are not trained to detect a deepfake. Since these attacks look more and more believable to the human eye, video identification in particular would benefit from additional algorithmic checks for anomalies. We should expect remote identity verification solutions to invest in the ability to better detect deepfake attacks.</p>
<p>The best weapon against attacks that use AI is defense that uses AI. Adding algorithmic anomaly detection for deepfake tell-tales like inconsistent or nonexistent blinking, inconsistent background and inconsistent video quality will be a meaningful step forward towards deterring more deepfake attacks. Deepfakes already have and will undoubtedly continue to address these inconsistencies, and therefore it becomes paramount to develop the capabilities to detect anomalies that have never been seen (or trained for) before.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole continues to research the identity verification space, and will publish a series of reports in the later half of 2022. Keep an eye out for this research to stay up to date on topics like liveness detection.</p>

   Facebook doesn’t have a strong reputation for respecting privacy — in fact, the company thrives on being as invasive as possible. It collects as much personal data on users as possible across all of their services. But, how does it acquire this data, and what does it do with it?

 Understanding the potential of the vLEI – the Organisation verifiable credential 
<p>We’ve been involved in some really cool work over the last few weeks focusing on the issuance of vLEIs and associated role credentials. Specifically, Ubisecure was the credential issuer for the GLEIF’s vLEI proof of concept project and issued the world’s first vLEI to the GLEIF, which was then used to sign the GLEIF’s 2021 annual report. </p>
 
 <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-showcases-one-digital-id-for-every-business-globally-with-first-verifiable-lei-deployment">Read full vLEI press release</a> 
 <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/vLEI/ixbrl-report-2021-viewer.html#">View vLEI role-based signatures in the 2021 GLEIF Annual Report</a> 
 
<p>The system works really well, but stepping back from the entire process there is a lot of technology and complexity involved behind the vLEI, as there is with most identity and/or cryptographic platforms. Like many complex systems we can break it down and take a more understandable view on what a vLEI actually is, what they do, and how we expect them to be used in the future. </p>
 What is a vLEI? 
<p>We are going to make a few assumptions here, the main one is that you already know about <a href="https://rapidlei.com/knowledge-base/what-is-an-lei-code/">LEI</a> (short for Legal Entity Identifiers). If you want to know more about the LEI itself we have some great material in our <a href="https://rapidlei.com/knowledge-base/">LEI Knowledge Base</a>. </p>
<p>The v in vLEI stands for “verifiable”, but what does that mean? The term verifiable in this case comes from the term “Verifiable Credential”. A verifiable credential is just a collection of information with a mechanism that allows a computer to verify that the information has not been modified and that the information was originally stated to be correct by some third party (maybe a bank, or the driving license authority). Often (almost always really) the information will include a link to the entity the information is about. </p>
<p>With those three things the verifiable credential can be used to provide information to others in a way that allows the receiver to be very confident about the claims made by the information.</p>
<p>Let’s take a simple, parallel example based around a driving license. Fred has his driving license as a plastic card in his wallet as issued to him by his national driving authority. He loses his card, but shortly gets a call from the local police station saying it has been handed in and he should come and claim it. When Fred gets to the police station the desk sergeant spends a long time looking at the photo (which is quite out of date now, time has not been kind to Fred!), asking Fred questions about his address, date of birth etc. Eventually the sergeant feels that Fred has answered enough correctly and hands over the license. </p>
<p>Alice also has a driving license but her license is on her mobile phone. Unfortunately, Alice loses her phone, but again shortly gets a call from the police to say it has been handed in. When Alice gets to the station, she can prove it is her phone by using her fingerprint to unlock it. The desk sergeant does not need to use his judgement, Alice has proved control over the phone and so it must be hers.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials work in the same kind of way, there is the ability to prove ownership of the credential. This process is understood by computer systems and so all the checks can be performed electronically online and in turn that allows automation and significant cost saving.</p>
<p>Back to the vLEI, at the basic level the vLEI is simply an LEI code, a unique organisation identifier, stored as part of the information set in a verifiable credential. A standard mechanism exists to prove ‘control’ over any given vLEI and so it is possible to determine, automatically, if the entity presenting the vLEI is entitled to do so. This capability now allows organisations to participate in trusted automatic transactions.</p>
 Wait, there’s more to vLEI than just the organisation 
<p>The vLEI standards define more than just a verifiable credential for the legal entity. Two further verifiable credentials are defined that allow information on people associated with the organisation.</p>
<p>The first of those two credentials is the “Official Organisation Role” credential (OOR). The OOR links an individual with an organisation in a well-known role. The roles are limited to an official set of ‘official’ roles as defined by an ISO standard (ISO 5009_2022). This list includes roles such as ‘Director’, ‘Chief Executive Officer’, ‘Chief Financial Officer’. With an OOR credential an individual is able to present themselves as holding an official role for a given organisation, and all the claims presented can be electronically verified in real time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The second of these two credentials is the “Engagement Context Role” credential (ECR). The ECR is very similar to the OOR except that the role is custom, the legal entity can define any role they wish and place that in the ECR. For example, “customer of”, “supplier to”, “contractor for”.</p>
<p>In the below example we see the GLEIF annual report signed using vLEI, OOR and ECRs. The browser-based document viewer displays the signers, their roles and their organisation association:</p>
<p></p>
 What can we do with a vLEI  
<p>There are many reasons why vLEIs will see a rising prominence in the coming months and years:</p>
 
 Document signing: document signing solutions exist, however they currently use ‘standard’ signatures. These do not have the ability to link between signatures. Credentials from the vLEI ecosystem can provide the same level of security of signature and also provide linkage information between the various signing parties. 
 KYC/KYB: It is currently quite challenging to determine that an individual is empowered to act in a certain capacity for an organisation. The vLEI credentials solve this challenge by design, massively reducing onboarding and ongoing verification costs. 
 Delegation: The ability to understand the linkage between an individual and an organisation allows for electronic delegation of rights and responsibilities. Delegation capabilities brings significant cost saving to organisations where complex inter-company relationships need to be electronically enabled and enforced, see <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/customers/" title="Ubisecure’s Finnish Government Katso case study">Ubisecure’s Finnish Government Katso case study</a> for an example. However whereas Katso was a closed community operating just within one jurisdiction, the vLEI offers the same potential using a trusted, standardised, globally verifiable credential.  
 Representation Governance: Parameterising delegation (think individual expense sign off levels as an example) moves delegation into the role of representation governance. This capability then allows all the business process that have been manual to be automated with the obvious cost savings. Whilst this is already possible in some regions the vLEI ecosystem enables this capability on a global basis. 
 
 It’s all about trust (frameworks) 
<p>There are more credentials in the broader framework than have been covered here, and that broader framework is quite important.</p>
<p>We have already understood that a credential wraps information and that systems can automatically verify the information to determine the original issuer of the information and that it is unaltered. This allows someone receiving the credential to know the Legal Entity in question and the nature of the relationship between that Legal Entity and the individual representing them. But how do we know that the person didn’t manage to get a fake identity through the system?</p>
<p>That assurance comes from the vLEI ecosystem having a defined Trust Framework, and an audit system that validates compliance to the Trust Framework. </p>

<p>When the credential is originally issued the issuer (known as a ‘Qualified vLEI Issuer’ or QVI) is required to perform identity checks to a globally defined standard. This is the same as you having to present your passport when you open a bank account or create a mobile phone account. As more national Ids become available the national ids will be able to provide the individual information meaning that a manual check will not be needed. In fact eIDaS 2 will be based on verifiable credentials itself. </p>
 What happens now 
<p>The GLEIF, along with stakeholders like Ubisecure, have been working incredibly hard to progress the vLEI project. Now the proof of concept has been released, the ecosystem will continue to develop the issuance technology and policy frameworks to make the vLEI a commercial reality. We are excited to continue to contribute to this exciting organisation identity advancement.</p>

				  The Cardea White Paper is Now Available  
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>The Cardea Project at Linux Foundation has released its first white paper — “The Cardea Project: A complete, decentralized, open source system for sharing medical data in a privacy-preserving way with machine readable governance for establishing trust.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cardea emerged as a response to the global pandemic and the need for a privacy-preserving way to prove Covid testing and vaccination status for air travelers. Developed by Indicio for SITA, the largest provider of IT to the air transport sector, in conjunction with the government of Aruba, the codebase was donated to Linux Foundation Public Health, where it continues to be developed by a community group of companies to address a much broader set of health data needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This white paper has been written by this community (which includes Indicio) and explains the history, implementation, and — most importantly — the mechanics of Cardea in a step-by-step explanatory style that presumes no prior knowledge of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>In fact, more than anything, the Cardea white paper is a perfect introduction to decentralized identity, the value of an open source approach to technology, the benefits of using verifiable credentials to create actionable data, and the opportunities that are created by this powerful new technology.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>Indicio Deputy CTO Sam Curren was recently featured on the “This Week in Tech Podcast” to discuss why DIDs and DIDcomm are the best approach to identity. In short, it’s all about making people first-class citizens on the internet and reducing reliance on third parties to exchange information.</p>

  <p>The cyber threat landscape has become very complex, with state-of-the-art intrusion, ransomware, and cryptocurrency mining tools now readily available through online stores and service providers, and an expanding attack surface due to increased cloud computing and remote working. Keeping data secure while ensuring its availability to legitimate users has become extremely challenging.&nbsp;Join experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and One Identity as they discuss the evolution of the cyber threat landscape and consider how correlating visibility, security, and control to an identity and its associated processes and accounts can significantly mitigate against modern cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cybersecurity threat landscape continues to evolve and pose new challenges to CISOs and security managers. But as Paul Fisher, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole will explain, it isn’t just about responding to threats, but also managing identity access and cloud infrastructures in new ways.&nbsp;Alan Radford, Global Identity and Access Management Strategist at One Identity will explain how to achieve a consistent view across users, machine identities, and accounts to help organizations move to a unified state. He will also highlight the importance of managing privileged users, and provide an overview of Unified Identity Management Platform that integrates Access Management, PAM, and IGA solutions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/dealing-effectively-modern-cyberthreats"></a>

 Veriscope Weekly Regulatory Recap (June 20 — June&nbsp;25)  The global crypto market is in a slightly better position than the week before. Yet, the cloud of uncertainty looms large over the broader&nbsp;market. <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s Weekly Regulatory Recap. The global crypto market is in a slightly better position than the week before. Yet, the cloud of uncertainty looms large over the broader market. Authorities continue to stress the need for regulatory measures to put an end to the wild-west days of the crypto industry. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> Swiss Financial Authority CEO Demands Strong Crypto Regulations to Prevent Market&nbsp;Abuse <p>Drawing parallels to the US stock market of the 1920s, Urban Angehrn, Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Market Supervisory Authority, Switzerland’s financial regulator, demanded strong regulatory measures for the digital assets market to prevent abusive market practices.</p><p>While speaking during a conference in Zurich, Angehrn said, “It would seem to me that a lot of trading in digital assets looks like the U.S. stock market in 1928, where all kinds of abuse, pump, and dump, are now, in fact, frequently common.”</p><p>He also asked his colleagues to brainstorm ways to simplify the technology, find ways to make massive data processing easier to handle crypto transactions, and create frameworks to protect investors against market&nbsp;abuse.</p><p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/swiss-regulator-urges-financial-watchdogs-to-protect-crypto-investors/">Click here to learn&nbsp;more</a>.</p> A Leading Nigerian Bank MD Calls Country’s Auditors to Monitor &amp; Flag Crypto Transactions for any Terrorism Financing-related Incidents <p>Math Ude, Managing Director of one of the leading Nigerian wholesale and investment banks, Nova Merchant Bank Limited, recently called on auditors to focus on digital asset-related transactions in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Attending a quarterly meeting of the Association of Chief Audit Executive of Banks in Lagos, Ude said that illicit actors involved in terrorism might turn to digital assets for money laundering &amp; terrorism financing.</p><p>Thus, he said that auditors must watch out for a systematic framework that enables them to collect sender &amp; beneficiary information, such as names &amp; account details of individuals &amp; organizations behind the transactions, and flag high-risk ones to the authorities. And doing so will prevent the misuse of digital assets in illicit activities in the&nbsp;country.</p><p><a href="https://leadership.ng/terrorism-financing-auditors-urged-to-monitor-digital-payments-system/">Click here to learn&nbsp;more.</a></p> ECB President Pushes for Extending Crypto Regulations to Staking &amp; Digital Assets&nbsp;Lending <p>While giving testimony to the European Parliament, the Head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, proposed to EU lawmakers to extend the current crypto regulatory framework to staking and crypto lending. She termed her proposal, MiCA&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Lagarde’s statement comes amid increasing demand from users to regulate the crypto lending space as some of the most popular virtual asset lending companies recently paused or limited withdrawals.</p><p>Leading crypto lending platforms like Celsius and Babel Finance recently paused withdrawals amid growing market uncertainty. Whereas, BlockFi and Voyager reduced the withdrawal limit. The fiasco attracted the attention of global authorities, including the&nbsp;SEC.</p><p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ecbs-christine-lagarde-proposes-a-mica-2-0-to-cover-bitcoin-staking-and-lending/">Click here to learn&nbsp;more</a>.</p> Panamanian President Sends Back Crypto Bill for not Including AML Provisions <p>Laurentino Cortizo, President of Panama, recently rejected to sign the crypto bill, legally known as Bill No 697 in the country, over AML-related concerns.</p><p>Although President Cortizo had called the bill “innovative” in the past, he is concerned about the lack of anti-money laundering provisions to prevent the use of crypto-assets in illicit activities.</p><p>Panama is known worldwide for its tax haven status, denting its global reputation, especially among financial regulators, such as the Financial Action Task&nbsp;Force.</p><p>As of now, Panama is placed in the “Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring” list. Thus, the President wants to strengthen the country’s AML framework to improve its reputation.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/president-of-panama-rejects-to-sign-the-crypto-bill-sends-it-back-for-further-discussion-over-d8b3e3c50708">Click here</a> to read more on the Panamanian President’s stance on the country’s crypto&nbsp;bill.</p><p>The current crypto market downturn is wreaking havoc on some of the largest crypto companies in the world, with crypto lending and exchanges companies facing the most heat. Such a brutal market downturn has made one thing clear to the global financial regulators: this industry cannot continue without regulatory oversight. Thus, this week, too, authorities continue to vouch for bringing crypto assets within the regulatory net.</p><p>The day when countries will co-ordinate and develop a global framework to regulate digital assets is not far. Hence, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must start complying with current national and international laws around digital assets. Speaking of global crypto regulations, the most important piece of law today is the FATF’s Travel Rule. And to comply with the Travel Rule, you will need a Travel Rule Solution Provider&nbsp;(TRSP).</p><p>Check out Veriscope, the best TRSP in the market.

<p>Kuala Lumpur/Manila, 29 June 2022 — Xarcade and TheFamous Labs are pleased to announce a partnership today for the benefit of web3 game developers and players. Xarcade with this partnership will be able to offer more solutions to web3 game developers when creating their NFT assets inventory.</p><p>Xarcade game developers will be allowed to access TheFamous Labs NFT factory and customize their NFTs with a library of options such as creating limited edition sub-NFTs or dynamic NFTs that can evolve during a game’s lifetime.</p><p>At the same time, Xarcade game players will benefit from an access to a dedicated section on TheFamous NFT marketplace to trade their assets from different Xarcade games with the possibility to bag and carry them, with their wallet, back to&nbsp;Xarcade.</p><p>When using Xarcade, a game developer can seamlessly blockchain his game and does not need to have any prior blockchain development knowledge to get started. Once done blockchaining his game, Xarcade also distributes the game, thus opening up a whole new&nbsp;market.</p><p>TheFamous Labs is the provider of an NFT factory and a marketplace that allows the creation, sale, and trade of a new generation of NFT VIP (Verifiable, Interoperable and Protectable). NFTs created by the factory can be easily verified using a unique passport that gives easy access to metadata, copyright certificate, buyer rights, and other events linked to ownership.</p><p>The NFTs can also be carried by owners from different blockchain platforms to trade or use them. Finally, NFTs are made dynamic and more secure with rights that can be revoked if used illegally while having an NFT suspended if proven to have been&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>According to Otto von Nostitz, CEO of Xarcade, “By partnering with TheFamous Labs, we can provide for our users an even more entertaining gaming experience. A game developer will be able to further enhance his blockchain game development by having access to TheFamous Lab’s innovative features.”</p><p>Fred Saurat, one of the founders of TheFamous Labs, commented, “When we were introduced to Xarcade via our common partner ProximaX, and we understood the vision of this metaverse project for web3 gamers, we immediately realized that our NFT platform and factory would be a perfect fit for this exciting and innovative venture.”</p><p>About Xarcade</p><p>Xarcade is a next-generation video game tokenization and distribution platform. It is a game-changer for seamless blockchaining of games and is a cost-less alternative to other app stores. The Xarcade gaming ecosystem consists of the Xarcade platform and the future Xarcade metaverse called MetaXar. On the Xarcade platform there is the testnet environment, whereby the game developer can release a game with assets of no real-world value in order to have his gameplay tested before releasing in the mainnet environment whereby a game will have assets of real-world value. Then from mainnet, the game developer can have his game released in&nbsp;MetaXar.</p><p>About TheFamous Labs</p><p>TheFamous Labs (a reference to Warhol factory and pop culture), is building a new economy around web3, culture and a community in transit to metaverses.</p><p>TheFamous Labs using its NFT factory and marketplace focus on building bridges, from the first generation of NFT to a new one more secure and intelligent, to and between metaverses while providing its technology to some of them, from creators to digital collectors offering solutions to onboard non-crypto native and finally from pop and street culture to the digital and cyber&nbsp;ones.</p><p>The Labs is also developing partnerships with institutions, curators and brands providing its technology and solutions, to develop innovative NFTs collections and web3 projects in different metaverses.</p>

  <p>Determined cyber attackers will nearly always find a way into company systems and networks using tried and trusted techniques. It is therefore essential to assume breach and have the capability to identify, analyze, and neutralize cyber-attacks before they can do any serious damage.&nbsp;But this can be challenging, especially when critical data is stored in business applications on-premise and in the cloud. Join cybersecurity experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and SAP for a discussion on why monitoring the SAP landscape is necessary and how this can be best achieved.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will talk about finding the right mix of cross-application solutions for threat detection, SIEM, and SOAR, and specialized solutions for critical environments such as the SAP line of business applications. He also will look at the interplay between security and identity, and how this can all converge in a modern Security Operations Center.&nbsp;Arndt Lingscheid,&nbsp;Solution Owner for SAP GRC – Security and Data Protection at SAP&nbsp; will share his perspectives and provide a detailed overview of SAP Enterprise Threat Detection Cloud Version that is designed to provide expert SAP security monitoring to neutralize threats in real time based on an included Managed Security Service.</p>

				<p>“Humanity is sending people to space, editing genes, and developing AI that can write better blog posts than I can,” said Riley Hughes, co-founder and CEO of Trinsic. “Yet, I still can’t even prove my legal name is Riley Hughes – let alone anything else about myself – digitally. Decentralized identity will finally solve this. We’re fortunate to have a front-row seat as our customers and partners bring that future a step closer to reality every day.”</p><p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>While decentralized identity is in high demand, developers face a dizzying number of standards to be compatible with—“<a href="https://nftnow.com/guides/soulbound-tokens-sbts-meet-the-tokens-that-may-change-your-life/">SoulBound Tokens</a>” and <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1535314738078486533">“Web5</a>” being the latest additions to the litany of W3C, ISO, DIF, ToIP, and other existing specs. Trinsic offers teams a single API that acts as an abstraction layer that bridges ecosystems, strips complexity away from the development process, and ensures products are future-proof.</p>

A wallet with every identity.<p>When we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-the-wallet-87870843dc1b">first launched the GlobaliD Wallet</a> powered by Uphold back in June of 2020, the goal was clear. Our vision has always been that anyone, anywhere should be able to create and own their <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/why-self-sovereign-identity-matters-8fd2c982ca2e">self-sovereign digital identity</a>. And along with that identity, they should get a wallet, providing them access to basic financial services.</p><p>These are the bare necessities of anyone trying to operate in the modern world, and the release of the original GlobaliD Wallet was a huge step toward achieving that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>But there have also been limitations when it comes to wallet access, where users living in certain countries or states have not been able to participate in the full GlobaliD experience. This is no fault of Uphold, which continues to expand its services to more and more jurisdictions. Instead, it’s the nature of any <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/custodial-wallets-vs-non-custodial-crypto-wallets/">custodial offering</a> in a highly regulated space.</p><p>What we’ve learned over the last two years is that in order to truly achieve our vision, we need to transition to a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/custodial-wallets-vs-non-custodial-crypto-wallets/">non-custodial solution</a> for the GlobaliD Wallet. That way, anyone who creates an identity with GlobaliD can get a non-custodial GlobaliD&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Beyond access, moving to a non-custodial solution gives us more control over our own destiny with exciting prospects for new products and features — including future debit card programs. It also means our users will be able to own and control their money along with their identity, furthering our mission toward building a more self-sovereign future.</p><p>So what will these changes look&nbsp;like?</p> 1. Effective July 15, 2022, you will need to access your wallet directly through Uphold rather than GlobaliD. Rest assured, the contents of your wallet won’t&nbsp;change.   On July 15, 2022, the GlobaliD Wallet powered by Uphold will be removed from the GlobaliD&nbsp;app.  GlobaliD Wallet users will still be able to access their wallet through Uphold’s website and&nbsp;app.  If you don’t have separate login credentials with Uphold, use the email address associated with your GlobaliD to login to Uphold using the “forgot password” flow to establish a password&nbsp;there.   2. The new non-custodial GlobaliD Wallet will soft launch in the near future — stay&nbsp;tuned.   This is still a work in progress and will be a staggered release so stay tuned, but this will be a pivotal step towards achieving our vision of providing anyone, anywhere with an identity and a&nbsp;wallet.   3. Debit card programs tied to the custodial GlobaliD Wallet including the GlobaliD and XRP Mastercard® Debit Card will cease operation on July 15,&nbsp;2022.   As both of these debit cards are tied to the custodial GlobaliD Wallet powered by Uphold, they will also cease operation on July 15,&nbsp;2022.  We have plans for future card programs, but it’s too early to discuss those details at this&nbsp;time.  XRP Rewards will be ending along with the debit card program. Your XRP Rewards will continue to accumulate through July 15 and will be available in your Uphold account after the card program&nbsp;ends.   4. The XRP Army Group on GlobaliD will live&nbsp;on.   Despite the XRP Card program ending, we will continue to support the XRP Army Group on GlobaliD.  As a core group of early adopters on the platform that have made a huge contribution to GlobaliD’s ongoing success, we will continue to engage with the XRP Army Group. Group members will receive exclusive early access to new products and features such as the new non-custodial GlobaliD Wallet and potential future card and rewards programs.  <p>Making these changes wasn’t an easy decision, but we believe that it’s the right strategic move in order to build a best-in-class identity and wallet offering for a more inclusive and equitable future.</p><p>In the coming weeks we will be announcing and releasing new tools, like our aforementioned non-custodial wallet as well as new privacy-preserving ways for people to use their identity. If you’d like to stay up to date on these and future card releases, <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">subscribe to our GlobaliD Insider newsletter</a>.</p><p>If you have more questions about this change, your wallet, or your card, you can refer to the FAQ below. If you have additional questions, please reach out to our <a href="https://care.global.id/hc/en-us">Customer Care</a>&nbsp;team.</p><p>For questions regarding your Uphold wallet, you can reach out to <a href="https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us">Uphold&nbsp;Support</a>.</p> Frequently Asked Questions <p>Why is this happening?</p>  Over the last two years we’ve learned that in order to truly achieve our vision of self-sovereign identity and inclusive finance, we need to transition to a non-custodial solution for the GlobaliD Wallet. The initial non-custodial solution will not support a card program at&nbsp;launch.  <p>What happens to my funds in my&nbsp;wallet?</p>  Your funds are safe. You will be able to access them directly through the <a href="https://uphold.com/en-eu">Uphold</a> mobile or web application. You will not be able to access them via GlobaliD after July&nbsp;15th.  <p>What happens to my&nbsp;rewards?</p>  All of your paid-out rewards will be accessible via Uphold in the Portfolio section. Click the dropdown next to “XRP” and you will see “Reward — XRP.”  <p>What happens to the money that was funding my&nbsp;card?</p>  All of your funds will still be available through Uphold in the Portfolio section.  <p>What do I do with my&nbsp;card?</p>  The card will stop working on July 15th, 2022. After that point, you will no longer be able to use it to make payments or collect new rewards and are free to dispose of the card if you wish to do&nbsp;so.  <p>How do I access my Uphold&nbsp;account?</p>  From the Uphold website, you can log in with the email address you registered with GlobaliD. If you don’t have a password, click on “Forgot password?” and proceed with Uphold’s password recovery flow to create a password. You will now be able to access your Uphold account with your email and password.  <p>How do I use my Uphold&nbsp;wallet?</p>  Please visit <a href="https://uphold.com/en-us/faq">the Uphold help center</a> to learn more about your Uphold wallet and&nbsp;account.  <p>Do I need to do anything to disconnect the XRP card or close&nbsp;it?</p>  No. After July 15th the card will automatically deactivate.  <p>Will GlobaliD support a card program in the&nbsp;future?</p>  We are looking into different ways to support card programs on the new non-custodial GlobaliD Wallet, but there are currently no short-term plans to start supporting this feature.

<p>In May we met with a group of actors from the Swedish food systems to explore what is changing in the systems at the moment and how this could be strategically navigated to enable a more rapid transition towards healthy and sustainable food&nbsp;systems.</p>Navigating the change landscape<p>In transformation theory, crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, are formative moments that could enable whole systems to transition and even transform. To understand how this potential could be seized, four strategic areas for change had been identified, based on the lab’s previous research and scenario workshop. They became the basis for discussion.</p><p>You can read more about what we were doing during the workshop and also download audio files that describe the strategic areas in this <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/making-strategic-moves-towards-sustainable-food-system-futures-31ffae3e64c2">previous blog</a>. Below we are outlining key findings and strategies built during the workshop with the actors. We recognise that the actors who participated primarily represented Stockholm perspectives and that the results are not representable for Sweden in its entirety.</p>Rapid Transition Lab: Strategy&nbsp;workshop A: Self-sufficiency <p>This group discussed how to strengthen the Swedish food systems capabilities to become more self-sufficient and resilient. The crisis has flashed out Sweden’s great dependency on imports and foreign food. Which may stimulate the national goals of increased resource efficiency and sustainable production methods. Incentives and business opportunities play a vital role, as well as new technologies. The group emphasized that there is a need to increase local production but also to change what is being produced and not necessarily more of the same (for example meat and&nbsp;dairy).</p><p>When looking at the change landscape we see that there has been an increased sale of locally produced goods. Some of the small grocery stores in rural areas have increased their sales. The participants had also found that there had been an increased interest in the role that publicly procured food can play for increased health and sustainability. The group elaborated on the fact that the increased prices on fuels and fertilizers both can be seen as an obstacle as well as a hinder. In terms of challenging food systems based on unsustainable use of diesel and chemical fertilizers, there is opportunity to bring in alternative products and increase efficiency.</p><p>The strategic moves discussed in the group had a stronghold towards government activities. The government was seen both as a driver for change in procurement of local and sustainable food, as well as creating incentives for change in regulations (like: all school meals should be sustainable products) and incentives for more sustainable production. For example, to use a “carrot and stick” approach to shift fossil fuel dependency in food productions. The group went deeper into the discussion around strategic moves for a circular value chain and specifically identified several activities connected to side stream opportunities and a shift towards mainstreaming biological fertilizers.</p> B: Regenerative farming <p>This group focused on how to create a culture of regenerative farming, where the farmers’ job is attractive, generates nutrition, fibers and energy (without waste) and cares for the long-term health of soil, plants and animals. Regenerative practices further include: 1) managing other types of land, such as forests, lakes and waterways, 2) meeting people’s needs within the means of the planet, and 3) providing the farmer with a reasonable income. Some participants highlighted regenerative farming as part of local food systems, whereas others emphasized the need for regenerative farming to be scalable and produce food to&nbsp;many.</p><p>When looking at the current change landscape, participants identified movements that could support change towards regenerative farming. Increased costs of diesel and chemical fertilizer could make regenerative practices more feasible compared to conventional ones, as it relies mainly on renewable and domestic inputs. Actors promoting regenerative practices could further connect to the heightened security debate by arguing that a resilient food production is an important part of civil defense. Yet, some actors highlighted the risk of regenerative farming not being able to produce enough food and that there may be a shortage of fertilizer (e.g. manure), especially, if it is implemented too&nbsp;fast.</p><p>With this in mind, the group discussed an overarching strategy to make financial resources available to drive the transformation toward regenerative agriculture (regardless of the farm’s size). This would address the lack of economic incentives and capital to make the transition. Several strategic moves were identified to enable this, for&nbsp;example:</p>  paying regenerative farmers for their efforts to improve and mitigate climate change (for example carbon sequestration and increasing biodiversity),  creating subsidies for the use of low-tilling practices and natural fertilizers,  shift the current tax relief for diesel costs for farmers into helping farmers transition to renewable fuels and technology  establishing promoters that connect farmers to investors,  scaling out Svensk Kolinlagring’s “carbon club” and digital platform to more farmers, investors and other&nbsp;actors,  following Norway’s example with lower tax on labor in rural areas,&nbsp;and  finding long-term investors such as Swedish pension&nbsp;funds  <p>In addition, the actors discussed the importance to make regenerative farming a prioritized area for research and innovation (e.g. Vinnova’s new innovation environment), to address the difficulty to measure and risk of scaling these practises. Research and development could help assess the outcomes of and define principles for regenerative farming that could be picked up to different degrees by different types of existing farms (e.g. organic, conservation and conventional).</p> C: Food as preventive health <p>This group looked at how food can be used for preventative health care. This includes looking at why, what, how and when one eats and its relationship to different bodies’ health defense systems. The participants discussed the potential for it to be building the resilience of the Swedish population in times of crises (such as the pandemic or times of war). Some emphasized the role of public meals and education whereas others had a larger focus on consumption at&nbsp;home.</p><p>The group looked at the change landscape and identified movements that could enable the transition towards using food as preventative health care. Grocery stores’ increased demand for locally produced food could become an opportunity to simultaneously ensure that new local products benefit our health defense systems. Sweden’s regulations already ensure products that are better for people’s wellbeing, when compared to many other countries. Similarly, the increased use of delivery services and online grocery shopping could be an opportunity to make it easy to make choices that benefit one’s&nbsp;health.</p><p>The success of the Covid-19 pandemic’s communication strategy is another opportunity. It showed how communication can shift behaviors and could lead the way for other health related campaigns; educating people about food’s impact on the body. This aligns with the government’s increased awareness of crises’ physical and mental health consequences. It has generated a larger, yet limited, interest in working more preventatively on a government level.</p><p>To navigate these changes the group shaped a strategy including three different strategic moves. It starts with an economic analysis of the adoption of healthier diets across the Swedish population; including direct costs and savings as well as the cost of missed opportunities. With this evidence as a foundation, strategic movement building could start, generating the demand for more healthy foods both commercially and politically. This could include: making food a part of every subject in school, cool role models talking about food’s impact on our health, songs about eating well, information brochures to everyone in Sweden and reporting the health impact of your grocery shopping on your receipt. This would in turn require new representation and collaboration on a government level, driving regulatory and policy changes together with actors in the food systems. This could for example include: establishing a food minister working horizontally across government and setting up policy labs where food systems actors work directly with policy&nbsp;makers.</p> D: True cost of&nbsp;food <p>This group reflected on how to price food according to its true cost, hence its impact on human and planetary health. Food systems activities such as production, distribution, consumption etc., and its effects on environmental and human health are not included in current food prices. At the same time, we must consider the affordability of healthy foods and how to make it accessible to all. Participants discussed how our financial model supports our current systems and therefore must change in order to change food systems. Consumers are also lacking basic knowledge around the impact of food and should not be responsible for making the right choices, price indicators could help them make the right&nbsp;ones.</p><p>Participants used the change landscape to look for movements that could open up for the opportunity to change the current pricing system. As a result of several recent and current crises (Covid, Energy crisis, the war in Ukraine, Oil prices increase), food prices have increased and continue to rise. This situation has brought light to the discussion around how much food should cost for producers to be profitable and how to make healthy food affordable for all. The Covid pandemic also showed us that we can change both behavior and policy if we have to in the face of a crisis, an opportunity that we could&nbsp;use.</p><p>The group brainstormed around a strategy for how to take advantage of the lowered threshold caused by these changes and identified a set of strategic moves. To support a new pricing system in how to determine what is sustainable and healthy or not, a new accounting system is needed. This would entail creating an open database and would require gathering data for all food and evaluating it, also including its social impact. Implementing the new pricing system would require education provided to organizations and a will to engage (potentially driven by economic incentives) amongst businesses. Food deliveries could also be priced according to the impact of the ordered&nbsp;food.</p><p>To facilitate for consumers to make the right decisions and navigate amongst all labellings; communication could be standardized and products labeled that are bad instead of the ones that are good. And in order to increase the knowledge amongst consumers of tomorrow, mandatory education about food and its impact should be implemented in school education. And to help children out of food poverty, statutory school breakfast could be introduced using the same mechanisms already in place for school lunches. This could have long term effects on societal welfare and would need to involve school politicians, principals, the Swedish food agency and possibly local stores and producers.</p> Next steps <p>Moving forward the lab will sens-make the findings, focused on connections to the change landscape, overlaps between strategies, and relationships with outcomes from the previous <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/growing-seeds-of-food-system-transformation-68ace0712fc">scenario workshop</a> and interviews. This will inform the final set of strategies, which will be presented in a report in the&nbsp;fall.</p><p>This blog is co-written by <a href="https://medium.com/u/c64c3a4b2d76">My Sellberg</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/c15ae0c4a9d0">Jenny Norrby</a> at Stockholm Resilience Centre and <a href="https://medium.com/u/a73ad541056b">Linnéa Rönnquist</a> at Dark Matter Labs.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p>Data-centric security is an alternative approach towards information protection that has emerged as a direct response to the increasingly obvious failure of traditional measures focusing on protecting IT infrastructures. Deceptively simple in theory, it promises to drastically improve security and compliance when dealing with sensitive data but requires a careful strategic approach to translate into a practical architecture. This whitepaper explains how the layered security approach combined with unified visibility and analytics help make data-centric security a reality.

				 <p>We use language to communicate with each other, express our thoughts and feelings, and interact in the world. But as we all know, words can be powerful, and the power of words can often have unintended consequences. The words we choose are important because they can affect how others see us and how we see ourselves. In a sense, the words we use create our reality.</p>
<p>They can make or break deals, inspire employees, and attract new customers in the business world. When used correctly, words can be a powerful tool for growth, and the wrong words can lead to misunderstandings, lost opportunities, and even legal troubles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power of words matters whether you’re working with a high-performance team and coming across a new customer or a new group inside your company or trying to improve how things are running to get that high-performance state. In this video, I’ll give some reasons for this and a real-world example of a high-stakes situation where two distinct differences between a single phrase had a critical outcome. Some things are interchangeable, but those casual words we use to define our business and our customer’s business become critically important.</p>
<p>Words are still free, so take advantage of them as much as possible, and don’t take this lightly. No one else has more control than you. The prize goes out to those who set their language apart from everyone else within their industry.</p>
<p>Our words create our reality. Choose wisely.</p>

A tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Write-Proposal">here</a>.</p><p>Proposals will then be published on Ocean <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-16/76">Port</a>. Port is also where voters can read proposal details.and ask questions.</p><p>All proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO voters receive funding, shortly after voting concludes.</p><p>Project Standing</p><p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing, to stay eligible in future Funding Rounds.

New&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN&nbsp;token.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects.

This drastically increases probability for receiving a grant, on top of Quadratic Funding. (You can reduce your Deliverables commenting in Port, if you only receive a minor part of your overall requested budget.</p><p>Voting Boosts: Quadratic Voting helps distribute voting power better. The more projects you vote on, the higher your overall voting power becomes. In addition, you can now visit the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">Web3 Portal</a>, register yourself with BrightID and receive a 400% voting&nbsp;boost.</p><p>Voter Delegation: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/delegate">Voter Delegation</a> allows participants to delegate their decision making to ecosystem members they trust, easily assigning their voting power to other addresses. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-voting-improvements-qv-delegation-multi-chain-c393afc7f5e6">More info&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>Funds recycling: Any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned.

<p>Genting International Convention Centre, Kuala Lumpur / 24th &amp; 25th June 2022 — we were honoured to be part of the Malaysia International Blockchain Get Connected Conference organized by BNB Chain last&nbsp;week.</p><p>Sponsored primarily by Indonesian company Sangkara Misa, the event featured over 12 distinguished speakers from various facets of the blockchain and crypto space, ranging from defi apps to crypto exchanges to blockchain platforms.</p><p>Both CEO of Xarcade, Otto Von Nostitz, and our founder, Lon Wong, were amongst the invited speakers during this event. Otto took to the stage in the morning to introduce Xarcade, a unique video game tokenization and distribution platform which allows for seamless blockchaining of games. Otto also touched on the future of Xarcade, a metaverse called&nbsp;MetaXar.</p>Otto presenting Xarcade<p>Lon’s talk was more technical, where he covered the topic of crosschain swaps and its security. Lon explained how crosschain transactions in ProximaX are conducted differently from what is practised by the industry at large. In ProximaX, crosschain swaps are bridged directly between parties without the use of any smart contract. The benefit of this methodology is that the security of the crosschain transaction no longer depends on the quality or programming of the smart contract, albeit it is more centralized. It was ironic that a mere few hours before Lon’s talk and unbeknownst to him (and many in the audience), hackers had stolen $100million from Harmony’s smart contract dependent bridge, Horizon. As Lon said in his presentation, the security of a crosschain transaction is “only as good as its smart contract”.</p>Lon explaining how the ProximaX swap service&nbsp;works<p>One of the highlights of the BNB Chain Get Connected Conference was the talk by Indonesia’s Deputy Minister of Trade, Dr. Jerry Sambuaga, who charmed the audience with his enthusiasm and knowledge about the crypto industry. He encouraged Indonesian crypto players to continuously innovate and educate the public so that crypto could be used as a bona fide investment instrument. He emphasized that Indonesia has a huge potential as a market given its demography that supports the development and progress of the crypto industry. “We cannot hold progress in technology, but we can choose what is good and what is not by providing sufficient education and clear protection for all industry stakeholders,” Dr. Jerry Sambuaga.</p><p>This conference also gave the audience and speakers from both Malaysia and Indonesia to network and get to know one another with the hope of fostering closer cooperation between industry players from both countries. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the BNB Chain for organizing this lively conference and look forward to attending and contributing to future&nbsp;events!</p>

 In this guide, we will give you step-by-step instructions on how to stake, unstake and claim&nbsp;rewards. <p>With Shyft Network’s Staking Dashboard launching tomorrow, you can stake SHFT tokens, unstake them, and also claim your rewards. In this guide, we will show you how to do all three with step-by-step instructions. Let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it:</p> 1. How to Stake SHFT&nbsp;Tokens? <p>The first thing you need to do is choose “Shyft Mainnet” through the wallet&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Step-1: Visit Shyft Network’s staking dashboard first (http://dashboard.shyft.network/) and click on the “Connect Wallet” button. Don’t forget to agree to the terms &amp; conditions before&nbsp;that.</p><p>Step-2: Now, you must connect your wallet with the DApp. Currently, Shyft supports two wallets: Metamask &amp; Walletconnect, and you can select any of the two&nbsp;options.</p><p>For this guide, we will use Metamask. So, after clicking on the Metamask wallet option, you will see a Metamask login page, where you must enter the password and click on the login button. After this, you will be logged into the “Overview” page of Shyft Dashboard.</p><p>Metamask Login&nbsp;Prompt:</p><p>Overview Page:</p><p>Step-3: Now, click on the “SHFT Stake” option shown just below the “Overview” button on the left side of the screen to access the Shyft Staking interface. Make sure to select “Shyft Mainnet” on your Metamask wallet. Check out this step-by-step instruction on switching to “Shyft Mainnet” on Metamask.”</p><p>Once you are on the staking interface, you will see data on “Total Pool Volume,” “Pool Rate,” and “Your Liquidity Deposits.”</p><p>Step-4: Click on the purple “Stake” button to begin the staking process. After this, you will see a pop up screen where you can enter the amount of SHFT tokens you want to stake or click on the “Max” button to stake all the SHFT tokens in your account. Then, click on the “Deposit” button.</p><p>Now, you will see a Metamask notification showing you the amount of SHFT tokens you are staking and the gas fee you will be paying for the transaction. Verify the transaction details and click on the blue “Confirm” button to go ahead with the transaction.</p><p>After confirming the transaction, a pop up message will appear at the bottom right side of the screen showing the amount you have staked. It will take a couple of seconds to approve the transaction.</p><p>As soon as the transaction goes through, the “Total Pool Volume” will go up, and that’s it! You have successfully staked your SHFT&nbsp;tokens.</p> 2. How to Unstake your SHFT tokens from Shyft Network’s Staking Dashboard? <p>Step-1: First, click on the unstake option. After this, you will see the current stats on “Your Liquidity Deposits” and “Unbonded Request.”</p><p>Unstaking your SHFT tokens will basically involve a two-step process: unbonding &amp; unstaking.</p><p>First, click on the “Unbonding’’ button. After you do so, you will see a popup notification where you must fill in the percentage of SHFT tokens you want to&nbsp;unbond.</p><p>Then, enter the percentage of SHFT tokens you want to unbond and click on the “Confirm” button.</p><p>After this, you will see a Metamask confirmation, showing the type of transaction (Unbond in this case), the number of SHFT tokens involved, and the gas fee you will have to pay. Click on the “confirm” button to proceed&nbsp;further.</p><p>The unbonding process will be completed in a few minutes on the test net, but on the mainnet, the unbonding process will take 28 days at&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Step-2: Next, click on the “Unstake” button shown next to the amount of SHFT tokens you unbonded. After this, you will see a Metamask notification showing the type of transaction, the amount of SHFT tokens involved in the transaction, and the associated gas fee. Click on the “Confirm” button to go ahead with the transaction.</p><p>That’s it! The unstaking process will be completed within a couple of seconds, and the unstaked SHFT tokens will be deposited into your&nbsp;account.</p> 3. How to Claim&nbsp;Rewards? <p>Step-1: Click on the “Rewards” section shown on the right side of the “Unstake” option. Here, you will see the amount of SHFT tokens you can claim as&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Step-2: Click on the “Claim all” button to claim your rewards. Then, you will see a Metamask notification, which you must confirm to proceed with the transaction.</p><p>After successfully claiming your rewards, the unclaimed SHFT rewards tracker will turn to&nbsp;zero.</p><p>That’s it! With these instructions, you should be able to use the Shyft Network Staking UI prepared by the Shyft DAO. We hope you find it&nbsp;useful.</p><p>Remember to follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShyftNetwork">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a> to stay up-to-date on all updates and community engagement opportunities.</p>

<p>SIM binding is growing in popularity due to the ease of use and the greater amount of security provided compared to PIN code verification.</p>
<p>What is SIM binding? SIM binding is a type of device binding where an individual uses their mobile phone and binds that phone to their SIM card. This provides for greater security in user authentication.</p>
 What Is Device Binding and How Does It Work? 
<p>Device binding is a security practice where a security token, used as proof of identity, is linked to a device trusted by the user and a service provider. Typically, devices, in this case, mean any device with a way to store digital information, which includes the following objects:</p>
 
 Smartphones 
 Tablets 
 Smart Watches 
 SIM Cards 
 Laptops 
 RF Transmitters 
 EMV Chip Cards 
 
<p>An authentication token is a key that shows a security service that a device is trusted. Tokens may produce a one-time password validated by the authentication server or utilize some other form of identification like a hardware identification number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These tokens generally fall into one of two categories:</p>
 
 Hardware Tokens: These devices use a small, physical system to serve as the token and produce the OTP. These usually come in a USB key, a smart card, or a wireless device used in high-security enterprise contexts.&nbsp; 
 Software Tokens: These tokens are installed on devices as an application or even inside another application like a web browser. Common forms of software tokens are <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/identity-authentication/">identity authentication</a> apps released by companies like Microsoft or Google that generate timed OTPs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>SIM binding is a form of hardware token security. A device, usually equipped with a dedicated application linked to an <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-solution/">identity solution</a>, will provide that app to detect the presence of SIM cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SIM card is registered with the employer and their authentication provider and, if necessary, linked with additional authentication measures. The application then validates that user and device and uses the token to authenticate it whenever it attempts to access systems and resources.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Benefits of SIM Binding? 
<p>With cloud technologies, remote workers, and distributed systems becoming the rule rather than the exception, proper security is necessary. Hardware tokens provide several advantages to help administrators implement that security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of hardware tokens and binding include the following:</p>
 
 Heightened Multi-Factor Authentication: Hardware tokens can serve as a secondary form of authentication that supplements technologies like passwords, SMS verification, or biometrics.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Furthermore, it intrinsically links SIM authentication with the typical biometric options available on modern smartphones, particularly fingerprint and facial scanning.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Self-Service and Simplified Onboarding: Administrators can automate access provisioning for old employees and new ones without requiring those employees to undergo complicated onboarding that involves several steps and personnel.&nbsp; 
 Continuous Authentication: In industries like finance and banking, administrators can ease the use of continuous authentication against risk-based identity management through device binding that can provide regular data streams of customer behavior to prevent fraud.&nbsp; 
 Passwordless Authentication: With SIM binding and mobile authentication, most organizations can remove the need for passwords at all. Passwords are often the weakest point in terms of security, and your organization can bypass them altogether.&nbsp; 
 Fraud Reduction: Binding can reduce fraud by requiring a physical device for authentication. Coupled with additional measures like identity proofing, an organization can avoid many fraud attempts that rely on gaps in identification and remote access.&nbsp; 
 Technology Agnostic: Outside of having a SIM-connected device (which nearly every person has), the binding token can streamline authentication across several platforms, services, or user portals—all from the same device.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These improvements are possible because binding is a localized, physical form of authentication, superior to passwords. Furthermore, this kind of authentication can mitigate hackers taking control of accounts to gain access to private information—the hacker would still need the device in hand to authenticate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To speak to these advantages, the Reserve Bank of India published their “Master Direction on Digital Payment Security.” They noted that existing token-based authentication (namely through SMS) was not, in and of itself, enough of a security measure to guarantee identity in a financial transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, they mandated that any payment transactions in that jurisdiction must use an additional authentication method (for banks. The method must be “dynamic or non-replicable,” including device and SIM binding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this kind of guidance, the signal to the broader financial industry is that device-based authentication will become the norm, rather than the exception, in the world of online banking and finances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Human imagination is like a box with a wide range of ideas: every person could imagine different things, but as a society it is common to picture outstanding scenarios where the species would achieve amazing progress. For instance, some movies like X-Machina or Bicentennial Man envisioned a future where relationships between robots and people are possible, and implanted the idea of machines having consciousness and feelings towards others. We probably looked at these films as impossible scenarios, but what happens when reality overlaps with fiction?</p>
<p>A few days ago, many people around the world started talking about LaMDA, a Language Model for Dialogue Application created by Google in 2017, system that recently gained relevance because it is claimed to be sentient by one of the researchers of the technological company. Considering the digitalization progress, it is not that hard to believe that the machines could develop unexpected capabilities, but before judging or commenting, it is important to understand how artificial intelligence work.</p>
 The Evolution of AI 
<p>Artificial intelligence is software that mimics human responses under certain conditions, and according to Alan Turing, “the possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this” (Turing, <a href="https://www.vordenker.de/downloads/turing-vorlesung.pdf">Lecture to the London Mathematical Society</a>, 20 February 1947). While Turing’s definition is one of many for artificial intelligence, it emphasizes its sometimes unbelievable capabilities to learn as humans do so that it can address problems it has never faced before. AI as Turning imagined it is not yet here, but its precursors are and can be applied to different fields: from decision-making in a self-driving car to answers provided by a chatbot. Specialists have improved algorithms and, undeniably, neuronal networks have changed the rules.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the first discussions and discoveries of artificial intelligence were in the 40s when engineers discovered an algorithm to decipher hidden messages during the war. If we compare that with the current decade where big data has undoubtedly gained relevance, we can say that artificial intelligence took great advantage of the massive amount of data available and the capabilities of the computers, which allow the machines to respond logically and, in some cases, faster than humans (e.g., in a chess game)</p>
<p>Nowadays, the software can understand different words and their meaning together in a sentence, learn from previous answers to develop a conversation, and reply according to the receptor’s assumed preferences in a very smooth way. Regardless of how amazed we are of this capabilities, the greatest limitation machines have is that they cannot transfer their “knowledge” on one topic to another similar or related one. For instance, if a human knows how to play chess, then the person would be able to play checkers in a few hours, but if a machine is trained to play chess, this is the only game it will be capable to play, and if we want the machine to play checkers, we need to train the software for that.</p>
<p>Taking into account the model’s mimic of the human brain and coming back to the main point, is it possible for a machine to feel like a human? The answer is no. Feelings are associated with emotions that occur within the body, while the machines can sense the world and agents around them, and by doing so they can respond to the circumstances. To make it clearer, software or robots can express sadness or happiness, but they do not feel it in the way that we know and do. LaMDA is a language built using artificial intelligence, and it is capable of developing answers according to what it learned. Undoubtedly it is an amazing creation, and it is bringing us closer to the superintelligence that scientists are looking for, but it is still a software created by humans whose functionality is learning from the experience and improving on its own.</p>
 What do we know about LaMDA? 
<p>To sum up, LaMDA is capable of connecting millions of sentences, giving them a meaning, and talking about many topics. Artificial intelligence needs humans as humans need computers. The two complement one another, but the existence of this new kind of intelligence would not be possible if the human does not indicate to the algorithm what to do and how to work. Although there is outstanding progress in this industry, we still have to keep the expectations of machines to have emotions on hold and leave this topic for the science fiction movies. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A seismic shift is under way in the huge, ongoing international project called ‘digital identity’. It hasn’t triggered any spectacular earthquakes yet. It’s more tectonic than that. But it’s seismic nevertheless.</p><p>Ten years ago, we (Mydex CIC) were one of five companies (along with the likes of the Post Office and the credit reference agency Experian) chosen by the UK Government to pioneer its Verify digital identity programme. At the time the Government had a vision for identity which went something like&nbsp;this.</p><p>An ‘identity’ — that confirms that a person is who they claim to be — would be a sort of digital product produced by specialist producers called ‘identity service providers’ (ISPs). They would compete in a market for digital identities made up of competing ISPs. Organisations would buy these identities from the ISPs to help them reduce the costs and risks they incur in checking to see if individuals are who they say they&nbsp;are.</p><p>None of this vision is likely to survive as it gets replaced by a different, more efficient and more person-centric perspective.</p><p>The first shift towards this new perspective happened a few years ago when the Government decided to launch its Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. Adding the word ‘attributes’ isn’t just a small semantic change. It signifies something very important (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>The second shift, confirmed by the publication of the Government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version">Beta version</a> of this Trust Framework, is the explicit recognition that ‘identities’, attributes, or both, may be shared by a range of different parties including citizens using personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>The Trust Framework paper gives the example of Carmen, a doctor moving to work at a new hospital. Before starting work at the hospital, she must prove who she is and that she has the relevant qualifications. She gets a digital version of her registration certificate that confirms her licence to be a doctor in the UK. It is added to her personal data store. The information from this registration certificate can be checked against an authoritative source. She can share it when needed e.g. when applying for a post at her new hospital.</p><p>Says <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version">the&nbsp;Paper</a>:</p><blockquote>“Attributes can be created, collected and checked by an attribute service provider. An attribute service provider could be an organisation or a piece of software, like a personal data store or digital&nbsp;wallet.”</blockquote><p>It’s all obvious, sensible stuff. But what it points to is a new vision of identity that has got nothing to do with the one outlined by Verify above; that combines trust-building with citizen agency with the reduction of friction, effort, risk and&nbsp;cost.</p><p>Here are some of the main operational differences between the two&nbsp;visions.</p> A new vision of&nbsp;identity <p>First, an ‘identity’ is not a fixed ‘thing’. It is a byproduct of a process for the sharing of verified attributes (that is, details about an individual that have been generated or checked by a recognised, responsible body such as a bank or government department). The particular bits of information that may go towards confirming that an individual is who they say they are may vary greatly from situation to situation. It doesn’t really matter what they are, as long as the process for making them available is reliable, safe and efficient.</p><p>Second, the use cases of ‘identity’ vary widely. Most people think of identity as relating to one specific scenario such as opening a bank account when, as an individual, you have to prove to the bank that you who you say you are and not some sort of fraudster. That’s important. But it’s actually just one step in an entire sequence of operations where it is necessary to know the identity and attributes of a person in order to provide them with a&nbsp;service.</p><p>Other use cases include being recognised when you return to a service, checking eligibility for the provision of a service (such as for a loan or a benefit), configuring the details of that service so that they fit the circumstances of the individual concerned, planning the delivery of this service, and implementing its delivery.</p><p>At each stage, different bits of information may be needed. If a person is applying for a job where they will be driving a lot, they will need to present evidence of having a valid driving licence. If they are applying for a loan or benefit, the driving licence may be irrelevant but details about their financial circumstances become central. At each point, it’s the ability to access and use verified attributes that matters — and it is the bundles of these attributes that make up the individual’s identity in that&nbsp;context.</p><p>Third, this means there can never be a fixed, separate product called ‘an identity’, because the detailed bits of information in play at any one time will be changing. What really adds value is the ability to configure multiple different data points to fit the task at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Fourth, this ability to access, share and configure verified attributes requires the existence of enabling data logistics infrastructure — infrastructure that enables these processes in a safe, efficient, privacy-protecting way. This mental and operational shift from ‘product’ to enabling infrastructure is vital. It is what our recent White Paper on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-the-personal-data-economy-f63ffa93e382">Design Principles for the Personal Data Economy</a> is&nbsp;about.</p><p>Fifth, this means there is no need for a special class of producers called ‘Identity Service Providers’, because their role is being fulfilled by this infrastructure.</p><p>Sixth, it also means that identity provision will never, ever become a ‘market’ because there isn’t a ‘product’ to sell. At one time, many companies hoped to make a fortune selling identities for fabulous profits. The opposite is true. Like all infrastructure such as roads, railways, electricity and the internet, the greatest benefits accrue all round when the costs of using attribute sharing infrastructure are brought to as close to zero as possible. The economic logic driver here is ‘cost out’, not ‘margin&nbsp;plus’.</p><p>Seventh, and most important of all, ‘identity’ is not just a service to organisations. It is first and foremost inclusive: a service for citizens as the example of Carmen shows. It is about empowering citizens with agency; with the information they need to make their way efficiently and effectively within a complex world of service provision.</p><p>Finally, the citizen-empowering data logistics infrastructure that’s needed for this new realistic vision of identity is already built — by Mydex CIC. As just noted, we have just published a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-the-personal-data-economy-f63ffa93e382">White Paper</a> examining the design principles of the ecosystem it needs to work&nbsp;within.</p> Conclusion <p>For decades now, identity practitioners (Governments, big businesses, tech companies) have been chasing a vision of identity that was as real as a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. That is why they have spent decades — huge amounts of wasted time, money and effort — getting&nbsp;nowhere.</p><p>But now there is growing Governmental recognition of the need for a different approach that empowers citizens as agents able to share verified attribute about themselves. This idea lies at the heart of Digital Identity Scotland’s <a href="https://digitalgovernment.scot/digital-identity-scotland/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a>, the Korean Government’s increasingly ambitious MyData initiative, and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-governance-act-explained">EU’s Data Governance Act</a> (especially its provisions for ‘data intermediaries’).</p><p>The Government’s proposed Identity and Attributes Trust Framework doesn’t get us all the way to the coherent, alternative vision that is needed. But it has made some decisive steps in that direction. By recognising the pivotal importance of verified attributes and the potential role of personal data stores in enabling the sharing of these attributes, it is opening the door to actually solving the problem of identity. At&nbsp;last.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/getting-identity-right-at-last-8512abadcfbc">Getting Identity Right. At Last.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Firebase is an exciting cloud platform from Google available to businesses today.  Firebase connects everything from simple static websites to IoT devices to AI and machine learning platforms. The platform provides various services to facilitate these connections, like storage and authentication.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about two core Firebase products: Cloud Functions for Firebase and Firebase Hosting. Hosting is for deploying static web applications. Functions are the Firebase serverless platform.  You will create a static application using React that authenticates users via Okta’s React library. After obtaining an access token from Okta’s authorization server, you will use a Firebase function to exchange the Okta token for a Firebase token and sign in the user using Firebase’s authentication structure. You will obtain additional user information by calling the <code>userInfo</code> endpoint on your Okta authorization server and including that data in your Firebase token. Finally, you will create another function endpoint to handle a simple HTTP request that requires an authenticated user.</p>

<p>Once you’ve built your application, you will deploy it to the Firebase platform for public consumption using the Firebase CLI.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> 
   <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase Account</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> offers Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta’s intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli">Firebase CLI</a> 
 

<p>If you wish, you can follow along with the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-firebase-serverless-example">GitHub repository found here</a>.</p>

<p>Table of Contents</p>
 
   <a>Add authentication using OIDC</a> 
   <a>Create your Firebase project</a> 
   <a>Create your front end in React</a> 
   <a>Make your React application ready for Firebase</a> 
   <a>Add authenticated Firebase functions</a> 
   <a>Test your app locally using Firebase emulators</a> 
   <a>Deploy your application to Firebase</a> 
   <a>Review your React app with authenticated Firebase functions</a> 
 

 Add authentication using OIDC 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The CLI outputs the Issuer and Client ID. You’ll need those coming up.</p>

 Create your Firebase project 

<p>Next, open the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/">Firebase console</a> and click Add Project. Give your project a name, preferably <code>okta-firebase</code>. For now, you can turn off the analytics and create the project. Once that’s completed, you’ll be able to access the project dashboard.</p>

<p>First, click the Upgrade button next to the Spark option at the bottom of your screen. Change your plan to Blaze and if you wish, set a billing budget for $1 to let you know when you are incurring a charge. Blaze is pay-as-you-go, and the rates are pretty generous for hobby projects. You shouldn’t incur any charges at this time, but the budget will let you know if you do.</p>

<p>Click the settings wheel next to Project Overview and click Project settings. At the bottom of the overview page, there’s a prompt to Select a platform to get started and select web app (it will look like &lt;/&gt;). Give your app the nickname <code>okta-firebase-demo</code> and select Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app. Click Register app, and in a moment you will see some JavaScript code for setting up your Firebase app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Hold onto this information as you will need it in your app. Click through the rest of the wizard and return to your console. Again go to the Project settings section and navigate to the Service accounts tab. Click Generate new private key and let that file download. You will need this in your Firebase Function shortly.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, click the Build&gt;Authentication in the side nav and click Get Started. Pressing the Get Started button generates a Web API Key that is required for using the auth features.</p>

 Create your front end in React 

<p>Next, create your React app.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app@5 okta-firebase
cd okta-firebase
</code>   

<p>The npx command will scaffold a new React version 18 application for you.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to install a few dependencies to help you.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-react@6.4.3
npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@6.2.0
npm i react-router-dom@5.3.0
npm i bootstrap@5.1.3
npm i firebase@9.8.1
</code>   

<p>First, you want to install the <code>@okta/okta-react</code> package to assist in authenticating users and obtaining the tokens from the Okta authorization server. This package will help you access the authentication state, direct users to the Okta login page, and handle any callbacks.</p>

<p><code>@okta/okta-react</code> relies on the <code>@okta/okta-auth-js</code> package, so you need to install it.</p>

<p>Next, you want to install <code>react-router-dom</code>. This package will set up the callback route for you and any other routes you may need.</p>

<p>Finally, you will use the <code>firebase</code> package to call the various platform features in Firebase, such as functions and authentication.</p>

<p>Add a file called <code>.env</code> in your root directory and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=/oauth2/default
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientID}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APIKEY={yourFirebaseAPIKey}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN={yourFirebaseAuthDomain}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECTID={yourFirebaseProjectID}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGEBUCKET={yourFirebaseStorageBucket}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGINGSENDERID={yourFirebaseMessagingSenderID}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APPID={yourFirebaseAppID}
REACT_APP_ENV=production
</code>   

<p>You obtained the Okta values when you created your application using the Okta CLI earlier. Your Okta domain is part of the Issuer. The Firebase values came from the configuration you copied when you first created your application.</p>

<p>There is currently a known error in React 18 with the Okta React library where multiple rerenders can lead to an error message in the <code>oktaAuth</code> object. Work on fixing this error is ongoing. In the meantime, you can work around it by taking React out of <code>strict</code> mode. Replace the code in your <code>index.js</code> file with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
    &lt;App /&gt;
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();

</code>   

<p>Next, open your <code>App.js</code> file and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>import "./App.css";

import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import AppWithRouterAccess from "./AppWithRouterAccess";
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';


function App() {

  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;      
      &lt;AppWithRouterAccess /&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>You are replacing the default code with a <code>Router</code> and an <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code> that you will write next. Open a new file called <code>AppWithRouterAccess.jsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import "./App.css";

import { Route, useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { Security, LoginCallback } from "@okta/okta-react";

import Home from "./Home";

const {
  REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
  REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID
} = process.env;

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
  clientId: REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID,
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + "/login/callback",
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
});

function AppWithRouterAccess() {
  const history = useHistory();

  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
    history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin));
  };

  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/" component={Home} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
}

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

<p>This file will define your routes and establish the <code>/login/callback</code> route for Okta to handle signing in your users.</p>

<p>Finally, add the <code>Home.jsx</code> file to your application with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from "react";

</code>   

<p>This page will handle both the authenticated and unauthenticated states. If the user is not authenticated, they are presented with a screen requesting them to do so. If the user is authenticated, they can <code>getGrades</code> by selecting a semester from the drop-down and calling the server.</p>

<p>The <code>getGrades</code> function ensures the user is authenticated using the build-in authentication function in Firebase. Firebase also integrates with authentication tokens from providers such as Okta. To utilize this functionality, you will mint a Firebase authentication token using an Okta authentication token. Okta returns an <code>accessToken</code> to the client when the user logs in. The client then passes the <code>accessToken</code> to a Firebase function called <code>exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken</code>. In this Cloud Function for Firebase, you verify the token and return a Firebase token to log the user in. Then subsequent calls to the functions will treat that user as logged in to Firebase.</p>

<p>At this point, you can use the <code>npm run start</code> command to run your app locally. You’ll see a few console errors from Firebase, and you’ll see Login buttons. Notice that you’re able to authenticate with Okta now, but the login process doesn’t call Firebase yet, so your login is still incomplete.</p>

 Make your React application ready for Firebase 

<p>Now you are ready to prepare your application for Firebase. If you haven’t done so yet, please install the Firebase CLI.</p>

   <code>npm install -g firebase-tools@11.1.0
</code>   

<p>To log in with your Google account, you may need to run <code>firebase login</code>.</p>

<p>Next, run the command <code>firebase init</code> to start the initialization of your project.</p>

<p>Select both of the following features:</p>
 
   Functions: Configure a Cloud Functions directory and its files 
   Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys 
 

<p>Select Use an existing project and select your <code>okta-firebase-{ID}</code> project</p>

<p>After a moment, you’ll see prompts to set up Firebase functions. Select the following options:</p>
 
   Language - Javascript 
   EsLint - No (You should use this in production-ready applications.) 
   When prompted to install dependencies say Yes 
 

<p>Next, select the following options to set up hosting.</p>
 
   What do you want to use as your public directory? - build 
   Configure as a single-page app?  yes 
   Setup automatic builds?  no 
 

<p>Before deploying your application, you must run the <code>build</code> command on your React app to prepare it properly. By configuring your app as a SPA, you tell the Firebase CLI to edit the configuration to redirect to <code>/index.html</code>.</p>

 Add authenticated Firebase functions 

<p>You should notice that a new folder called <code>functions</code> has been added to your directory. There, you will see some Firebase config stuff and a file called <code>index.js</code>. You’re going to add the code for two functions.</p>

<p>First, you will need one that accepts an Okta token and returns a Firebase token for the client to use. To verify the token, you will use the <code>@okta/jwt-verifier</code> package from Okta.</p>

<p>The second function will accept arguments from the client, namely the semester, and use that along with some information from the token to build report card data for the client to use to create the report card.</p>

<p>Start by navigating to your functions directory and installing your dependencies.</p>

   <code>cd functions
npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@2.3.0
</code>   

<p>The <code>@okta/jwt-verifier</code> will verify your JWT from Okta when calling the <code>exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken</code> function.</p>

<p>Next, copy the keys file you downloaded from the Firebase console earlier and add it to your <code>functions</code> folder. Make a note of the name, as you will need that shortly.</p>

<p>Add a file to your <code>functions</code> folder called <code>grades.js</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>const getGrades = (user, semester) =&gt; {
  return {
    name: user.name,
    school: getFakeUniversityName(user.email),
    semester: semester.name,
    year: semester.year,
    grades: grades
      .filter((r) =&gt; r.year == semester.year)
      .filter((r) =&gt; r.semester == semester.name),
  };
};

const getFakeUniversityName = (email) =&gt; {
  const number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);
  const domain = parseDomain(email);

  switch (number) {
    case 0:
      return "University of " + domain;
    case 1:
      return domain + " State University";
    default:
      return "University of " + domain;
  }
};

const parseDomain = (email) =&gt; {
  const emailParts = email.split("@");
  const domainParts = emailParts[1].split(".");

  let name = "";

  domainParts.forEach((part, i) =&gt; {
    if (i &gt; 0) {
      name += " ";
    }
    if (i + 1 &lt; domainParts.length) {
      name += part.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + part.slice(1);
    }
  });

  return name;
};

</code>   

<p>First, <code>exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken</code> will provide a custom token from Firebase to use in your application. Firebase allows you complete control over your authentication via the <code>signInWithCustomToken</code> method you used on the client. You need to create a custom token using your service account. You downloaded your service account definition as a JSON file earlier. Now you can call <code>createCustomToken</code> from your <code>auth</code> object against your service account. This function requires a <code>uid</code> and optionally accepts other claims you may wish to add.  Be mindful that <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-tokens#reserved_custom_token_names">Firebase reserves token names</a>.</p>

<p>You can then obtain a token from the Okta authorization server and present it to the Firebase function to be verified using the <code>OktaJwtVerifier</code>. If the Okta token is valid, you will call your Okta authorization server’s <code>userInfo</code> endpoint to obtain additional information about your user. You can include this information in your Firebase token as its custom claims. Then you can use the <code>firebaseApp</code> object to create your token with those claims. You’ll return this token to the client and sign in with it.</p>

<p>Next, you have the <code>getGrades</code> function. You check <code>context.auth</code> to see if the user is logged in. If they aren’t, you are throwing an error. If they are, allow the user to access the grades data in that file.</p>

<p>There are two different ways to set up functions in Firebase, <code>onCall</code> and <code>onRequest</code>. <code>onRequest</code> gives you a more raw form of handling the incoming call. You’d need to set up your CORS code, your authentication, and all the good stuff that the <code>onCall</code> wrapper takes care of for you. For example, <code>context.auth</code> is provided because you used the <code>onCall</code>, whereas through <code>onRequest</code> you would need to obtain this information manually.</p>

 Test your app locally using Firebase emulators 

<p>Now you are ready to test your application locally through the Firebase emulator. The emulator will make it so that your services can communicate as though they were deployed to Firebase.</p>

<p>First, edit your <code>.env</code> file to replace <code>REACT_APP_ENV=production</code> with <code>REACT_APP_ENV=development</code>. This change tells the application to connect to the emulator. Next, run the following commands in your project’s root directory.</p>

   <code>npm run build
firebase emulators:start
</code>   

<p>First, you need to build your application since Firebase expects your application to be in the <code>build</code> directory as you configured earlier. Next, it will create an emulator and deploy your function and web application to that emulator. By default, the web app deploys to <code>localhost:5000</code> rather than the usual <code>localhost:3000</code>.</p>

<p>If you find that you have conflicts with the default ports that Firebase uses, you can update the <code>firebase.json</code> file entries for <code>emulators.functions.port</code> and <code>emulators.hosting.port</code> to ports that you have available. See below for an example <code>firebase.json</code> file that uses port 5002 for hosting and 5001 for functions.</p>

 <code>{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  },
  "functions": {
    "source": "functions"
  },
  "emulators": {
    "functions": {
      "port": 5001
    },
    "hosting": {
      "port": 5002
    },
    "ui": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
</code> 

<p>You’ll need to open the Okta admin console and navigate to your Okta application to add these ports to the allowlist.</p>

<p>Open <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Portal</a> and Sign in to Okta. Then press Admin to launch the admin console.</p>

<p>Navigate to Applications &gt; Applications and find your Okta application for this project. Select it to edit. On the General tab, Edit the General Settings with the new ports. For example, if your Firebase hosting port is 5000, add <code>http://localhost:5000/login/callback</code> to Sign-in redirect URIs and <code>http://localhost:5000</code> to your Sign-out redirect URIs. Update the port number based on your Firebase emulator settings and save.</p>

<p>There’s one more place to add the new port in the Okta admin console. You’ll add the port as a Trusted Origin so your app can complete the logout process. Navigate to Security &gt; API and open the Trusted Origins tab. Press the + Add Origin button and add the new URL with the port, such as <code>http://localhost:5000/</code>. Select the Redirect and CORS checkboxes and save, then return to your application.</p>

<p>At this point, you should be able to log in to Okta, exchange your token for a Firebase token, select a semester, and click Get Grades to see your report card generate.</p>

<p></p>

 Deploy your application to Firebase 

<p>Once this works, you are ready to deploy your application to Firebase. First, set your <code>.env</code> entry for <code>REACT_APP_ENV</code> back to <code>production</code> if you had set it to <code>development</code>. You may need to run the <code>npm run build</code> command once more in case you’ve made any edits or changes. Once complete, run the command <code>firebase deploy</code> from your root directory.</p>

<p>After completing this step, your CLI will provide a URL to your application. You should see your application running on Firebase if you click that. But, Okta won’t work at this point. You need to go back to your Okta admin portal, under your application, and add <code>{yourFirebaseDomain}/login/callback</code> to your Sign-in redirect URIs, <code>{yourFirebaseDomain}</code> to your Sign-out redirect URIs to the General Settings tab of your Okta application, and add {yourFirebaseDomain} as a Trusted Origin</p>

<p>Now return to your application in Firebase and click Sign In to ensure Okta is hooked up correctly. Once you are signed in, you should be able to select a semester and click Get Grades to see your report card generated.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We learn who we are in practice, not in theory.”</p><br>David Epstein, Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</blockquote>



<p>I love when different spaces come together. There are so many opportunities to challenge assumptions, learn from each other, and find common ground. And if you happen to be sitting right in the middle at the time, suddenly you have the opportunity to unify and bridge seemingly unbridgeable gaps.</p>



<p>It’s been a busy month for decentralized identity. Led by Vitalik Buterin, the Web3 community joined the party with a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">proposal on Soulbound Tokens</a> (SBTs), culminating in an excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbyVyVNsyys">debate</a> on Bankless between Vitalik and Evin McMullen from <a href="https://disco.xyz/">disco.xyz</a>, about the risks and rewards of the “public by default” identity tokens over the “private by default” Verifiable Credential (VC) standard recommended by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/">TBD</a> and Jack Dorsey published their equally tongue-in-cheekily-named <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/">Web5 proposal</a>, essentially coming down firmly in the VC camp, stating that nothing should be put on chain, and if it should, then it should be on bitcoin (because who needs smart contracts anyway)?</p>



<p>We at Civic find ourselves sitting in the middle of a debate that we are extremely familiar with. We’ve been negotiating this dichotomy since our inception. In 2017 we published <a href="https://vinnylingham.com/civic-enabling-the-future-of-privacy-digital-security-with-chainauth-b79d61904d4c">Chainauth</a>, a mechanism for anchoring verifiable credentials on Bitcoin, and in 2021 we released <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/">Civic Pass</a>, a multi-chain token protocol, in conjunction with <a href="https://identity.com/">identity.com</a>.</p>



<p>I, for one, feel like a Berlin resident in 1990 tapping away at the Berlin Wall as others on each side pick up pick-axes around me, suddenly realising that a wall that shouldn’t exist anyway can, in fact, be toppled.</p>



<p>Why, if we had Chainauth, based on verifiable credentials, did we release Civic Pass, a token protocol very similar to SBTs? Why do we, at Civic, think that, all in all, SBTs are a good thing? After all, we share the privacy concerns of SBTs that were eloquently enumerated by Evin McMullen. Alongside the benefits of shared state for revocability and “negative reputation” listed by Vitalik, the main driver for us is flexible and uncomplicated integration into smart contracts, be they <a href="http://dex.solrise.com/">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://realms.today/">DAOs</a>,<a href="https://docs.civic.com/integrations/adding-captcha-to-candy-machine-v2"> NFT mints</a>, or others. Essentially we believe that there is benefit for an individual in circumspectly registering aspects of their identity on-chain.</p>



<p>There are right ways and wrong ways to achieve this (and watch this space for an upcoming post about the four pillars of identity-based tokens), but what Civic is doing is building the bridge between SBTs and VCs. Civic strongly believes that the future of decentralized, reusable identity is verifiable credentials. We issue VCs behind the scenes. We have an identity wallet that allows users to store and present those credentials, and we are building a web portal to replace it (keep an eye on <a href="http://civic.me/">civic.me</a>). However, smart contracts never see them, because we allow users to “tokenize” them on whatever chain they are using. In this way, an SBT is really more of a decentralized access-control layer, which is why we decided to call it Civic Pass. Combining these two concepts, off-chain verifiable credentials and on-chain passes, is immensely powerful, allowing seamless integration with on-chain projects, an identity that is portable across multiple chains, while still allowing users to provide their credentials off-chain to organizations that need them for regulatory, or other, purposes.</p>



<p>Vitalik opened the debate with Evin by stating that the two sides have more they agree with than they disagree with, and we at Civic certainly agree with that. We have been operating in both worlds for several years now, and have lived the debate internally several times. Essentially it comes down to figuring out a common language, so that the Decentralized Identity world can integrate into Web3, their biggest ally to wide-scale adoption, and the Web3 world can truly kick-off with a robust, secure and self-sovereign identity model.</p>

<p>Cointelegraph: Lior Yaffe noted that a business’s decision to accept Bitcoin should not be based on short-term price fluctuations. Even with all the volatility, there are compelling reasons for SMEs to accept Bitcoin, such as the ability to control funds directly without relying on third parties. Businesses selling goods and services over the internet having problems using the existing credit card system, organizations based in countries where the local currency is extreme, or firms who cannot work with their local banking system, all can benefit from the use of BTC. However, cybersecurity risks and expensive and difficult accounting are still tangible issues that need to be resolved.</p>

				  Indicio a Finalist in CRN Awards for social impact  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The CRN Tech Impact awards are given to IT vendors, distributors, and resellers for their social and environmental impact. This year, Indicio is a finalist in the Social Impact Project Category for its work with SITA, the world’s leading provider of IT to the air transport sector,&nbsp; on verifiable credentials for travel.</p>
<p>Indicio worked with SITA and the Aruban government to develop a decentralized identity solution for managing Covid testing and vaccination for travelers to the tourism-dependent island. The goal was to avoid the need for airlines or governments to directly integrate with health care providers, while providing travelers with a tamper-and-fraud proof, privacy-preserving way to prove their health data (and thereby comply with health data privacy requirements).</p>
<p>After successful trials, the code was donated to Linux Foundation Public Health as a privacy-preserving way for public health authorities to share health data. Known as the <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea Project</a>, the codebase continues to be developed to address other health data sharing needs.</p>
<p>As a Public Benefit Corporation, Indicio has made the advancement of decentralized identity its public benefit mission. The social impact of Cardea is enormous. There is now a complete open source decentralized ecosystem for issuing, holding, and sharing health data in a privacy-preserving way. At the same time, SITA’s application of the same digital technology promises to transform our experience of travel from check in to border control.</p>
<p>To read more about some of the work that was done you can read the original press release <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">here</a> or read the <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">Cardea white paper.</a></p>
<p>Other finalists in the social impact category are Epson UK and Clevertouch Technologies and Interactive AV Solutions.</p>

<p>The 2022 Verizon Data Breach report found that a staggering 82% of breaches this year were caused by the human element which encompasses errors, misuse, and social engineering. The report also found that 45% of breaches were caused by credential misuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your organization secures any remote access systems like Zscaler with a password, you are vulnerable to a data breach. Even if 2FA or password based MFA has been implemented, a user’s password is the first authentication factor, which can be stolen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about biometric based MFA? Device level biometrics like Touch ID and Face ID don’t actually prove the user’s identity. This is because multiple fingerprints and faces can be registered to the same phone. Furthermore, these fingerprints and faces are never matched to any valid source of proof like a government issued credential.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, it is important that remote access solutions like Zscaler are protected from data breaches. As the workforce has become increasingly remote over the last two years, the risk of data theft has been exacerbated by employees who use their personal devices and networks which have lower security standards than their corporate-controlled alternatives. This makes it easier than ever for hackers to access company data.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>BlockID hardens the security of remote access solutions like Zscaler by enabling them to prove the identity of their users. By proving the identity of users each time they log in, all of the other pillars of zero trust become easier to manage.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Prove Identity?&nbsp; 
<p>When a user downloads the BlockID app and enrolls, they will take a live selfie – This is part of our LiveID. Then, we ask the user for that selfie and compare it to their photo from government issued documents like a passport or a driver’s license. 1Kosmos matches the selfie with the documents and gives the user a digital certificate that verifies their identity and it binds the account to the proven identity. When users authenticate through LiveID we compare the live selfie with the one taken at enrollment to prove identity and grant access.</p>
<p>To summarize, proving identity and reaching Zero Trust requires one platform that</p>
 
 Establishes user-controlled identity 
 Proves authentication with that previously established identity 
 
<p>There are two standards for identity and authentication: NIST 800-63-3 for ID enrollment and strong ID usage, and FIDO2 for passwordless. No platform besides BlockID has combined both of these into one experience. When done right, this single experience can replace many legacy processes and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST 800-63-3</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/1kosmos/">FIDO</a>, BlockID’s live biometrics are <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1Kosmos-Biometric-Subsystem-Certification-Report-V2.0-1.pdf">iBeta</a> certified which validates the reliability of BlockID for accurately performing live biometrics for identity proofing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about the BlockID platform and how it can support your zero trust journey, I invite you to watch our ondemand webinar, “<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/webinars/implementing-a-sustainable-zero-trust-architecture/">Implementing a Sustainable Zero Trust Architecture.</a>”</p>

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week’s Holochain release brings a large and anticipated change, what will become the foundation for the 0.1.0 release of the HDK and the Stable Validation milestone. I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-roadmap-online/#holochain-roadmap-is-now-live">hinted at it</a> a few months ago, and now the time is finally upon us.</p> Holochain 0.0.143: Maintenance release <p>HDK compatibility: 0.0.129 to 0.0.136</p><p>This release brought more documentation updates to a couple packages, and that’s about it.</p> Holochain 0.0.144: Integrity/coordination split <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.9<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.137</p><p>This release sees a number of changes to the HDK in preparation for the next release. You’ll note that I’m now listing the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/external-links/#integritycoordination-split-begins">previously announced</a> HDI (Holochain Deterministic Integrity) crate as a separate thing — this library has only existed as part of the HDK before this release, but it becomes a separate thing from now on.</p><p>I have to admit that the title of this Dev Pulse is not exactly true. As you may know, data integrity is critical when groups of people want to coordinate their actions. If you can’t trust what your peers are saying and doing, you can’t move forward safely with them.</p><p>Also, when I say ‘coordination’ I’m not even talking about that kind of coordination. I’m talking about something more low-level and programmer-ish: one application instance coordinating the flow of its own processing and data, nothing more.</p><p>And finally, they’re not really parting ways — it’s just that the pieces of your hApp’s code that are responsible for data integrity will be split from the pieces that are responsible for application execution. They’ll exist in separate zomes in your DNA. If you’re familiar with the MVC (model, view, controller) programming pattern, you could look at it this way:</p><p>Your application’s integrity zomes comprise its model layer — everything that defines the shape of the data. In practice, this means three things: entry type definitions, link type definitions, and a validation callback that constrains the kinds of data that can validly be called entries and links of those types.</p><p>And the coordination zomes comprise its controller layer — the code that actually commits data, retrieves it, handles countersigning sessions, and sends and receives messages between peers or between a cell and its UI. In other words, all your zome functions, your `init` functions, your remote signal receivers, and your scheduler callbacks will all live in coordination zomes.</p><p>To repeat what I described a few months ago, the intention is to let you split the core integrity components of your application, which define the unalterable rules of the game, from the business logic. That way, your DHT can last a long time yet still receive upgrades and bug fixes — as long as you don’t need to change your integrity components.</p><p>And we’re making the same promise for the reduced library that your integrity components are built on — the HDI (Holochain Deterministic Integrity) crate. Once it reaches its 0.1.0 release, we plan to keep HDI stable for a while between minor releases.</p><p>You’re probably wondering how to refactor your hApp given this substantial change. Here are the most important things to know:</p><p>Your DNA manifest file is broken into <code>integrity</code> and <code>coordinator</code> sections. <code>integrity</code> holds everything that affects the DNA’s hash: the list of integrity zomes, the DNA properties, the UID, and a new <code>origin_time</code> field that indicates the earliest possible timestamp for a source chain entry, which is used to prevent time-travel attacks. Only the <code>integrity</code> section affects your DNA hash.</p><p><code>coordinator</code> holds the list of coordination zomes. Coordination zomes must explicitly list their dependencies; that is, the integrity zomes that contain definitions for the entry and link types they intend to write. (If you have only one integrity zome, however, you don’t need to list it as a dependency in any of the coordination zomes.) Here’s a complex example with multiple zomes of both kinds:</p> <code>manifest_version: "1"
name: multi integrity dna
integrity:
  uid: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  properties: ~
  origin_time: 2022-02-11T23:05:19.470323Z
  zomes:
    - name: zome1
      bundled: ../dna1/zomes/zome1.wasm
    - name: zome2
      bundled: ../dna2/zomes/zome1.wasm
coordinator:
  zomes:
    - name: zome3
      bundled: ../dna1/zomes/zome2.wasm
      dependencies:
        - name: zome1
    - name: zome4
      bundled: ../dna2/zomes/zome2.wasm
      dependencies:
        - name: zome1
        - name: zome2
</code> 
<p>As mentioned, your entry/link definitions, membrane proof self-checks, and validation callbacks will need to be moved into integrity zomes with only one core dependency on the HDI crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain_deterministic_integrity"><code>holochain_deterministic_integrity</code></a>. This crate has been around for a while, but you haven’t needed to worry about it until now because it was just part of the HDK. (It still is, but it now is meant to exist independently of the HDK.) integrity zomes should not depend on the full HDK — it’s not going to remain stable over time like HDI is. There are new macro helpers for defining entry and link types. The test suite has examples of an integrity zome with <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.144/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace/integrity_zome/src/lib.rs">entry types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.144/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace/link/src/integrity.rs">link types</a>.</p><p>All of your zome functions, init callbacks, remote signal receivers, and scheduler callbacks should go into coordination zomes. They can (and likely should) depend on the full HDK, which still includes <code>holochain_deterministic_integrity</code> as a dependency.</p><p>Only the coordination zomes can use non-deterministic host functions in the full HDK such as source chain commits and queries, DHT gets, agent activity queries, signal emitters, remote calls, and complex crypto functions. Integrity zomes can only use deterministic functions such as <code>must_get_*</code>, <code>dna_info</code>, <code>zome_info</code>, and simple crypto functions such as hashing. This makes sense, because the only functions available to your validation callback are the deterministic ones; this just becomes explicit with the separation between HDI and the rest of the HDK.</p><p>There are some changes that remove <code>zome_id</code> from the headers of entry and link creation elements. These changes are temporary and will be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1453">reverted</a> in a future release. In fact, before the 0.1.0 release of HDI there will likely be more changes, although they will mostly be hidden behind macros and other conveniences. If you want to have a say in the usability of the hApp development experience, please jump in now and tell us what you think. But if you desire stability, it’s probably best to wait until 0.1.0.</p><p>You can also look at the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.144/CHANGELOG.md#20220616084359">full changelog</a> or the integrity PR (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1325">#1325</a>) for the fine details.</p><p>There are a lot of other changes in this release, some related to the integrity/coordinator split and some not:</p>  New: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/macro.wasm_error.html"><code>wasm_error!</code></a> macro in the HDK, which captures line numbers. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1380">#1380</a>)  New: Stubs for libsodium Salsa20-Poly1305 <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/secretbox">secret box</a> encryption in the HDK. It’s not yet supported by the Lair keystore, so it will currently throw unimplemented errors. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1410">#1410</a>)  New: Updated to newest Wasmer, which allows us to implement metering. Zome calls are now limited to a generous 10 giga-operations, which should prevent infinite loops from overwhelming an agent’s machine. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1386">#1386</a>)  Breaking: When using <code>get_links</code>, the <code>link_type</code> parameter now takes <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html">more than one</a> link type at a time. And because a coordination zome can depend on more than one integrity zome, you can even specify link types from multiple integrity zomes. Any link types not defined in a coordination zome’s dependencies will be filtered out.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/p2p/fn.call.html"><code>call</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/p2p/fn.call_remote.html"><code>call_remote</code></a> can now take anything that implements the <code>Into&lt;ZomeName&gt;</code> trait.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/entry/fn.create_entry.html"><code>create_entry</code></a> takes anything that implements both the <code>TryInto&lt;<a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/struct.EntryDefIndex.html">EntryDefIndex</a>&gt;</code> and <code>TryInto&lt;<a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/enum.EntryVisibility.html">EntryVisibility</a>&gt;</code> traits rather than <code>EntryDefRegistration</code>.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/entry/fn.update.html"><code>update</code></a> now takes an <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/struct.UpdateInput.html"><code>UpdateInput</code></a> struct to make it align more closely with other host functions, and <code>UpdateInput</code> now has separate <code>entry</code> and <code>chain_top_ordering</code> params rather than wrapping a <code>CreateInput</code>.  Breaking: <code>update_entry</code> takes anything that implements <code>TryInto&lt;Entry&gt;</code> rather than <code>EntryDefRegistration</code>.  Breaking: <code>Path</code> now must be <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/hash_path/path/struct.Path.html#method.typed">typed to a specific <code>LinkType</code></a>.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.136/hdk/prelude/struct.CreateInput.html#structfield.entry_location"><code>CreateInput</code></a>, used in <code>create_entry</code>, replaces <code>entry_def_id</code> with <code>entry_location</code> which allows you to specify that the entry is either an app entry (with entry def ID) or a capability grant/claim. In practice, you don’t need to worry about this if you’re using the entry def helper macro, because it will create a type that can be converted into a <code>CreateInput</code>.  Breaking: The <code>register_entry!</code> macro has been replaced by an <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/entry/attr.hdk_entry_defs.html"><code>#[hdk_entry_defs]</code></a> helper.  Breaking: The <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/info/struct.ZomeInfo.html">struct returned by <code>zome_info</code></a> now has a <code>zome_types</code> field that lists all the global IDs of the zome’s entry and link types.  Breaking: <code>EntryDefs::entry_def_index_from_id()</code>, <code>ZomeInfo::matches_entry_def_id()</code>, <code>CreateLink::zome_id</code>, and <code>AppEntryType::zome_ID</code> have been removed because there is no way to go from a local ID to a global ID. This may change again in the future.  Breaking: <code>EntryDef::required_validation_type</code> has been removed because validation packages are not going to be implemented.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/struct.ZomeName.html"><code>ZomeName</code></a> is now a <code>Cow&lt;’static, string&gt;</code> instead of a <code>String</code>.  <p>Read the changelog for all the details.</p> Holochain 0.0.145: Source chain name change, countersigning updates <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.10<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.138<br>Lair compatibility: 0.2.0</p><p>There are three important changes in this release:</p>  Breaking: <code>Element</code> and <code>Header</code>, two structures that make up the source chain, have been renamed to <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/struct.Record.html"><code>Record</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/action/enum.Action.html"><code>Action</code></a>, along with changes to related types. We believe these language changes will make it easier for new developers to understand what these structures are about. Every source chain commit is a record of a particular type of action (publishing an agent key, creating data, deleting a link, etc), so this language aligns with that reality. <code>Entry</code> is remaining the same. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1441">#1441</a>)  Breaking: When you’re using an ‘enzyme’ in countersigning (a trusted agent who collects all the signatures, rather than waiting for signatures to get published to the DHT and broadcast to all signers), you now specify that a session <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html#structfield.enzymatic">is enzymatic</a>, and the enzyme agent will be the first countersigner by convention. Previously the enzyme's agent ID was specified explicitly and separately from the other counterparties. (Note: the API is fully fleshed out, but the network plumbing to support enzymes is not functional yet.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1394">#1394</a>)  Breaking: In a countersigning session, you can now specify a number of <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html#structfield.optional_signing_agents">optional signers</a>. You can specify how many of them <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html#structfield.minimum_optional_signing_agents">must sign</a> in order for the session to complete; that number must be equal to or greater than a majority of the optional signers. This is useful for reaching ‘micro-consensus’ over rivalrous data such as usernames, in a way that tolerates downtime among trusted authorities. Note: When using optional witnesses, the session must use an enzyme, who must be the first agent in both the list of signing agents and the list of optional signers. This allows the process to be more efficient and less ambiguous than waiting for the DHT to reach consistency.

 Identity Platform 2022.1 is released today, including SSO 9.0 and CustomerID 6.0 
<p>Across this release cycle we have covered deep technical improvements and modernisations of the Identity Platform, as well as making progress in a new key development area. For all the details, please head over to our <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20221/pages/8907554826/Identity+Server+2022.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the structural changes found in this release, OpenLDAP MDB (regarding memory and disk space), the move to Java 11 and some third-party libraries, we felt there were sufficient changes to make this release a major version update. As such, SSO is moving from 8.9 to 9.0 and CustomerID is moving from 5.9 to 6.0 during this 2022.1 release cycle.</p>
 Features 
<p>Sign in with BYOI: Within the Identity Platform we have added another ‘essential’ BYOI (bring your own identity) provider into full support – Apple. Now you can easily configure sign-in functions with Google, Microsoft, and Apple identities. They enable you to support most consumers or external users and offer an already existing, easy to use identity method to empower your digitisation. You no longer have to maintain internal identity and password management services if you do not require them. Adding in “Sign in with Apple” continues our journey towards offering you a passwordless future, where users can be allowed access based on their existing credentials and authenticated with a glance at their phone. It may take some time for the entire world to transition to this easy-to-use feature, but just like the gradual transition to electric cars, the FIDO alliance will help enable a passwordless future for everyone. For more details on the FIDO backed, passwordless future check out this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/05/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard/">Apple blog</a>.</p>
<p>Risk-Based Authentication (RBA):&nbsp;We have continued our development of risk-based authentication features over the past several months, with ongoing developments to be continued. For this release, we have added the ability to offer SMS OTP (one time password) and SMTP OTP for unregistered users. Utilising either OpenID Connect or SAML, you can now both securely integrate an external IdP, as well as require a second authentication factor (MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)) to highly assure external users from that IdP. The external user signs into your application via OpenID Connect (or SAML) and after returning to SSO will query the external IdP for the user’s phone number. From there, a six-digit OTP code is sent as an SMS to the user. When the user enters the OTP code on your application login screen, the external MFA is completed, and the user will be allowed to access your application.</p>
<p>Risk-Based Authentication is an area that we will continue to develop over the next two to three release cycles. We are excited to expand our Identity Platform into this dynamic security space and believe we will deliver many useful enhancements to the platform. Ask your Sales Team/Account Manager for more information on upcoming development plans.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>We are all aware that security is a continual process, not a one-time destination. For the Identity Platform, this process of continually ensuring our security posture is paramount. We have been investing development cycles to ensure we can respond to unforeseen security events, like Log4j v2 at the end of last year, as well as making systematic improvements to the core functioning and performance of the Identity Platform. During this release we have published several further improvements to the platform.</p>
<p>OpenLDAP MDB: We’ve updated the directory (OpenLDAP) which underlies our SSO application to OpenLDAP MDB (Memory-Mapped Database), which has proven to give a responsive and ready-to-scale datastore to our Identity Platform. We have been operating MDB for one of our cloud customers for six months now and it has proven capable of handling upwards of a million active user sessions. An updated session manager (which is also used with Redis deployments) further improves session management on the platform. Read the release notes for more details as there are environment updates needed to migrate from the existing OpenLDAP BDB to MDB.</p>
<p>Java11: We have recompiled the Identity Platform with Java 11. This fundamental improvement brings all the enhancements of Java 11, as well as the security improvements permitted by enabling updates in third-party libraries and services (like WildFly) used throughout the Identity Platform. For many of us, Java 8 has been a mainstay for a number of years. Java 11 will not be as long lived as Java 8 was – please see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html">Oracle’s page</a>&nbsp;over Java SE life cycles. We will review Java 17 vs Java 21 in late 2023, so please anticipate your environment needs as we move forward.</p>
<p>Third-party libraries: The Identity Platform follows open standards, like OIDC (OpenID Connect), and uses many third-party libraries. The standards and libraries help to ensure that the code is reviewed by a global community, with the community offering patches against security vulnerabilities and bugs. For each and every release, we continue to patch the third-party libraries used and as needed update the libraries to more modern or better functioning libraries and code bases. Within the 2022.1 release, we’ve continued this updating. As with prior releases we encourage every customer to update their environment as soon as possible, to benefit from these latest updates.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>As we head into the summer months, we are aiming to finalise another section of Risk-Based Authentication (directory mapped users will gain the ability to use TOTP as their MFA), complete the modernisation of logging libraries within the platform, and complete some updates to make premises-based installations easier. We have some exiting mid-term goals that we hope to announce at the end of summer, that will bring IDaaS into sharp view and consideration for all&nbsp; future customer projects. We expect to have a two-year roadmap laid out to discuss with all of you at the end of summer. Until then, please have a look at the 2022.1 Release Notes. Feel free to engage with us via the Operations team or your account team – we are always happy for your input to help shape our future developments.</p>

   Account creation fraud–also referred to as new account fraud (NAF) or fake accounts fraud–is the act of fraudsters creating accounts on online services with malicious intent. 
 &nbsp; 
 There are many variations in how and why fraudsters engage in this activity (and we will cover these below in detail), but the general ideas are the same:

<p>Account creation fraud–also referred to as new account fraud (NAF) or fake accounts fraud–is the act of fraudsters creating accounts on online services with malicious intent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many variations in how and why fraudsters engage in this activity (and we will cover these below in detail), but the general ideas are the same:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>A fraudster creates accounts on an online service with malicious intent using fake or stolen identity information.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A fraudster uses fake accounts to conduct fraudulent activity for the purpose of monetization (directly or indirectly).</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tactics of account creation fraud vary between different online services depending on the information required for account creation, the information verification processes, and eventually the ways that accounts can be used for illegitimate activity. Some examples of these differences between services are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Online gaming platforms: A valid email address alone is sometimes sufficient to create an account. Once created, a fake account may be used, for example, to spam other players or to gain in-game assets that can then be transferred.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Online retail and e-commerce: An email address and basic details such as gender and name are usually sufficient for account creation. A fake account may be used, for example, for credit card testing (i.e., simply verifying that account details and credit card details are valid) or as part of accounts referral chaining to collect referral bonuses.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Financial services: Account creation usually requires highly detailed account information such as an address, phone number, and social security number. A fake account may be used, for example, to access credit.</p>

<p>Small-to-midsize business (SMB) owners have had to pivot and adjust to the new realities of the economy, throughout the pandemic and beyond. Implementing new business models, investing in PPE and managing employees all come with additional costs, in a business environment that’s already rife with inflationary pressures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing these challenges takes every available resource, and owner-permissioned SMB open banking data is powering the financial management apps and services that owners are embracing to improve their business operations. According to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">Rise of Open Banking Small Business report</a>, connecting accounts is the main driver that provides the insights and analytics that owners are looking for to help tackle critical business tasks. Ninety-six percent of owners are currently linking their business financial accounts, taking advantage of fintech apps and services that leverage open banking data to generate crucial information and insights for their businesses, helping to improve decision-making. The top reasons for connecting accounts are:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Receiving payments from customers (75%) 
 Banking (73%) 
 Billing/invoicing (73%) 
 Paying bills/expenses (73%) 
 Accounting (73%) 
 Cash flow management (72%) 
 
<p>With all the benefits of linking accounts, fintech innovators have a window of opportunity in the SMB space to improve the connection process:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Reducing time for cross-platform verification 
 Making it intuitive for SMB owners to link their accounts, or communicating how to link accounts 
 Utilizing UI that auto-populates routing and accounting numbers 
 Utilizing account owner verification to mitigate fraudulent accounts 
 
<p>Even with the understandable adjustments that it takes to press forward into a new era of digital business and financial management, the desire to adopt is strong in the SMB sector. Owners want to digitize their businesses to help prevent fraud, automate processes and share data and insights across apps.&nbsp;</p>
 Linking Accounts Generates Real-Time Financial Insights 
<p>Despite rising fintech use, 94% of small business owners still encounter financial pain points. Many of them cite financial management as a major source of stress.</p>
<p>Owners are seeking solutions that can help them with financial management to address these pain points. They’re looking for better ways to harness their business’s data to get a holistic view, optimize financial management and inform business strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where SMB fintech services providers can step in and provide solutions, partnering with SMBs as they push forward into the new digital economy. Owners are open to receiving help. Sixty-three percent are looking for help with financial planning for their business, and 85% want the kind of custom financial recommendations that come from linking accounts and sharing open banking data.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The top driver for owners linking accounts is improvement in business decision-making. This comes directly from financial management apps and services. Real-time data paired with AI, machine learning and analytics can have a powerful impact on an owner’s speed of decision-making and action, allowing them to either take advantage of opportunities or avoid costly mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better data and better decisions naturally feed into the rest of the top-three SMB owners’ concerns: saving time and improving financial health.&nbsp;</p>
 How Small Businesses are Using Open Banking Fintech Apps and Services 
<p>According to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">report</a>, banking is the top use case for small businesses, once they link their accounts. Depositing checks, paying bills and transferring funds are core, everyday needs that SMB owners are currently using fintech to accomplish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Billing and invoicing can be streamlined and automated with fintech, and small businesses want this. Sixty-one percent of small businesses are already using fintech to do so. When routine tasks can be handled in the background by apps, owners can move more pressing concerns to the forefront. Growing, scaling and developing products or services can be given the bandwidth they deserve.</p>
<p>Sixty percent are using digital apps and services for cash flow management. With real-time data from linked accounts, owners can pay bills strategically, while making sure they can pay vendors, employees and themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the number of SMBs leveraging fintech apps is currently in the 50-60% range, the Rise of Open Banking study found that the number who want to use digital apps and services powered by open banking is over 90% for the majority of use cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05122043/Small-Business-FAQ-2020.pdf">31.7 million small businesses</a> in the US are looking for more choice in financial services. They’re willing and ready to adapt to the digital future, and are looking for innovators that provide solutions to help them make better decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard’s “always on” platform means maximum connection uptime and the highest quality data for insights into the financial health of a small business. Read the full report <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">here</a> to see details on the solutions small businesses are looking for from financial service technology.</p>

<p>A bipartisan group of legislators in the US House and Senate has proposed a bill that could result in a long-awaited national data privacy law. This is big news that could allow internet users to opt out of targeted advertisements and sue companies that improperly sell their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 This is the biggest breakthrough to date for a national privacy law 



<p></p>



<p>While it’s too soon to say whether the bill will pass, whether its protections will be diluted before it passes, and how rigorously the law will be enforced, this is the biggest breakthrough to date for a national data privacy law.&nbsp;The US is one of the only major global economies without&nbsp;strong&nbsp;national privacy laws&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">akin to the GDPR</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Some say this bill offers a compromise position 



<p></p>



<p>Until now, partisan disagreements and privacy actives fighting for their version of a perfect bill have hampered efforts and distracted from the benefits of passing a reasonable, decent bill. Democrats argue for a private right of action that will give consumers legal rights if government fails to enforce the federal law, while Republicans want a federal law to preempt state laws to end the patchwork of compliance obligations on business.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/03/internet-privacy-congress-compromise-proposal/">Observers</a>&nbsp;say this current bipartisan bill represents a compromise on these two big sticking points, in that it limits when and how users could sue internet companies for privacy violations and contains measures that would supersede most state data privacy laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the proposed bill:</p>



  Companies would have to restrict their data collection to only data that is necessary for their business to function.  Companies couldn’t charge users to access data privacy measures except in some limited circumstances.  The Federal Trade Commission would have to maintain a public registry of data brokers and present a way for users to opt out of targeted advertisements and other data sharing practices.  Consumers could access, correct and delete their own data and companies would have to tell third parties to change user data where users request it.  Companies would have to annually prove their compliance.  The FTC would be tasked with enforcing the law via a new purpose-built bureau for consumer data privacy.&nbsp;  Individual users could sue companies after a four-year waiting period from the date this new bill is enacted. There are some caveats on individual powers to sue.  The new federal law would supersede most state data privacy laws with some exceptions.  



<p>The proposed bill needs more members’ support and is in a race against time to be passed before the midterm elections. So while this proposed bill is generally good news, a bill is only as good as the funding and capabilities of the agencies responsible for enforcing it. And if it doesn’t pass before the midterms, what then?</p>

<p>Last month we were asked to give a talk in Korea on the design principles for a new personal data economy. We’ve turned this talk into a White Paper, <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">published here</a>.</p><p>It’s important because, in our view, most current debate about personal data is based on a philosophical category error that inevitably leads to a dead&nbsp;end.</p><p>If you want to solve a problem you need to know what’s causing it. If you’ve got a heart problem, no matter how many pills you take for gastric wind you won’t solve it. When it comes to personal data, most discussion assumes that our problems are caused by how organisations handle the data they collect and use. They are not. They are caused by the design of the system these organisations are operating within.</p><p>‘System design’? That sounds rather abstract and airy-fairy. Not for practical people. But it’s not abstract or airy-fairy at all. Birds are living systems designed to fly in the air. Fish are designed to swim in water. If you ask a fish to fly you won’t get very far because that’s not what its system is designed to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Today’s personal data system is designed to help organisations collect and use data to further their particular purposes. It is not designed to help citizens get the benefits of their data, to use data to address social ills, or even to help economy-wide innovation and growth (which may involve the creation of new and different organisations).</p><p>In fact, with the way our current system works citizens have little or no control over their own data and are not benefiting as they should from it. Service providers often lack access to the data they need and face high costs in accessing and using it. And the system as a whole experiences high costs along with low levels of trust and restricted innovation.</p><p>But these problems are not created by the behaviours of individual organisations in isolation. They are created by the way the system itself works. Its design: the fact that it is organised solely around organisations collecting and using data for their own particular purposes. We simply won’t solve the problems we now face by asking organisations to behave differently; by asking fish to fly. We can only solve them by introducing a different system&nbsp;design.</p> Fitness for&nbsp;purpose <p>We need a system for personal data that unleashes its full personal, social and economic potential; that goes beyond only helping organisations achieve their purposes. To achieve this we need to design a new system that’s fit for a broader range of purposes; that’s designed to fly rather than&nbsp;swim.</p><p>These design principles are not random, plucked from the air because we think they might be nice. It’s no accident that all fish are sleek and that birds have wings. These designs fit what they need to do. So what fit-for-purpose design principles do we need to&nbsp;adopt?</p><p>For a start, we need to build on the fact that unlike other commodities, when data gets used it doesn’t get used up. It can be used again and again, for many different purposes. We expand on this <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">theme here</a>. This being the case, it makes no sense to restrict access to data to just one organisation with one set of purposes. We need to break out of the confines of organisation-centricity, to enable data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>However, if you try to create a system where all organisations try to share data with all other organisations, you quickly create <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">a complexity catastrophe</a>. To solve this problem you need fit-for-purpose design. If data about each individual is deposited in the individual’s personal data store, then these personal data stores can act as hubs for the safe, efficient sharing of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>This is effectively a new layer of data infrastructure that transforms the design of the system. It turns multiple separate, independent, exclusive and excluding silos of data collection and use (today’s organisations) into a networked data sharing ecosystem with three core functional layers:</p>  Service providers collecting and generating personal data (acting as ‘data factories’ if you&nbsp;like)  A new exchange layer made up of personal data stores where data is stored and distributed under the individual’s control (data warehouses holding what the factories have produced)  The same and other service providers accessing and using this data to produce specific services.  <p>This means that our system’s current operating principle — that ‘the organisations that use data always store the data in question in their own systems’ — increasingly makes way for a different operational principle: the increasing separation of data storage and use, where personal data stores store individuals’ data and specialist users access this data when they need it. (Like to going to a shop when you need bread rather than baking it yourself.)</p><p>A key element of this new system design is that it is now largely citizen- or person-centric. Personal data stores a) give each individual control over the collection, sharing and use of their own data, and b) act as the natural point where all information about them is aggregated — information that was previously dispersed across hundreds of different, separate organisations collecting data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>This new structure not only empowers citizens with their own data (thereby shifting balances of power and reward within the data economy), it also creates new person-centric data assets that are impossible to create under the old structure and which are natural sources of future innovation and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The economics of all this is another question which we will return to shortly. Right now, our focus is the design principles themselves which fall into four main areas of system architecture, infrastructure, governance and economic/business model. The following tables summarise their key points. The <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">White Paper itself</a> explains their logic in further&nbsp;detail.</p> Architecture <p>Today’s data economy is organised exclusively around organisations, disperses citizens’ data across many different organisations, excludes citizens from its workings (with organisations collecting and using data about them), operates via separate data silos that act like moated castles of data control, and integrate the collection and use of data behind these castle&nbsp;walls.</p><p>The new data economy will enable citizens to collect and use their own data (as well as organisations), make individuals the point at which data about themselves is integrated, and place this new data asset directly under the citizen’s control. It will connect today’s data silos via a new ‘exchange layer’ of personal data stores that enable citizen-controlled data sharing and increasingly separates the storage of data from&nbsp;use.</p>Table 1: Architecture of the new personal data ecosystem Infrastructure <p>Today’s organisation-centric approach to personal data use creates multiple separate data silos where data is concentrated in a small number of centralised databases. Citizens’ control over their data is restricted to (often only formal) rights to consent to data collection and use. By the very way it operates it is privacy invading: organisations get to know a lot about the individuals they hold data&nbsp;on.</p><p>The new infrastructure is distributed, with multiple nodes (personal data stores) where individuals can exert real, direct control over their data. Because each personal data store is individually encrypted, with only the individual holding the key, it operates on a zero knowledge (rather than privacy invading) basis. It has a technology agnostic, cloud- based approach where PDS providers ensure key functions such as interoperability.</p>Table 2: Infrastructure of the new personal data ecosystem Governance <p>The critical governance challenge is that trustworthiness cannot be reduced to an organisation’s policy or promise: a policy that may change at any time or a promise that may be broken at any time. Commitments to ensure data security, privacy etc need to be permanent and legally enforceable, embedded in the constitutions of the institutions providing the data infrastructure. (This relates to the ‘built to last’ principle — see&nbsp;below).</p><p>In today’s data ecosystem, many organisations seek to gather and use personal data for the purposes of competitive advantage. To achieve this, they restrict who has access to the data.. For infrastructure designed to empower and include citizens and to enable data sharing of wider, improved data use, while competition between different service providers can be as intense as ever, the data infrastructure needs to be neutral: it must be designed to enable all legitimate users, without&nbsp;favour.</p>Table 3: Infrastructure governance in the new personal data ecosystem Economic logic and business&nbsp;models <p>To sustain themselves in a way that maintains and fulfils their function, personal data store providers need to be able to cover their costs. This ensures their independence from external parties who may wish to use control over the purse strings to exercise control over purposes. Because the purpose of this infrastructure is to enable others’ actions rather than to make and sell a specific ‘product’, its prime economic logic and benefit is ‘cost out’ rather than ‘added margin’. All its financial and economic incentives need to be designed to ensure this sustainability, neutrality and mission alignment.</p><p>A key part of this is continuity and longevity: a personal data store is for life, so the institutions providing personal data stores should be designed for decades (centuries, even). Whatever particular corporate form they take, legal safeguards relating to continuity and longevity of purpose need to be built into how they&nbsp;operate.</p>Table 4: Economic and business models underlying the new personal data ecosystem <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-the-personal-data-economy-f63ffa93e382">Design Principles for the Personal Data Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: In the recent years, there have been organisations across the world creating, for instance, mobile credentials, and specifically mobile driving licenses. So, we’re going to discuss about this topic, and also the privacy side of this super interesting system that has been around. So, for that, we have an expert who is joining us today. My guest today is John Wunderlich. He is an information privacy and security expert with extensive experience in information privacy, identity management, and data security.</p>
<p>He has designed, built, operated, and assessed system for operations and compliance in the private and public sectors for over 25 years. These includes working or consulting for Fortune 500 corporations, government ministries, small companies, volunteer organisations, regulators, and health system organisations of all sizes.</p>
<p>Hello, John.</p>
<p>John Wunderlich: Hi, Oscar, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. It’s a pleasure talking with you.</p>
<p>John: Likewise.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. That’s a super interesting topic we’re going to discuss today about mobile credentials, so yeah, let’s talk about digital identity. But first, of course, we want to hear something a bit more about you as a guest. So please tell us your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>John: Long story short, I used to be Corporate Systems Administrator, Network Administrator, Operations Manager, and the Federal Privacy Law in Canada was introduced, I took that as a project at my company, and it turned into a career. When I moved from the corporate side to working for a regulator, I first met Kim Cameron, a name that most of your listeners will know, working with the Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, shortly after he introduced the Seven Laws of Identity. And around the same time, my former boss introduced the idea of Privacy by Design.</p>
<p>So, for me going back 15, 16 years privacy and identity have been in lockstep. There’s a very large Venn diagram overlap between the two. And I’ve been consulting and working on standards and volunteer areas in that joint area since then.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Yes, just a few years ago, maybe almost two, a bit more than two years ago, we met in Kantara Initiative, in one of the working groups, and you are super involved there. And I know that recently, you and other authors have released one document called <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/pimdl-v1-final/">Privacy and Identity Protection in Mobile Driving License Ecosystem</a>. So first of all, kudos for that very good report.</p>
<p>John: Gracias!</p>
<p>Oscar: I read at least partly that and definitely I want to hear more about that today. So going into that specific mobile credentials, mobile driving licenses, I would like to hear, to start, a simple definition. So, what are mobile credentials?</p>
<p>John: Well, at the very highest level, a mobile credential is a bundle of attributes about an entity that sits on a mobile phone, or a mobile device. That’s at a very high level. And it then sort of branches down from there. You look at wallets or you can look at flash passes, or you can look at mobile driving licenses which have a specific ISO standard. You can talk about the W3C mobile credentials data model. You can talk about decentralised IDs, the W3C DIDs. So, it branches out into a whole grouping of things, but it ends up being bundles of attributes on a mobile phone.</p>
<p>Oscar: In practice, that replaces holding a driving license, the physical driving license.</p>
<p>John: I think in any substantive way, it doesn’t replace it yet. I mean, we’re talking about in-person presentation on the phone. In the workgroup that I lead that’s working on a recommendation report at Kantara, we’ve kind of matched the scope of ISO 18013-5, sorry for the ISO number reference, which is mobile driving licenses on the phone. It’s not the online presentation, which helps reduce the problem space significantly. But I think it is the case that most credentials like that are issued on the phone still have physical analogues.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>John: So that people have a choice of presenting, for example, in Canada, health is a provincial matter so depending on the province, you would be issued a QR code for your COVID vaccination status and you could print that out on paper, or there were apps that you could present it on the phone, so people did both. So, I think in the space of the mobile credential, mass adoption is still sort of dual track, not replacing but supplementing.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So yeah, whichever is available or convenient for the individual. And tell me, because I know it’s in some countries, you mentioned in Canada, this type of mobile credentials, more specifically, the mobile driving licenses are already being issued, not everywhere in world. Normally, who are these mobile credentials issued by and how do they work in practice?</p>
<p>John: Well, anybody can issue a credential. The analogue is weak, but I still think of a bundle of credentials, a bunch of attributes as the digital equivalent of a business card. I can print my own business card. But the level of assurance and level of authority is pretty weak on a business card, as opposed to a laminated plastic with a hologram issued by a government for a driving license or a proof of citizenship or a medical card or an in between, something that might be issued by a university or a company. So, you have different levels of assurance in the physical world, just as you do in the digital world. So, anybody can issue a credential, the question is what level of authority you give to the credential.</p>
<p>Oscar: And we can say the right now the most, the mobile credential that has the highest level of assurance are done by governments today.</p>
<p>John: Yeah, I don’t think that’s going to change. The government, possibly financial institutions, possibly health institutions, but they are institutionally issued by institutions that have the capability of doing identity verification on initial issuance to provide a very high level of assurance that this credential is associated with this entity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. Tell me a bit of the practicalities because I have never used, at least a mobile driving license, how it works in practice, when people who drive want to present the credential?</p>
<p>John: Well, let’s talk about two use cases for a mobile driving license. One is proof of authority that you’re, in fact, a licensed driver. So, you’re pulled over by the police and asked to present your driver’s license. Right now, you present a plastic laminate card, they look at it, look at the picture, may go back to their squad car, and do a check to make sure that there’s no problems with that license, that there’s no warrants. Once a warrant is issued against your name, all that good stuff. We’re presuming here that this is a legitimate traffic stop. I have a lead foot, they pull me over for going 80 in a 60, or whatever. And all of that is authorised by law. So, they get a full set of the credentials that are on the card and are able to access their backend system to get further information about me. So that’s fairly intrusive. But that’s what you would expect when you are a potential violator of the law.</p>
<p>As opposed to the more common use case for driving license, which is age verification. So, it’s long past the age where I get checked when I go into an establishment where I could buy alcohol or cannabis. But that’s the joke, driving licenses get used much more for drinking than they do for driving because people need them to buy alcohol. So right now, if I’m a just barely legal age young woman, because this is the edge case that causes real difficulties, and I’m trying to enter a club, I have to show the doorman or the bouncer at the front of the club my entire driving license. Now, what he should be doing is looking at the driving license, looking at the picture to make sure that I’m actually the person I purport to be. And then looking at the date of birth and making sure that I’m old enough in that jurisdiction to enter the club. That’s it. That’s all and no retention of information.</p>
<p>The problem, the dual edged nature of the digital driving license is this. If you do it right, you end up with all that shows up on the device that the doorman is using to verify your digital license. So, you present a QR code or there’s an NFC, you wave your phone near their receiver, the same way you do a tap to pay or a Bluetooth off in the MDL specification. All of those are allowable, the Bluetooth and the NFC are preferable. And what shows up on the doorman’s verifying device is a picture of the person whose license it is so that they can do the proof of presence. Yeah, this is indeed the person I’m presented with. And a green checkmark that says this person is old enough.</p>
<p>So, as opposed to the analogue physical driving license, he has no opportunity should he be amorously struck by the person to grab her address or follow her or grab your phone number or do any of that stuff. And the system operated by the bar also cannot record anything other than there was an age verification for a person, or they can–. On the other hand, depending on how the presentation goes, the backend system for John’s Bar and Grill could collect all the credentials that are on that driving license even if it only shows the doorman the other one and send me marketing email and all that other kind of stuff. So, you can do it in a really privacy protective manner, or you can take the bad edge case of presenting a card and automate that for negative consequences.</p>
<p>So obviously, the Kantara workgroup that I lead for reports and recommendations on privacy enhancing mobile credentials, is trying to come up with a set of recommendations for providers of verifier device issuers, providers of wallets or designers of mobile credentials, how to protect the privacy of the individual above and beyond the transaction.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. In this example of the going to a bar, you illustrated how it works, but also in the privacy implications.</p>
<p>John: Personally, I’d prefer some of the European countries that don’t have age distinctions. If you want to send your six-year-old to the bar to pick up some wine, then… But I think there’s cultural bands in those countries where if you’re publicly intoxicated, you’re subject to social ridicule. There’s no social benefit to being inebriated. Anyway, that’s a side-line.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And definitely you started explaining there some of the challenges about privacy. What would you say are the main, if you can just summarise the main challenges about privacy?</p>
<p>John: Well, the business culture, surveillance capitalism, if you will, I know that’s a fraught face. When I was running networking systems and systems administrator in the ’90s, I was issuing X.509 certificates and I had all my user data, and I had access to it. Which kind of made sense in mid to late ’90s systems. And we were a B2B company that I was working for, but we were processing the personal information of our customer’s clients. So, we also had a proprietary interest in that.</p>
<p>So, coming into 2000, there’s this sort of culture of data about people is an asset owned by the companies and can be used to those companies’ advantage. The idea of, because systems were centralised and few, privacy issues didn’t really raise their head. There was good confidentiality in most companies, but not privacy.</p>
<p>And then, with the explosion of systems, and the introduction of a very interconnected backend, and especially with the introduction of monetising data through behavioural advertising and tracking, the entire thing got out of control, and we need to wrest control back of our own information. The challenge is cultural as much as anything, like the business culture around personal data. And the business models, which are I think, not sustainable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. And could you now tell us about the solutions? What are the solutions to those challenges you just mentioned?</p>
<p>John: Well, I think the solutions are two or three-fold. Legislation like the GDPR in Europe, or a day or two ago, I don’t know when this is going out. But just today, I heard the news that in the US, there was an agreement that might lead towards a Federal Privacy Law in the US. But all of those laws have the same flaw, which is that they’re built on the idea of Fair Information Practices, which came out of a 1970s vision of the way computer networks and systems run. Which is what we know now to be a completely flawed, notice and consent model where the organisation is a trusted organisation. It provides you notice of what they’re going to do with your data, they get your consent, and then they take possession of your data and act as a trusted custodian of your data. That was fine when there was a couple of 100 mainframes scattered around the world and IBM, [0:13:31] [unsure] on most of them doesn’t make any sense now.</p>
<p>So, there’s a new type of regulation that’s needed. But there’s a new type of standard that’s needed as well. So, the new type of regulation is what I started to taking to call “digital building code” which is you shouldn’t, any more than you shouldn’t build a house with electrical connections without making sure that your electrical infrastructure meets the building code for your jurisdiction. I think that there needs to be digital building codes so you can’t build a system that’s going to process personal information without meeting a certain minimum set of standards for protecting so that people don’t have to try and read privacy policies that can give notice and consent. That should be matched by standards and business culture to meet that floor standards.</p>
<p>So, it’s a tripod, if you will, the complaint mechanisms in the current regulations, safety regulations to make sure everybody is operating off the same floor, and standards to enable developers and companies to meet those. And I’m working on the standards side.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. You mentioned the companies tend to use the data of the individuals as a property. So how you, when we were discussing before this interview, you mentioned was the role of the IAM into this, what is your view on that?</p>
<p>John: Well, I remember talking at IIW a few years ago, it wasn’t about SSI as this was pre-SSI, but it was about a product in the system that enabled companies to give control over some portion of their customer’s data to the customer. So, in financial institutions, they’re highly regulated, and oftentimes have a requirement to send paper to their customer’s home on a yearly or quarterly basis.</p>
<p>If you have the wrong address, it’s very expensive, but you have this address in your database for the customer. And if you’ve got it wrong, you eat the cost of reprinting, resending, bringing back the data that you sent to the wrong address. The customer neglected to update you on their address, and so forth and so on. It costs millions of dollars to some of these companies every year just in data around customer addresses.</p>
<p>So, this was a system that instead of a customer requesting an address change, the company gave control of the address information to the customer, so that if the customer didn’t update the data, so with power comes responsibility, then the customer will be charged for the delivery charge to the wrong place, the reprinting and delivery charge. So that de-risks that company on that.</p>
<p>In that particular system, I had also enabled the customer to update their address with multiple companies at once if they were participating in the protocol. So, you can de-risk your data, especially against data rot, by actually giving control back to the person who knows it best. Now, you’re not going to do, I know I worked in payroll and HR so theoretically, customers can also update their financial information like, “Oh, I changed account, let me enter, put a new account number.”</p>
<p>But anybody who’s worked in payroll and HR knows that you want to verify that, so you have to balance that. But giving control of customer’s data can save you money and improve the quality of your data. And I think that was kind of one of the arguments that SSI people don’t make often enough is just the simple, reduced cost and business risk of putting people in control of aspects of their own data.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Regarding the report that you built in Kantara, tell me more about that. How it was the work that and you can tell the main findings?</p>
<p>John: The way Kantara works, there’s two kinds of discussion groups which produce reports and then recommendations, which will have requirements for conformance that could be tested. So, your audience may well know the identity assurance work trust mark that Kantara can issue if you want to make claims about your level of identity assurance for your firm.</p>
<p>So, the discussion group produced a report on protecting privacy and information and mobile driving licenses coming and that report is available on the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">kantarainitiative.org</a> website for download and you can take a look at it. The workgroup is trying to do a little bit more ambitious. It’s trying to talk about how do you meet the reasonable expectations of privacy in the issuer, holder, verifier triangle where Alice is the holder? How can she trust that her reasonable expectations of privacy are maintained in the transactions after she’s been issued a mobile credential that that credential won’t be abused in a way? Because most of the standards are transactional, which is to say that if you use the ISO MDL standard, for example, it talks about the interfaces. It has good requirements around data minimisation, and notice and consent, but it’s all around the transaction. It doesn’t speak to, and it’s not supposed to, it’s scoped out of it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t speak about if John’s Bar and Grill is the verifier and they’re using a system issued by ‘insert your mobile payment system verifier here’ that both that system at John’s Bar and Grill. And John’s Bar and Grill, once they’ve gotten the identity attributes from the transaction, how do they use those in a privacy protective manner? If you’re building a wallet or building a mobile credential for a phone, how do you do that, so that Alice can trust the wallet not to share the information for advertising on the backend, and so forth, and so on. So, building human trust between entities is how I like to summarise it rather than technical trust between endpoints, which is a lot of what most of us work with.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s a very interesting distinction you make, right? Trust is something technical for most of us.</p>
<p>John: Well, sure. But if you think about it, Zk-SNARKs or Zero Trust Solutions make perfect sense, right? If I went back to being a Network Administrator, I’d build a zero-trust network. I would assume that there was an APT inside my network and there would be zero trust between the endpoints, and everything would be cryptographically signed and verified and yadda yadda yadda.</p>
<p>But in the real world, and this is– I steal this example from Bruce Schneier. If there was zero trust, nobody would ever cruise through a green light. How many times, if you were driving today, how many times to do sales through a green light without looking to see if some idiot was ignoring the red light and ploughing through? I mean, it happens every once in a while, for a variety of reasons. But by and large, if you’ve got a green light, you trust that all the other drivers on the road are following the rules and you just go through.</p>
<p>That’s trust. That’s human trust. It’s built on systems that have all kinds of safeguards to make sure that you don’t have a green light going four ways. But once the systems are working, people can trust each other using those systems. And we do not have that on the internet. There is essentially zero people trust, and sadly, that’s been earned by the behaviour of a number of ecosystems that handle personal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. So, you have seen this, the understanding of trust, let’s say the identity professionals are the one who are building the systems and the, let’s say, the majority of people that difference. So, you have noticed that this makes things complicated for developing the systems?</p>
<p>John: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, the story for surveillance capital, like companies that depend on advertising is, we never sell your information, or we never share your information. Well, which was true in a sense, and that if you went to site X, or site F, or site G, you know, insert whatever company. And you went to that site, and then behind the scenes, real time bidding occurred, they didn’t share your information with any of the advertisers. The advertisers said, I want to put my ad on profiles that meet these parameters. And there’ll be real time bidding.</p>
<p>So, at one level, until you clicked on the ad, and at which point your positive action of clicking on the ad created a relationship between you and the advertiser, at which point it’s out of system X or system F or system G’s hands, you’ve now done something, and that advertiser or the publisher has access to your information, because you clicked on their ad. So, in a very narrow, untrustworthy sense, yeah, they weren’t selling your data. Although a lot has come out now about the way real time bidding works, and how much information is shared for the 100 bidders, who get to see some bit of your data to bid on that page, and only one of them actually gets the data, the one that actually wins the bid. It’s a snake pit behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. Well, thank you, very interesting, what you are sharing with us about the mobile credential, the privacy and how things are progressing. Could you tell us now for all business leaders that are listening to us, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>John: The actionable item is, do you know who you share your customer’s data with? And why you shared it? And would you be comfortable sharing that information with your customer? So, the answer to all three of those questions should be yes. Yes, I know with whom I shared it. Yes, I know what I shared. And yes, I’m comfortable letting the customer know that I’ve shared it. If any one of those answers is no, then there’s going to be a reckoning at some point with your customers, or with the regulator, or with your business model.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yup. Three questions that, as you said, they should be yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>John: Those three yeses de-risk and future-proof your organisation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, exactly. Well, thanks a lot for putting it in a very, very clear way for everybody who is listening to this. Well, thanks a lot for sharing all this super interesting about mobile driver licenses. And of course, I recommend, so we’ll put the link to the report, <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/pimdl-v1-final/">Kantara Initiative report</a> that John has co-authored and super interesting,</p>
<p>John: And a link to the workgroup, hopefully, because I invite anybody who is interested in this to join the workgroup because you can start to help shape the requirements for the standard to come.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, what is the name of the workgroup? What is the exact name?</p>
<p>John: <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/groups/pemc-wg/">The Privacy Enhancing Mobile Credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, perfect. We will add the link as well. Fantastic. So, John, it was a pleasure talking with you. If there’s something else that you would like to tell or how people can get in touch with you.</p>
<p>John: Probably the simplest way is I’m @PrivacyCDN on both Twitter and LinkedIn, P-R- I-V-A-C-Y CDN. That’s a play on words because in Canada, CDN is sometimes used for Canadian. But in the rest of the world, it means Content Delivery Network, so I thought that was an interesting pun. Anyway, @PrivacyCDN on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/privacycdn/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&amp;originalSubdomain=ca">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivacyCDN">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, I didn’t know that’s CDN, so it’s good to know, thank you. Again, it was a pleasure talking with you, John, and all the best.</p>
<p>John: Take care, Oscar.</p>

<p>Between long hours at work and time spent on devices outside of work hours, digital interactions have become a dominant and permeating force in the lives of people all over the world. In 2020 and 2021, the global COVD-19 pandemic rewired consumers to be digital-first (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CpZP-avaaBZPAawyV07a_GWwFGOlGIiO/view?usp=sharing">Adobe</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, organizations and businesses have become hyper-focused on boosting user experience (UX) to ensure that customers and employees can easily engage with all their digital properties, helping to support and drive business growth. Unfortunately, this also means that bad actors are also on the rise, and online threats are more prevalent than ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great UX is critical in this digital-first world but begs the question: is it possible to balance UX and security in a way that creates a smooth experience for the user and a secure environment for your organization? In this article, we will look at how identity security can balance UX and security throughout the user journey.</p>

  <p>When it comes to infrastructure, public clouds are the most popular choice these days, especially Amazon Web Services (AWS). If you are in one of those lucky or unlucky (depending on how you see it) teams running microservices, then you need a way to orchestrate their deployments. When it comes to orchestrating microservices, Kubernetes is the de-facto choice. Most public cloud providers also provide managed Kubernetes as a service; for example, Google provides Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Microsoft provides Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Amazon provides Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that deploying and managing microservices on the public cloud is easy; each cloud service comes with its own challenges and pain. This is especially true for Amazon EKS, which, in my opinion, is the most difficult Kubernetes service to use, but also one of the most flexible. This is because EKS consists of some clever orchestrations doing a complex dance on top of other AWS services like EC2, EBS, etc.</p>

<p>If you want to run a microservice stack on EKS, you will need to spend some extra time and effort setting it up and managing it. This is where infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> come in handy.</p>

<p>So here is what you will learn to do today:</p>

 
   Scaffold a Java microservice stack using JHipster, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud 
   Create an EKS cluster, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, and required Kubernetes add-ons using Terraform on AWS 
   Set up OIDC authentication for the microservice stack using Okta 
   Build and deploy the microservice stack to the cluster

 Why Terraform, why not CloudFormation? 

<p>At this point, the first question that might pop up in your mind would be, “Why not use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a>?”. It’s a good question; after all, CloudFormation is built by AWS and hence sounds like an excellent solution to manage AWS resources. But anyone who has tried both CloudFormation and Terraform will probably tell you to forget that CloudFormation even exists. I think CloudFormation is far more complex and less developer-friendly than Terraform. You also need to write a lot more boilerplate with CloudFormation in YAML or JSON. Yikes! And most importantly, Terraform is far more powerful and flexible than CloudFormation. It’s cross-platform, which means you can take care of all your infrastructure management needs on any platform with one tool.</p>

 Scaffold a Java microservice stack using JHipster 

<p>You need a microservice stack to deploy to the cluster. I’m using a microservice stack scaffolded for demo purposes using <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a>. You can use another microservice stack if you want. If you prefer using the same application as in this demo, then you can either scaffold it using JHipster <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/intro">JDL</a> or clone the sample repository from <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-k8s-eks-microservices-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Option 1: Scaffold the microservice stack using JHipster</p>

   <code>mkdir jhipster-microservice-stack
cd jhipster-microservice-stack
# download the JDL file.
jhipster download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-k8s-eks-microservices-example/main/apps.jdl
# Update the `dockerRepositoryName` property to use your Docker Repository URI/Name.
# scaffold the apps.
jhipster jdl apps.jdl
</code>   

<p>Option 2: Clone the sample repository</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-k8s-eks-microservices-example
</code>   

<p>In either case, remember to change the Docker repository name to match your Docker repository.</p>

<p>The JHipster scaffolded sample application has a gateway application, two microservices, and uses <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a> for service discovery and centralized configuration.</p>

 Create an EKS cluster using Terraform 

<p>Now let us move on to the important part of the tutorial. Creating an EKS cluster in AWS is not as straightforward as in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You need to also create a lot more resources for everything to work correctly without surprises. You will be using a bunch of Terraform providers to help with this, and you will also use some prebuilt Terraform modules like <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc">AWS VPC Terraform module</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints">Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform</a> to reduce the amount of boilerplate you need to write.</p>

<p>These are the AWS resources and VPC architecture you will create:</p>

<p></p>

 Build the Terraform configuration 

<p>First, make sure you use a specific version of the providers as different versions might use different attributes and features. Create a <code>versions.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>mkdir terraform
cd terraform
touch versions.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>terraform {
  required_version = "&gt;= 1.0.0"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "&gt;= 3.72"
    }
    kubernetes = {
      source  = "hashicorp/kubernetes"
      version = "&gt;= 2.10"
    }
    helm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/helm"
      version = "&gt;= 2.4.1"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "&gt;= 3.2.0"
    }
    nullres = {
      source  = "hashicorp/null"
      version = "&gt;= 3.1"
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you need to define variables and configure the providers. Create a <code>config.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch config.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code># ##  To save state in s3. Update to suit your needs
# backend "s3" {
#   bucket = "create-an-s3-bucket-and-provide-name-here"
#   region = local.region
#   key    = "eks-cluster-with-new-vpc/terraform.tfstate"
# }

variable "region" {
  default     = "eu-west-1"
  description = "AWS region"
}

resource "random_string" "suffix" {
  length  = 8
  special = false
}

data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {}

locals {
  name            = "okta-jhipster-eks-${random_string.suffix.result}"
  region          = var.region
  cluster_version = "1.22"
  instance_types  = ["t2.large"] # can be multiple, comma separated

  vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
  azs      = slice(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names, 0, 3)

  tags = {
    Blueprint  = local.name
    GitHubRepo = "github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = local.region
}

# Kubernetes provider
# You should **not** schedule deployments and services in this workspace.
# This keeps workspaces modular (one for provision EKS, another for scheduling
# Kubernetes resources) as per best practices.
provider "kubernetes" {
  host                   = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_endpoint
  cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_certificate_authority_data)

  exec {
    api_version = "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
    command     = "aws"
    # This requires the awscli to be installed locally where Terraform is executed
    args = ["eks", "get-token", "--cluster-name", module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id]
  }
}

provider "helm" {
  kubernetes {
    host                   = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_endpoint
    cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_certificate_authority_data)

    exec {
      api_version = "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
      command     = "aws"
      # This requires the awscli to be installed locally where Terraform is executed
      args = ["eks", "get-token", "--cluster-name", module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id]
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>You can uncomment the <code>backend</code> section above to save state in S3 instead of your local filesystem. This is recommended for production setup so that everyone in a team has the same state. This file defines configurable and local variables used across the workspace and configures some of the providers used. The Kubernetes provider is included in this file so the EKS module can complete successfully. Otherwise, it throws an error when creating <code>kubernetes_config_map.aws_auth</code>. The helm provider is used to install Kubernetes add-ons to the cluster.</p>

 Build the VPC 

<p>Next up, you need a VPC, subnets, route tables, and other networking bits. You will use the <code>vpc</code> module from the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules"><code>terraform-aws-modules</code></a> repository. This module is a wrapper around the AWS VPC module. It makes it easier to configure VPCs and all the other required networking resources. Create a <code>vpc.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch vpc.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>#---------------------------------------------------------------
# VPC, Subnets, Internet gateway, Route tables, etc.
#---------------------------------------------------------------
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~&gt; 3.0"

  name = local.name
  cidr = local.vpc_cidr

  azs             = local.azs
  public_subnets  = [for k, v in local.azs : cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 8, k)]
  private_subnets = [for k, v in local.azs : cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 8, k + 10)]

  enable_nat_gateway   = true
  single_nat_gateway   = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true

  # Manage so we can name
  manage_default_network_acl    = true
  default_network_acl_tags      = { Name = "${local.name}-default" }
  manage_default_route_table    = true
  default_route_table_tags      = { Name = "${local.name}-default" }
  manage_default_security_group = true
  default_security_group_tags   = { Name = "${local.name}-default" }

  public_subnet_tags = {
    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.name}" = "shared"
    "kubernetes.io/role/elb"              = 1
  }

  private_subnet_tags = {
    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.name}" = "shared"
    "kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb"     = 1
  }

  tags = local.tags
}
</code>   

<p>This will create:</p>

 
   A new VPC, three private subnets, and three public subnets, 
   Internet gateway and NAT gateway for the public subnets, 
   and AWS routes for the gateways, public/private route tables, and route table associations. 
 

 Build the EKS cluster 

<p>Now that you have the networking part done, you can build configurations for the EKS cluster and its add-ons. You will use the <code>eks_blueprints</code> module from <a href="https://aws-ia.github.io/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/v4.0.9/"><code>terraform-aws-eks-blueprints</code></a>, which is a wrapper around the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules"><code>terraform-aws-modules</code></a> and provides additional modules to configure EKS add-ons.</p>

<p>Create a <code>eks-cluster.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch eks-cluster.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>#---------------------------------------------------------------
# EKS cluster, worker nodes, security groups, IAM roles, K8s add-ons, etc.
#---------------------------------------------------------------
module "eks_blueprints" {
  source = "github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints?ref=v4.0.9"

  cluster_name    = local.name
  cluster_version = local.cluster_version

  vpc_id             = module.vpc.vpc_id
  private_subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnets

  managed_node_groups = {
    node = {
      node_group_name = "managed-ondemand"
      instance_types  = local.instance_types
      min_size        = 2
      subnet_ids      = module.vpc.private_subnets
    }
  }

  tags = local.tags
}

module "eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons" {
  source = "github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints//modules/kubernetes-addons?ref=v4.0.9"

  eks_cluster_id       = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id
  eks_cluster_endpoint = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_endpoint
  eks_oidc_provider    = module.eks_blueprints.oidc_provider
  eks_cluster_version  = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_version

  # EKS Managed Add-ons
  enable_amazon_eks_vpc_cni    = true
  enable_amazon_eks_coredns    = true
  enable_amazon_eks_kube_proxy = true

  # K8S Add-ons
  enable_aws_load_balancer_controller = true
  enable_metrics_server               = true
  enable_cluster_autoscaler           = true
  enable_aws_cloudwatch_metrics       = false

  tags = local.tags

}

# To update local kubeconfig with new cluster details
resource "null_resource" "kubeconfig" {
  depends_on = [module.eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons]
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws eks --region ${local.region}  update-kubeconfig --name $AWS_CLUSTER_NAME"
    environment = {
      AWS_CLUSTER_NAME = local.name
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>eks_blueprints</code> module definition creates:</p>

 
   EKS Cluster Control plane with one <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">managed node group</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html">fargate profile</a>, 
   Cluster and node security groups and rules, IAM roles and policies required, 
   and AWS Key Management Service (KMS) configuration. 
 

<p>The <code>eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons</code> module definition creates:</p>

 
   Amazon EKS add-ons vpc-cni, CoreDNS, and kube-proxy, 
   AWS Load Balancer Controller that provisions an AWS Network Load Balancer for distributing traffic, 
   and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server">Metrics Server</a>, and Cluster Autoscaler for scaling your workloads. 
 

<p>The <code>null_resource</code> configuration updates your local kubeconfig with the new cluster details. It’s not a required step for provisioning but just a handy hack.</p>

<p>Finally, you can also define some outputs to be captured. Create a <code>outputs.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch outputs.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>output "vpc_private_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "VPC private subnet CIDR"
  value       = module.vpc.private_subnets_cidr_blocks
}

output "vpc_public_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "VPC public subnet CIDR"
  value       = module.vpc.public_subnets_cidr_blocks
}

output "vpc_cidr" {
  description = "VPC CIDR"
  value       = module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block
}

output "eks_cluster_id" {
  description = "EKS cluster ID"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroups" {
  description = "EKS managed node groups"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_groups
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_ids" {
  description = "EKS managed node group ids"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_groups_id
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_arns" {
  description = "EKS managed node group arns"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_group_arn
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_role_name" {
  description = "EKS managed node group role name"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_group_iam_role_names
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_status" {
  description = "EKS managed node group status"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_groups_status
}

output "configure_kubectl" {
  description = "Configure kubectl: make sure you're logged in with the correct AWS profile and run the following command to update your kubeconfig"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.configure_kubectl
}
</code>   

 Provision the cluster 

<p>Our Terraform definitions are ready. Now you can provision the cluster. First, initialize Terraform workspace and plan the changes:</p>

   <code># download modules and providers. Initialize state.
terraform init
# see a preview of what will be done
terraform plan
</code>   

<p>Review the plan and make sure everything is correct. Ensure you have configured your AWS CLI and IAM Authenticator to use the correct AWS account. If not, run the following:</p>

   <code># Visit https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials for creating access keys
aws configure
</code>   

<p>Now you can apply the changes:</p>

   <code>terraform apply
</code>   

<p>Confirm by typing <code>yes</code> when prompted. This will take a while (15-20 minutes), so sit back and have a coffee or contemplate what led you to this point in life. 😉</p>

<p>Once the EKS cluster is ready, you will see the output variables printed to the console.</p>

<p>You should see the cluster details if you run <code>kdash</code> or <code>kubectl get nodes</code> commands.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The EKS cluster defined here will not come under AWS free tier; hence, running this will cost money, so delete the cluster as soon as you finish the tutorial to keep the cost within a few dollars.</p>

 Set up OIDC authentication using Okta 

<p>You can proceed to deploy the sample application. You could skip this step if you used a sample that does not use Okta or OIDC for authentication.</p>

<p>First, navigate to the store application folder.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Make sure to add the newly created <code>.okta.env</code> file to your <code>.gitignore</code> file so that you don’t accidentally expose your credentials to the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Update <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code> with the OIDC configuration from the <code>.okta.env</code> file. The Spring Cloud Config server reads from this file and shares the values with the gateway and microservices.</p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, configure the JHipster Registry to use OIDC for authentication. Modify <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> to enable the <code>oauth2</code> profile, which is preconfigured in the JHipster Registry application.</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

<p>The application is now ready.</p>

 Secure secrets 

<p>If you have noticed, you are setting secrets in plain text on the <code>application-configmap.yml</code> file, which is not ideal and is not a best practice for security. For the specific JHipster application, you can use the encrypt functionality provided by the JHipster Registry to encrypt the secrets. See <a>Encrypt Your Secrets with Spring Cloud Config</a> to learn how to do this. But that would also rely on a base64 encoded encryption key added as a Kubernetes Secret, which still can be decoded. The best way to do this would be to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/">AWS Secrets Manager</a>, an external service like <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">HashiCorp Vault</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">Sealed Secrets</a>. To learn more about these methods see <a>Encrypt Your Kubernetes Secrets</a>.</p>

 Deploy the microservice stack 

<p>You are ready to deploy to our shiny new EKS cluster, but first, you need to build and push the Docker images to a container registry. You can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)</a> or any other container registry.</p>

 Build the Docker images 

<p>You need to build Docker images for each app. This is specific to the JHipster application used in this tutorial which uses <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">Jib</a> to build the images. Make sure you are logged into Docker using <code>docker login</code>. Navigate to each app folder (store, invoice, product) and run the following command:</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=&lt;docker-repo-uri-or-name&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;
</code>   

<p>Image names should be <code>store</code>, <code>invoice</code>, and <code>product</code>.</p>

 Deploy the applications to EKS 

<p>Start the deployment using the handy script provided by JHipster. You could also manually apply deployments using <code>kubectl apply -f &lt;file&gt;</code> commands.</p>

   <code>cd kubernetes
./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>You can also run the following command to see the status of the deployments:</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n jhipster
</code>   

<p>View the registry using port-forwarding as follows, and you will be able to access the application at <code>http://localhost:8761</code>.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n jhipster 8761
</code>   

<p>You can access the gateway application using port-forwarding as follows, and you will be able to access the application at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/store -n jhipster 8080
</code>   

<p>Or, you can access the application via the load balancer exposed. Find the external IP of the <code>store</code> service by navigating to the service tab in KDash or by running the following:</p>

   <code>kubectl get svc store -n jhipster
</code>   

<p>Navigate to the Okta Admin Console and go to Applications &gt; Applications from left-hand navigation. Find the application you created earlier with <code>okta apps create jhipster</code> and add the external IP from <code>kubectl get svc</code> command to the Sign-in redirect URIs and Sign-out redirect URIs. Make sure to use the same paths as the current <code>localhost</code> entries.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to visit the external IP of the <code>store</code> service on port 8080 and see the application, and you should be able to log in using your Okta credentials.</p>

 Tear down the cluster with Terraform 

<p>Once you are done with the tutorial, you can delete the cluster and all the resources created using Terraform by running the following commands:</p>

   <code>cd terraform
# The commands below might take a while to finish.
terraform destroy -target="module.eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons" -auto-approve
# If deleting VPC fails, then manually delete the load balancers and security groups
# for the load balancer associated with the VPC from AWS EC2 console and try again.
terraform destroy -target="module.eks_blueprints" -auto-approve
terraform destroy -target="module.vpc" -auto-approve
# cleanup anything left over.
terraform destroy -auto-approve
</code>

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>I recently participated in a panel discussion covering "What to Look for in an Identity Cloud Provider" with two of my colleagues here at ForgeRock, which was hosted by the <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/">Cloud Security Alliance</a>. With widespread confusion about cloud, hybrid, privacy, MFA, governance, and so much else, I found this discussion a useful primer on the basics of a cloud identity service as well as what's important to look for before signing the dotted line with a vendor. I thought I'd summarize the talk here, but I encourage you to view the <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/10415/538830?utm_source=CloudSecurityAlliance&amp;utm_medium=brighttalk&amp;utm_campaign=538830">full session</a>, which goes into much more detail.</p>

<p>Selecting a cloud vendor to help host your identity-related functions — such as user authentication, authorization, single sign-on, federation, and identity management — can be a business booster and a way to streamline efficiencies. Plus, it can help improve your overall security and give your organization a competitive edge through the delivery of a more seamless digital experience for your users — both your internal employees and your consumers. But, not all identity clouds deliver the same capabilities. The way some are architected and operated can actually impact the capabilities you're looking for and may not meet your expectations for performance and scalability.</p>

<p>What follows are some highlights from the talk. It covers a few of the considerations to ask for, nag, cajole, and anything else you need to do to get assurances from the vendor before you sign the bottom line.</p>

<p>Consideration #1: Capabilities in the Cloud</p>

<p>It may be assumed that all ID cloud vendors offer the capabilities you're looking for, but mileage varies.</p>

<p>For example, some vendors focus on customer identity and access management (CIAM) solutions, which provide the capabilities you need to reach, enroll, manage, and otherwise deliver that great online experience for your end-user customers. Other vendors focus on internal or workforce-related scenarios, which optimize around the security of employees, gig workers, contractors, and work-a-day types gaining access to your applications, networks, and data.</p>

<p>While there is significant overlap between <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/CIAM">CIAM</a> and workforce identity and access management (IAM), when you get down into the weeds, key differences exist and you need to be able to plan for multiple user journeys all within a single identity cloud solution so that you can accommodate current and future scenarios. The cloud service should enable you to easily design user journeys, from registration and authentication to the ways users prefer to access services (MFA, passwordless, one-time password, magic link, and others). It should enable self-service flows, such as password resets, forgotten usernames, and preferences. Bottom line: why run two identity solutions in your organization when you can just run one that covers all your applications and the needs of all your users?</p>

<p>Consideration #2: Hybrid IT</p>

	<p>A recent survey from Threatpost<a>1</a> shows that the use of a hybrid cloud environment is on par with the use of public clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure). In other words, organizations are straddling applications that span both on-premises and cloud deployments. It's not just a pure-play cloud world. This isn't really surprising. ForgeRock's own research<a>2</a> shows that 86% of respondents expect hybrid cloud will be their reality for at least the next five years.</p>

<p>Given this reality, you should determine if your identity vendor has capabilities that can be deployed to secure applications on-premises, in the cloud with a public cloud provider of your choice, or through a hybrid or multi-cloud approach. You should opt for an identity cloud architecture with deployment options that include a combination of private and public clouds, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS).</p>

<p>Consideration #3: User Experience</p>

<p>In a world where the only interface many users will have with your organization is through digital channels, having an identity cloud solution that can deliver the ultimate seamless experience for your users — regardless of where they are coming from or what device they are using — can be a game-changer.</p>

<p>You should plan for the platform to secure and orchestrate seamless omnichannel user journeys for easy access, regardless of what device users are on. Think of an omnichannel experience like curbside pickup, where a user places an order through a web browser from the comfort of home, then engages in the mobile app for payment and coordination of the pickup within a defined time window. Many different identity, compliance and security, and ecommerce functions need to be simultaneously engaged and work together seamlessly to deliver a satisfying user experience and outcome.</p>

<p>Consideration #4: Security and Compliance</p>

<p>It was once taken for granted that anything "cloud" was scary and suspect on the grounds that security could not provide parity with a self-managed, on-premises solution. Now it's widely recognized that as long as your cloud SaaS vendor has the security controls in place, you can achieve the same level of security and compliance in the cloud as you do on site. But there's the rub…you have to know what your identity cloud vendor is doing in this area.</p>

<p>You need to work with your cloud service provider to ensure your data is never commingled with other customer data. This not only prevents accidental data spillage, but also prevents "noisy" and "nosey" neighbors impacting your performance or accidentally or maliciously accessing your data.</p>

<p>In terms of compliance, look for the vendors that have done the hard work upfront on SOC2 and ISO27001. That way, you can be assured that at least the base-level security plumbing is in place. But also look to your own internal compliance needs and seek out a cloud vendor that can isolate your data in certain geos so you can satisfy data residency laws for regional regulatory requirements such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>

<p>Consideration #5: Predictability, Scalability, and More</p>

<p>The nuts and bolts of the cloud solution — the way it's built and operated — underpin the way it's going to perform for you. You should review the cloud service provider's upgrade process. Does the vendor allow for zero-downtime upgrades so that a patch or upgrade does not impact service-level agreements (SLAs)? When it comes to identity-related services, even a small downtime window for upgrades can mean big user impact.</p>

<p>You should also seek out a vendor with an industry-standard <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/welcome-9999-availability-forgerock">99.99% SLA</a> and a history of exceeding that standard. Too many cloud providers "intermingle" client data, making it very difficult to extract and restore your particular backup in the timeframe that you need it. If disaster strikes, be sure the cloud service has the ability to restore your specific environment from an encrypted backup, within an acceptable SLA, in case of a mishap or misconfiguration.</p>
