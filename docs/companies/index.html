<p>Written by <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/chriswere">Chris Were</a> (Verida CEO &amp; Co-Founder), this article was originally published on <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2024/03/28/top-three-data-privacy-issues-facing-ai-today/">DailyHodl.com</a></p><p>AI (artificial intelligence) has caused frenzied excitement among consumers and businesses alike — driven by a passionate belief that LLMs (large language models) and tools like ChatGPT will transform the way we study, work and&nbsp;live.</p><p>But just like in the internet’s early days, users are jumping in without considering how their personal data is used — and the impact this could have on their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There have already been countless examples of data breaches within the AI space. In March 2023, OpenAI temporarily took ChatGPT <a href="https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage">offline</a> after a ‘significant’ error meant users were able to see the conversation histories of strangers.</p><p>That same bug meant the payment information of subscribers — including names, email addresses and partial credit card numbers — were also in the public&nbsp;domain.</p><p>In September 2023, a staggering 38 terabytes of Microsoft data was inadvertently <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-ai-employee-accidentally-leaks-38tb-of-data">leaked</a> by an employee, with cybersecurity experts warning this could have allowed attackers to infiltrate AI models with malicious code.</p><p>Researchers have also been able to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5aceb7a6-9d5a-4f1f-af3d-1ef0129b0934">manipulate</a> AI systems into disclosing confidential records.</p><p>In just a few hours, a group called Robust Intelligence was able to solicit personally identifiable information from Nvidia software and bypass safeguards designed to prevent the system from discussing certain&nbsp;topics.</p><p>Lessons were learned in all of these scenarios, but each breach powerfully illustrates the challenges that need to be overcome for AI to become a reliable and trusted force in our&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Gemini, Google’s chatbot, even admits that all conversations are processed by human reviewers — underlining the lack of transparency in its&nbsp;system.</p><p>“Don’t enter anything that you wouldn’t want to be reviewed or used,” says an alert to users&nbsp;warns.</p><p>AI is rapidly moving beyond a tool that students use for their homework or tourists rely on for recommendations during a trip to&nbsp;Rome.</p><p>It’s increasingly being depended on for sensitive discussions — and fed everything from medical questions to our work schedules.</p><p>Because of this, it’s important to take a step back and reflect on the top three data privacy issues facing AI today, and why they matter to all of&nbsp;us.</p> 1. Prompts aren’t&nbsp;private <p>Tools like ChatGPT memorize past conversations in order to refer back to them later. While this can improve the user experience and help train LLMs, it comes with&nbsp;risk.</p><p>If a system is successfully hacked, there’s a real danger of prompts being exposed in a public&nbsp;forum.</p><p>Potentially embarrassing details from a user’s history could be leaked, as well as commercially sensitive information when AI is being deployed for work purposes.</p><p>As we’ve seen from Google, all submissions can also end up being scrutinized by its development team.</p><p>Samsung took action on this in May 2023 when it banned employees from using generative AI tools altogether. That came after an employee <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-chatgpt-and-other-chatbots-for-employees-after-sensitive-code-leak/?sh=3db17e386078">uploaded</a> confidential source code to&nbsp;ChatGPT.</p><p>The tech giant was concerned that this information would be difficult to retrieve and delete, meaning IP (intellectual property) could end up being distributed to the public at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Apple, Verizon and JPMorgan have taken similar action, with reports suggesting Amazon launched a crackdown after responses from ChatGPT bore similarities to its own internal&nbsp;data.</p><p>As you can see, the concerns extend beyond what would happen if there’s a data breach but to the prospect that information entered into AI systems could be repurposed and distributed to a wider audience.</p><p>Companies like OpenAI are already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai">facing</a> multiple lawsuits amid allegations that their chatbots were trained using copyrighted material.</p> 2. Custom AI models trained by organizations aren’t&nbsp;private <p>This brings us neatly to our next point — while individuals and corporations can establish their custom LLM models based on their own data sources, they won’t be fully private if they exist within the confines of a platform like&nbsp;ChatGPT.</p><p>There’s ultimately no way of knowing whether inputs are being used to train these massive systems — or whether personal information could end up being used in future&nbsp;models.</p><p>Like a jigsaw, data points from multiple sources can be brought together to form a comprehensive and worryingly detailed insight into someone’s identity and background.</p><p>Major platforms may also fail to offer detailed explanations of how this data is stored and processed, with an inability to opt out of features that a user is uncomfortable with.</p><p>Beyond responding to a user’s prompts, AI systems increasingly have the ability to read between the lines and deduce everything from a person’s location to their personality.</p><p>In the event of a data breach, dire consequences are possible. Incredibly sophisticated phishing attacks could be orchestrated — and users targeted with information they had confidentially fed into an AI&nbsp;system.</p><p>Other potential scenarios include this data being used to assume someone’s identity, whether that’s through applications to open bank accounts or deepfake&nbsp;videos.</p><p>Consumers need to remain vigilant even if they don’t use AI themselves. AI is increasingly being used to power surveillance systems and enhance facial recognition technology in public&nbsp;places.</p><p>If such infrastructure isn’t established in a truly private environment, the civil liberties and privacy of countless citizens could be infringed without their knowledge.</p> 3. Private data is used to train AI&nbsp;systems <p>There are concerns that major AI systems have gleaned their intelligence by poring over countless web&nbsp;pages.</p><p>Estimates suggest 300 billion words were used to train ChatGPT — that’s 570 gigabytes of data — with books and Wikipedia entries among the datasets.</p><p>Algorithms have also been known to depend on social media pages and online comments.</p><p>With some of these sources, you could argue that the owners of this information would have had a reasonable expectation of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>But here’s the thing — many of the tools and apps we interact with every day are already heavily influenced by AI — and react to our behaviors.</p><p>The Face ID on your iPhone uses AI to track subtle changes in your appearance.</p><p>TikTok and Facebook’s AI-powered algorithms make content recommendations based on the clips and posts you’ve viewed in the&nbsp;past.</p><p>Voice assistants like Alexa and Siri depend heavily on machine learning, too.</p><p>A dizzying constellation of AI startups is out there, and each has a specific purpose. However, some are more transparent than others about how user data is gathered, stored and&nbsp;applied.</p><p>This is especially important as AI makes an impact in the field of healthcare — from medical imaging and diagnoses to record-keeping and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Lessons need to be learned from the internet businesses caught up in privacy scandals over recent&nbsp;years.</p><p>Flo, a women’s health app, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/us/period-apps-health-technology-women-privacy.html">accused</a> by regulators of sharing intimate details about its users to the likes of Facebook and Google in the&nbsp;2010s.</p> Where do we go from&nbsp;here <p>AI is going to have an indelible impact on all of our lives in the years to come. LLMs are getting better with every passing day, and new use cases continue to&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>However, there’s a real risk that regulators will struggle to keep up as the industry moves at breakneck speed.</p><p>And that means consumers need to start securing their own data and monitoring how it is&nbsp;used.</p><p>Decentralization can play a vital role here and prevent large volumes of data from falling into the hands of major platforms.</p><p>DePINs (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) have the potential to ensure everyday users experience the full benefits of AI without their privacy being compromised.</p><p>Not only can encrypted prompts deliver far more personalized outcomes, but privacy-preserving LLMs would ensure users have full control of their data at all times — and protection against it being&nbsp;misused.</p><p>Chris Were is the CEO of <a href="https://www.verida.network/">Verida</a>, a decentralized, self-sovereign data network empowering individuals to control their digital identity and personal data.

<p></p>
<p>Digital identity shapes every facet of our online interactions. The quest for a system that balances decentralization, scalability, security, and user experience has been relentless. Today, I'm thrilled to share that TBD has birthed a new solution: the DID DHT method. This leap forward is not just a technical achievement; it's a foundational component for the more inclusive and trust-based digital world we want for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://did-dht.com/">specification</a> is nearing its first major version, and our team has produced client software in all of our <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/">open source SDKs</a> in more than five languages. We have also built and deployed a publicly-available developer gateway, which has already registered many thousands of DIDs, with staging and production-ready gateways coming soon.</p>
<p>Some of you may already be <a href="https://youtu.be/23lCRO2CIIY?si=R-a79TEKQQmv6Vj_">familiar with DID DHT</a> and why we’ve chosen to make it our default DID method, but if not, or if you’re curious to find out more, read on to learn more about how the method was created, and how we’ve ended up here today.</p>
 What Makes a Good DID Method?<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#what-makes-a-good-did-method" title="Direct link to What Makes a Good DID Method?">​</a> 
<p>Our vision for a superior DID method hinged on several critical features:</p>
 
 Sufficient Decentralization — a foundational principle to mitigate censorship and enhance user autonomy. 
 Scalability and Accessibility –&nbsp;making digital identity accessible to billions, without a prohibitive cost barrier. 
 Comprehensive Feature Set — supporting multiple cryptographic key types, services, and other core DID properties. 
 Reliable and Verifiable History — enabling trust through transparency historical data. 
 **Global Discoverability **– facilitating easy access and independent verification of digital identifiers. 
 
 The Evolution of Our DID Strategy<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#the-evolution-of-our-did-strategy" title="Direct link to The Evolution of Our DID Strategy">​</a> 
<p>Historically our software has supported <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec">did:ion</a>, and some other methods within certain segments of our stack. Recognizing the impracticality of a "one-size-fits-all" approach, we embraced a multi-method strategy. Today that strategy incorporates three key DID methods: <a href="https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md">did:jwk</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a>, and <a href="https://tbd54566975.github.io/did-dht-method/">did:dht</a>, each catering to specific scenarios with their unique strengths.</p>
<p>Within our SDKs, JWK replaces did:key, a simple and widely adopted method that uses standard JSON Web Keys (JWKs), limiting complexity over did:key’s approach to using multi-formats. DID Web is an obvious choice for entities with existing brands, as trust can be easily linked to existing domains without the use of any special or complex technology. DID DHT is a new method that we view as a replacement for ION, which has strong decentralization characteristics, a robust feature set, and a simpler architecture.</p>
 Leaping Beyond ION<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#leaping-beyond-ion" title="Direct link to Leaping Beyond ION">​</a> 
<p>The biggest change we’ve made is going from ION to DID DHT.</p>
<p>ION is a <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree-based DID method</a> that is a L2 on the Bitcoin blockchain. ION is a fully-featured DID method, and one of the few that supports root key rotation and discoverability of all DIDs with complete historical state. However, there are three main reasons that led us to move away from using ION — architectural complexity, centralization risk, and a sub-optimal user experience.</p>
<p>While ION presented a robust DID method with admirable features, its complexity, centralization risks, and user experience challenges prompted us to explore alternatives. DID DHT stands out as our choice for a new direction, offering simplicity, enhanced decentralization, and a user-friendly approach without compromising on the core features essential for a comprehensive DID method.</p>
 Enter DID DHT<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#enter-did-dht" title="Direct link to Enter DID DHT">​</a> 
<p>DID DHT is built upon <a href="https://github.com/Nuhvi/pkarr">Pkarr</a>, a community-created project. Pkarr stands for Public Key Addressable Resource Records and acts as a bridge between our DID method and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT">Mainline Decentralized Hash Table</a>, overlaying DNS record semantics and providing a space-efficient encoding mechanism for DID Documents. The choice of Mainline DHT, with its over 20 million active nodes and a 15-year successful run, guarantees exceptional decentralization out of mainline nodes, but can also leverage Pkarr nodes and DID DHT gateways for additional functionality.</p>
<p>DID DHT trades off use of a blockchain for immediate decentralization, fast publishing and resolution, and trustless verification. That’s right — the DID Document’s records are signed by its own key before entering the DHT — there’s no need to trust nodes, as you can verify payloads yourself client-side. Similar to ION, DID DHT documents support multiple keys, services, type indexing, and other DID Document properties.</p>
<p>DID DHT, however, is not without its limitations. The main three being: a need to republish records to nodes regularly to prevent them from expiring from the DHT and reliance on a non-rotatable Ed25519 key called the “identity key,” as is required by the DHT and <a href="https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0044.html">BEP44</a>, and historical DID state not being shared between nodes. Our ongoing development and the community-driven enhancements aim to address these challenges, refining DID DHT's architecture for broader applicability and reliability.</p>
 DID DHT Opportunities<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#did-dht-opportunities" title="Direct link to DID DHT Opportunities">​</a> 
<p>One of the most interesting opportunities we have identified for DID DHT is <a href="https://did-dht.com/#interoperability-with-other-did-methods">interoperability</a> with existing single-key methods like <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key</a> and <a href="https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md">did:jwk</a>. Essentially, you can continue to use single-key methods as you do today, with an optional resolution step to the DHT to extend the functionality of these methods, like adding additional keys or service(s) to a DID Document. We have begun to define this interoperability in the <a href="https://did-dht.com/registry/index.html#interoperable-did-methods">method’s registry</a>.</p>
<p>Another interesting opportunity for DID DHT is with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/WorkMode/">W3C DID working group</a>, which is currently going through a rechartering effort to focus on interoperability and DID Resolution. Depending on how the charter ends up, there could be an opportunity to promote the DID DHT method as one that is broadly interoperable, decentralized, and does not necessitate the use of a blockchain — a common critique of DIDs by community members in the past.</p>
<p>We have additional ideas such as associating human-readable names with DIDs, tying DIDs into trust and discoverability services, and supporting gossip between DID DHT gateways. We encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/did-dht-method/">join us on GitHub</a> to continue the discussion.</p>
 Looking Forward<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#looking-forward" title="Direct link to Looking Forward">​</a> 
<p>The introduction of DID DHT represents a significant milestone in our journey toward a more decentralized, accessible, and secure digital identity landscape. We believe DID DHT has the characteristics to make it widely useful, and widely adopted. <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did/">Try it out</a> for yourself, and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>As we continue to refine and expand its capabilities, we invite the community to join us in this endeavor, contributing insights, feedback, and innovations to shepard DID DHT toward becoming your default DID method.</p>

   This blog entry explores the insane world of non-human identity, a subject as complicated as the world’s many cloud computing environments. My journey from the early days of digital identity management to the revelations at IETF 119 serves as the backdrop, and I share what I’m learning based on those experiences.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>I’ve recently started to explore the world that is non-human identity. Coming out of <a href="https://youtu.be/zIadPdCQsJE?si=9S-KrcbOCYsM22tU">IETF 119</a>, where some of the best (and most terrifying) hallway conversations were about physical and software supply chains, I realized this was a space that didn’t look like what I’d experienced early in my digital identity career.</p>



<p>When I was first responsible for the group managing digital identity for a university, our issues with non-human identity centered around access cards. These were provisioned in the same system that provisioned employee badges: the HR system. Having entities that were not people in a people-driven system always involved annoying policy contortions. It was fitting a square peg in a round hole.</p>



<p>That kind of non-human identity has nothing to do with what I learned at IETF 119. Personally, I blame cloud computing.</p>



 Cloud Computing 



<p>Depending on the person you’re talking to, cloud computing is often seen as the answer to a company’s computing cost and efficiency problems. Rather than paying for a data center, equipment, network capacity, and all the staff that goes with it, the company can buy only the computing power it needs, and the rest magically disappears. IT staff tend to look at cloud computing another way: the same headaches, just more complicated to manage because they are on someone else’s computers.</p>



<p>However, cost and some dimensions of efficiency are the driving force behind business costs, and cloud computing has become even more attractive. Companies regularly purchase cloud computing services from a variety of vendors. A cloud here via Microsoft for Azure, a cloud there at Amazon Web Services for database computing, and another cloud there at Google for storage. It looks fantastic on paper (or at least on a monitor), but it’s introduced big identity problems as a result.</p>



 Authorization in the Cloud 



<p>Processes and APIs are not people. They don’t get hired and fired over the course of years like people do. They may never be associated with a person at all. And yet, they usually have a start and an end. They need to be constrained to access or accomplish only the specific things they are supposed to do. They may delegate specific tasks to other processes. They need authorization and access control at a speed and scale that makes human authorization look like a walk in the park.</p>



<p>If all authorizations happen in one environment, it’s not too bad. Everything gets their data from the same sources and in the format they expect. It might be like those old key cards managed via a people system, even when they aren’t themselves people, but it is a simple enough model.</p>



 Authorization in Many Clouds 



<p>However, if the authorization has to happen across environments, things get hairy. The format of the code may change. The source of truth may vary depending on where the process started. There may be hundreds, thousands, millions more of these processes and APIs than there are people in the company. And these processes are almost entirely independent of any human involvement.</p>



<p>This new kind of non-human identity operates in ways human identities don’t. Batch processing is a great example since the process does not necessarily act on behalf of a user. Training an AI model is batch processing that runs for a week and has no human involved. Batch transactions in the bank, such as payroll, run unsupervised and aren’t handled as a person. Furthermore, a human may be flagged by a computer’s security system as showing strange behavior when they are logging in from both Brisbane and Chicago simultaneously. An application, in all its glory, may suddenly expand to be in data centers around the world because it’s dealing with a Taylor Swift concert sale. What would be anomalous for a person is just another day in cloud computing.</p>



<p>Sorry, HR badge system, you’re just not suited for managing authorization here.</p>



 DevOps, IT Admins, and IAM Practitioners 



<p>Developing and deploying code in a cloud environment is generally in the hands of the DevOps and IT teams. DevOps traditionally move quickly to develop and manage the applications a company needs to deliver its products or services. IT teams deal with the applications that have been developed and deployed. The staff in these groups often specialize in one cloud computing environment or another; it’s not easy to be a generalist in this space.</p>



<p>DevOps is often the fastest in terms of getting new code in place, and the IT admin tries to deal with the symptoms of what’s been developed and deployed. Neither group tends to think in terms of identity management; most IAM teams are focused on people. This is a problem.</p>



<p>Identity administrators are beginning to understand there is an authorization problem, but solutions are sparse. DevOps teams also realize they have an identity problem (ask your favorite DevOps person how much fun it is to manage API permissions without leaking a password or private key). But the DevOps team is not going to the IAM people and say, “Create all these millions of identities and manage them for us, kthxbai.” For one thing, it wouldn’t occur to them. For another, the IAM staff would have a nervous breakdown.</p>



 Standards to the Rescue! 



<p>And here’s where the hallway conversations at IETF 119 enter the story. The whole reason I learned about the authorization-in-the-cloud problem was because of discussions around two working groups and an almost-working group:</p>



 
 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about/">Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (scitt)</a> 



 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/wimse/about/">Workload Identity in Multi System Environments (wimse)</a> 



 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spice/about/">Secure Patterns for Internet CrEdentials (spice)</a> 
 



 SCITT 



<p>The big picture here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain">software supply chain</a>. A software supply chain is the collection of components, libraries, tools, and processes used to develop, build, and publish software. Software is very rarely one monolithic thing. Instead, it’s made up of lots of different components. Some may be open-source libraries, and some may be proprietary to the company selling them.</p>



<p>Just like a physical bill of materials is required when importing or exporting physical goods, there is also a software bill of materials (SBOM) that is supposed to list all the components of a software package. Now, wouldn’t it be fantastic if, based on a computer-readable, standardized format of an SBOM, a computer could decide in real-time whether a particular software package was safe to run based on a quick check for any severe security vulnerabilities associated with any of the components listed in the SBOM?</p>



<p>It’s an entirely different way of looking at authorization, and that’s what scitt is working on.</p>



 WIMSE 



<p>Workload identity is a term that’s still struggling to find a common, industry-wide definition (not an unusual problem in the IAM space). I do like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain">Microsoft’s definition</a>, though: “an identity you assign to a software workload (such as an application, service, script, or container) to authenticate and access other services and resources.”</p>



<p>I mentioned earlier that there can be a ridiculous number of applications and services running across multiple cloud environments. DevOps gets to develop and deploy those, but IT admins need to keep track of all the signals from all the services to make sure everything is running as expected and uninfluenced by hackers. There needs to be a standardized format for the signals all these workloads will send, regardless of any particular cloud environment.</p>



<p>Enter WIMSE. WIMSE is focused on standardizing automated signals via all the workload components so that IT admins get an efficient view of what’s going on. To make it more challenging, these signals must be platform agnostic because no one is deploying single-platform environments.</p>



 SPICE 



<p>Sometimes, processes and APIs have nothing to do with humans. But sometimes, they do. They might run as a person in order to do something on that person’s behalf. In those cases, it would make life a lot easier to have a credential format that is lightweight enough to support the untold number of workload identities out there AND the human identities that might exist in the same complex ecosystem.</p>



<p>Here is where the proposed working group, spice, sits. Personally, I think it might have the hardest job of the three. While standardizing a common format makes a lot of sense, we can’t ignore that with human identities, issues like privacy, identity verification and proofing, and revocation are an incredibly big deal. Those same issues, however, either don’t apply or don’t apply in the same way for workload identities. If you insist on constraining the credential to be entirely human in its concerns, it’s too burdensome for the millions of apps and processes to handle at the speeds necessary. If you don’t constrain the credentials, security problems may creep in if the developers misuse the credentials.</p>



<p>So, of course, this is the group I volunteered to co-chair. I’m insane.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Non-human identity is identity at an unprecedented scale. It’s a whole new world because there are many more workload instances than users. The same tooling and standards for human identity are not designed to operate at this new scale or velocity.</p>



<p>I have a lot more to learn in this space, and one person I follow (literally, I will chase him down in hallways) who knows a LOT about this stuff is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieter-kasselman-0259862/">Pieter Kasselman</a> (Microsoft). He and several others are engaged within the IETF and the broader world to make sense of this complicated and anxiety-inducing space. If you work in IAM and you default to only thinking about the people in your organization, I’m afraid you need to start thinking much more broadly about your field. If you need a place to start, come to <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse 2024</a> or <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/120/">IETF 120</a> and hang out with me as we all learn about the non-human identity landscape.&nbsp;</p>

 Although Peru has a long-standing relationship with gambling and is one of a few South American countries to have allowed local and international companies to operate online casinos and betting sites, recent regulations have changed the game. Here’s what domestic and international operators need to know. 



 



<p>Hot on the heels of Colombia, Argentina (Buenos Aires, Mendoza and Córdoba), and, most recently, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a>, Peru has decided to introduce new regulations and gaming licenses for local and international operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to October 2023, although online gambling in Peru was permitted by the constitution, it operated within a rather relaxed regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Peruvian market has grown exponentially in the last few years and from the point of view of the customers, the operators and the government, it was mandatory to be on the regulated side of the industry. Recent changes will attract investors, generate an increase in government collection, protect players from responsible gaming and reduce illegal operators,” said Nicholas Osterling, Founder of Peru gaming platform, Playzonbet.</p>



 Brief history of gambling in Peru. 



<p>Peru’s gambling industry has undergone significant changes since it legalized land-based casinos in 1979. Key milestones over the past four decades have included tax regulations and ethical guidelines for casinos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online gambling regulations emerged later, with the first online casino license issued in 2008. Unlike other South American countries, Peru has never explicitly banned offshore or local online casinos, as long as they met the established domestic standards for any company. This relatively open market approach has attracted numerous international and local brands.</p>



 Clearing the regulatory path for operators. 



<p>MINCETUR is the national administrative authority in charge of regulating, implementing, and overseeing all aspects of online gaming and sports betting in Peru.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responsibilities include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Issuing licenses to qualified operators.<br>  Monitoring operator activities for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/">compliance</a> with regulations.<br>  Enforcing fines, sanctions, or criminal proceedings for non-compliance.<br>  Fostering a safe gambling environment especially for players.&nbsp;  



<p>Within MINCETUR, the Directorate General of Casino Games and Gaming Machines (DGJCMT) is an important executive body that is particularly instrumental in ensuring player protection, improving game quality, and enforcing regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2022, Peru passed Law No. 31557 and its amendment, Law No. 31806, which established a comprehensive legal framework for most gambling activities. These laws were further clarified in 2023 by <a href="https://img.lpderecho.pe/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Decreto-Supremo-005-2023-Mincetur-LPDerecho.pdf">Supreme Decree No. 005-2023</a>, which provided detailed regulations for online sports betting and other real-money gaming services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under these new regulations, international online casino operators must obtain a license from the DGJCMT to operate legally. The decree also outlines the process for obtaining and maintaining a license. Penalties for non-compliance include hefty fines and possible exclusion from the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MINCETUR set a pre-registration phase from February 13 – March 13 for domestic and international gambling operators already active in the market. During this phase, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">remote gaming</a> and sports betting operators, certification laboratories, and service providers could register their interest for preliminary consideration of their applications. Juan Carlos Mathews, Peru’s Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism, confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamesbras.com/english-version/2024/3/21/peru-receives-145-licence-applications-for-online-gambling-in-30-days-43638.html">145 requests had been received</a> from both national and international companies and for both casino and sports betting business units. Although this stage is now closed, newcomers to the Peru market can continue to apply.</p>

 Objectives of the new Peru gaming license. 



<p>The new Peru gambling license places safety and consumer protection at the forefront of its objectives. With a focus on ensuring a secure environment for players, promoting responsible gambling practices, and formalizing online gaming and sports betting activities, these regulations aim to create a robust and transparent framework for the Peruvian gambling industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, the Peruvian government is opting for a more simplified approach compared to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">complex structure of the Brazilian gambling license.</a></p>



 Secure gaming environment for consumers. 



<p>The regulations prioritize security by implementing measures to protect consumers. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/age-verification/">Age verification</a> requirements and participation restrictions ensure that only adults engage in gambling activities, while strict measures will be in place to prevent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and fraud, fostering a safe and secure environment for players. A <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> process must also be in place to verify the age, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;hsa_acc=5234001163&amp;hsa_cam=21059765194&amp;hsa_grp=&amp;hsa_ad=&amp;hsa_src=x&amp;hsa_tgt=&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1">identity, and nationality of players</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Promotion of responsible gaming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Peruvian regulations promote responsible gaming practices by encouraging operators to implement self-exclusion tools and support programs for players struggling with problem gambling. By raising awareness of the potential risks, the regulations aim to mitigate harm and promote responsible behavior within the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Preparing for compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the application process, certification laboratories, remote sports betting and gaming operators, and service providers will be asked to enter their details on the <a href="https://extranet.mincetur.gob.pe/extranet2/Home/Inicio">MINCETUR website</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the website is only available in Spanish, international operators are advised to devote the necessary resources to enter information correctly. Accurate information provided during pre-registration is critical to avoid delays and ensure the smooth processing of license applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must also ensure they have the necessary technical infrastructure in place, such as robust <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC checks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators who do not have a license or fail to comply will face:</p>



  Significant fines.<br>  Revocation of licenses.<br>  Potential criminal charges.  



 Fines for non-compliance in the Peru gambling market. 



<p>Operators who fail to obtain a license while continuing to offer remote gaming could face fines of up to 990,000 Sol, which amounts to approximately £207,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a licensee fails to verify the identity, age, and nationality of players as required by MINCETUR regulations, a fine of between 50-150 Peru tax units will be imposed, which amounts to between £53,500-160,600. It is therefore crucial for operators to implement solid KYC procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Article 243-C of the new law also imposes prison sentences of up to four years for those found to be operating online casino games or sports betting without a proper license.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operating in the Peruvian market without a license may result in exclusion from the market and possible prosecution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peru aims to generate more revenue from the new Peruvian gaming license by introducing a special gaming tax. The tax rate is set at 12% of the net profits from online gambling activities, to be paid by licensed operators, both domestic and foreign alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government estimates that the new regulations will generate tax revenues of approximately 162 million Sol (£33.9 million) per year, putting the total size of the Peru gambling market at around £1 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Full enforcement of the new regulations, including licensing requirements and potential penalties for non-compliance, began on April 1, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All companies, both domestic and foreign, operating in the Peruvian online gaming market must comply with the new regulations. Failure to obtain a license while continuing operations will result in fines, exclusions, and criminal charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be eligible for a Peruvian gambling license, operators must adhere to security protocols, implement KYC processes to verify player identity and age, and have sound responsible gaming policies in place. Provisions of around £1.2 million must also be in place to prevent money laundering and financial <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/fraud/">fraud</a>.</p>



 The future of gambling in Peru. 



<p>Implementing a licensing regime will obviously have an impact on the profitability of gaming operators in the market. However, the online gaming market in Peru is also expected <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/peru">to grow at a minimum rate of 6.4% per annum.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A regulated online gambling market ensures a clear legal framework for operators to conduct their business and reduces potential legal risks. Increased consumer confidence also leads to higher revenues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Peru is a very traditional market when it comes to sports betting. We Peruvians love soccer, and we are very passionate about betting. The industry here has had several years of growth and now that it will become a regulated market it will be even more attractive for vendors and operators that are only interested in these types of jurisdictions,” added Nicholas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a stable economy and a growing middle class among its 33 million inhabitants, Peru is considered one of the most attractive markets for international gaming operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Peru emerges as a key player in the Latin American gaming market, operators must quickly adapt to the new regulatory landscape to ensure sustainable growth and success in this dynamic industry.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p><p>When an organization uses a cloud service, it must make sure that it does this in a way that is secure and complies with their obligations. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides a broad set of integrated cloud security services to help its customers achieve these objectives. Oracle continuously innovates to improve these services and Oracle Cloud Guard has now been enhanced to provide a complete Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) for OCI.</p>
 Complementary User Entity Controls 
<p>To meet their security and compliance obligations when using OCI the tenant must implement the appropriate controls. The American Institute of CPAs® (AICPA)&nbsp;provides attestations of the security and compliance of cloud services. OCI has a Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 type 2 attestation that affirms that controls relevant to the&nbsp;AICPA Trust Services Security and Availability Principles&nbsp;are implemented effectively within OCI. This includes a consideration of the <a href="https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/au-c-00402.pdf">Complementary User Entity Controls</a> (CUECs) that the OCI tenant is expected to implement as well as the capabilities provided by OCI to support these.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Complementary User Entity Controls</p>
<p>OCI offers a full stack of cybersecurity capabilities to help the tenant prevent, protect, monitor, and mitigate cyber threats and control access and encrypt data.&nbsp; These include Oracle Cloud Guard that was first launched in 2020 and enhanced in 2022 to provide Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) for OCI. This detects misconfigurations, insecure activity, and threat activities and provides visibility to triage and resolve cloud security issues.</p>
<p>Oracle Cloud Guard CSPM, together with the other OCI security services, helps the OCI tenant to demonstrate how their CUECs meet their security and compliance objectives.</p>
 Oracle Cloud Guard for CSPM 
<p>Oracle Cloud Guard is an OCI service that helps OCI tenants to maintain a strong security posture on Oracle Cloud.&nbsp; The tenant can use the service to examine their OCI resources for security weakness related to their OCI configuration and monitor their OCI administrators for risky activities. When Cloud Guard detects weaknesses, it can identify appropriate corrective actions and assist in or automate implementing these.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: OCI CSPM Storage Bucket Risks Example</p>
<p>Cloud Guard detects security problems within a tenant OCI environment by ingesting activity and configuration data about their resources in each region, processing it based on detector rules, and correlating the problems at the reporting region level. Identified problems can be used to produce dashboards and metrics and may also trigger one or more inbuilt responders to help resolve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oracle Cloud Guard works together with Oracle Security Zones to provide an always-on security posture. With Security Zones&nbsp;and Cloud Guard the OCI tenant can define policy compliance requirements for groups of resources. Security Zones and Cloud Guard can then enforce these policies to automatically correct and log any violations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud Security Posture Management is a valuable tool for organizations to ensure that they use OCI in a secure and compliant manner. OCI provides a very comprehensive range of capabilities for the tenant to secure their use of the services.&nbsp; Oracle Cloud Guard CSPM is one of these and is backed by the expertise and experience of Oracle’s technical teams.&nbsp;</p>
 Cloud Guard for CNAPP 
<p>The distinctive feature of CNAPP is the integration of several capabilities that were previously offered as standalone products. These most often include Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) for identifying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in cloud infrastructures, Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP) that deal with runtime protection of workloads deployed in the cloud (such as virtual machines, containers, and Kubernetes, as well as databases and APIs), and Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) for centralized management of rights and permissions across (multi-) cloud environments. Cloud Service Network Security (CSNS) is sometimes included as well, combining such capabilities as web application firewalls, secure web gateways, and DDoS protection. OCI Security Services include many of these capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud Guard has provided CSPM capabilities since its launch in 2020.&nbsp; It has now been enhanced to offer further cloud native application security capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Log Insights Detector</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Log Insights Detector, which is not yet generally available, provides a flexible way to capture specific events from logs available in the OCI Logging service. It allows customers to mine all their logs, augmenting out of the box controls to cover all resources and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It continuously monitors audit, service, and custom logs from Oracle IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS across all subscribed regions, and can be used to detect malicious events that may indicate a threat or a risk that needs to be investigated based on user-defined queries. Data from all services (like VCN flow logs, Object Storage or WAF), the OCI event audit trail and custom application logs can be accessed in every region, and results be centralized for consolidated alerting.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3: OCI Log Insights Detector</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Instance Security</p>
<p>This provides controls to manage risks and exposures at the compute server, microservices instance / container level. It detects suspicious runtime activities within OCI VMs based on MITRE ATT&amp;CK and creates alerts in real time. It also monitors the integrity of critical system and application files. It comes with a range of predefined detection recipes, based on Oracle’s knowledge and OCI recommended best practices. These can be supplemented with ad hoc and custom scheduled queries.</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Container Security</p>
<p>Cloud-Native Applications are built using a microservices architecture based on containers. Microservices, containers, and Kubernetes have become synonymous with modern DevOps methodologies, continuous delivery, and deployment automation and are seen as a breakthrough in the way to develop and manage cloud-native applications and services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4: Examples of container related risks.</p>
<p>However, this approach brings new security challenges and attempts to repurpose existing security tools to protect containerized and microservice-based applications have proven to be inadequate due to their inability to adapt to the scale and ephemeral nature of containers. Static security products that focus on identifying vulnerabilities and malware in container images, while serving a useful purpose, do not address the full range of potential risks.</p>
<p>Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) is an OCI platform for running Kubernetes workloads. Oracle Cloud Guard has been extended to include Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) for OKE. This helps to protect the DevOps pipeline processes and containers throughout their lifecycle from security vulnerabilities.&nbsp; It includes out-of-the-box configuration policies based on Oracle best practices.&nbsp; The rules also align with industry accepted best practices like CIS benchmarks and regulatory frameworks like US FedRAMP.</p>
 From CSPM to CNAPP 
<p>Since its inception in 2020 Oracle Cloud Guard has enabled OCI tenants to measure their security posture for OCI. These new capabilities extend Cloud Guard beyond CSPM to proactively manage the security of cloud native applications developed and deployed in OCI. This supports Oracle’s vision to make OCI the best platform for enterprises to develop and deploy secure and compliant applications.&nbsp; Organizations using OCI should review these new capabilities and adopt them where appropriate.</p>

<p>Fission is winding down active operations. The team is wrapping things up and ending employment and contractor status by the end of May 2024.</p><p>Fission has been a venture investment funded company since 2019. Our last round, led by Protocol Labs, was raised as part of joining the Protocol Labs network as a “blue team”, focused on protocol research and implementation. The hypothesis was to get paid by the network, including in Filecoin FIL grants for alignment with the network.</p><p>In Q4 of 2023, it was clear that our hypothesis of getting paid directly for protocol research wasn’t going to work.</p><p>We did a round of lay offs and focused on productizing our compute stack, powered by the IPVM protocol, as the <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a>. The team has shipped this as a working decentralized, content-addressable compute system in the past 6 months.</p><p>Unfortunately, we have not been able to find further venture fundraising that is a match for us.</p> What about the projects that Fission works on? <p>The majority of Fission’s code is available under open source licenses. The protocols we’ve worked on have been developed in working groups, with a community of other collaborators, and have their home base in shared Github organizations:</p>  UCAN: capability-based decentralized auth using DIDs <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">https://github.com/ucan-wg</a>  WNFS: encrypted file system <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg">https://github.com/wnfs-wg</a>  IPVM: content-addressable compute <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">https://github.com/ipvm-wg</a>  <p>Various people on the team, as well as other people and organizations, continue to build on the open source code we’ve developed.</p><p>Fission does have active publishing and DNS infrastructure that we'll be winding down, and will be reaching out to people about timing for that.</p> Thanks <p>Thank you to everyone for your support, interest, and collaboration over the years. Many of us have been involved in protocols and open source implementations for a long time, and have seen them have impact far after they were first created. We're proud of the identity, data, and compute stack we developed, and hope to see them have continued growth across different ecosystems.</p><p><br></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-process-management">Business Process Management</a> (BPM) is a systematic approach to managing and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/blueworkslive">streamlining business processes</a>. BPM is intended to help improve the efficiency of existing processes, with the goal of increasing productivity and overall business performance.</p>



<p>BPM is often confused with other seemingly similar initiatives. For example, BPM is smaller in scale than <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-resource-planning">business process reengineering</a> (BPR), which radically overhauls or replaces processes. Conversely, it has a larger scope than task management, which deals with individual tasks, and project management, which handles one-time initiatives. And while <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-resource-planning">enterprise resource planning</a> (ERP) integrates and manages all aspects of a business, BPM focuses on its individual functions—optimizing the organization’s existing, repeatable processes end-to-end.</p>



<p>An effective BPM project employs structured processes, uses appropriate technologies and fosters collaboration among team members. It enables organizations to streamline project workflows, enhance productivity and consistently deliver value to stakeholders. Ultimately, the successful implementation of BPM tools can lead to increased customer satisfaction, competitive advantage and improved business outcomes.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-50839">Get the COO’s Pocket Guide to Enterprise-wide Intelligent Automation</a>



 3 main types of business process management 



<p>Integration-centric BPM focuses on processes that don’t require much human involvement. These include connecting different systems and software to streamline processes and improve data flow across the organization, for example <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/human-capital-management">human resource management</a> (HRM) or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/crm">customer relationship management</a> (CRM)</p>



<p>Human-centric BPM centers around human involvement, often where an approval process is required. Human-centric BPM prioritizes the designing of intuitive processes with drag and drop features that are easy for people to use and understand, aiming to enhance productivity and collaboration among employees.</p>



<p>Document-centric BPM is for efficiently managing documents and content—such as contracts—within processes. A purchasing agreement between a client and vendor, for example, needs to evolve and go through different rounds of approval and be organized, accessible and compliant with regulations.</p>



 Business process management examples 



<p>BPM can help improve overall business operations by optimizing various business processes. Here are some BPM examples that outline the use cases and benefits of BPM methodology:</p>



 Business strategy 



<p>BPM serves as a strategic tool for aligning business processes with organizational goals and objectives. By connecting workflow management, centralizing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-management">data management</a>, and fostering collaboration and communication, BPM enables organizations to remain competitive by providing access to accurate and timely data. This ensures that strategic decisions are based on reliable insights.</p>



<p>Through BPM, disparate data sources—including spend data, internal performance metrics and external market research—can be connected. This can uncover internal process improvements, strategic partnership opportunities and potential cost-saving initiatives. BPM also provides the foundation for making refinements and enhancements that lead to continuous improvement.</p>



<p>Benefits:</p>



 
 Enhanced decision-making 



 Efficient optimization 



 Continuous improvement 
 



 Claims management

 Business process management examples: Case studies 



 Improving procure-to-pay in state government 



<p>In 2020, one of America’s largest state governments found itself <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/state-gov-process-mining">in search of a new process analysis solution</a>. The state had integrated a second management system into its procurement process, which required the two systems, SAP SRM and SAP ECC, to exchange data in real time. With no way to analyze the collected data, the state couldn’t monitor the impact of its newly integrated SAP SRM system, nor detect deviations during the procurement process. This created an expensive problem.</p>



<p>The state used <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/process-mining">IBM Process Mining</a> to map out its current workflow and track the progress of the SAP SRM system integration. Using the software’s discovery tool, data from both management systems was optimized to create a single, comprehensive process model. With the end-to-end process mapped out, the state was able to monitor all its process activities and review the performance of specific agencies.</p>

 The cloud represents a strategic tool to enable digital transformation for financial institutions 



<p>As the banking and other regulated industry continues to shift toward a digital-first approach, financial entities are eager to use the benefits of digital disruption. Lots of innovation is happening, with new technologies emerging in areas such as data and AI, payments, cybersecurity and risk management, to name a few. Most of these new technologies are born-in-cloud. Banks want to tap into these new innovations. This shift is a significant change in their business models, moving from a capital expenditure approach to an operational expenditure approach, allowing financial organizations to focus on their primary business. However, the transformation from traditional on-prem environments to a public cloud PaaS or SaaS model presents significant cybersecurity, risk, and regulatory concerns that continue to impede progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Balancing innovation, compliance, risk and market dynamics is a challenge&nbsp; 



<p>While many organizations recognize the vast pool of innovations that public cloud platforms offer, financially regulated clients remain accustomed to the level of control and visibility provided by on-prem environments. Despite the potential benefits, cybersecurity remains the primary concern with public cloud adoption. The average cost of any mega-breach is an astonishing $400 plus million, with misconfigured cloud as a leading attack vector.&nbsp;This leaves many organizations hesitant to make the transition, fearing they will lose the control and security they have with their on-prem environments. The banking industry’s continued shift toward a digital-first approach is encouraging. However, financial organizations must carefully consider the risks that are associated with public cloud adoption and ensure that they have the proper security measures in place before making the transition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The traditional approach for banks and ISV application onboarding involves a review process, which consists of several key items like the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 A third-party architecture review, where the ISV needs to have an architecture document describing how they are deploying into the cloud and how it is secure.&nbsp; 



 A third-party risk management review, where the ISV needs to describe how it is complying to required controls.&nbsp; 



 A third-party investment review, where the ISV provides a bill of material showing what and how services are being used to meet compliance requirements, along with price points.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The ISV is expected to be prepared for all these reviews and the overall onboarding lifecycle through this process takes more than 24 months today.</p>



 Why a FS Cloud and FS Validation Program?&nbsp; 



<p>IBM has created the solution for this problem with its Financial Services Cloud offering, and its ISV Financial Services validation program, which is designed to de-risk the partner ecosystem for clients. This help accelerating continuous integration and continuous delivery on the cloud. This program ensures that the new innovations coming out of these ISVs are validated, tested, and ready to be deployed in a secure and compliant manner. With IBM’s ISV Validation program, banks can confidently adopt new innovative offerings on cloud and stay ahead in the innovation race.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ensuring that the success of a cloud transformation journey requires a combination of modern governance, standard control framework, and automation. There are different industry frameworks available to secure and provide compliance posture. Continuous compliance that is aligned to an industry framework, informed by an industry coalition that is composed of representation from key banks worldwide and other compliance bodies, is essential. IBM Cloud Framework for Financial services is uniquely positioned for that, meeting all these requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Cloud for Financial Services® is a secure cloud platform that is designed to reduce risk for clients by providing a high level of visibility, control, regulatory compliance, and the best-of-breed security. It allows financial institutions to accelerate innovation, unlock new revenue opportunities, and reduce compliance costs by providing access to pre-validated partners and solutions that conform to financial services security and controls. The platform also offers risk management and compliance automation, continuous monitoring, and audit reporting capabilities, as well as on-demand visibility for clients, auditors, and regulators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our mission is to help ISVs adapt to the cloud and SaaS models and prepare ISVs to meet the security standards and compliance requirements necessary to do business with financial institutions on cloud. Our process brings the compliance and onboarding cycle time down to less than 6 months, a significant improvement.

<p>The platform provides a catalog of self-paced courses that help you become familiar with the processes and tools that are used during the IBM Cloud for Financial Services onboarding and validation. The self-paced format allows you to learn at your own pace and on your own schedule.&nbsp;</p>



 ISV Controls analysis 



<p>The ISV Controls Analysis serves as an initial assessment of an organization’s security and risk posture, laying the groundwork for IBM to plan the necessary onboarding activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Architecture assessment 



<p>An architecture assessment evaluates the architecture of an ISV’s cloud environment. The assessment is designed to help ISVs identify gaps in their cloud architecture and recommend best practices to enhance the compliance and governance of their cloud environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Deployment planning 



<p>Deployment of ISV application in a secure environment and manage their workloads on IBM Cloud®. This step is designed to meet the security and compliance requirements of organizations. Providing a comprehensive set of security controls and services to help protect customer data and applications, meeting the suitable secure architecture requirements.&nbsp;</p>



 Security Assessment 



<p>The security assessment is a process of evaluating the security controls of the proposed business processes against a set of enhanced, industry-specific, control requirements in the IBM Cloud for Financial Services Framework. The process helps to identify vulnerabilities, threats, and risks that might compromise the security of a system and allows for the implementation of appropriate security measures to address those issues.&nbsp;</p>



 Professional guidance by IBM and KPMG teams

<p>In the world of identity management, the struggle is real. Identity management involves controlling and managing user identities, access rights, and privileges within an organization. At YeshID, we’ve seen it all: from Google App Scripts built inside Sheets to Notion databases, full of outdated and fragmented documentation. We’ve seen people who have unexpectedly inherited the identity management job and people spending all their time reacting to HR onboarding and offboarding surprises. We’ve seen managed service providers with creative solutions that too often fall short. And we’ve seen IAM vendors overpromising integration and seamless system management and delivering upgrade prices and uncontrolled manual processes.</p>
<p>It’s like a tangled web of issues that can leave you feeling trapped and overwhelmed. The result? A complex set of challenges that can hinder productivity, security, and growth:</p>
 
 Workflow Issues
 
 Redundant Workflows: You have workflows dedicated to verifying automation, manually handling unautomatable tasks, and fine-tuning access in each app, including sending requests and reminders to app owners and the time-consuming quarterly access reviews. 
 Workflow Dependencies: Intertwined workflows make it hard to untangle them, leading to a domino effect when changes are made. 
 Bottlenecks and Delays: Manual steps and the need to chase approvals slow down processes, causing frustration and reduced efficiency. 
 
 
 Data Management and Accuracy
 
 Data Inconsistency: Manual intervention and multiple workflows increase the likelihood of data inconsistencies, such as discrepancies in user information across different systems, leading to confusion and potential security risks. 
 Email Address Standardization: Maintaining a consistent email address format (e.g., firstName.lastName@) can help with organization, but ensuring conventions are followed can be complex, especially as the organization grows.. 
 
 
 Security
 
 Secure Access: Enforcing secure access practices is non-negotiable, but it’s an uphill battle, including:
 
 MFA: Multi-Factor Authentication adds protection against compromised credentials, but getting everyone to comply can be a challenge. 
 Secure Recovery Paths: Ensuring account recovery methods aren’t easily exploitable is crucial, but often overlooked, leaving potential gaps in security.. 
 Principle of Least Privilege: Limiting user permissions to only what’s necessary for their roles is a best practice, but permissions can creep up over time, leading to excessive access rights and failing compliance audits. 
 Regular Updates and Patching: Keeping systems updated and patched is essential to address vulnerabilities and maintain a secure environment. 
 
 
 
 
 Compliance
 
 Compliance Concerns: Meticulously designing workflows to collect evidence that satisfies compliance and regulatory requirements is time-consuming and often confusing. 
 
 
 Operational and Growth Challenges
 
 Knowledge Silos: Manual processes mean knowledge is held by a few individuals, creating vulnerabilities and making it hard for others to step in when needed, hindering business continuity. 
 Audit Difficulties: A mix of automated and manual workflows without proper documentation makes audits challenging and prone to errors, increasing the risk of non-compliance. 
 Difficulty Scaling: As the organization grows, the complexity of fragmented processes hinders growth potential, making it difficult to onboard new employees and manage access rights efficiently. 
 Complex Offboarding: Workflows must ensure proper, gradual account removal to balance security, archiving, business continuity, and legal compliance concerns. 
 Mandatory Training: Tracking mandatory training like security awareness within the first month of employment is an ongoing struggle. 
 Group and OU Assignments: Correctly placing users in groups and organizational units is key for managing permissions, but automating this requires careful alignment between automation rules and the company’s organizational structure, which can be challenging to maintain. 
 
 
 
 Recommendations: Untangling the Web 
<p>YeshID’s YeshList gives you a way to untangle the process web organizing centrally, distributing the workload, and coordinating actions.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Implement Company-Wide Accountability
 
 Establish a regular cadence for an access review campaign to ensure permissions are regularly reviewed and updated. 
 Create a simple form for managers to review access for their team members, making it easy for them to participate in the process. 
 Use a ticketing system or workflow tool to track requests and ensure accountability, providing visibility into the status of each request. 
 
 
 Embrace Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
 
 Design granular roles based on common job functions to streamline access granting, reducing the need for individual access requests. 
 Track roles in a spreadsheet, including Role Name, Description, Permissions Included, and Role Owner, to maintain a clear overview of available roles and their associated permissions. 
 Upgrade to Google Groups for decentralized role ownership, employee-initiated join requests, and automation possibilities, empowering teams to manage their own access needs. 
 Use RBAC to speed up audits by shifting focus from individual permissions to role appropriateness, simplifying the audit process. 
 Tool Examples: Google Workspace allows custom roles, but other identity management solutions may offer more robust RBAC capabilities. 
 
 
 Conduct Regular Application-Level Access Reviews
 
 Periodically review user access within each critical application to close potential security gaps and ensure that access rights align with job requirements. 
 Restrict access to applications using your company’s domain to improve security and prevent unauthorized access from external accounts. 
 Utilize tools like Steampipe or CloudQuery to automate the integration of application access lists with your employee directory, enabling regular comparisons and alerts for discrepancies, saving time and reducing manual effort. 
 
 
 Invest in Centralized Workflow Management
 
 Consolidate Workflows: Map existing processes, find overlaps, and merge them within a centralized tool. 
 Prioritize High-Impact Automation First: Target repetitive, time-consuming tasks to get the most value. 
 
 
 Prioritize Data Standardization and Integrity
 
 Define clear rules for email addresses, naming, and data entry, and enforce them during account creation to maintain data consistency across systems. 
 Implement input validation to catch inconsistencies early, preventing data quality issues from propagating throughout the organization. 
 Schedule data hygiene checks to identify and correct discrepancies between systems. 
 Use a tool or script for account creation to ensure consistency. 
 
 
 Strengthen Security with Key Enhancements
 
 Mandate MFA for all accounts. 
 Review Recovery Methods: Favor authenticator apps or hardware keys over less secure methods. 
 Regularly review user access levels and enforce least privilege principles. 
 Use your company’s Identity Provider (IdP) for authentication whenever possible to centralize access control and simplify user management. 
 
 
 Make Compliance a Focus, Not an Afterthought
 
 Document Workflows Thoroughly: Include decision points and rationale for auditing purposes. 
 Build requirements for proof of compliance directly into your automated workflows. 
 
 
 Tackle Operational Challenges Head-On
 
 Reduce errors with in-workflow guidance, providing clear instructions and prompts to guide users through complex processes. 
 Cross-train IT team members to reduce single points of failure. 
 Develop templates for recurring processes to streamline efforts and ensure consistency. 
 
 
 Democratize Identity Management
 
 Empower employees and managers to resolve access requests whenever possible through:
 
 Automated Approval Workflows: Set up workflows with pre-defined rules to grant access based on criteria. 
 Manager Approvals: Delegate access request approvals to direct managers for their teams. 
 Self-Service Access Management: Consider a self-service portal for employees to request and manage basic access needs. 
 Empowered Employees and Managers: Enable employees and managers to add or remove employee accounts for specific apps as needed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Light at the End of the Tunnel 
<p>As you evaluate solutions, keep these factors in mind:</p>
 
 Cost-Effectiveness: Prioritize solutions with free tiers or flexible pricing models.

<p>Part 2 of this four-part series discusses the complex tasks energy utility companies face as they shift to holistic grid asset management to manage through the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/guides/business-operations/sustainably-accelerating-decarbonization/">energy transition</a>. The <a href="https://ibm.com/blog/holistic-asset-management-for-utility-network-companies/">first post of this series</a> addressed the challenges of the energy transition with holistic grid asset management. In this part, we discuss the integrated asset management platform and data exchange that unite business disciplines in different domains in one network.</p>



 The asset management ecosystem 



<p>The asset management network is complex. No single system can manage all the required information views to enable end-to-end optimization. The following figure demonstrates how a platform approach can integrate data flows.</p>







<p>Asset data is the basis for the network. Enterprise asset management (EAM) systems, geographic information systems and enterprise resource planning systems share technical, geographic and financial asset data, each with their respective primary data responsibility. The EAM system is the center for maintenance planning and execution via work orders. The maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) system provides necessary spare parts to carry out work and maintains an optimum stock level with a balance of stock out risk and part holding costs.</p>



<p>The health, safety and environment (HSE) system manages work permits for safe work execution and tracks and investigates incidents. The process safety management (PSM) system controls hazardous operations through safety practices, uses bow-tie analysis to define and monitor risk barriers, and manages safety and environmental critical elements (SECE) to prevent primary containment loss. Monitoring energy efficiency and greenhouse gas or fugitive emissions can directly contribute to environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting, helping to manage and reduce the carbon footprint.</p>



<p>Asset performance management (APM) strategy defines the balance between proactive and reactive maintenance tasks. Asset criticality defines whether a preventive or predictive task is justified in terms of cost and risk. The process of defining the optimum maintenance strategy is called reliability-centered maintenance. The mechanical integrity of hazardous process assets, such as vessels, reactors or pipelines, requires a deeper approach to define the optimum risk-based inspection intervals. For process safety devices, a safety instrumented system approach determines the test frequency and safety integrity level for alarm functions.</p>



<p>Asset data APM collects real-time process data. Asset health monitoring&nbsp; and predictive maintenance&nbsp; functions receive data via distributed control systems or supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA). Asset health monitoring defines asset health indexes to rank the asset conditions based on degradation models, failures, overdue preventive work and any other relevant parameters that reflect the health of the assets. Predict functionality builds predictive models to predict imminent failures and calculate assets’ remaining useful life. These models often incorporate machine learning and AI algorithms to detect the onset of degradation mechanisms in an early stage.</p>



<p>In the asset performance management and optimization (APMO) domain, the team collects and prioritizes asset needs resulting from asset strategies based on asset criticality. They optimize maintenance and replacement planning against the constraints of available budget and resource capacity. This method is useful for regulated industries such as energy transmission and distribution, as it allows companies to remain within the assigned budget for an arbitrage period of several years. The asset replacement requirements enter the asset investment planning (AIP) process, combining with new asset requests and expansion or upgrade projects. Market drivers, regulatory requirements, sustainability goals and resource constraints define the project portfolio and priorities for execution. The project portfolio management function manages the project management aspects of new build and replacement projects to stay within budget and on time. Product lifecycle management covers the stage-gated engineering process to optimize the design of the assets against the lowest total cost of ownership within the boundaries of all other stakeholders.</p>



<p>An industry-standard data model</p>



<p>A uniform data model is necessary to get a full view of combined systems with information flowing across the ecosystem. Technical, financial, geographical, operational and transactional data attributes are all parts of a data structure. In the utilities industry, the common information model offers a useful framework to integrate and orchestrate the ecosystem to generate optimum business value.</p>



<p>The integration of diverse asset management disciplines in one provides a full 360° view of assets. This integration allows companies to target the full range of business objectives and track performance across the lifecycle and against each stakeholder goal.</p>

<p>The popularity of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/private-cloud">private cloud</a> is growing, primarily driven by the need for greater <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">data security</a>.&nbsp;Across industries like education, retail and government, organizations are choosing private cloud settings to conduct business use cases involving workloads with sensitive information and to comply with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-privacy">data privacy</a> and compliance needs.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technavio.com/report/private-cloud-services-market-industry-analysis">report from Technavio</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside ibm.com), the private cloud services market size is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 26.71% between 2023 and 2028, and it is forecast to increase by USD 619.08 billion.</p>



<p>The need for private cloud settings is also closely linked to a hybrid cloud approach—the integration of on-premises, private cloud and public cloud into a single, flexible IT infrastructure—which is an essential part of the enterprise-business digital transformation journey. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/image/IBM%2BTransformation%2BIndex%2B-%2BState%2Bof%2BCloud.pdf">IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud</a>&nbsp;report, 71% of business executives&nbsp;surveyed agree it’s challenging to realize the full potential of a digital transformation without a solid hybrid cloud strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To determine how a private cloud can bring business value to their organization, business and IT leaders need to review its advantages and disadvantages.</p>



 What is private cloud?&nbsp; 



<p>Before we examine the pros and cons of a private cloud, here’s a rundown of its essential features and basic cloud architecture components.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;private cloud&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a>&nbsp;environment where all resources are isolated and operated exclusively for one organization. It may be hosted in-house within a company’s physical location, in an off-site&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a>&nbsp;on infrastructure owned or rented by a third party, or in a public cloud service provider’s (CSP’s) infrastructure in one of their data centers.</p>



<p>Private cloud combines the main benefits of cloud computing—chiefly on-demand access to computing resources (e.g., cloud servers,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-storage">data storage</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking">networking</a>&nbsp;capabilities, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a>, software, data analytic tools)—with the security and control of on-premises IT infrastructure.</p>



<p>An organization can maintain sole responsibility for operating a private cloud, including its maintenance and overall management. Most companies, however, choose to outsource some or all of their private cloud management to a third-party provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud or Microsoft Azure.</p>



 Four types of private clouds 



<p>There are four main types of private clouds from which to choose:</p>



<p>1. On-premises private cloud:&nbsp;An on-premises private cloud is hosted within a company’s on-site data center and managed by its IT team. In an on-premises private cloud, an organization is responsible for buying and maintaining all hardware, software, security features, other infrastructure and so forth.</p>



<p>2. Virtual private cloud:&nbsp;A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vpc">virtual private cloud</a>&nbsp;(VPC) provides an isolated private-cloud environment within a public cloud. A VPC allows organizations to run code, host websites, and more in a secure setting with shared CSP resources.</p>



<p>3. Hosted private cloud (also referred to as private cloud hosting):&nbsp;A hosted private cloud is run off-premises on a CSP’s servers. It differs from a VPC in that it is an environment with dedicated servers (also called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/bare-metal-dedicated-servers">bare metal servers</a>) used by a single organization. In a hosted private cloud, the cloud provider owns and manages resources like cloud storage maintenance, upgrades and security management tools.</p>



<p>4. Managed private cloud:&nbsp;A managed private cloud consists of physical hardware usually hosted in a service provider’s data center. However, CSPs also offer management services for private cloud infrastructure hosted in an enterprise’s data center. In this setting, the CSP carries out maintenance, upgrades, support and management.</p>



 Public vs. private vs. hybrid cloud&nbsp; 



<p>In addition to private cloud computing, there are two other main cloud computing models: private cloud and hybrid cloud.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/public-cloud">public cloud</a>&nbsp;setting, IT infrastructure is offered as virtual resources over the internet on a pay-per-use or subscription-based pricing model. The public cloud provider owns, manages and assumes all responsibility for the data centers, hardware and infrastructure on which its customers’ workloads run, providing high-bandwidth network connectivity to ensure high performance and rapid access to applications and data.</p>



<p>Unlike the single-tenant architecture of a private cloud, a public cloud provides a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-tenant">multi-tenant</a>&nbsp;setting that enables multiple clouds&nbsp;to efficiently share scalable computing resources (e.g., hardware, storage, networking devices) accessed through a user-friendly interface.</p>



<p>In a public cloud, each tenant’s data is logically separated and isolated from data related to other tenants. In comparison, private clouds offer a heightened layer of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">cloud security</a>&nbsp;through network firewalls, access controls, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">data encryption</a> and authentication methods like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/identity-access-management#:">identity and access management (IAM)</a> tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, most large enterprise businesses choose a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a>&nbsp;approach that combines on-premises, private cloud, public cloud and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">edge&nbsp;</a>settings. Today enterprise organizations merge hybrid cloud with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">multicloud</a>—the use of services from more than one cloud provider to avoid vendor lock-in and select best-in-class offerings from different cloud vendors.</p>



<p>For a more in-depth look at these types of cloud deployment models, read our blog post, “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/public-cloud-vs-private-cloud-vs-hybrid-cloud/">Private cloud vs. public cloud vs. hybrid cloud: What’s the difference?”</a></p>



 Virtualization and other underlying cloud technologies&nbsp; 



<p>Public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud all rely on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtualization">virtualization</a> technology, which is at the heart of cloud computing and enterprise IT architecture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Virtualization uses software called a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hypervisors#:">hypervisor</a> to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware, enabling the division of a single computer’s hardware components—such as processors, memory and storage—into multiple&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a>.</p>



<p>In public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud settings, automation tools run on top of virtual environments and perform tasks like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">container orchestration</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/provisioning#:~">provisioning</a>&nbsp;of resources for workload deployments and updates,&nbsp;performance monitoring, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/disaster-recovery#:~">disaster recovery</a> and more. Administrators control and manage their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/disaster-recovery">IT infrastructure</a> using management software tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">APIs</a>.</p>



 Cloud services: IaaS, PaaS and SaaS 



<p>Private, public and hybrid clouds can all run the following cloud computing services:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas">IaaS, or Infrastructure-as-a-Service</a>, is on-demand access to cloud-hosted IT infrastructure for running applications and workloads in the cloud. IaaS allows organizations to scale and shrink infrastructure resources as needed, providing the capacity to handle spiky workloads.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas">PaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service</a>, is on-demand access to a full-service cloud platform for developing, running and managing applications without the cost, complexity and inflexibility that often come with building and maintaining that platform on-premises.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">SaaS, or Software-as-a-Service</a>, is on-demand access to ready-to-use software apps (e.g., Adobe Creative Suite, Slack). SaaS offloads all software development and infrastructure management to the cloud service provider, including maintaining the server hardware and software, managing user access and security, storing and managing data, implementing upgrades and more.</p>



 The advantages of private cloud 



<p>A private cloud offers organizations a range of business advantages, including the following:</p>



 
 Control:&nbsp;A private cloud&nbsp;offers an organization full control over its environment, including choices regarding hardware, software apps and different levels of security, while also providing many benefits of cloud computing (e.g., on-demand access to cloud resources, elasticity, scalability and ease of service delivery). 



 Greater control and visibility:&nbsp;A private cloud offers organizations greater control and visibility by storing data and workloads behind private firewalls.&nbsp; 



 Customization:&nbsp;Private clouds allow businesses to customize their hardware and software as needed. For instance, IT teams can tailor specific data storage and backup needs, boosting overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness. 



 Enhanced security:&nbsp;In general,&nbsp;private clouds are designed with more significant layers of security than public clouds. For instance, private clouds are highly sought after by companies in industries like government and finance where sensitive data like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii">personally identifiable information (PII)</a> must be protected from unauthorized users or bad actors. Private cloud security measures include firewall configurations, virtual private networks (VPNs), data encryption, authorization mechanisms and more to help reduce&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-breach">data breaches</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">cyberattacks.</a>&nbsp;Private clouds also typically include enhanced physical security measures like surveillance cameras and security personnel. 



 Regulatory compliance:&nbsp;Businesses can tailor a private cloud to meet compliance requirements and regulatory standards. This capability is crucial for highly regulated businesses, as they must adhere to data privacy and data sovereignty laws like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/power-systems-vs?topic=compliance-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> for companies operating in the EU and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) for healthcare in the US. 



 Predictable, stable costs:&nbsp;Private cloud costs are generally steady and predictable since resources are allocated to meet specific needs, which can translate into cost savings. This is in comparison to public cloud costs, which can be unpredictable based on usage, new services, data egress fees and more. 



 Improved performance:&nbsp;When resources are in high demand, problems like outages, downtime or bottlenecks can occur. A private cloud can optimize performance by isolating workloads on dedicated servers. This capability eliminates “noisy neighbor” issues like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency">latency</a> and other performance interference that can occur in multi-tenant public cloud environments.&nbsp; 



 Modernizing legacy applications:&nbsp;The control provided by a private cloud enables more seamless integration of existing systems. For instance, a private cloud supports&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">application modernization</a>, the transformation of monolithic legacy applications into cloud applications built on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a> architecture, which supports <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> methodologies. 
 



 Private cloud disadvantages 



<p>While private cloud has many advantages, particularly for organizations that seek heightened control and security measures, it does have some disadvantages that are important to consider:</p>



 
 High initial costs and setup:&nbsp;Private clouds come with high startup (initial Capex) expenses related to building, operating and managing on-premises hardware and infrastructure. Moreover, private cloud deployments require high levels of technical expertise. This disadvantage requires organizations to train or hire more IT staff for building, operating and managing private cloud infrastructure. 



 Complex, ongoing maintenance:&nbsp;A private cloud can be difficult for organizations to maintain on its own due to tasks like performance monitoring, software patching and planning updates. Thus, many organizations opt for a certain level of private cloud-managed services from a CSP to carry out smooth operational maintenance and reduce maintenance costs. 



 Lower scalability: Because private clouds are restricted by a limited amount of on-premises resources, they are usually less scalable than public clouds, which offer practically unlimited scalability.&nbsp;Scaling up in a private cloud requires the purchase of more and more hardware and software. However, this disadvantage can be overcome in a hybrid cloud setting through cloud bursting—the scaling of public cloud resources to run workloads when on-premises or private cloud data resources reach peak capacity.&nbsp; 



 Limited mobile access:&nbsp;Because of its multiple security features, a private cloud can limit mobile user access, which can be a drawback for organizations seeking this capability. 
 



 IBM and private cloud 



<p>As a leader in hybrid multicloud solutions, IBM is helping clients optimize private cloud solutions to meet their business needs, whether that means leveraging technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai">generative AI</a> to help automate IT, modernizing applications for improved ROI, or building <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native#:">cloud-native</a> applications and managing them at scale.</p>



<p>IBM Power Private Cloud Edition provides cost-effective bundles of compelling software offerings that enable seamless deployment and management of private clouds, simplify security and compliance management, and ensure high availability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s rapidly changing landscape, delivering higher-quality products to the market faster is essential for success. Many industries rely on high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve this goal. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Enterprises are increasingly turning to generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) to drive operational efficiencies, accelerate business decisions and foster growth. We believe that the convergence of both <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloud/blogs/john-easton/2024/03/25/working-together-ai-hpc-can-solve-large-complex-ch?CommunityKey=74d589b7-7276-4d70-acf5-0fc26430c6c0">HPC and artificial intelligence</a> (AI) is key for enterprises to remain competitive. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These innovative technologies complement each other, enabling organizations to benefit from their unique values. For example, HPC offers high levels of computational power and scalability, crucial for running performance-intensive workloads. Similarly, AI enables organizations to process workloads more efficiently and intelligently. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the era of gen AI and hybrid cloud, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/high-performance-computing">IBM Cloud® HPC</a> brings the computing power organizations need to thrive. As an integrated solution across critical components of computing, network, storage and security, the platform aims to assist enterprises in addressing regulatory and efficiency demands.&nbsp;</p>



 How AI and HPC deliver results faster: Industry use cases 



<p>At the very heart of this lies data, which helps enterprises gain valuable insights to accelerate transformation. With data nearly everywhere, organizations often&nbsp;possess an existing repository acquired from running traditional HPC simulation and modeling workloads. These repositories can draw from a multitude of sources. By using these sources, organizations can apply <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloud/blogs/john-easton/2024/03/25/working-together-ai-hpc-can-solve-large-complex-ch?CommunityKey=74d589b7-7276-4d70-acf5-0fc26430c6c0%22%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloud/blogs/john-easton/2024/03/25/working-together-ai-hpc-can-solve-large-complex-ch?CommunityKey=74d589b7-7276-4d70-acf5-0fc26430c6c0">HPC and AI</a> to the same challenges, enabling them to generate deeper, more valuable insights that drive innovation faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI-guided HPC applies AI to streamline simulations, known as intelligent simulation. In the automotive industry, intelligent simulation speeds up innovation in new models. As vehicle and component designs often evolve from previous iterations, the modeling process undergoes significant changes to optimize qualities like aerodynamics, noise and vibration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With millions of potential changes, assessing these qualities across different conditions, such as road types, can greatly extend the time to deliver new models. However, in today’s market, consumers demand rapid releases of new models. Prolonged development cycles might harm automotive manufacturers’ sales and customer loyalty. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Automotive manufacturers, having a wealth of data related to existing designs, can use these large bodies of data to train AI models. This enables them to identify the best areas for vehicle optimization, thereby reducing the problem space and focusing traditional HPC methods on more targeted areas of the design. Ultimately, this approach can help to produce a better-quality product in a shorter amount of time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In electronic design automation (EDA), AI and HPC drive innovation. In today’s rapidly changing semiconductor landscape, billions of verification tests must validate chip designs. However, if an error occurs during the validation process, it is impractical to re-run the entire set of verification tests due to the resources and time required. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For EDA companies, using AI-infused HPC methods is important for identifying the tests that need to be re-run. This can save a significant amount of compute cycles and help keep manufacturing timelines on track, ultimately enabling the company to deliver semiconductors to customers more quickly. &nbsp;</p>



 How IBM helps support HPC and AI compute-intensive workloads 



<p>IBM designs infrastructure to deliver the flexibility and scalability necessary to support HPC and compute-intensive workloads like AI. For example, managing the vast volumes of data involved in modern, high-fidelity HPC simulations, modeling and AI model training can be critical, requiring a high-performance storage solution. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/storage-scale">IBM Storage Scale</a> is designed as a high-performance, highly available distributed file and object storage system capable of responding to the most demanding applications that read or write large amounts of data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As organizations aim to scale their AI workloads, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700076341632478&amp;p5=e&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwn7mwBhCiARIsAGoxjaLoMdZiZvIK_q6qzLKq-J60f2HlEDCKuQHEBxWSLsqD3lueWGOcPMgaAg40EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM watsonx™</a> on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/gpu">IBM Cloud®</a> helps enterprises to train, validate, tune and deploy AI models while scaling workloads. Also, IBM offers graphics processing unit (<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/How-IBM-is-Helping-Clients-Deploy-Foundation-Models-and-AI-Workloads-with-New-GPU-Offering-on-IBM-Cloud">GPU</a>) options with NVIDIA GPUs on IBM Cloud, providing innovative GPU infrastructure for enterprise AI workloads. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s important to note that managing GPUs remains necessary. Workload schedulers such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/hpc-workload-management">IBM Spectrum® LSF®</a> efficiently manage job flow to GPUs, while <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/analytics-workload-management">IBM Spectrum Symphony®, a </a>&nbsp;low-latency, high-performance scheduler designed for the financial services industry’s risk analytics workloads, also supports GPU tasks. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding GPUs, various industries requiring intensive computing power use them. For example, financial services organizations employ Monte Carlo methods to predict outcomes in scenarios such as financial market movements or instrument pricing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Monte Carlo simulations, which can be divided into thousands of independent tasks and run simultaneously across computers, are well-suited for GPUs. This enables financial services organizations to run simulations repeatedly and swiftly. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the fast-paced and high-stakes industry of high-volume card production, minimizing rejects is crucial not only for operational efficiency but also for maintaining a competitive edge. To achieve this, best-in-class manufacturers are turning to data analytics as a powerful tool to identify, analyze, and address the root causes of rejects. Data analytics is revolutionizing the smart card manufacturing landscape and helping businesses enhance their quality control processes.</p>
<p>The Power of Data Analytics in Manufacturing</p>
<p>Data analytics involves the use of advanced algorithms and statistical methods to analyze large sets of data, extracting meaningful insights and patterns. In the context of high-volume card production, data analytics provides manufacturers with a comprehensive understanding of the entire manufacturing process from start to finish. This insight allows for informed decision-making and targeted improvements in areas prone to defects or rejects.</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of data analytics in minimizing rejects is its ability to identify and highlight patterns and anomalies in the manufacturing process. By analyzing historical data and trends, manufacturers can pinpoint specific stages or conditions that lead to a higher likelihood of rejects. This proactive approach enables preemptive measures to be implemented, reducing the occurrence of defects before they become a serious issue.</p>
<p>Data analytics also facilitates real-time monitoring of the manufacturing process. With sensors on the equipment, manufacturers can collect and analyze data in real-time, allowing for immediate identification of anomalies or deviations from established quality standards. This enables swift corrective actions, minimizing the overall number of card rejects.</p>
<p>Integrating Data Analytics into Quality Control Processes</p>
<p>To fully leverage the potential of data analytics in minimizing rejects, manufacturers must integrate it seamlessly into their quality control processes. This involves:</p>
 
 Data Collection Infrastructure – Establishing a robust infrastructure for data collection, including sensors and monitoring software across the production line. 
 Data Processing and Analysis – Implementing advanced data processing and analysis tools to derive actionable insights from the collected data. 
 Real-Time Reporting – Setting up real-time reporting mechanisms to enable immediate response to deviations from quality standards. This ensures that corrective actions can be taken swiftly, minimizing the impact on production efficiency. 
 Continuous Improvement – Creating a culture of continuous improvement by regularly reviewing and updating the data analytics system based on evolving manufacturing conditions and emerging trends in smart card technology. 
 
<p>Transformative Impact of Data Analytics − A Recent Opportunity &nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, a large financial client solicited our assistance in analyzing their operational health and overall quality. They simply wanted to track, report, and plan for operational efficiency where minimal measures were currently in place at their issuance facility. They needed clear insight and root cause diagnostics to assess the what, when, and how of production inefficiencies hindering their operational plan. In addition, they needed a solution that helped them maintain complete control of their end-to-end issuance production, from supplies and rejects to idle time and availability.</p>
<p>After a thorough analysis using <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/adaptive-issuance-production-analytics-solution">Entrust’s Adaptive Issuance Production Analytics Solution</a> (PAS), it was determined that the customer’s biggest Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) impact areas were machine utilization (Availability) and the number of reject cards (Quality). The analysis provided our client with a recommended action plan, including anticipated improvements based on their operational environment, specific machine layout, and configurations. Both outcomes were pivotal in increasing overall quality through deeper data interrogations.</p>
<p>Outcome #1 − Availability</p>
<p>In the above example, our digital intelligence identified compelling trend information in two areas. The first was a noticeable gap in the amount of idle time between machines, which led to further investigation into the operators themselves at each station. By enabling the “idle time tracking” feature, a complete picture of all operator activities between runs and during pause time showed a sizable disparity from machine to machine. This helped the client address critical labor differences and immediately laid the foundation to drive a continuous improvement plan, initiating best practices across the production floor.</p>
<p>Outcome #2 − Quality</p>
<p>The second finding determined that a significant percentage of rejects were all traced to a limited number of error codes. Similar to the first outcome, the client was able to investigate through a focused, root-cause analysis, driving their investigation quickly to assess and pinpoint the failures. The result was a significantly improved reject rate. Without a focused analytics-based assessment of their environment, this client was left to guess how and why inefficiencies were happening. The dynamic PAS dashboard was instrumental in identifying these inefficiencies and leading improvement plans for a more stable, healthy, and efficient operation.</p>
<p>In the dynamic landscape of high-volume card production, where precision and efficiency are paramount to the bottom line, leveraging data analytics is no longer a nice-to-have, but rather a necessity. Manufacturers that embrace data-driven approaches to quality control can minimize card rejects, enhance operational efficiency, and ultimately deliver superior smart card products to the market. As technology continues to advance, the integration of data analytics into manufacturing processes will play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the future of high-volume card production. By harnessing the power of data, manufacturers can stay ahead of the competition and ensure that every smart card produced meets the highest standards of quality.</p>

<p>The short answer is yes. The long answer is they will, but quick action could ease the damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quantum computers harness the laws of quantum mechanics to quickly solve problems too complex for classical computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Complex problems” are ones with so many variables interacting in complicated ways that no classical computer at any scale could solve them—at least not within tens of thousands or even millions of years.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">IBM</a> gives the example of a classical computer being able to sort through a big database of molecules, but struggling to simulate how those molecules behave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s these complex problems that the world would enormously benefit from solving and that quantum computers are being developed to handle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Explore-future-potential-quantum-computing-uses">Use cases</a> for quantum computing are emerging across industries for simulations (e.g. simulating molecular structures in drug discovery or climate modelling) and optimization (e.g. optimizing shipping routes and flight paths, enhancing machine learning algorithms, or developing advanced materials).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the quantum age won’t be all upside. The quantum threats you might have read about are real. Here are 4 things you must know:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>



 1. Quantum computers present a massive cyber threat to the world’s secured data&nbsp; 



<p><br>Since quantum computers can solve complex computational problems far faster than any classical computer, the day will come when they will be sufficiently powerful and error-resistant to break conventional encryption algorithms (RSA, DSS, Diffie-Hellman, TLS/SSL, etc.) and expose the world’s vast stores of secured data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The future technology will use what’s known as <a href="https://www.qutube.nl/quantum-algorithms/shors-algorithm">Shor’s algorithm</a> and other quantum algorithms to break all public key systems that employ integer factorization-based and other cryptography, rendering these conventional encryption algorithms obsolete and putting at risk global communications, stored data, and networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All protected financial transactions, trade secrets, health information, critical infrastructure networks, classified databases, blockchain technology, satellite communications, supply chain information, defence and national security data, and more, will be vulnerable to attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This video explains exactly how quantum computers will one day “break the internet”:&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UrdExQW0cs?feature=oembed"></a></p>



<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UrdExQW0cs?feature=oembed"></a>



 &nbsp;<br>2. The cyber threat from quantum computing is now urgent&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>If a recent <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/quantum-computers-what-is-q-day-and-whats-the-solution">Chinese report</a> could be proven, <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/quantum-computers-what-is-q-day-and-whats-the-solution">“Q-Day”</a>—the point at which large quantum computers will break the world’s encryption algorithms—could come as soon as 2025. Until now, estimates had put it 5–20 years away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bad actors, as well as nation-states such as <a>Russia and China</a>, are already intercepting and stockpiling data for “steal now, decrypt later” (SNDL) attacks by future quantum computers, and experts are urging organizations to pay attention and prepare now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial sector is particularly vulnerable and will require rapid development of robust quantum communication and data protection regimes. The transition will take time and, with Q-Day already on the immediate horizon, experts agree there’s <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/653471/preparing-for-the-post-quantum-cryptography-environment-today.html">no time to waste</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Top of Form&nbsp;</p>



 3.&nbsp; The world is already mobilizing against quantum threats&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Governments and industry have had decades to plan their defence against the encryption-busting potential of quantum computers, and now things are heating up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alibaba, Amazon, IBM, Google, and Microsoft have already launched commercial quantum-computing cloud services and in December 2023 IBM launched its next iteration of a quantum computer, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/technology#ibm-quantum-system-two">IBM Quantum System Two</a>, the most powerful known example of the technology (but still not there in terms of the power required to crack current encryption techniques).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will this year release four <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/08/nist-standardize-encryption-algorithms-can-resist-attack-quantum-computers">post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) standards</a> “to protect against future, potentially adversarial, cryptanalytically-relevant quantum computer (CRQC) capabilities. A CRQC would have the potential to break public-key systems (sometimes referred to as asymmetric cryptography) that are used to protect information systems today.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/571721/collect-today-decrypt-tomorrow-how-russia-and-china-are-preparing-for-quantum-computing.html">goal</a> is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.&nbsp;<br></p>



 4. Organizations are being urged to prepare now&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>In late August 2023 the US Government published its <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/media.defense.gov/2023/Aug/21/2003284212/-1/-1/0/CSI-QUANTUM-READINESS.PDF">quantum readiness guide</a> with advice for organization from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) about how to proactively develop and build capabilities to secure critical information and systems from being compromised by quantum computers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advice for organizations, particularly those supporting critical infrastructure, is in four parts:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Establish a quantum readiness roadmap.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Engage with technology vendors to discuss post-quantum roadmaps.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Conduct an inventory to identify and understand cryptographic systems and assets.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Create migration plans that prioritize the most sensitive and critical assets.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The US Government says it’s urging immediate action since “many of the cryptographic products, protocols, and services used today that rely on public key algorithms (e.g., RivestShamir-Adleman [RSA], Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman [ECDH], and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm [ECDSA]) will need to be updated, replaced, or significantly altered to employ quantum-resistant PQC algorithms, to protect against this future threat.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Organizations are encouraged to proactively prepare for future migration to products implementing the post-quantum cryptographic standards.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the readiness guide is a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/matrix-game-quantum-technologies">game</a> from the CISA, designed to help organizations across the critical infrastructure community identify actionable insights about the future and emerging risks, and proactively develop risk management strategies to implement now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The clear message in all the government advice and industry action is to be prepared such that your organization is ready to enact a seamless transition when quantum computing does become reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Rob Joyce, Director of NSA Cybersecurity, says: “The transition to a secured quantum computing era is a long-term intensive community effort that will require extensive collaboration between government and industry. The key is to be on this journey today and not wait until the last minute.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/653471/preparing-for-the-post-quantum-cryptography-environment-today.html">CSO</a> writer sums it up this way: “This is not a light lift, it is indeed a heavy lift, yet a necessary lift. Sitting on the sidelines and waiting is not an option.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Is your organization already planning for quantum cryptography?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read the US Government’s <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3498776/post-quantum-cryptography-cisa-nist-and-nsa-recommend-how-to-prepare-now/">readiness guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Over 800,000 organizations rely on Microsoft Entra to navigate the ever-changing threat landscape, ensuring their security while enhancing the productivity of their end users. Customers have frequently expressed their desire for greater transparency into their Entra usage, with licensing being a particularly popular request. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of Microsoft Entra license utilization portal, a new feature that enables customers to optimize their Entra ID Premium licenses by providing insights into the current usage of premium features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll provide an overview of Entra ID license utilization, including what it is, how it works, and how you can optimize your license to get the most out of your Entra ID Premium Licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Entra ID License utilization portal allows you to see how many Entra ID P1 and P2 licenses you have and the usage of the key features corresponding to the license type. We're thrilled that Conditional Access and risk-based Conditional Access usage are available as part of the public preview, but this would be expanded to include usage of other SKUs and corresponding features at general availability. This perspective is an initial stride towards empowering you to comprehend your license count and the value you extract from your Entra license. It also aids in addressing any over-usage issues that might emerge in your tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Try the public preview 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The license utilization &amp; insights portal is available under the “Usage &amp; Insights” blade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1. License utilization insights portal under Usage &amp; Insights blade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This portal would provide you with insights into the top features you’re using that correspond with your Entra ID Premium P1 and P2 licenses (as applicable). You can leverage these insights to secure and govern your users along with ensuring you comply with the licensing terms and conditions. Here is a screenshot of feature usage view you can see in the Entra portal:</p>
<p>Figure 2. Entra ID Premium P1 feature usage on License utilization portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3. Entra ID Premium P2 feature usage on License utilization portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to extend this transparency into Entra usage and would love to hear your feedback on this new capability, as well as what would be most useful to you. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Microsoft Entra is not only the identity system for users; it’s also the identity and access management (IAM) system for Azure-based services, all internal infrastructure services at Microsoft, and our customers’ workload identities. This is why our 99.99% service-level promise extends to workload identity authentication, and why we continue to improve our service’s resilience through a multilayered approach that includes the backup authentication system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, we introduced the backup authentication system, as an industry-first innovation that automatically and transparently handles authentications for supported workloads when the primary Microsoft Entra ID service is degraded or unavailable. Through 2022 and 2023, we continued to expand the coverage of the backup service across clouds and application types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’ll build on our <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fadvancing-azure-active-directory-availability%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7Cf42f60520e8241d6f48108dc4d11a2a1%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638469985375289828%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=4E80MYl8uCYinrptGG1ZUiGZpkrpO9zGTiT8PDAWJsQ%3D&amp;reserved=0">resilience blogpost series </a>by going further in sharing how workload identities gain resilience from the regionally isolated authentication endpoints as well as from the backup authentication system. We’ll explore two complementary methods that best fit our regional-global infrastructure. One example of workload identity authentication is when an Azure virtual machine (VM) authenticates its identity to Azure Storage. Another example is when one of our customers’ workloads authenticates to application programming interfaces (APIs). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Regionally isolated authentication endpoints&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regionally isolated authentication endpoints provide region-isolated authentication services to an Azure region. All frequently used identities will authenticate successfully without dependencies on other Azure regions. Essentially, they are the primary endpoints for Azure infrastructure services as well as the primary endpoints for managed identities in Azure (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview">Managed identities for Azure resources - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn</a>). Managed identities help prevent out-of-region failures by consolidating service dependencies, and improving resilience by handling certificate expiry, rotation, and trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This layer of protection and isolation does not need any configuration changes from Azure customers. Key Azure infrastructure services have already adopted it, and it’s integrated with the managed identities service to protect the customer workloads that depend on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How regionally isolated authentication endpoints work&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each Azure region is assigned a unique endpoint for workload identity authentication. The region is served by a regionally collocated, special instance of Microsoft Entra ID. The regional instance relies on caching metadata (for example, directory data that is needed to issue tokens locally) to respond efficiently and resiliently to the workload identity’s authentication requests. This lightweight design reduces dependencies on other services and improves resilience by allowing the entire authentication to be completed within a single region. Data in the local cache is proactively refreshed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regional service depends on Microsoft Entra ID's global service to update and refill caches when it lacks the data it needs (a cache miss) or when it detects a change in the security posture for a supported service. If the regional service experiences an outage, requests are served seamlessly by Microsoft Entra ID’s global service, making the regional service interruption invisible to the customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Performant, resilient, and widely available&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service has proven itself since 2020 and now serves six billion requests per day across the globe.&nbsp; The regional endpoints, working with global services, exceed 99.99% SLA. The resilience of Azure infrastructure is further protected by workload-side caches kept by Azure client SDKs. Together, the regional and global services have managed to make most service degradations undetectable by dependent infrastructure services. Post-incident recovery is handled automatically. Regional isolation is supported by public and all Sovereign Clouds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure authentication requests are processed by the same Azure datacenter that hosts the workloads along with their co-located dependencies. This means that endpoints that are isolated to a region also benefit from performance advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Backup authentication system to cover workload identities for infrastructure authentication&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For workload identity authentication that does not depend on managed identities, we’ll rely on the backup authentication system to add fault-tolerant resilience.&nbsp; In our <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/advancing-service-resilience-in-azure-active-directory-with-its-backup-authentication-service/">blogpost</a> from November 2021, we explained the approach for user authentication which has been generally available for some time. The system operates in the Microsoft cloud but on separate and decorrelated systems and network paths from the primary Microsoft Entra ID system. This means that it can continue to operate in case of service, network, or capacity issues across many Microsoft Entra ID and dependent Azure services. We are now applying that successful approach to workload identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backup coverage of workload identities is currently rolling out systematically across Microsoft, starting with Microsoft 365’s largest internal infrastructure services in the first half of 2024. Microsoft Entra ID customer workload identities’ coverage will follow in the second half of 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Protecting your own workloads&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of both regionally isolated endpoints and the backup authentication system are natively built into our platform. To further optimize the benefits of current and future investments in resilience and security, we encourage developers to use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and leverage managed identities whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to assure our customers that our 99.99% uptime guarantee remains in place, along with our ongoing efforts to expand our backup coverage system and increase our automatic backup coverage to include all infrastructure authentication—even for third-party developers—in the next year. We’ll make sure to keep you updated on our progress, including planned improvements to our system capacity, performance, and coverage across all clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Introducing Leandexer: Simplifying Blockchain Data Interaction 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in March 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>A few years ago, Tokeny encountered some challenges in maintaining and scaling its infrastructure as blockchain data indexing can be quite complex with advanced smart contracts. We were limited by existing indexing tools like The Graph and decided to invest massively in the development of our own indexer solution for our tokenization platform.</p>
<p>Issues such as unsynchronized blockchain data and disruptions to other operations during token and event indexing were costly to maintain and hard to use.&nbsp;With our in-house indexer, these challenges were effectively resolved.</p>
 Opening Our Indexer to Third-Parties 
<p>This experience led us to realize that&nbsp;many other companies shared similar frustrations&nbsp;with existing indexing solutions, regardless of their size or industry. Recognizing the widespread need for a reliable indexer solution,&nbsp;we decided to launch&nbsp;Leandexer, a standalone version of our in-house indexer, available as a SaaS solution.</p>

  <p>I’m thrilled to announce the public preview of advanced certificate-based authentication (CBA) options in Conditional Access, which provides the ability to allow access to specific resources based on the certificate Issuer or Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our customers, particularly those in highly regulated industries and government, have expressed the need for more flexibility in their CBA configurations. Using the same certificate for all Entra ID federated applications is not always sufficient. Some resources may require access with a certificate issued by specific issuers, while other resources require access based on a specific policy OIDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, a company like Contoso may issue three different types of multifactor certificates via Smart Cards to employees, each distinguished by properties such as Policy OID or issuer. These certificates may correspond to different levels of security clearance, such as Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. Contoso needs to ensure that only users with the appropriate multifactor certificate can access data of the corresponding classification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Authentication strength - advanced CBA options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the authentication strength capability in Conditional Access, customers can now create a custom authentication strength policy, with advanced CBA options to allow access based on certificate issuer or policy OIDs. For external users whose multifactor authentication (MFA) is trusted from partners' Entra ID tenant, access can also be restricted based on these properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This adds flexibility to CBA, in addition to the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/advancing-cybersecurity-the-latest-enhancement-in-phishing/ba-p/2365681">recent updates we shared in December</a>.

  <p>In November 2023 at <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/07952ef8-8603-4a94-8185-975ae95e53bb?source=sessions">Microsoft Ignite</a>, we announced Microsoft-managed policies and the auto-rollout of multifactor authentication (MFA)-related Conditional Access&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">policies</a> in customer tenants. Since then, we’ve rolled out report-only policies for over 500,000 tenants. These policies are part of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative,</a>&nbsp;which includes key engineering advances to improve security for customers against cyberthreats that we anticipate will increase over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follow-up blog will dive deeper into these policies to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what they entail and how they function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Multifactor authentication for admins accessing Microsoft admin portals 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admin accounts with elevated privileges are more likely to be attacked, so enforcing MFA for these roles protects these privileged administrative functions. This policy covers 14 admin roles that we consider to be highly privileged, requiring administrators to perform multifactor authentication when signing into Microsoft admin portals. This policy targets Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per-user MFA is when users are enabled individually and are required to perform multifactor authentication each time they sign in (with some exceptions, such as when they sign in from trusted IP addresses or when the remember MFA on trusted devices feature is turned on). For customers who are licensed for Entra ID P1, Conditional Access offers a better admin experience with many additional features, including <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups">user group</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps">application</a> targeting, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions">more conditions</a> such as risk- and device-based, integration with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">authentication strengths</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session">session controls</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-report-only">report-only mode</a>. This can help you be more targeted in requiring MFA, lowering end user friction while maintaining security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers users with per-user MFA. These users are targeted by Conditional Access and are now required to perform multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It aids organizations’ transition to Conditional Access seamlessly, ensuring no disruption to end user experiences while maintaining a high level of security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy targets licensed users with Entra ID P1 and P2, where the security defaults policy isn't enabled and there are less than 500 per-user MFA enabled enabled/enforced users. There will be no change to the end user experience due to this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication and reauthentication for risky sign-ins 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy will help your organization achieve the Optimal level for Risk Assessments in the NIST <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> because it provides a key layer of added security assurance that triggers only when we detect high-risk sign-ins. “High-risk sign-in” means there is a very high probability that a given authentication request isn't the authorized identity owner and could indicate brute force, password spray, or token replay attacks. By dynamically responding to sign-in risk, this policy disrupts active attacks in real-time while remaining invisible to most users, particularly those who don’t have high sign-in risk. When Identity Protection detects an attack, your users will be prompted to self-remediate with MFA and reauthenticate to Entra ID, which will reset the compromised session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks%22%20/l%20%22sign-in-risk-detections">Learn more about sign-in risk</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers all users in Entra ID P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled, all active users are already registered for MFA, and there are enough licenses for each user. As with all policies, ensure you exclude any break-glass or service accounts to avoid locking yourself out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies have been created in all eligible tenants in Report-only mode. These policies are suggestions from Microsoft that organizations can adapt and use for their own environment. Administrators can view and review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>. To enhance the policies, administrators are encouraged to add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>. Once ready, the policies can be moved to the ON state. For additional customization needs, administrators have the flexibility to clone the policies and make further adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Call to Action 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't wait – take action now. Enable the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies now and/or customize the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies according to your organizational needs. Your proactive approach to implementing multifactor authentication policies is crucial in fortifying your organization against evolving security threats.

  <p>Today <a href="https://aka.ms/CopilotforSecurityGA">we announced</a> that Microsoft Copilot for Security will be generally available worldwide on April 1. The following new Microsoft Entra skills will be available in the standalone Copilot for Security experience: User Details, Group Details, Sign-in Logs, Audit Logs, and Diagnostic Logs. User Risk Investigation, a skill embedded in Microsoft Entra, will also be available in public preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These skills help identity admins protect against identity compromise through providing identity context and insights for security incidents and helping to resolve identity-related risks and sign-in issues. We’re excited to bring new identity capabilities to Copilot for Security and help identity and security operators <a href="http://aka.ms/copilotforsecurity">protect at machine speed.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity skills in Copilot for Security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at what each of these new Entra Skills in Copilot for Security do to help identity professionals secure access, while easily integrating into any admin's daily workflow via natural language prompts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User details can quickly surface context on any user managed in Entra, such as username, location, job title, contact information, authentication methods, the account creation date, and account status. Admins can prompt Copilot with phrases like "tell me more about this user”, “list the active users created in the last 5 days”, “what authentication methods does this user have”, and “is this user’s account enabled” to pull up this kind of information in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group details can summarize details on any group managed in Entra.&nbsp; Admins can ask Copilot questions like “who is the owner of group X?”, “tell me about the group that starts with XYZ”, and “how many members are in this group?” for immediate context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign-in logs can highlight information about sign-in logs and conditional access policies applied to your tenant to assist with identity investigations and troubleshooting. Admins must simply instruct their Copilot to “show me recent sign-ins for this user”, “show me the sign-ins from this IP address”, or “show me the failed sign-ins for this user.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs can help isolate anomalies associated with audit logs, including changes to roles and access privileges. Admins just have to ask Copilot to “show me audit logs for actions initiated by this user” or “show me the audit logs for this kind of event”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin, who has identified a risky user under the username ‘rashok’, asks Copilot for the March 5th audit logs for ‘rashok’ to discover what actions that user took while at a heightened risk of compromise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diagnostic logs can help assess the health and completeness of your tenant's policy configurations. This helps ensure sign-in and audit logs are correctly set up, and that there are no gaps in the log collection process. Admins can ask “what logs are being collected in my tenant” or “are audit logs enabled” to quickly remediate any gaps.&nbsp;</p>

 Using Copilot in Entra for risk investigation&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better picture of how Copilot for Security can increase the speed at which you respond to identity risks, let’s imagine a scenario in which a user is flagged for having a high-risk level due to several abnormal sign-in attempts. With the User Risk Investigation skill in Microsoft Entra, available in public preview with Copilot for Security, admins can get an analysis of the user risk level coupled with recommendations on how to mitigate an incident and resolve the situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin notices that a user has been flagged as high risk due to a series of abnormal sign-ins. With Copilot for Security, the admin can quickly investigate and resolve the risk by clicking on the user in question to receive an immediate summary of risk and instructions for remediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copilot summarizes in natural language why the user risk level was elevated. Then, Copilot provides an actionable list of steps to help nullify the risk and close the alert. Finally, Copilot provides a series of recommendations an identity admin can take to automate the response to identity threats, minimizing exposure to a compromised identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the next decade, AI will impact all industries and help shape which companies, teams and executives come out ahead. This is why we’ve seen so many early AI adopters in sports, where even the slightest competitive advantage can be the difference between first and second place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take last year’s <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-08-15-IBM-and-the-USTA-Add-Generative-AI-Commentary-and-AI-Draw-Analysis-to-the-2023-US-Open-Digital-Platforms%22%20/t%20%22_blank">US Open</a>, for example, where <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">IBM watsonx™</a> projected the level of advantage or disadvantage of all players in the singles draw. Overseas, Sevilla FC launched <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-23-Sevilla-FC-Transforms-the-Player-Recruitment-Process-with-the-Power-of-IBM-watsonx-Generative-AI%22%20/t%20%22_blank">a tool built on watsonx</a> to provide scouts with comprehensive data-driven identification and evaluation of potential recruits. And <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/edge3-to-help-universities-and-athletes-navigate-recruiting-landscape-using-ibm-watsonx-ai-and-data-platform/">EDGE3 will embed to IBM watsonx</a> to help universities and athletes navigate the increasingly complex world of recruiting by improving the decision-making process for college programs and players.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These examples go hand-in-hand with rapid enterprise adoption. For instance, we are working together with Adobe to embed watsonx into their platform to support key industries. <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-05-02-SAP-to-Embed-IBM-Watson-Artificial-Intelligence-into-SAP-R-Solutions">With SAP</a>, we’re working together to incorporate additional AI, machine learning and other intelligent technologies into SAP solutions that can lead to better business outcomes for our joint customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies of all shapes, sizes and industries are taking the first step in their AI journey. Here are two questions they should be asking:&nbsp;</p>



 Is AI right for my business?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Absolutely. Whether you lead a high-growth startup or an established enterprise, you’re likely playing in a highly competitive market where AI can add enormous value to your business. Start your AI journey by determining your use case and what you are trying to accomplish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, partners across industries are embedding IBM watsonx into their workflows, offerings and solutions in different ways to supercharge their existing technology. For example, by integrating watsonx with Box’s Content Cloud, customers can use IBM AI with proprietary data housed in Box to help them accelerate business processes. In the financial investment and wealth management space, QuantumStreet AI offers a comprehensive AI platform which embeds watsonx for professional investors, representing USD 6 billion of client assets covering 50,000 publicly traded global companies and asset classes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM’s approach, which uses smaller models tuned to specific business use cases, also helps lower the AI barrier to entry by helping enterprises adopt specific models that run on cheaper infrastructure and offer more flexibility to be deployed on public cloud, on private cloud or on-premises.&nbsp;</p>



 How can I ensure responsible AI innovation for my company?&nbsp; 



<p>Today’s corporate leaders shouldn’t be questioning whether to explore AI for their business, but how to do so responsibly. When AI is applied to the enterprise, there is no room for error—it must be implemented with the right guardrails in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A key ingredient in responsible AI is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/ai-governance-must-be-step-one-in-your-generative-ai-journey">governance</a>, which should be the top concern for every developer, software provider and business with plans to implement AI. That is why the availability of watsonx.governance was such a <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-11-14-IBM-Unveils-watsonx-governance-to-Help-Businesses-Governments-Govern-and-Build-Trust-in-Generative-AI">tentpole moment for IBM</a>. We provide enterprises with a toolkit that helps them manage risk, embrace transparency and anticipate compliance with future AI-focused regulation. Partners that choose to use their data can take advantage of watsonx.data, a fit-for-purpose data store that helps them scale AI workloads for all their data anywhere it resides. An important distinction for IBM is our longstanding policy that such data belongs to the partner. Alternatively, many partners use watsonx.ai, which includes the <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-09-28-IBM-Announces-Availability-of-watsonx-Granite-Model-Series,-Client-Protections-for-IBM-watsonx-Models">Granite model series</a> (with openly shared data sources).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our partners look at data use just as seriously as we do. Take <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231213889530/en/Dun-Bradstreet-and-IBM-Collaborate-to-Bring-Trustworthy-Business-Insights-to-Fuel-Responsible-Generative-AI-Solutions-Powered-by-watsonx">our relationship with Dun &amp; Bradstreet</a>, which combines Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Cloud with watsonx to help enterprises responsibly expand their use of generative AI. Another IBM Partner, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/personalize-retail-insights-with-boxes-and-ibm-watsonx/">Boxes</a>, is using IBM watsonx Assistant™ to help retailers gather customer insights and generate buyer-ready reports to bring forward new products and get samples in the hands of consumers. And partners like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/jaxon-takes-on-ai-hallucinations-with-the-release-of-domain-specific-ai-language-with-integrated-ibm-watsonx-foundation-models/">Jaxon.ai</a> are using watsonx foundation models to address some of the other challenging aspects of AI, such as hallucinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m proud that IBM draws on decades of industry leadership, investment and research in AI to help guide partners along every step of their AI journey. No matter your company’s age, size, shape or industry, IBM has the right tools and partner program to help your business adopt and scale responsible AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We came across this recent Joint Cybersecurity Advisory paper: “<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/aa24-046a-threat-actor-leverages-compromised%20account-of%20former-employee.pdf">Threat Actor Leverages Compromised Account of Former Employee to Access State Government Organization</a>,” co-authored by the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Multi-State Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). The topic strikes a familiar chord, yet we both appreciate the thorough analysis provided by the authors to educate cybersecurity professionals on the details and mitigating factors. In our view, sharing real life experiences helps get the message across more impactfully than discussing abstract threat models and hypothetical attacks.</p>
<p>It makes you think … Do you know how quickly your organization responds to an employee or contractor leaving the organization? How unified are your HR and IT functions? Is your identity and access management (IAM) solution fit for the 21st century? With social engineering attacks such as phishing and man in the middle (MiTM) getting more sophisticated, do you have the tools in place to protect against them?</p>
<p>Let’s first look at the method used by the hacker described in this advisory paper and see what lessons we can learn from this attack.</p>
<p>Unidentified Threat Actor</p>
<p>The hack started with a government agency being alerted to a U.S. government employee’s credentials, host, and user information being offered for sale on the dark web. The incident response assessment determined that “an unidentified threat actor compromised network administrator credentials through the account of a former employee … to successfully authenticate to an internal virtual private network (VPN) access point … .”</p>
<p>The hacker then moved onto targeting the ex-employee’s on-prem environment, running several lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) queries, and then moving laterally into their Azure environment.</p>
<p>The good news is the hacker didn’t appear to have progressed much further, presumably satisfied they had valid credentials that they could sell to other hackers to continue their nefarious acts.</p>
<p>The advisory paper references the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® framework, which we’ve illustrated below.</p>
<p>These are the steps a threat actor would typically follow as they carry out an attack –&nbsp;starting at the 12 o’clock position (Reconnaissance), moving clockwise to Resource Development all the way to Impact.</p>
<p>NOTE: For more details about the typical stages of an attack and a comprehensive database of real threats used by adversaries, visit <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">attack.mitre.org</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: MITRE ATT&amp;CK illustration of the threat actor’s modus operandi</p>
<p>USER1, referenced in the paper, likely followed these steps in sourcing the former employee’s credentials and then used them to access the network. Once on the network, they were able to locate a second set of credentials, labeled USER2. The advisory paper charts the progress of USER1 and USER2 through these stages as far as the Collection stage, where “the actor obtained USER2 account credentials from the virtualized SharePoint server managed by USER1.” As we mentioned, progress seems to have stalled and the paper states: “Analysis determined the threat actor did not move laterally from the compromised on-premises network to the Azure environment and did not compromise sensitive systems.”</p>
<p>Mitigations</p>
<p>What’s clear from the report is several simple errors facilitated this hack. Below, we’ve added some best practices to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK illustration to show how to mitigate those errors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The joint Cybersecurity Advisory paper is a reminder of how threat actors are poised and ready to exploit weaknesses in an organization’s security posture. Some straightforward security measures would’ve halted this attack before it had even started. However, we know that threat actors are evolving and implementing more sophisticated attacks. Organizations might not always leave the door open, but they might not have secured the latch and attached the door chain to bolster their security posture.</p>
<p>We Can Help You Lock the Door</p>
<p>Entrust offers a comprehensive portfolio of solutions that not only would have helped the organization that was the victim in this particular situation, but can also help other organizations protect against more sophisticated attacks being used by threat actors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/key-management/keycontrol">KeyControl</a> manages keys, secrets, and certificates – including credentials. KeyControl proactively enforces security policies by whitelisting approved users and actions while also recording privileged user activity across virtual, cloud, and physical environments – creating a granular, immutable audit trial of those accessing the system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/cloudcontrol">Entrust CloudControl</a> improves virtual infrastructure security and risk management with features such as role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), and secondary approval (two-person rule). These are important, especially when overseeing virtualized environments on a large scale with a team of busy system administrators. CloudControl provides the necessary guardrails and control measures to ensure that your system admin team consistently applies policies across your VM estate while also mitigating against inadvertent misconfigurations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/iam/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Entrust Phishing-Resistant MFA</a> delivers precisely as advertised. Identity continues to be the largest attack vector, with compromised credentials and phishing being the leading causes of breaches. The traditional password adds to the poor user experience and is easily compromised. Even conventional MFA methods such as SMS one-time password (OTP) and push authentication are easily bypassed by attackers.</p>
<p>Credential Management and Access Trends</p>
<p>When examining credential management and access, there are prominent trends in identity and IAM that are receiving significant attention in the office of the CEO and the boardroom.</p>
<p>One prominent trend is the increasing adoption of phishing-resistant passwordless adaptive biometrics authentication. This helps prevent fraud and secure high-value transactions with risk inputs that assess behavioral biometrics and look for indicators of compromise (IOCs) based on various threat intelligence feeds.</p>
<p>Another trend is using identity proofing to enhance security layers, seamless onboarding processes, and the integration of digital signing to provide a unified digital identity experience. Many companies are grappling with the complexities of managing multiple identity providers (IDPs) and associated processes, as well as challenges related to MFA fatigue and phishing attacks targeting OTPs via SMS or email – particularly through adversary in the middle (AiTM) attacks.</p>
<p>Then there’s the management of diverse cybersecurity platforms – including various IDPs, MFA solutions, identity proofing tools, and standalone digital signing platforms –&nbsp;that can lead to productivity bottlenecks and costly administration overheads. Employing certificate-based authentication, biometrics, and other passwordless authentication methods – combined with identity proofing and digital signing within an integrated identity solution – helps streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance user adoption. Plus, it also helps mitigate potential vulnerabilities associated with disjointed platform connections across enterprise IT environments. It’s a lot for organizations to take on board.</p>
<p>Entrust phishing-resistant identity solutions provide a complete identity and access management platform and comprehensive certificate lifecycle management capabilities to help you implement high-assurance certificate-based authentication for your users and devices.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned</p>
<p>Whether your organization is on a Zero Trust journey or just looking to strengthen your security posture, the attack discussed in the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory paper that started this conversation is a reminder that the threats out there are real – and organizations need to have robust security processes and procedures in place to keep that door firmly closed.</p>

Through the creation of tangible artifacts that imply adjacent possible trajectories for computing's futures, Design Fiction allows us to materialize the intangible, make the non-sensical make sense, and imbue these possibilities with ambitions, desires, and dreams of what-could be. Design Fiction allows us to represent challenges, and technological trajectories in grounded form, through the powerful Design Fiction artifact, such as advertisements, magazines, quick-start guides, FAQs, and news stories. In this talk I will briefly describe the methodologies of Design Fiction and the ways it has been used by organizations, teams, and brands to project into possible futures. I will showcase how speculative artifacts, such as industrial designs for new computing platforms or advertisements for future services, act as conduits for discussion and reflection on the evolution of computing.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nearfuturelaboratory.com/">https://www.nearfuturelaboratory.com</a></p><p><a>See more on YouTube</a></p> the poetics of computation <p><a href="https://ivanzhao.me/">ivan zhao</a></p><blockquote>in what ways is a poem a computer? how do the mechanics, the inner working of software, reflect the syntactic and beautiful nature of poetry? this talk dives into the rich history of programmers, poets, writers, and designers and how they've created new worlds with ideas, theories and examples.</blockquote> Using TiddlyWiki For Personal Knowledge Curation <p><a href="https://gavart.ist/">Gavin Gamboa</a></p><blockquote>TiddlyWiki is an open-source software project initiated and maintained by Jeremy Ruston and volunteers since 2004.

<p>On March 6, 2024, the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11275-fact-sheet.pdf">US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) adopted rules to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures by public companies and in public offerings. The commission’s adoption of the rules is two years in the making. The original proposed rules, issued in March 2022, aimed to ensure consistency in how publicly traded companies provided climate-related information to investors.</p>



<p>These new rules join existing regulations in both the US and around the world requiring companies to make climate-related disclosures and provide other ESG-related metrics. In California, for example, legislation passed in late 2023 requires Scope 3 emissions disclosures, while the European Union’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/csrd">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive</a>—which mandates disclosures on a range of sustainability issues—was adopted earlier in the year.</p>



<p>Per the new SEC rules, companies will be required to disclose:</p>



 Climate-related risks and costs 



 
 Climate-related risks that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant’s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition; 



 The actual or potential material impacts of any identified climate-related risks on the registrant’s business model, outlook and strategy; 



 The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures and sea level rise, subject to applicable one percent and de minimis disclosure thresholds disclosed in a note to the financial statements; 
 



 Mitigation and oversight efforts 



 
 If a registrant has undertaken activities to mitigate or adapt to a material climate-related risk, a quantitative and qualitative description of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that directly result from such mitigation or adaptation activities; 



 Specified disclosures regarding a registrant’s activities, if any, to mitigate or adapt to a material climate-related risk including the use, if any, of transition plans, scenario analysis or internal carbon prices; 



 Any oversight by the board of directors of climate-related risks and any role by management in assessing and managing the registrant’s material climate-related risks; 



 Any processes the registrant has for identifying, assessing and managing material climate-related risks and, if the registrant is managing those risks, whether and how any such processes are integrated into the registrant’s overall risk management system or processes; 



 Information about a registrant’s climate-related targets or goals, if any, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant’s business, results of operations or financial condition. Disclosures would include material expenditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the target or goal or actions taken to make progress toward meeting such target or goal; 
 



 Emissions information 



 
 For large accelerated filers (LAFs) and accelerated filers (AFs) that are not otherwise exempted, information about material Scope 1 emissions and/or Scope 2 emissions; 



 For those required to disclose Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions, an assurance report at the limited assurance level, which, for a LAF, following an additional transition period, will be at the reasonable assurance level; 
 



 Where will the disclosures be made? 



<p>The SEC is requiring that required climate-related disclosures be included in companies’ filings with the commission, such as registration statements and annual reports.</p>



 When will companies be required to begin disclosures? 



<p>The new rules will take effect 60 days after they’re published in the federal register. However, there will be a phase-in period for compliance, with the largest companies reporting, as required, on climate-related risks by fiscal year 2025 and on emissions by 2026. Compliance dates for smaller companies range between 2026 and 2028, depending on their registrant type.</p>

				 <p><a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/travel-and-mobile-are-driving-decentralized-digital-identity-ddid-growth/">A new blog from Andras Cser</a>, VP and Principal Analyst at Forrester Research, says standardized use cases, such as<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-301989815.html"> Indicio and SITA’s development of digital travel credentials</a> will drive adoption of “exciting new identity technology,” what he calls, decentralized digital identity (DDID).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-takes-the-lead-in-indicio-series-a-funding-round-cementing-a-partnership-delivering-trusted-digital-identity-for-travel/">SITA recently announced</a> its role as lead investor in Indicio’s Series A funding round, citing the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-and-indicio-announce-a-co-innovation-agreement-to-accelerate-the-development-of-digital-identities/">co-innovation agreement</a> as being key to its digital identity strategy. This means offering verifiable credential-based digital identity solutions that meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards for a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) to its 400-plus members and 2,500 worldwide customers, which SITA says is about 90% of the world’s airline business.</p>
<p>With the digital travel credential — or DTC — Indicio and SITA have applied decentralized identity technology to enable pre-authorized travel and seamless border crossing using verifiable credentials. The simplicity, speed, and security of the process applied to the often stressful experience of travel will not only drive the adoption of the technology in air travel but show the world how verifiable identity and data can be easily applied to make everything from passwordless login to banking and finance better, more secure, and faster.</p>
<p>“We agree with Cser,” says Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “When you can solve one of the toughest security challenges — crossing a border — and solve it so that it becomes, easy, frictionless, and seamless, you have the opportunity not only to scale the technology across the global travel industry and affect the lives of millions of people, but to show how this simplicity can be applied to any digital interaction that requires personal or high-value data. It is a very exciting technology, these are exciting times, and we’re going to change everything.”</p>
<p>Cser’s observation highlights <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-the-supernova-award-from-constellation-research-for-disruptive-technology-leadership-in-digital-safety-governance-and-privacy/">Indicio as a leader</a> in the development and deployment of decentralized digital identity software and solutions through its growing customer roster of global enterprises, governments, organizations, and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity and verifiable credentials are a new and transformational method for data sharing that allows information to be verified without intervention from a centralized third-party or through creating a direct integration between systems. This means data from disparate sources and systems can be easily and quickly shared directly to organizations and governments by end users to make informed decisions based on accurate, verifiable data.</p>
<p>The key to this, as Cser notes, is standardization: “standardized use cases will drive interoperability and usability and help grow DDID adoption.” Government contracts for IT infrastructure increasingly mandate open source and open standard-based technology over proprietary solutions because the former is easier to scale, easier to sustain, and less expensive. In practice, this means that a verifiable credential solution like the DTC can be easily adapted to other identity verification purposes because it is easy for anyone to access and use verification software combined with governance rules.</p>
<p>Indicio’s engineering team are key leaders, contributors to, and maintainers of open-source projects at the Hyperledger Foundation and Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), and Indicio’s products and solutions align with the open standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP). With the DTC, Indicio and SITA not only followed ICAO’s standard for DTC but also the open standards and open-source codebases that enable interoperability.</p>
<p>“Open standards are a decentralized identity superpower,” says Dahl, “and It is, in large part, due to the work of the open-standards Hyperledger Foundation that we have a complete technology solution that meets the needs of global enterprises and governments now and, equally important, will meet them in the future. Technology will evolve and we have to be ready for that, but we know the direction it will evolve towards: universally verifiable identity and data. It’s the only way forward that makes economic sense. That’s why we provide our customers with a universal solution — Indicio Proven®. It can meet current requirements for eIDAS, OpenID4VC, and mobile driver’s licenses but also allow the evolution, expansion, and innovation that will come — that is already coming — from business models using verifiable data.”</p>
<p>As 2024 continues, more global enterprises are learning about this exciting new technology and contracting with the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-academy/">Indicio Academy</a> to help educate and train their workforce on the latest advancements and technologies encompassing decentralized identity.</p>

  <p>Managing the myriad settings and resources within your tenant can be daunting. In an era of escalating security risks and an unprecedented global threat landscape, organizations seek trusted guidance to enhance their security posture That’s why we introduced <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Microsoft Entra Recommendations</a> to diligently monitor your tenant’s status, ensuring it remains secure and healthy. Moreover, they empower you to extract maximum value from the features offered by Microsoft Entra ID. Since the launch of Microsoft Entra recommendations, thousands of customers have adopted these recommendations and resolved millions of resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re thrilled to announce the upcoming general availability of four recommendations, and another three recommendations in public preview. We’re also excited to share new updates on Identity secure score. These recommendations cover a wide spectrum, including credentials, application health, and broader security settings—equipping you to safeguard your digital estate effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Presenting new and upcoming recommendations- Learn from our best practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The following list of new and upcoming recommendations help improve the health and security of your applications:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Remove unused credentials from applications: An application credential is used to get a token that grants access to a resource or another service. If an application credential is compromised, it could be used to access sensitive resources or allow a bad actor to move latterly, depending on the access granted to the application. Removing credentials not actively used by applications improves security posture and promotes application hygiene. It reduces the risk of application compromise and improves the security posture of the application by reducing the attack surface for credential misuse by discovery.&nbsp; 
 Renew expiring service principal credentials: Renewing the service principal credential(s) before expiration ensures the application continues to function and reduces the possibility of downtime due to an expired credential.&nbsp; 
 Renew expiring application credentials: Renewing the app credential(s) before its expiration ensures the application continues to function and reduces the possibility of downtime due to an expired credential.&nbsp; 
 Remove unused applications: Removing unused applications improves the security posture and promotes good application hygiene. It reduces the risk of application compromise by someone discovering an unused application and misusing it. Depending on the permissions granted to the application and the resources that it exposes, an application compromise could expose sensitive data in an organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Migrate applications from the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs to Microsoft Graph: The Azure AD Graph service (graph.windows.net) was announced as deprecated in 2020 and is in a retirement cycle. It’ is important that applications in your tenant, and applications supplied by vendors that are consented in your tenant (service principals), are updated to use Microsoft Graph APIs as soon as possible. This recommendation reports applications that have recently used Azure AD Graph APIs, along with more details about which Azure AD Graph APIs the applications are using.&nbsp; 
 Migrate Service Principals from the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs to Microsoft Graph: The Azure AD Graph service (graph.windows.net) was announced as deprecated in 2020 and is in a retirement cycle. It’ is important that service principals in your tenant, and service principals for applications supplied by vendors that are consented in your tenant, are updated to use Microsoft Graph APIs as soon as possible. This recommendation reports service principals that have recently used Azure AD Graph APIs, along with more details about which Azure AD Graph APIs the service principals are using.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find these recommendations that are in general availability on the Microsoft Entra recommendations portal by looking for “Generally Available” under the column titled “Release Type” as shown below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Changes to Secure Score - Your security analytics tool to enhance security.&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re happy to announce some new developments in Identity Secure Score which functions as <a href="https://kateblog.io/iam/identity-secure-score-in-azure-active-directory/">an indicator for how aligned you are with Microsoft’s recommendations for security</a>. Each improvement action in Identity Secure Score is customized to your configuration and you can easily see the security impact of your changes. We have an upcoming Secure Score recommendation in public preview to help you protect your organization from Insider risk. Please see the details below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Protect your tenant with Insider Risk policy: Implementing a Conditional Access policy that blocks access to resources for high-risk internal users is of high priority due to its critical role in proactively enhancing security, mitigating insider threats, and safeguarding sensitive data in real-time. Learn more about this feature <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/how-to-policy-insider-risk">here.</a> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the new Secure Score recommendation, we have several other recommendations related to Secure Score. We strongly advise you to check your security-related recommendations if you haven't done so yet. Please see below for the current list of recommendations for secure score:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enable password hash sync if hybrid: Password hash synchronization is one of the sign-in methods used to accomplish hybrid identity. Microsoft Entra Connect synchronizes a hash of the hash of a user's password from an on-premises Microsoft Entra Connect instance to a cloud-based Microsoft Entra Connect cloud sync instance. Password hash synchronization helps by reducing the number of passwords your users need to maintain to just one. Enabling password hash synchronization also allows for leaked credential reporting.&nbsp; 
 Protect all users with a user risk policy: With the user risk policy turned on, Microsoft Entra ID detects the probability that a user account has been compromised. As an administrator, you can configure a user risk Conditional Access policy to automatically respond to a specific user risk level.&nbsp; 
 Protect all users with a sign-in risk policy: Turning on the sign-in risk policy ensures that suspicious sign-ins are challenged for multifactor authentication (MFA).&nbsp; 
 Use least privileged administrative roles: Ensure that your administrators can accomplish their work with the least amount of privilege assigned to their account. Assigning users roles like Password Administrator or Exchange Online Administrator, instead of Global Administrator, reduces the likelihood of a privileged account being breached.&nbsp; 
 Require multifactor authentication for administrative roles: Requiring multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrative roles makes it harder for attackers to access accounts. Administrative roles have higher permissions than typical users. If any of those accounts are compromised, your entire organization is exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Ensure all users can complete MFA: Help protect devices and data that are accessible to these users with MFA. Adding more authentication methods like the Microsoft Authenticator app or a phone number, increases the level of protection if another factor is compromised.&nbsp; 
 Enable policy to block legacy authentication: Today, most compromising sign-in attempts come from legacy authentication. Older office clients such as Office 2010 don’t support modern authentication and use legacy protocols such as IMAP, SMTP, and POP3. Legacy authentication doesn’t support MFA. Even if an MFA policy is configured in your environment, bad actors can bypass these enforcements through legacy protocols. We recommend enabling policy to block legacy authentication.&nbsp; 
 Designate more than one Global Admin: Having more than one Global Administrator helps if you’re unable to fulfill the needs or obligations of your organization. It's important to have a delegate or an emergency access account that someone from your team can access if necessary. It also allows admins the ability to monitor each other for signs of a breach.&nbsp; 
 Do not expire passwords: Research has found that when periodic password resets are enforced, passwords become less secure. Users tend to pick a weaker password and vary it slightly for each reset. If a user creates a strong password (long, complex, and without any pragmatic words present), it should remain as strong in the future as it is today. It is Microsoft's official security position to not expire passwords periodically without a specific reason and recommends that cloud-only tenants set the password policy to never expire.&nbsp; 
 Enable self-service password reset: With self-service password reset in Microsoft Entra ID, users no longer need to engage helpdesk to reset passwords. This feature works well with Microsoft Entra dynamically banned passwords, which prevents easily guessable passwords from being used.&nbsp; 
 Do not allow users to grant consent to unreliable applications: To reduce the risk of malicious applications attempting to trick users into granting them access to your organization's data, we recommend that you allow user consent only for applications that have been published by a verified publisher.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find your Secure Score recommendations on Microsoft Entra recommendations portal by adding a filter on “Category” and selecting “Identity Secure Score” as shown below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to you leveraging these learnings and best practices for your organization. We’re constantly innovating and improving customers' experience to bring the right recommendations to the right people. In our future release, we’ll introduce new capabilities like email notifications to create awareness of new recommendations and delegation capabilities to other roles, and provide more actionable recommendations so you can quickly resolve them to secure your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  South Korea has a one million won minimum threshold for the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.  Crypto businesses must register with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit and comply with AML regulations to operate in the&nbsp;country.  The country has enacted several laws for crypto transaction transparency and asset protection.  <p>In South Korea, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) serves as the primary regulatory authority, overseeing the sector and ensuring <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">compliance with anti-money laundering (AML)</a> and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) obligations.</p><p>In this article, we will delve into the specifics behind the regulations, starting with the background of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a> in South&nbsp;Korea.</p> History of the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>In 2021, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission revised its AML-related law to align with the guidance of the international financial watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). With the<a href="https://law.go.kr/LSW/lsSc.do?menuId=1&amp;query=%ED%8A%B9%EC%A0%95+%EA%B8%88%EC%9C%B5+%EA%B1%B0%EB%9E%98#liBgcolor1"> amendments to the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information</a> Requirements of VASPs, the Crypto Travel Rule went into effect in South Korea in March&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Next year, in June 2023, the FSC passed <a href="https://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/pr010101/80317?srchCtgry=&amp;curPage=&amp;srchKey=&amp;srchText=&amp;srchBeginDt=&amp;srchEndDt=">a new law</a> aimed at enhancing transaction transparency, market discipline, and protection for cryptocurrency users. Under this law, the regulator has been granted the authority to supervise and inspect VASPs as well as to impose penalties. This legislative move targets the regulation of unfair trade practices and the protection of&nbsp;assets.</p> Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Under the country’s mandated AML law, both domestic and foreign VASPs are required to register with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) before commencing business operations.</p><p>To register, VASPs must obtain an Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) certification from the Korea Internet and Security Agency&nbsp;(KISA).</p><p>Further amendments to the AML-related law mandate the implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule for international virtual asset transfers over 1 million won (approximately $740 or €687). Any transfers above this threshold are limited to wallets verified by users and must be flagged by exchanges. Additionally, VASPs are required to verify customers’ identities and report any suspicious actions to the authorities.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>To register with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) and report their business activity, VASPs have to submit their registered company name, their representative’s details, the location of the business contact information, and bank account details. Moreover, VASPs must adhere to all measures prescribed by the Presidential Decree.</p><p>VASPs must also comply with AML regulations, which include the collection and sharing of information regarding customers’ virtual asset transfers exceeding KRW 1&nbsp;million:</p><p>- Name of the originator and beneficiary</p><p>- Wallet address of originator and beneficiary</p><p>Should the beneficiary VASP or authorities request further information, the following must be provided within three working days of the&nbsp;request:</p><p>- Originator’s customer identification number, personal document identity number, or foreigner registration number</p><p>In addition to Crypto Travel Rule compliance, AML regulations require VASPs to appoint a money laundering reporting officer (MLRO) and develop and implement comprehensive internal AML policies and procedures. These procedures necessitate conducting a company-wide risk assessment and performing Customer Due Diligence (CDD), along with Simplified Due Diligence and Enhanced Due Diligence, depending on the specific situation.</p><p>Moreover, AML obligations involve rigorous transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, record keeping, and reporting suspicious activity and transactions.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>When it comes to crypto exchanges, they are defined as business entities that engage in the purchase, sale, transfer, exchange, storage, or management of crypto, as well as the intermediation or brokerage of virtual asset transactions. Thus, South Korean VASPs cover exchanges, custodians, brokerages, and digital wallet service providers, and they all must comply with the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rules.</p><p>According to South Korea’s Crypto Travel Rule, transactions among individuals are regulated, and there are no rules regarding moving funds to and from self-hosted or non-custodial wallets. Local exchanges, however, have introduced varying rules for users when transacting with foreign exchanges, leading to confusion among&nbsp;users.</p><p>As per the new 2023 regulations that have yet to go into effect, VASPs are required to create real-name accounts with financial institutions and separate their customers’ deposits from their own to provide better user and asset protection. They are further required to have an insurance plan or reserves, maintain crypto records for fifteen years, keep records for five years, and be assessed for AML compliance with a financial institution.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>According to FATF’s latest report, <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Virtualassets/VACG-Snapshot-Jurisdictions.html">less than 30% of surveyed jurisdictions</a> worldwide have started regulating the cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>Of 58 jurisdictions, 33% (19), which includes the likes of Australia, China, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Ukraine, and Vietnam, have not yet passed or enacted the Travel Rule for VASPs.

<p>Data and AI are increasingly critical tools in how organizations are evolving their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/facilities-management">facilities management</a>. Real-time insights infused with AI support <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/tririga/space-management?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700077410979052&amp;p5=e&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsbDVpoamhAMVt29HAR2iOwyGEAAYASAAEgIz__D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">dynamic space planning</a>.

<p>As TRIRIGA continues to evolve, TAS will be the primary offering for new major enhancements. IBM and our partners are assisting clients in their migrations to help them take advantage of new technologies as they become available on TAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this blog post, we walk through the recommended options for running IBM TAS on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We discuss the architecture and describe how the IBM, Red Hat® and AWS components come together and provide a solid foundation for running IBM TAS. We also explore the architectural decisions to consider so you can choose the one that best fits your organization’s needs.&nbsp;</p>



 In this article, we cover three ways to run IBM TAS on AWS: &nbsp; 



 
 TAS on customer-hosted Red Hat® OpenShift®&nbsp; 



 TAS on customer-hosted Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA)&nbsp; 



 TAS Managed Services by Partners&nbsp; 
 



 1. TAS on customer-hosted Red Hat OpenShift&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>This deployment allows customers to use their in-house skilled team members with Red Hat OpenShift expertise, particularly in areas such as security, helping to ensure robust protection for their environment. Customers are responsible for the management of every aspect of this environment, which requires ongoing attention, maintenance and resource allocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This deployment gives customers maximum control over the application and infrastructure in exchange for greater responsibility for managing both. This option remains scalable, providing the flexibility to adjust resources according to fluctuating demand and optimizing efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The availability and reliability of the environment hinge upon the customer’s architectural design and proficiency in managing both Red Hat OpenShift and TAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The accessibility of version updates and extra features also depend on the customer’s software update plan for Red Hat OpenShift and TAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, since the environment runs on the customer’s AWS account, it draws down against their existing AWS Enterprise Discount Plan, which may bring some cost benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, while offering autonomy and scalability, this deployment option demands careful planning and management to help ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>



Figure 1: TAS on customer-hosted Red Hat OpenShift high-level architecture



 2. TAS on customer-hosted ROSA&nbsp; 



<p>The customer-hosted Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) deployment option for the TAS is a deployment tailored to simplify the user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This option reduces the customer’s operational burden, offloading all the (OpenShift) ROSA cluster lifecycle management—including upgrades and security hotfixes—to Red Hat and AWS teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This option allows customers to focus on the TAS application, with platform and infrastructure management and support provided by Red Hat and AWS teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach streamlines management and frees up customer resources for other critical tasks making it ideal for customers seeking to focus on their TAS application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the deployment maintains scalability, which allows seamless resource adjustments to accommodate varying demand levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this option, the customer has full control over TAS upgrades and deployed versions, allowing the customer to balance the software lifecycle with the deadlines and demands of their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The managed aspect of the ROSA platform also provides robust high availability and fault-tolerance guardrails <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rosa/latest/userguide/what-is-rosa.html">backed by 99.95% </a><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rosa/latest/userguide/what-is-rosa.html">service level agreement. This </a><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rosa/latest/userguide/what-is-rosa.html">SLA</a> is designed to satisfy your platform reliability and stability requirements, allowing uninterrupted service delivery for your TAS application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, since the environment operates within the customer’s AWS account, it draws down against their existing AWS Enterprise Discount Plan (EDP), bringing some cost benefits. The ROSA deployment option provides a compelling tool for customers who are focusing on TAS applications and offloading platform monitoring and maintenance to a managed service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Figure 2: TAS on customer-hosted ROSA high-level architecture 



 3. TAS Managed Services by Partners&nbsp; 



<p>The TAS Managed Services by Partners option offers a tailored solution designed to alleviate customers from the complexities of managing their TAS deployment. With this option, customers can sidestep the need to acquire Red Hat OpenShift skills, as the responsibility for managing Red Hat OpenShift falls upon the partners. The customer is no longer required to manage the platform or application as they engage with a fully managed service with the business partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This option allows organizations to focus on their core objectives while benefiting from the scalability inherent in the deployment, facilitating seamless adjustments to resources in line with fluctuating demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The availability, resilience and reliability of the environment are the responsibilities of the business partner subject to SLA with the partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customers also rely on partners for TAS version updates and the availability of added features, which might be subject to the partner’s offerings and timelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The environment operates within the partner’s AWS account, and the customers can only see and access the application endpoints for their business operations. The customer should know that their data exists and is controlled in the partner AWS account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The TAS Managed Services by Partners option presents a compelling proposition for customers seeking a streamlined, scalable and well-supported TAS deployment system.&nbsp;</p>



Figure 3: TAS Managed Services by Partners high-level architecture



<p>Note: The above architecture is generic. Actual architecture might vary based on the partner solution.&nbsp;</p>



 Closing thoughts&nbsp; 



<p>Each IBM TRIRIGA Application Suite deployment option presents distinct advantages and limitations. Customers should assess their infrastructure, customization, in-house skills and cost considerations to make an informed decision that helps ensure a successful and efficient IBM TAS deployment. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each option, customers can choose the deployment option that meets their business objectives.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The CA/Browser Form Code Signing Working Group has recently updated the Signing Service Requirements in the Code Signing Baseline Requirements (CSBRs) through <a href="https://cabforum.org/2024/01/18/ballots-csc-21-and-csc-22/">ballot CSC-21</a>.</p>
<p>The former Signing Service Requirements allowed for a model with risks for secure deployment. Upon receiving a Code Signing Request, the model would allow the Signing Service to perform CA functions, such as providing the Certificate Subscriber Agreement and performing applicant verification.</p>
<p>Definition of Signing Service</p>
<p>The new model requires the CA to provide the Subscriber Agreement and perform verification. The updated requirements now define the Signing Service as: “An organization that generates the key pair and securely manages the private key associated with the code signing certificate on behalf of the subscriber.” The primary focus is to support the subscriber and ensure that their private keys are generated and protected within a cryptographic module to control private key activation.</p>
<p>Advantages of Signing Services</p>
<p>Signing Services play a critical role in mitigating the primary risk of private key compromise for subscribers. Additionally, they provide simplicity by offering alternatives, such as using a subscriber-hosted cryptographic module. This eliminates the need for subscribers to install and configure a server crypto module or use tokens and drivers.</p>
<p>Compliance and Audit Requirements</p>
<p>In addition to providing Signing Service requirements, the CSBRs also provide audit requirements to ensure compliance and private key protection. Signing Services must undergo annual audits to meet the applicable requirements outlined in WebTrust for CSBRs and WebTrust for Network Security.</p>
<p>As your code signing solution partner, Entrust supports these updated requirements and offers <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/what-is-code-signing">Code Signing as a Service</a> for both OV and EV Code Signing Certificates.</p>

  <p>At our latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EGK57wwHfs&amp;t=1027s">Microsoft Ignite event</a>, we announced and demonstrated new capabilities within Microsoft Entra Internet Access, an identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG) solution capable of converging all enterprise access governance in one place. These capabilities unify identity and network access controls to help eliminate the security loopholes and manageability created by using multiple security solutions. This helps protect enterprises against malicious internet traffic and other threats from the open internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Secure access to all internet resources, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Microsoft 365 apps with an identity-centric SWG solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog, we highlight the advantages of Entra Internet Access’ web content filtering capabilities that work across all web-based internet resources and SaaS applications by leveraging the unified policy engine: Entra ID Conditional Access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Extend Conditional Access policies to the internet 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Internet Access extends the contextual sophistication of Conditional Access policies to enterprise SWG filtering. This enables you to&nbsp;apply granular web filtering for any internet destination based on user, device, location, and risk conditions​.&nbsp;The ability to&nbsp;apply different filtering policies​ (and in the future, threat protection policies, DLP policies, and more)&nbsp;based on various contexts and conditions is critical to address the complex demands of today’s enterprise. Bringing identity and network context together to enforce granular policy through Conditional Access is what makes Microsoft Entra Internet Access the first identity-centric SWG solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Filter web content to reduce attack surface&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Internet Access offers extensive web content filtering to prevent access to unwanted web content for enterprise users, using our client connectivity model, available for both Windows and Android platforms. We’ll soon add support for other OS platforms and branch connectivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering">web category filtering</a>, you can create policies using an extensive repository of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/reference-web-content-filtering-categories">web content categorization</a> to easily allow or block internet endpoints across categories. Category examples include liability, high bandwidth, business use, productivity loss, general surfing, and security, which includes malware, compromised sites, spam sites, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide even more granular application layer access control, you can create policies with ​​<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering">fully qualified domain name (FQDN) </a><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering">filtering</a> to identify specific endpoints to allow or block through standalone policy configuration or add exceptions to web category policies with ease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Microsoft Entra Internet Access, internet filtering policies are more succinct, readable, and comprehensive, helping to reduce the attack surface and simplifying the administrative experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Web content filtering</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Proactively set conditional security profiles&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security profiles make it easy to create logical groupings of your web content filtering policies (and in the future, treat protection policies, DLP policies, and more) and assign them to Conditional Access policies. Additionally, security profiles can also be organized with priority ordering, allowing imperative control over which users are affected by web content filtering policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Security profile Conditional Access integration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how that works. Let’s say only your finance department should have access to finance applications. You can add a block finance web category policy to your baseline profile (priority 65000) which is applied to all users. For the finance department, you can create a security profile (priority 200) that allows the finance web category and attach it to a Conditional Access policy enforced to the finance group. Because the security profile for allow finance is a higher priority than the baseline profile, the finance department will have access to finance apps. However, if a finance department user risk is high then their access should be denied. So, we create an additional security profile at a higher priority (priority 100) that blocks the finance web category and attach it to a Conditional Access policy enforced to users with high user risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Security profile priorities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our 2023 Ignite release reflects Microsoft’s desire to make your job easier by offering you a fully integrated security service edge (SSE) solution, including SWG, ​​Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection, Cloud Firewall, Network ​Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Microsoft Threat Protection capabilities. This is the first of many incremental milestones on our journey to help you protect your enterprise and your people. </p>

<p>Update: Azure AD Graph Retirement&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June of 2023, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> on completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. The service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will be done with incremental stages. In the first stage of this retirement cycle, applications that are created after June 30, 2024, will receive an error (HTTP 403) for any requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net/">https://graph.windows.net</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph. We are providing an optional configuration that will allow an application created after June 30, 2024, to resume use of Azure AD Graph APIs through June 2025.&nbsp; If you develop or distribute software that requires applications to be created as part of the installation or setup, and these applications will need to access Azure AD Graph APIs, you must prepare now to avoid interruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have recently begun rollout of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Microsoft Entra recommendations</a> to help monitor the status of your tenant, plus provide information about applications and service principals that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant. These new recommendations provide information to support your efforts to migrate the impacted applications and service principals to Microsoft Graph.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on Azure AD Graph retirement, the new recommendations for Azure AD Graph, and configuring applications created after June 30, 2024, for an extension of Azure AD Graph APIs, please reference <a href="https://aka.ms/AApjqqx">this post</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Important update: Azure AD PowerShell and MS Online PowerShell modules are deprecated&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/automate-and-manage-azure-ad-tasks-at-scale-with-the-microsoft/ba-p/1942489">described our plans</a> to invest in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK as the PowerShell experience for Entra going forward, and that we would wind-down investment in Azure AD and MS Online PowerShell modules. In June of 2023, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">announced</a> that the planned deprecation of Azure AD and MS Online PowerShell modules would be deferred to March 30, 2024. We have since made substantial progress closing remaining parity gaps in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, these PowerShell modules are deprecated:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview?view=graph-powershell-1.0">Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK</a> is the replacement for these modules and you should migrate your scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK as soon as possible. Information about the retirement of these modules can be found below. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Azure AD PowerShell, Azure AD PowerShell Preview, and MS Online will continue to function through March 30, 2025, when they are retired. Note: MS Online versions before 1.1.166.0 (2017) can no longer be maintained and use of these versions may experience disruptions after June 30, 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are making substantial new and future investments in the PowerShell experience for managing Entra. Please continue to watch this space as we announce exciting improvements in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server - 6-month notice &nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>Beginning September 30, 2024, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server deployments will no longer service multifactor authentication (MFA) requests, which could cause authentications to fail for your organization. MFA Server will have limited SLA and MFA Activity Report in the Azure Portal will no longer be available. To ensure uninterrupted authentication services and to remain in a supported state, organizations should <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-migrate-mfa-server-to-azure-mfa-user-authentication">migrate their users’ authentication data</a> to the cloud-based Azure MFA service using the latest Migration Utility included in the most recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55849">Azure MFA Server update</a>.

<p>Microsoft Entra Connect 2.x version retirement&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March of 2023, Microsoft started retiring past versions of Microsoft Entra Connect Sync 2.x 12 months from the date they were superseded by a newer version. Currently only builds 2.1.20.0 (release November 9, 2022) or later are supported.&nbsp; For more information see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-version-history#retiring-microsoft-entra-connect-2x-versions">Retiring Microsoft Entra Connect 2.x versions</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use Microsoft Entra Conditional Access to create and manage risk-based policies&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-entra/ba-p/3796395">announced</a> in October 2023, we invite customers to upgrade your legacy Entra ID Protection user risk policy and sign-in risk policy to modern risk-based policies in Conditional Access following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies#migrate-risk-policies-from-identity-protection-to-conditional-access">these steps</a> for a list of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies#migrate-id-protection-risk-policies-to-conditional-access">benefits</a>. The legacy risk policies are being retired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting May 1, 2024, no new legacy user risk policy or sign-in risk policy can be created in Entra ID Protection. To create and enable new risk-based policies, please use Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting July 1, 2024, existing legacy user risk policy or sign-in risk policy in Entra ID Protection will not be editable anymore. To modify them, please migrate them to Conditional Access following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies#migrate-risk-policies-from-identity-protection-to-conditional-access">these steps</a> and manage them there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start migrating today and learn more about risk-based policies at  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies">Microsoft Entra ID Protection risk-based access policies.</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 2024, users using unsupported versions of the My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension will experience breakages. If you are utilizing Microsoft Edge and Chrome extensions, you will experience no change in functionality. If you are using the unsupported Firefox versions of this extension, all functionalities will stop working in June 2024 (please note, Firefox support ceased in September 2021). Our recommendation is to use the Edge or Chrome versions of this extension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes in Dynamic Group rule builder&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To encourage efficient dynamic group rules, the dynamic group rule builder UX in both Entra and Intune Admin Centers has been updated. As of July 2024, the 'match' and 'notMatch' operators have been removed from the rule builder because they are less efficient and should only be used when necessary. However, we want to assure you that these operators are still supported by the API and can be written into rules via the text box in both admin centers. So, if you need to use them, you still can! Please refer to this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/groups-dynamic-membership#rule-builder-in-the-azure-portal">document</a> for instructions on how to write rules using the text box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional Access 'Locations' condition is moving&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting mid-April 2024, the Conditional Access ‘Locations’ condition is moving up. Locations will become the 'Network' assignment, with the new Global Secure Access assignment - 'All compliant network locations'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will occur automatically, admins won’t need to take any action. Here's more details:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The familiar ‘Locations’ condition is unchanged, updating the policy in the ‘Locations’ condition will be reflected in the ‘Network’ assignment and vice versa.&nbsp; 
 No functionality changes, existing policies will continue to work without changes.&nbsp;

<p>Microsoft Entra ID Protection: "Low" risk age-out&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As communicated <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/whats-new#plan-for-change---microsoft-entra-id-identity-protection-low-risk-age-out">earlier</a>, starting March 31, 2024, all "low" risk detections and users in Microsoft Entra ID Identity Protection that are older than 6 months will be automatically aged out and dismissed. This will allow customers to focus on more relevant risks and provide a cleaner investigation environment.

  <p>In June 2023, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> on the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle, and retirement (shut down) will be done with future incremental stages. In this update, we’ll provide more details about this first stage and a new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Entra recommendations</a> experience to help you identify applications that are using retiring Azure AD Graph APIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re committed to supporting our customers through this retirement with regular updates as we work through this change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Azure AD Graph retirement update 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After June 30, 2024, we’ll start a rollout for the first stage of Azure AD Graph retirement. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/application-model">Entra ID Applications</a> that are created after June 30, 2024 will receive an error for any API requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (https://graph.windows.net). We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph. We’re providing an optional configuration that will allow an application created after June 30, 2024 to use Azure AD Graph APIs through June 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you develop or distribute software that requires applications to be created as part of the software installation or setup, and these applications will need to access Azure AD Graph APIs, you must prepare now to avoid interruption. You will either need to migrate your applications to Microsoft Graph (recommended) or configure the applications that are created as part of software setup for an extension, as described below, and ensure that your customers are prepared for the change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications that are created before June 30, 2024 will not be impacted or experience interruption at this stage. Vendor applications consented in your tenant will also not be impacted if the application is created before June 30, 2024. Later in 2024, we’ll provide timelines for the following stage of the Azure AD Graph retirement, when existing applications will not be able to make requests to Azure AD Graph APIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How do I find applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Microsoft Entra recommendations</a> feature provides recommendations to ensure your tenant is in a secure and healthy state, while also helping you maximize the value of the features available in Microsoft Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve recently begun a rollout of two Entra recommendations that provide information about applications and service principals that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant. These new recommendations provide information to support your efforts to identify and migrate the impacted applications and service principals to Microsoft Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra recommendations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Configuring a new application for an extension of Azure AD Graph access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To allow an application created after June 30, 2024 to have an extension for access to Azure AD Graph APIs, you must make a configuration change on the application after it’s created. This configuration change is done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface. By setting the blockAzureADGraphAccess flag to false, the newly created application will be able to continue to use Azure AD Graph APIs until further in the retirement cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this first stage, only applications created after June 30, 2024 will be impacted. Existing applications will be able to continue to use Azure AD Graph APIs even if the authenticationBehaviors property is not configured. Once this change is rolled out (after June 30, 2024), you may also choose to set blockAzureADGraphAccess to true for testing or to prevent an existing application from using Azure AD Graph APIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Graph REST API examples: 
<p><br>Read the authenticationBehaviors property for a single application:</p>




<p>GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/afe88638-df6f-4d2a-905e-40f2a2d451bf/authenticationBehaviors&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set the authenticationBehaviors property to allow extended Azure AD Graph access for a new Application:&nbsp;</p>




<p>PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/afe88638-df6f-4d2a-905e-40f2a2d451bf/authenticationBehaviors&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content-Type: application/json&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set the authenticationBehaviors property to allow extended Azure AD Graph access for a new Application:</p>

<p>$params = @{&nbsp;</p>
<p>authenticationBehaviors = @{&nbsp;</p>
<p>blockAzureADGraphAccess = $false&nbsp;</p>
<p>}&nbsp;</p>
<p>}&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update-MgBetaApplication -ApplicationId $applicationId -BodyParameter $params</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens to applications using Azure AD Graph after June 30, 2024? &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Existing applications will not be impacted at this date. &nbsp; 
  Any applications created after June 30, 2024 will encounter errors (HTTP 403) when making requests to Azure AD Graph APIs, unless the blockAzureADGraphAccess attribute has been set to false in the authenticationBehaviors property for the application. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens in future retirement stages?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this update, we’ve discussed the first stage of Azure AD Graph retirement, starting after June 30, 2024. In the coming months, we’ll provide updates on the timeline for the second stage of Azure AD Graph retirement. In the second stage, we’re planning for all applications, including existing applications, to be blocked from using Azure AD Graph APIs unless they’re configured with the AuthenticationBehaviors property (blockAzureADGraphAccess: false) to enable extended access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A minimum of three (3) months of advance notice will be provided before this next stage of retirement. We’ll continue to provide routine updates as we work through this service retirement to provide clear expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current support for Azure AD Graph</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph APIs are in the retirement cycle and have no SLA or maintenance commitment beyond security-related fixes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Microsoft Graph 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph represents our best-in-breed API surface. It offers a single unified endpoint to access Microsoft Entra services and Microsoft 365 services such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Intune. All new functionalities will only be available through Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph is also more secure and resilient than Azure AD Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph has all the capabilities that have been available in Azure AD Graph and new APIs like identity protection and authentication methods. Its client libraries offer built-in support for features like retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication, and payload compression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What about Azure AD and Microsoft Online PowerShell modules?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, AzureAD, AzureAD-Preview, and Microsoft Online (MSOL) PowerShell modules are deprecated and will only be supported for security fixes. You should migrate these to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Please read more <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/bg-p/Identity">here</a>. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In 2021, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/automate-and-manage-azure-ad-tasks-at-scale-with-the-microsoft/ba-p/1942489">described our plans</a> to invest in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK as the PowerShell provider for Microsoft Entra and transition away from Azure AD and MSOnline PowerShell modules. In 2023, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">announced</a> that the deprecation of Azure AD and MSOnline PowerShell modules would occur on March 30, 2024. We’ve since made substantial progress closing remaining parity gaps in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, and as of March 30, 2024, these PowerShell modules are now deprecated:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should migrate your scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK as soon as possible. Information about the retirement of these modules can be found below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What happens to MSOnline and Azure AD Modules after March 30, 2024? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, Azure AD, Azure AD Preview, and MS Online PowerShell modules are deprecated. Support will only be offered for critical security fixes. They will continue to function through March 30, 2025. Note: Only MSOnline versions 1.1.166.0 (2017) and later are assured to function through March 30, 2025. Use of versions earlier than 1.1.166.0 may experience disruptions after June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Required Actions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Identify scripts in your environment that are using Azure AD or MS Online PowerShell modules.&nbsp; 
  Take immediate action to migrate scripts that are using MS Online versions below 1.1.166.0. If you’re not ready to migrate to Microsoft Graph PowerShell, you can update to the latest version of MSOnline PowerShell (<a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MSOnline/1.1.183.81">1.1.183.81</a>) to avoid impact after June 30, 2024. To inspect the version of MS Online module, you can use this PowerShell command:&nbsp;&gt; Get-InstalledModule MSOnline&nbsp; 
 Plan to migrate all MS Online (latest version) and Azure AD PowerShell scripts to Microsoft Graph by March 30, 2025. 
 Migrate these scripts to use Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.<br>&nbsp; 
 
<p>We’re making substantial new and future investments in the PowerShell experience for managing Entra. Please continue to monitor this space as we announce exciting improvements in the coming months.</p>

<p>In a world where every company is now a technology company, all enterprises must become well-versed in managing their digital products to remain competitive. In other words, they need a robust digital product lifecycle management (PLM) strategy. PLM delivers value by standardizing product-related processes, from ideation to product development to go-to-market to enhancements and maintenance. This ensures a modern customer experience. The key foundation of a strong PLM strategy is healthy and orderly product data, but data management is where enterprises struggle the most. To take advantage of new technologies such as AI for product innovation, it is crucial that enterprises have well-organized and managed data assets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Gartner has estimated that <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-data-governance-works/">80%</a> of organizations fail to scale digital businesses because of outdated governance processes. Data is an asset, but to provide value, it must be organized, standardized and governed. Enterprises must invest in data governance upfront, as it is challenging, time-consuming and computationally expensive to remedy vast amounts of unorganized and disparate data assets. In addition to providing data security, governance programs must focus on organizing data, identifying non-compliance and preventing data leaks or losses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 In product-centric organizations, a lack of governance can lead to exacerbated downstream effects in two key scenarios:&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 1. Acquisitions and mergers 



<p>Consider this fictional example: A company that sells three-wheeled cars has created a robust data model where it is easy to get to any piece of data and the format is understood across the business. This company is so successful that it acquired another company that also makes three-wheeled cars. The new company’s data model is completely different from the original company. Companies commonly ignore this issue and allow the two models to operate separately. Eventually, the enterprise will have weaved a web of misaligned data requiring manual remediation.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Siloed business units 



<p>Now, imagine a company where the order management team owns order data and the sales team owns sales data. In addition, there is a downstream team that owns product transactional data. When each business unit or product team manages their own data, product data can overlap with the other unit’s data causing several issues, such as duplication, manual remediation, inconsistent pricing, unnecessary data storage and an inability to use data insights. It becomes increasingly difficult to get information in a timely fashion and inaccuracies are bound to occur. Siloed business units hamper the leadership’s ability to make data-driven decisions. In a well-run enterprise, each team would connect their data across systems to enable unified product management and data-informed business strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How to thrive in today’s digital landscape 



<p>In order to thrive in today’s data-driven landscape, organizations must proactively implement PLM processes, embrace a unified data approach and fortify their data governance structures. These strategic initiatives not only mitigate risks but also serve as catalysts for unleashing the full potential of AI technologies. By prioritizing these solutions, organizations can equip themselves to harness data as the fuel for innovation and competitive advantage. In essence, PLM processes, a unified data approach and robust data governance emerge as the cornerstone of a forward-thinking strategy, empowering organizations to navigate the complexities of the AI-driven world with confidence and success.</p>

<p>In another devastating blow to data privacy, telecommunications behemoth AT&amp;T has disclosed a massive breach involving the personal records of over 73 million current and former customers. The compromised data, spanning names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, and account information, has surfaced on the dark web - a cybercriminal's paradise.</p><p>As AT&amp;T grapples with this crisis, the incident lays bare the vulnerabilities of centralized data storage systems employed by most major corporations. Holding troves of personal data in concentrated databases creates an enticing target for bad actors, jeopardizing the privacy and security of millions.</p><p>This is where decentralized identity solutions pioneered by the Bloom team come into play. By leveraging cryptography, Bloom eliminates the need to centrally store personal data, giving individuals full control over their information through self-sovereign digital identities.</p><p>With Bloom's decentralized approach, there is no honeypot of personal data for hackers to target. Instead, users manage their own encrypted data and share only verifiable credentials when needed, such as proof of identity or credit history. This selective disclosure minimizes the risk of mass data leaks.</p><p>In the wake of AT&amp;T's breach, customers are being advised to vigilantly monitor accounts and credit reports. However, had AT&amp;T utilized Bloom's decentralized model, the compromised data would be severely limited, if exposed at all. Eliminating centralized data storage reduces the attack surface and potential impact of breaches.</p><p>The Bloom ecosystem empowers users to own and fully control access to their personal information through blockchain-based identities and verifiable credentials. This capability could have prevented the indiscriminate exposure of 73 million AT&amp;T customer records.</p><p>As data privacy and security risks escalate, centralized data stores are becoming an outmoded, unacceptable liability. Bloom's decentralized identity solutions represent a paradigm shift - one that severs the reliance on centralized databases and transitions identity ownership to users themselves.</p><p>In today's digital landscape, the question is not if, but when, the next major company will suffer a crippling data breach. Widespread adoption of innovative, user-centric solutions like Bloom's decentralized identity is crucial to halt the onslaught of data privacy crises. The path forward involves empowering people with full ownership and control over their personal data through blockchain-enabled decentralized identity.</p>

<p>Building on our previous discussion about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2024/02/the-indispensable-role-of-trusted-platform-modules-in-distributed-id-and-payment-card-printers/">the pivotal role of Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) in securing distributed ID and payment card printers</a>, it’s important to delve deeper into strengthening security within distributed payment systems. There are many cutting-edge solutions and strategies that enhance security in distributed payment environments.</p>
 Advancements in Software for Payment Card Printers 
<p>The issuance of payment cards stands as a cornerstone of payment system security. As technology advances, however, the operating systems of these printers face new challenges. To address this, developers are crafting software capable of withstanding threats while adhering to standards such as <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">PCI DSS</a>. The implementation of such technologies ensures the protection of sensitive payment data, even amid future technological advancements.</p>
 
 Cloud Software: Opting for cloud-based software empowers financial institutions with robust security measures, including data encryption, access controls, and regular backups. Additionally, cloud solutions offer dedicated teams focused on maintaining security and compliance standards. 
 On-Premises Software: On-premises solutions afford organizations full control over their data and reduce dependency on internet connectivity. However, upgrading and migrating systems to newer software versions may pose challenges. 
 
<p>In today’s fast-changing technological world,, staying ahead is essential to ensure optimal performance, security, and compliance. Whether employing cloud or on-premises solutions, having a dedicated strategy for software control ensures systems remain up to date and secure.</p>
 Enhanced Physical Security Standards 
<p>In the realm of distributed payment systems, robust security standards are critical for protecting sensitive financial information and stopping new threats. As threats grow in distributed payment, organizations face more scrutiny and must follow strict compliance measures to keep their payment systems secure.</p>
 
 Protecting Personal Information on Ribbons: <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/datasheets/ifi-secure-ribbon-scramble-ds.pdf">Keeping personal and financial information printed on payment cards secure</a> is crucial in distributed payment environments. Following <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-208/subpart-F/section-208.61">strict bank security requirements</a> ensures the overall security and efficiency of financial institutions. 
 Bolt-Down Readiness: Securing valuable equipment by bolting it down to the mounting surface enhances physical security. 
 Physical Locks: Checking equipment for locks on important parts, such as card stocks and ribbons, ensures unauthorized access is prevented. 
 
<p>In an era marked by constant technological change and widespread payment transactions, securing distributed payment systems is vital. By embracing cutting-edge solutions such as <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/issuance-systems/software/adaptive-issuance-instant-financial">payment card issuance software</a> and implementing robust physical security features within payment card printers, organizations can stay ahead of evolving threats. Taking proactive measures and continually innovating are key to protecting payment systems and maintaining trust with consumers and businesses alike.</p>

  Unlike many other countries, Malaysia mandates the sharing of transaction data under the FATF Travel Rule with no minimum threshold.  VASPs must enforce strict AML and CFT compliance measures, including thorough customer due diligence to comply with the Travel Rule in Malaysia.  Companies must retain transaction records for seven years and present them to authorities when demanded.  <p>Malaysia, a Southeast Asia country with a population of 33 million, classifies crypto as a security and requires those involved in crypto activities to maintain the highest standards of compliance for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) by adopting FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> The Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Malaysia <p>In Malaysia, crypto is regulated by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SCM), which in 2019 published <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/api/documentms/download.ashx?id=8c8bc467-c750-466e-9a86-98c12fec4a77">the Capital Markets and Services Order</a>. This classified certain cryptocurrencies as securities, subjecting them to securities laws.</p><p>In April 2021, the Malaysian statutory body responsible for the development and regulation of capital markets in the country made amendments to <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/api/documentms/download.ashx?id=b682d829-38bc-4827-b48d-022726d75a17">officially introduce Travel Rule requirements in the region</a>. Then, in April 2022, the Crypto Travel Rule came into&nbsp;force.</p> What Does Travel Rule&nbsp;Mandate? <p>The Travel Rule mandates that crypto service providers share transaction information for digital assets, complying with AML regulations. This involves detailing both the sender and receiver’s information and implementing robust, risk-based policies and procedures.</p><p>To comply with the FATF Travel Rule, VASPs in Malaysia must appoint a compliance officer, train employees, and apply a risk-based approach tailored to relevant risk&nbsp;factors.</p><p>Additionally, crypto companies must conduct Customer Due Diligence checks, which entail identifying and verifying customers. Moreover, depending on the customer’s risk level, companies must carry out either Simplified Due Diligence (SDD) or Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).</p><p>Those involved in crypto-related activities are required to monitor transactions closely and perform sanctions and AML screenings, which involve checking if a customer is designated as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) or appears on sanctions lists. Additionally, they must report any suspicious transactions immediately.</p><p>The companies are also obligated to retain all records for a minimum period of seven years, making the data accessible to authorities upon&nbsp;request.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>When it comes to Malaysia’s Crypto Travel Rule requirements, the Originator VASP is required to collect and then share personally identifiable information (PII) with the Beneficiary VASP. Notably, Malaysia has no minimal threshold for reporting, mandating that information must be gathered and shared regardless of the transaction amount.</p><p>The personally identifiable information (PII) an originating VASP must collect, verify, and transmit from its customer includes:</p><p>- Name</p><p>- National registration identity card number or passport&nbsp;number</p><p>- Account number or unique transaction number to trace the transaction</p><p>- Address or date of birth and place of&nbsp;birth</p><p>When it comes to the beneficiary VASPs, they must collect the following customer information:</p><p>- Name</p><p>- Account number or unique transaction number to trace the transaction</p><p>The beneficiary VASP is required to have an effective risk-based procedure to monitor transactions and identify transfers lacking the required information. It must also have policies to determine when to execute a wire transfer lacking the required originator/beneficiary information or when to reject or suspend it. The beneficiary VASPs must also have the appropriate follow-up action to be&nbsp;taken.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Malaysia, a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) facilitates the buying, selling, or transferring of digital assets on behalf of its customers. In order to operate in the country and offer its services, the company must be Malaysian-incorporated and registered with the&nbsp;SCM.</p><p>Besides being locally incorporated, digital asset exchanges must have a minimum paid-up capital of RM5 million (approximately $1 mln). For an IEO applicant as well, the min. paid-up capital is RM5,000,000 (just over $1 mln). A digital asset custodian, meanwhile, is required to have a minimum paid-up capital of RM500,000 (approximately $107,000) and shareholders’ funds of RM500,000 that must be maintained at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>The exact criteria vary based on the type of services one provides, which can be found in the <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/api/documentms/download.ashx?id=942594d3-df78-42af-b2ee-186763fe4ea8">Guidelines on the Recognized Market</a>.</p><p>Moreover, in order to offer the services in Malaysia, VASPs must enforce the Crypto Travel Rule. These rules ensure the crypto company is fully compliant with AML and CFT regulations and provides a secure trading experience.</p><p>When it comes to cross-border transactions, the SCM applies the same scope of Travel Rule information-sharing obligations no matter whether the transaction involves a national or foreign counterparty.</p><p>As for the self-hosted, un-hosted, or non-custodial wallet requirements, the Malaysian regulator doesn’t specify anything.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>Only in the last few years has the implementation of the Travel Rule ramped up. So, it is still early in its adoption phase, and Malaysia is among a limited number of countries, including <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-kingdom">the UK</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">the US</a>, Germany, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-estonia">Estonia</a>, Gibraltar, Liechtenstein, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">Japan</a>, that have adopted the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Different countries interpret the FATF recommendation in their own ways, leading to varied requirements for VASPs. This results in differences in the specifics of the personal data to be collected during transactions, and the threshold, which the FATF sets at $1,000, varies by country. However, with no minimum threshold, unlike Canada (CAD 1,000), Germany (EUR 1,000), <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong (HKD 8,000)</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Singapore (S $1,500)</a>, Malaysia adopts a more stringent stance than other&nbsp;nations.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Overall, to comply with the FATF Travel Rule in Malaysia, VASPs must rigorously collect, verify, and share transactional and customer data, adhere to strict AML and CFT protocols, and maintain records to ensure transparency and security in the digital asset&nbsp;space.</p> FAQs  Q1: What’s the transaction threshold for the Travel Rule in Malaysia? <p>Malaysia has no minimum threshold for transaction reporting under the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Q2: What compliance measures must Malaysian VASPs implement? <p>Malaysian VASPs must enforce detailed AML and CFT compliance procedures, including thorough customer due diligence.</p> Q3: How long are transaction records required to be&nbsp;kept? <p>Transaction records in Malaysia must be maintained for seven years, making them accessible to regulatory authorities as&nbsp;needed.</p> Q4: What customer information do VASPs need to collect in Malaysia under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>VASPs in Malaysia are required to collect and verify customer names, identity numbers, account numbers, and addresses or dates and places of birth under the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> About Veriscope <p>Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on <a href="https://www.shyft.network">Shyft Network</a>, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>It’s no longer a question of whether AI will transform business and the workforce, but how it will happen. A <a href="http://s/">study</a> by the IBM® Institute for Business Value revealed that up to three-quarters of CEOs believe that competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With so many leaders now embracing the technology for business transformation, some wonder which C-Suite leader will be in the driver’s seat to orchestrate and accelerate that change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CHROs today are perfectly positioned to take the lead on both people skills and AI skills, ushering the workforce into the future. Here’s how top CHROs are already seizing the opportunity.&nbsp;</p>



 Orchestrating the new human + AI workforce&nbsp; 



<p>Today, businesses are no longer only focused on finding the human talent they need to execute their business strategy. They’re thinking more broadly about how to build, buy, borrow or “bot” the skills needed for the present and future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CHRO’s primary challenge is to orchestrate the new human plus AI workforce. Top CHROs are already at work on this challenge, using their comprehensive understanding of the workforce and how to design roles and skills within an operating model to best leverage the strengths of both humans and AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past, that meant analyzing the roles that the business needs to execute its strategy, breaking those roles down into their component skills and tasks and creating the skilling and hiring strategy to fill gaps. Going forward, that means assessing job descriptions, identifying the tasks best suited to technology and the tasks best suited to people and redesigning the roles and the work itself. &nbsp;</p>



 Training the AI as well as the people&nbsp; 



<p>As top CHROs partner with their C-Suite peers to reinvent roles and change how tasks get done with AI and automation, they are also thinking about the technology roadmap for skills. With the skills roadmap established, they can play a key role in building AI-powered solutions that fit the business’ needs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>HR leaders have the deep expertise in training best practices that can inform not only how people are trained for skills, but how the AI solutions themselves are trained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To train a generative AI assistant to learn project management, for example, you need a strong set of unstructured data about the work and tasks required. HR leaders know the right steps to take around sourcing and evaluating content for training, collaborating with the functional subject matter experts for that area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s only the beginning. Going forward, business leaders will also need to consider how to validate, test and certify these AI skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine an AI solution trained to support accountants with key accounting tasks. How will businesses test and certify those skills and maintain compliance, as rigorously as is done for a human accountant getting an accounting license? What about certifications like CPP or Six Sigma? HR leaders have the experience and knowledge of leading practices around training, certification and more that businesses will need to answer these questions and truly implement this new operating model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Creating a culture focused on growth mindset and learning&nbsp; 



<p>Successfully implementing technology depends on having the right operating model and talent to power it. Employees need to understand how to use the technology and buy in to adopting it. It is fundamentally a leadership and change journey, not a technology journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every organization will need to increase the overall technical acumen of their workforce and make sure that they have a basic understanding of AI so they can be both critical thinkers and users of the technology. Here, CHROs will lean into their expertise and play a critical role moving forward—up-skilling people, creating cultures of growth mindset and learning and driving sustained organizational change. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For employees to get the most out of AI, they need to understand how to prompt it, evaluate its outputs and then refine and modify. For example, when you engage with a generative AI-powered assistant, you will get very different responses if you ask it to “describe it to an executive” versus “describe it to a fifth-grader.” Employees also need to be educated and empowered to ask the right questions about AI’s outputs and source data and analyze them for accuracy, bias and more. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While we’re still in the early phases of the age of AI, leading CHROs have a pulse on the anticipated impact of these powerful technologies. Those who can seize the moment to build a workforce and skills strategy that makes the most of human talent plus responsibly trained AI will be poised to succeed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Discord Community Dynamics Challenge, centered around Ocean Protocol’s Discord server, provided a platform for an in-depth analysis of community interactions and their impact on essential ecosystem metrics, including the $OCEAN token price. The challenge, Spanning 1,645 days of data, began with the first server entry from ‘sheridan_oceanprotocol’ on August 20, 2019, and extended to the most recent contribution by ‘wanderclyffex’ on February 20, 2024. The dataset encompassed 84,754 entries, of which 15,696 were from GitHub bot feeds related to Ocean Protocol’s GitHub Page updates, covering various aspects of community engagement.</p><p>Key elements of each entry, such as channel, author ID, author, date, content, attachments, and reactions, were examined, along with daily $OCEAN token price data from May 4, 2019, to March 7, 2024. Participants explored the correlation between community activities and the $OCEAN token’s valuation, providing a comprehensive view of the server’s dynamics.</p><p>The challenge uncovered diverse trends and patterns across different timescales and categories, revealing insights into the community’s behavior and interests. Rankings, leaderboards, and categorization studies provided insights into the dynamics of community groups and interactions. Thematic discussions were analyzed to identify recurring topics and questions, highlighting the community’s interests.</p><p>Notable outcomes of this challenge are the development of a scam alert analysis procedure and a classification model capable of predicting next-day server statistics, utilizing historical data from the past three days or one week. Participants presented critical findings supported by visual narratives and in-depth discussions. They clarified the approaches and techniques, concluding with suggestions for future technological advancements, such as creating specialized Discord bots and AI assistants to enhance community server experiences.</p> Winners Podium <p>The top submissions for this challenge were outstanding. Participants displayed exceptional skills in leveraging AI and ML models to reveal the complexities of digital community interactions and their impact on the crypto market. The top three submissions are distinguished by their analytical depth, innovative approaches, and insightful predictions.</p><p>Dominikus Brian — 1st&nbsp;Place</p><p>Dominikus’ study on the Ocean Protocol Discord Server analyzed 84,754 entries over 1,645 days, integrating this with the daily $OCEAN token price to examine community engagement and market trends. The research involved a detailed temporal analysis of user activities to identify high-engagement periods, correlating these with significant cryptocurrency events. A key component was sentiment analysis, aiming to link the tone of community discussions with fluctuations in the $OCEAN token&nbsp;price.</p><p>The study also categorized users based on activity levels, identifying key community influencers. A significant technical achievement was developing a RandomForest classification model for scam detection. Additionally, the team employed machine learning models for predictive analysis, forecasting server statistics, and token prices. This approach showcased the potential of combining community data analysis with advanced AI techniques to gain insights into digital community behavior and its potential impact on market&nbsp;trends.</p><p>Anamaria Loznianu — 2nd&nbsp;Place</p><p>Anamaria conducted a comprehensive analysis, beginning with preprocessing a dataset of 84,754 records. She meticulously cleaned the dataset, removing irrelevant messages and bot interactions and extracting features like word and character counts and user reactions. After processing, she reduced the dataset to 30,883 entries spread across 17 columns, providing a rich source for analysis.</p><p>She first explored the general trends in the community, identifying patterns and outlier periods of high activity. This analysis revealed a significant upward trajectory in message volumes over time, suggesting an active and expanding community. She also conducted correlation studies between the $OCEAN token price and server metrics. However, these correlations showed weak relationships, suggesting that other factors might be more influential in server activity.</p><p>Owais Ahmad — 3rd&nbsp;Place</p><p>Owais’ report provides an in-depth analysis of the Ocean Protocol Discord Community, focusing on how the community’s interactions contribute to the advancement of data economy and Web3 vision. The study begins by examining the fluctuations in message volume from 2021 to 2024, revealing significant spikes in activity during certain months, indicative of the community’s evolving engagement. By analyzing different Discord channels, Ahmad identified the most popular ones and observed variations in their activity levels, reflecting the community’s diverse interests and responses to specific events or campaigns.</p><p>The approach involved looking at raw numbers and considering engagement quality, such as the days of the week when members are most active. The analysis also examined the correlation between the $OCEAN token price and community communication patterns. While noting a mild correlation, relying on message volume as a consistent predictor of token price movements was considered insignificant.</p> Interesting Facts  Scam Reports&nbsp;Analysis <p>The studies showed a somewhat even distribution of scam reports throughout the day, with a peak around 23:00, suggesting that scammers might target users during late-night hours. There was no definitive pattern across days of the week, although there was a slight inclination towards the beginning of the week for scam activities.</p> General Trends and&nbsp;Patterns <p>The Ocean Protocol Discord server saw rapid activity growth from 2019 to 2022, with a peak in the summer of 2022 and a decline in 2023. Data revealed user activities were more prominent from April to August than in other months. Notably, there was a record-breaking surge in user activity in early July 2022, likely due to the launch of Ocean V4 (“Onda”) and the Ocean Data Bounty&nbsp;program.</p> Correlation between $OCEAN Token Price and Server&nbsp;Metrics <p>There was a noticeable correlation between the $OCEAN token price and specific server metrics. Sentiment value and average word count per message were the most correlated metrics, with a positive Pearson correlation of 0.63 and 0.46, respectively. An increase in positive sentiment value often preceded a rise in the $OCEAN token&nbsp;price.</p> Technical Inquiries and Sentiment Analysis <p>The community shows a significant interest in technical aspects. This enthusiasm is evident in the many inquiries about blockchain, innovative contract development, and other technical issues. General information and price-related inquiries also showed varying degrees of sentiment.</p> Channel Popularity <p>The ‘General Chat’ and ‘Welcome’ channels were the most active, with more than 11,000 and 5,000 messages sent by 646 and 856 unique users, respectively. It demonstrates that these channels are vital hubs of community interaction.</p> 2024 Championship: <p>Each challenge offers a $10,000 prize pool divided among the top 10 participants. Furthermore, our championship points system distributes 100 points among the top 10 finishers in every event. In each challenge, a single championship point is worth&nbsp;$100.</p><p>By participating in challenges, contestants accumulate points toward the 2024 Championship.

<p>Authors: Yanisa Sunanchaiyakarn &amp; Nuttawut Kongsuwan, Finema Co.&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>This blog is the second part of the vLEI Demystified series. <a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-212349c09643">Part 1</a> of the series outlines different stakeholders, their roles, and six types of credentials that are involved in the trust chain and the foundational structures of the vLEI ecosystem. This part delves deeper into the qualifications and verification procedures that persons representing these organizations have to go through prior to the issuance of vLEI credentials.</p> Overview of vLEI Identity Verification <p>Before participating in the vLEI ecosystem, including obtaining and issuing vLEI credentials, the representatives of all organization stakeholders must undergo rigorous identity verification processes to confirm their legal identity.</p><blockquote>Note: Legal identity is defined as the basic characteristics of an individual’s identity. e.g. name, sex, place, and date of birth conferred through registration and the issuance of a certificate by an authorized civil registration authority following the occurrence of birth. [Ref: <a href="https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda/]">https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda/]</a></blockquote><p>With some exceptions, authorized representatives of each organization stakeholder are responsible for performing identity verification on representatives of organizations downstream within the vLEI trust chain. That is, GLEIF verifies qualified vLEI issuers (QVIs), QVIs verify legal entities (LEs), and LEs verify role representatives, as shown&nbsp;below.</p>The vLEI trust&nbsp;chain<blockquote>Note: The authorized representatives are the persons designated by an organization (either GLEIF, a QVI, or a legal entity) to officially represent the organization.</blockquote><blockquote>Note: There are two types of role representatives: official organization role (OOR) and engagement context role&nbsp;(ECR).</blockquote> GLEIF Authorized Representative (GARs) <p>GARs are controllers of the GLEIF Root AID, GLEIF Internal Delegated AID (GIDA), and GLEIF External Delegated AID&nbsp;(GEDA).</p><p>As the root of trust of the vLEI ecosystem, GLEIF established an internal process to verify their GARs, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2022-12-16_verifiable-lei-_vlei_-ecosystem-governance-framework-gleif-identifier-governance-framework_v1.0_final.pdf">GLEIF Identifier Governance Framework</a>. This includes:</p>  The policies and processes for the genesis events of the GLEIF Root AID, GIDA, and&nbsp;GEDA  Detailed identity verification process of all GARs where they mutually authenticate each&nbsp;other  Contingency plans such as a designated survivor policy as well as restrictions on joint travel and in-person attendance of meetings.   Designated Authorized Representative (DAR) <p>DARs are representatives authorized to act on behalf of a Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) or an&nbsp;LE.</p>  Identity verification on a QVI’s DAR is performed by an external&nbsp;GAR.  Identity verification on an LE’s DAR is performed by a&nbsp;QAR.   Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representatives (QARs) <p>A QAR is a representative designated by a QVI’s DAR to carry out vLEI operations with GLEIF and&nbsp;LEs.</p>  Identity verification on a QAR is performed by an external&nbsp;GAR.  <p>This process is detailed in <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-qualified-vlei-issuer-identifier-governance-framework-and-vlei-credential-framework_v1.3_final.pdf">Qualified vLEI Issuer Identifier Governance Framework and vLEI Credential Framework</a>.</p> Legal Entity Authorized Representatives (LARs) <p>An LAR is a representative designated by an LE’s DAR to request the issuance and revocation of LE vLEI credentials and Role vLEI credentials.</p>  Identity verification on an LAR is performed by a&nbsp;QAR.  <p>This process is detailed in <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-legal-entity-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Legal Entity vLEI Credential Framework</a>.</p> Role Representatives (OOR and ECR&nbsp;Persons) <p>A role representative, either an OOR or ECR person, is designated by an LAR to represent an LE in a functional or official organization role, respectively. The identity verification process for a role representative depends on whether an authorization vLEI credential is used, see <a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-212349c09643">Part 1</a> of the series for more&nbsp;detail.</p>  In the case where an authorization vLEI credential is used, identity verification on a role representative is performed by both a QAR and an&nbsp;LAR.  In a case where an LE issues a role vLEI credential directly without using an ECR authorization vLEI credential, identity verification of an ECR person needs to be performed by only a&nbsp;LAR.  <p>This process is detailed in the following documents:</p>  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-qualified-vlei-issuer-authorization-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorization vLEI Credential Framework</a>  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-legal-entity-official-organizational-role-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Legal Entity Official Organizational Role vLEI Credential Framework</a>  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-legal-entity-engagement-context-role-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Legal Entity Engagement Context Role vLEI Credential Framework</a>   Identity Verification Processes <p>The identity verification process of all representatives in the vLEI ecosystem includes two subprocesses namely:</p>  Identity Assurance Process, which verifies the veracity and existence of a legal identity, as well as binding the legal identity to a representative  Identity Authentication Process, which binds the representative to an autonomic identifier (AID)  <p>Once the identity verification process is completed, a vLEI credential may be subsequently issued to the AID that has been bound to the representative.</p>Illustration of the identity verification process Identity Assurance <p>The first stage of identity verification for the vLEI ecosystem is called identity assurance. This step involves an identity proofing process to verify the legal identities of all individuals prior to obtaining vLEI credentials. The vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) requires that Identity Assurance is performed according to Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) as defined in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">NIST SP&nbsp;800–63A</a>.</p><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized the identity proofing process in their Special Publication (SP) 800–63A. Although originating in the United States, SP 800–63A is one of the most influential standards for identity proofing and is widely referenced by various industries and governments worldwide.</p> Identity Assurance Level <p>NIST SP 800–63A has categorized the degrees of assurance in one’s identity into 3&nbsp;levels:</p>  Identity Assurance Level 1 (IAL1): The service provider is not required to validate or link the applicant’s self-asserted attributes to their real-life identity.  Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2): Either remote or physical identity proofing is required at this level. The applicant’s submitted evidence supports the real-world their real-world identity and verifies that the applicant is accurately linked to this identity.  Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3): Physical presence is required for the identity proofing process at this level. Identifying attributes must be verified by an authorized and trained service provider representative.  <p>Only IAL2 is relevant in the context of the vLEI&nbsp;EGF.</p> Identity Resolution, Validation, and Verification <p>Identity proofing in NIST SP 800–63A consists of three main components, namely:</p>  Identity Resolution: a process for uniquely distinguishing an individual within a given&nbsp;context.  Identity Validation: a process for determining the authenticity, validity, and accuracy of the identity&nbsp;evidence  Identity Verification: a process for establishing a linkage between the claimed identity and the person presenting the identity evidence.  <p>For example, an applicant for a vLEI credential could present a verifier with a set of required identity evidence. The verifier must resolve the applicant’s legal identity and validate that the presented information on the collected evidence is legitimate. Validation may involve confirming the information with an authoritative source and determining that there is no alteration to the images and data of the presented evidence. Subsequently, the verifier may verify the applicant by comparing the applicant’s live image with the one displayed on the provided identity evidence.</p> Identity Evidence Collection <p>During identity resolution and validation, the collection of “identity evidence” is required to establish the uniqueness of the individual’s identity.</p><blockquote>Note: Identity evidence is defined as information or documentation provided by the applicant to support the claimed identity. Identity evidence may be physical (e.g. a driver’s license) or&nbsp;digital.</blockquote><p>To comply with IAL2, one of the following sets of identity evidence must be collected:</p>  a piece of STRONG or SUPERIOR evidence if the evidence’s issuing source confirmed the claimed identity by collecting at least two forms of SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence before and the service provider validates the evidence with the source directly; OR  two pieces of STRONG evidence; OR  one piece of STRONG evidence plus two pieces of FAIR&nbsp;evidence  <p>NIST SP 800–63A defines five tiers of identity evidence’s strength: UNACCEPTABLE, WEAK, FAIR, STRONG, and SUPERIOR. While the strength of specific identity evidence, e.g., a driver’s license, may vary across jurisdictions, NIST provides <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/resolution/">examples of common evidence</a> and their estimated strength, based on their general quality characteristics, for instance:</p>  SUPERIOR: passports and permanent resident&nbsp;cards  STRONG: driver’s licenses and U.S. military ID&nbsp;cards  FAIR: school ID cards and credit/debit cards  <p>Further details on the ​​strengths of identity evidence can be found in Section 5.2.1 on the NIST SP&nbsp;800–63A.</p> Identity Authentication <p>After completing identity assurance, an organization representative who applies for a vLEI credential may proceed to identity authentication, which establishes a connection between the representative — whose legal identity has been assured to meet IAL2 — to an <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">autonomic identifier (AID)</a>.</p><p>Once such a connection has been established, a vLEI credential could be issued to the AID with confidence that the representative is the sole controller of the AID. Subsequently, the representative may cryptographically prove their control over the AID and the issued vLEI credential.</p><blockquote>Note: An autonomic identifier (AID) is a persistent self-certifying identifier (SCID) that is derived and managed by cryptographic means without reliance on any centralized entity or distributed ledger technology.</blockquote> Credential Wallet&nbsp;Setup <p>Before identity authentication can begin, a credential wallet must be set up for the organization representative. The primary role of a credential wallet includes:</p>  Creation, storage, and management of key&nbsp;pairs  Creation, storage, and management of&nbsp;AIDs.  Digital signature creation and verification  <p>The specification for a credential wallet is detailed in <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-technical-requirements-part-1-keri-infrastructure_v1.2_final.pdf">Technical Requirements Part 1: KERI Infrastructure</a>. The credential wallet must also be used during the live Out-of-band-Introduction (OOBI) session to complete the identity authentication process.</p><blockquote>Note: A credential wallet for vLEI credentials is essentially a KERI-compatible identity wallet. It must be compliant with three specifications currently being developed under the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation, namely, <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">KERI</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/#go.draft-ssmith-acdc.html">ACDC</a>, and <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a> specifications.</blockquote> Out-of-band-Introduction (OOBI)&nbsp;Protocol <p>The identity authentication process is implemented using the Out-of-band-Introduction (OOBI) Protocol, which is a protocol defined in the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/#out-of-band-introduction-oobi">ToIP Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) specification</a>. The OOBI protocol provides a discovery mechanism for verifiable information related to an AID — including its key event log (KEL) and its service endpoint — by associating the AID with a&nbsp;URL.</p><p>For example, an AID EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM may provide a service endpoint at <a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> with an OOBI URL&nbsp;of</p> http://www.example.com/oobi/EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM <p>The OOBI protocol is “out-of-band” as it enables any internet and web search infrastructure to act as an “out-of-band” infrastructure to discover information that is verified using the “in-band” KERI protocol. The OOBI protocol leverages the existing IP and DNS infrastructure for discovery so that a dedicated discovery network is not&nbsp;needed.</p><blockquote>Note: The OOBI by itself is insecure, and the information discovered by the OOBI must be verified using the KERI protocol.</blockquote><p>This OOBI URL may be used to discover the AID’s KEL as well as send messages to the AID, including sending a challenge message in a challenge-response protocol and sending a vLEI credential.</p> Challenge-Response Protocol <p>To establish a connection between a representative and an AID, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication">challenge-response protocol</a> is implemented to ensure that the representative holds the private key that controls the&nbsp;AID.</p><p>With the OOBI protocol, the verifier uses the OOBI URL as a service endpoint to deliver the challenge message to the AID controller. The verifier of an AID then generates a random number as a challenge message and sends it to the AID controller. The AID controller then uses the private key associated with the AID to sign a digital signature on the challenge. The signature is the response to the challenge message and is returned to the verifier. Finally, the verifier verifies the response using the public key of the&nbsp;AID.</p>Illustration of a challenge-response session Man-In-the-Middle Attack <p>However, there is a risk that an attacker could intercept the communication between the representative and the verifier in a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. Here, the attacker obtains the authentic OOBI URL, which contains the representative’s AID, and sends a false OOBI URL, which instead contains the attacker’s AID, to the verifier.</p>Illustration of a challenge-response session that is intercepted by a man-in-the-middle (MITM)&nbsp;attack. Real-time OOBI&nbsp;Session <p>To mitigate the risk of an MITM attack, the vLEI EGF specifies an authentication process that is called a real-time OOBI session that a representative and their verifier must complete before issuance of a vLEI credential.</p>An illustration of an OOBI&nbsp;session<p>During a real-time OOBI session, the representative and the verifier must organize a real-time in-person or a virtual face-to-face meeting, e.g., using a Zoom call. For a virtual face-to-face meeting, there are extra requirements as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The meeting must be continuous and uninterrupted throughout the entire OOBI&nbsp;session.  Both audio and video feeds of all participants must be active throughout the entire OOBI&nbsp;session.  <p>The OOBI session consists of the following steps:</p><p>1) The identity verifier performs manual verification of the representative’s legal identity, which has been verified during the identity assurance process. For example, if the representative had provided a passport as their identity evidence during identity assurance, they may present the passport to the verifier once again during their live&nbsp;session.</p><p>2) After the verifier confirms that the evidence is accurately associated with the representative present in the meeting, they must exchange their AIDs through an out-of-band channel. For example, OOBI URLs can be shared in the live chat of a Zoom call or shared via QR codes via video&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>3) The verifier sends a unique challenge message to cryptographically authenticate the representative’s AID.</p><p>4) The representative uses their private key that is associated with the AID to sign and respond to the challenge.</p><p>5) The verifier verifies the response using the public key obtained from the AID’s key event log&nbsp;(KEL).</p><p>6) The challenge-response protocol is repeated where the representative is now the challenger and the verifier the responder.</p> Group Real-time OOBI Session for QARs and&nbsp;LARs <p>For issuance of QVI and LE vLEI credentials, all QARs and all LARs of the candidate QVI and LE, respectively, must be present in the real-time OOBI&nbsp;session.</p>  For the issuance of a QVI vLEI credential, 2 External GARs and at least 3 QARs must be present during the real-time OOBI&nbsp;session.  For the issuance of a LE vLEI credential, 1 QAR and at least 3 LARs must be present during the real-time OOBI&nbsp;session.  An example authentication process of LARs by&nbsp;QARs<p>Once the Authentication steps are completed, the identity verifier can now sign the vLEI credential to the representatives of the vLEI candidate organizations. However, the vLEI credential issuance process cannot be completed by a single representative. To meet the required weight threshold of the multi-signature scheme stated in the vLEI EGF, another representative in control of the issuer’s AID must combine the authority and approve the vLEI issuance. For instance, a QAR may perform the required verification processes on all LARs of an LE and initiate the issuance of an LE vLEI credential. At least one other QAR must review and approve the issuance.</p> Conclusion <p>While the verification processes that applicants seeking vLEI credentials have to complete before the issuance might appear rather involved, these thorough steps to verify the identity of individuals representing organizations are crucial to safeguarding against identity theft, impersonation, and other fraudulent activities across various industries. After the identity assurance process validates the legal identities of representatives, and the identity authentication process cryptographically associates the representatives to AIDs. After identity verification, vLEI credentials may be issued with confidence, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the vLEI ecosystem.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-2-identity-verification-519102614b8e">vLEI Demystified Part 2: Identity Verification</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

In total, Alice will have received 244 OCEAN (144 soon, 100 in 4&nbsp;years).  Her return is approximately the same as if she’d used Passive DF &amp; Volume DF for 4 years and got 25% APY. That is: (1.25⁴-1) * 100 = 2.44 * 100. Yet this updated scheme benefits her more because her 144 of that 244 OCEAN is liquid&nbsp;soon.  <p>psdnOCEAN. psdnOCEAN holders will be able to swap back to the OCEAN with a fixed-rate contract. For each 1 psdnOCEAN swapped they will receive &gt;1 OCEAN at a respectable ROI. Details forthcoming.</p><p>Predictoor DF. In the event of a “yes”, Predictoor DF continues.

				  Transcripts, diplomas, and manual processing will soon be digitized, thanks to Open Badges and verifiable credential technology. Here’s how your organization can be ready.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable credentials</a> in education allow students to share their data with verifying parties — such as places of employment or universities — without the need to check in with the original source of that information, namely the school or college where they did their coursework or received their diploma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that administrators no longer need to go through the manual process of authenticating documents or contacting the school that an applicant is claiming to have graduated from, saving the administrator time, the university or business money, and the student or graduate both.</p>
<p>Immediate proof of degrees and accreditation&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJdJZftt17s">hosted a Meetup</a> with Jerry Henn, Assistant Executive Director of the United School Administrators of Kansas (USA Kansas). With 35 years of experience in education, Jerry is an expert in how schools run and the pain points administrators want to remove by turning to new technologies. Henn was excited about being able to actually prove skills and achievements; claiming to know something is one thing, but being able to instantly verify that someone is accredited by using cryptography is a huge time and money saver.</p>
<p>Prove specific skills with microcredentials</p>
<p>Henn was joined by Indicio’s VP of Business Development James Schulte to talk about what he learned from attending the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiyPLdxCKsw">1EdTech Digital Credential Summit</a>. And the headline was microcredentials, short, accredited courses that provide specific knowledge and skills, such as competence in a specific programming language, which are particularly relevant to professional development. Open Badges — particularly the verifiable credential version — simplify issuing, collecting, and verifying microcredentials. This makes it easier for an employer to assess a candidate’s qualifications, but it also helps to drive a continuous learning infrastructure.</p>
<p>Eliminate redundant paperwork and manual processes</p>
<p>Currently, authenticating a diploma requires contacting the school where it was issued, and having them dig through their records. This is a process that can take days, and can easily be delayed due to school holidays or other interruptions. This costs businesses time as they do their due diligence, makes job applicants wait longer, and requires time and physical effort by the university. Verifiable credentials allow you to trust data as if it were being presented by the original source. No more need to contact the school at all, if you can verify the credential you can move forward.</p>
<p>To learn more about the paperwork involved in school administration and how decentralized identity can help, <a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">read Why use decentralized identity and Open Badges in education</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t be left behind</p>
<p>Education administrators are already implementing this technology to save their students and faculty time and effort. Indicio recently <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-serves-verifiable-data-solutions-to-over-2000-school-administrators-with-new-partner-usa-kansas/">partnered with USA Kansas</a> to implement verifiable credentials to over 2,000 administrators; and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4cVQa-4yQc&amp;t=1s">see a demonstration</a> of just a few of the things that this technology can do for your organization today on the Indicio YouTube channel.</p>
<p>If you would like to discuss a use case for your organization, or think you might be ready to get started, please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us</a> and we will be in touch promptly.</p>

<p>Is your company using a patchwork approach to employee onboarding and offboarding? Or is everything in one place?&nbsp; Are you relying on a combination of HR tools, IT tools, spreadsheets, checklists, and communication across email and Slack?</p>
<p>YeshID gives you a simple, clean way to manage centralized and distributed Identity and Access Management (IAM). It’s centralized (everything in one place) and decentralized (workload doesn’t land on one set of shoulders). YeshID integrates with your existing HR and IT processes, regardless of complexity.</p>
 YeshID Simplifies Onboarding 
<p>When your new hire shows up, bright-eyed and ready to rock, the last thing you want to do is drain that enthusiasm. OK, it’s not the last thing. But never mind. You don’t want it to happen. Good news. You can use YeshID to create a smooth onboarding experience for new hires.</p>
 Scenario 1: No HR or Limited IT Integration 
<p>YeshID acts as your one-stop shop for managing both HR and IT tasks during onboarding. YeshID lets you create playbooks that include manual steps like ordering a laptop, sending company swag, compliance training, along with automated tasks like user provisioning in Google Workspace, assigning them to groups and departments, and coordinating access to other applications.</p>
<p>By centralizing the orchestration process in YeshID, you ensure a streamlined and organized onboarding experience for your new hires. By decentralizing–assigning tasks to people other than your unexpected IT person–you can get the work done faster and better.</p>
 Scenario 2: Existing HR Tool with Partial IT Provisioning 
<p>Maybe you’ve got an HR or IT tool that handles some basic IT provisioning. You probably know that it falls short if you don’t have the fancy enterprise license for all of your applications. And so you are back to a spreadsheet or document to handle the rest of your IT process.</p>
<p>But don’t worry! YeshID will seamlessly integrate with your existing process and will handle provisioning coordination (with the application owners) of the lower license tier applications that don’t have SAML/SCIM support.<br>
</p>
<p>If an HR tool creates a new user in Google Workspace, YeshID will send an alert to ensure that the rest of the onboarding takes place. You can then assign a pre-built playbook to coordinate the remaining tasks on your checklist.&nbsp;</p>
 YeshID: The Advantages 
 
 Simple Setup: Get started with YeshID in minutes, not days or weeks. 
 Flexible Workflows: YeshID adapts to your existing processes, allowing you to handle manual and automated tasks regardless of license type. 
 Effortless Compliance: YeshID simplifies compliance by centralizing access requests and approvals, ensuring a clear audit trail. 
 Enhanced Security: YeshID reduces human error and improves security by tracking identity life cycles and permissions so that offboarding is mistake-free. 
 Happy Teams: YeshID empowers your team with clear processes, reduces busy work, and frees them to focus on strategic tasks. 
 
 Ready to Streamline Your Onboarding Process? 
<p>YeshID is the key to a smoother, more secure, and more efficient employee onboarding experience. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Get started today</a> and see the difference YeshID can make for your organization.</p>

 Dawn of the DID: Part&nbsp;3  Embracing the Digital Identity Revolution <p>In today’s digital age, our online identities are as integral to our lives as our physical identities. Yet, as we navigate the vast digital landscape, the security and sovereignty of these digital selves often feel just out of reach. Enter blockchain technology, a beacon of hope in the quest for a secure and autonomous digital identity, promising a future where we hold the reins of our online personas.</p><p>Blockchain is not just a technological innovation; it’s a paradigm shift in how we manage and protect our digital identities. By offering a decentralized and immutable ledger, blockchain technology introduces a new era of security, privacy, and user control. This marks the beginning of a revolution, one where our digital identities are both safeguarded and truly our&nbsp;own.</p> Understanding Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Our digital identity is an amalgamation of all the digital footprints we leave behind — email addresses, social media profiles, and even our online shopping habits. These bits of data paint a picture of who we are online but are scattered across the vast expanse of the internet, often under the stewardship of various online platforms. The challenge here is twofold: ensuring the security of this scattered identity and reclaiming control over how it’s used and by&nbsp;whom.</p><p>In the traditional setup, our digital identities are not fully in our control. Instead, they’re often managed by central authorities or platforms, making them susceptible to breaches, misuse, and privacy invasions. This centralized approach not only poses significant security risks but also strips individuals of their privacy and control over their own identities. The need for a shift towards a more secure, user-controlled identity system is&nbsp;clear.</p> Blockchain to the&nbsp;Rescue <p>Blockchain technology emerges as the hero in the narrative of digital identity, offering a solution that is as secure as it is revolutionary. With its decentralized nature, blockchain acts as a digital ledger that is distributed across a network, rather than being stored in a single location. This not only makes it nearly impervious to hacking but also ensures that no single entity can claim undue control over the system. The implications for digital identity are profound, promising a future where our online selves are both protected and autonomous.</p><p>The decentralized approach of blockchain brings the power back to the user, offering a level of security and privacy that centralized systems simply cannot match. By storing identity data across a network, blockchain makes unauthorized access and identity fraud exponentially more difficult. Moreover, it gives individuals the ability to manage and control their own digital identities, marking a significant step towards a future where online privacy and user sovereignty are the norms, not the exceptions.</p> The Mechanisms of Blockchain in Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Blockchain secures digital identities through cutting-edge technologies like public-private key encryption. Imagine sending a locked box through the mail, where the recipient has the only key; this is the essence of public-private key encryption. The public key is widely available, allowing anyone to encrypt information, but the private key is held only by the recipient, ensuring that only they can decrypt and access the information. This mechanism is at the heart of blockchain’s ability to secure digital identities, ensuring that only the rightful owner can access and control their identity.</p><p>Smart contracts further enhance the security and efficiency of digital identities on the blockchain. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts automate and secure transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the potential for fraud. This technology not only streamlines transactions but also fortifies the trust and integrity of digital interactions, making blockchain an indispensable tool in the management of digital identities.</p> Real-World Applications and&nbsp;Benefits <p>The practical applications of blockchain in managing digital identities are as diverse as they are transformative. From securing personal medical records to ensuring the integrity of online voting systems, blockchain technology is already reshaping how we interact with the digital world. These applications not only demonstrate blockchain’s versatility but also highlight its potential to enhance security, privacy, and trust in digital transactions. By providing a secure platform for managing digital identities, blockchain paves the way for more efficient, transparent, and user-centric online services.</p><p>Beyond its practical applications, blockchain offers profound benefits for individual users. It empowers users with greater control over their personal information, ensuring that they decide who has access to their data and how it is used. This shift towards user-centric identity management represents a significant move away from the vulnerability and lack of control that characterize traditional digital identity systems. With blockchain, users enjoy enhanced privacy, reduced risk of identity theft, and a newfound sense of agency over their digital&nbsp;selves.</p> Empowering Users Through Blockchain <p>Blockchain technology doesn’t just protect; it empowers. By enabling the concept of self-sovereign identities, blockchain allows individuals to own and directly control their digital identities without the need for intermediaries. This empowerment extends beyond mere control over personal data; it fosters a digital environment where trust is built into the system, and users can engage in transactions with confidence. The impact of such a shift is profound, offering a blueprint for a digital society where privacy, security, and individual autonomy are paramount.</p><p>The empowerment provided by blockchain is a catalyst for innovation, opening doors to new ways of interacting in the digital realm that were previously unimaginable. From streamlining financial services to revolutionizing how we verify credentials and qualifications, the potential for growth and development is limitless. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, so too does the landscape of digital identity, promising a future where our online lives are not only secure but also more seamlessly integrated with our physical realities.</p> The Future Is Decentralized <p>As we stand on the cusp of a new era in digital identity management, the role of blockchain technology cannot be overstated. It heralds a future where the security, privacy, and control of digital identities are not just improved but reimagined. The journey toward a decentralized digital world is filled with promise, offering a vision of the internet where trust is inherent, and user empowerment is the standard. The path forward is clear: a future where our digital identities are as secure, sovereign, and uniquely ours as our physical&nbsp;ones.</p> Join the Revolution <p>The blockchain revolution is here, and it’s redefining what it means to own your digital identity. We invite you to dive deeper into the world of blockchain, explore its potential, and become part of the movement towards secure, decentralized digital identities. Whether you’re a seasoned expert in the realm of Web3 or just starting to explore the possibilities, your voice and your actions can help shape this exciting future. Together, we can build a digital world that respects privacy, security, and individual autonomy. Join us in paving the way toward a more secure, decentralized digital&nbsp;future.</p> A Quote or Thought to&nbsp;Ponder <blockquote>“In the end, it’s not the technology that changes the world; it’s how we use&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><p>As we embrace the possibilities that blockchain technology brings to digital identity management, let’s remember that technology is a tool — one that, in the right hands, has the power to transform lives, societies, and the world at large. The future of digital identity is not just about securing data; it’s about empowering individuals, fostering trust, and building a digital world that values and protects the identity of every user. As we move forward, let’s use this powerful tool to create a legacy of empowerment, security, and trust — a legacy that future generations will thank us&nbsp;for.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/blockchains-role-in-digital-identity-40e8b646a2fc">Blockchain’s Role in Digital Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Written by Fission's <a href="https://github.com/bgins">Brian Ginsburg</a> and <a href="https://zee.town/">Zeeshan Lakhani</a> and published on March 27th, 2024.</p><p>The <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> is a decentralized platform that aims to distribute computational tasks across a vast, open network. This network spans from your personal machine to other devices on your LAN, a cluster of cloud nodes, and even to PoPs (points of presence) located at the edge of the Internet. Processing happens as close to the data source as possible, scheduled on nodes with general capacity or those with specialized capabilities like high-powered GPUs.</p><p>At its core, the Everywhere Computer is built on the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM)</a> protocol. It executes workflows containing tasks that are content-addressed—which means they're uniquely identified by their content rather than by their location. This system is powered by nodes running Fission's <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/">Homestar runtime</a>, an engine that runs WebAssembly (Wasm) based workflows composed of <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">Wasm components</a> with runnable functions that can be scheduled and executed by any Homestar peer throughout the network.</p><p>Beyond the sandboxing, portability, and predictable performance benefits of Wasm, we're excited about orchestrating workflows and state machines composed of modules compiled from different source languages and bringing them together into workflows where the output of one task feeds into the input of another. Composing components in a workflow lets users focus on component interfaces without considering interactions between multiple languages.</p>Tasks that wrap functions are published by content identifier (CID), and distributed and executed by nodes running Homestar<p>With the Everywhere Computer, we're all in on <a href="https://youtu.be/dhoVlVu2XAw?si=x1YIQk-9Jkg_FphP">"the return of write once, run anywhere"</a> as a motto, but with content-addressing and our focus on caching and replayability of previously computed tasks, we can go a step further and say:</p><blockquote>Write once, run once, and never run again (everywhere!)</blockquote><p>This post will introduce authoring Wasm components and functions for the Everywhere Computer. Wasm components can be written in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-guest-languages">several different programming languages</a>— including C/C++, Java (TeaVM Java), Go (TinyGo), and C#—but we'll focus on Rust, JavaScript, and Python for this post. We'll be writing functions in each of these languages, compiling and packaging them as Wasm components, and bringing them together into a workflow that executes on our compute platform. Along the way, we'll introduce Wasm component tooling, the Homestar runtime, and <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/everycli/">EveryCLI</a>, which provides a convenient interface for running Homestar with a gateway for preparing and executing workflows.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer is in beta. The <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer">GitHub repositories</a> and <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/">docs</a> are publicly available and open-source licensed. We have a closed beta group to provide high-quality support and to gather feedback. <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Sign up</a> for the beta group. We would love to hear what you are working on and what ideas you have for using the Everywhere Computer!</p><p>This post is a high-level overview that can be used a companion to the code in the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024">everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024</a> repository. We won't cover every detail in this overview, so clone this repository if you would like to follow along.</p> Background: Wasm components, WIT, &amp; WASI logging <p>Evolution within the Wasm ecosystem is happening at a wicked fast pace, particularly now that the <a href="https://youtu.be/phodPLY8zNE">path to Wasm components</a> has been streamlined and standardized, module-to-module interop is trivial.</p><p>In the Everywhere Computer, we decided to use the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/CanonicalABI.md">Canonical ABI</a> to convert between the values and functions exposed by components written using the Component Model and those provided by <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/">Core WebAssembly</a> modules instead of imposing a custom ABI upon our users. A component is just a wrapper around a core module that specifies its imports, internal definitions, and exports using interfaces defined with the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md">Wasm Interface Type (WIT)</a> IDL format.</p><p>Unlike core modules, components may not export Wasm memory, reinforcing Wasm sandboxing and enabling interoperation between languages with different memory assumptions. For example, a component that relies on Wasm-GC (garbage collected) memory compiled from a dynamic language can seamlessly interact with a component compiled from a static language using linear memory.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer strives for <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">simplicity</a>. By adopting the Component model and its tooling (for example, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component">cargo-component</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen">wit-bindgen</a>), we can run workflows combining components from different languages without handling arbitrary Wasm modules or introducing custom tooling, bindgens, or SDKs for our ecosystem.</p><p>In addition, while our Homestar runtime utilizes alternate formats as internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">intermediate representations</a>, by adopting WIT, we can <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/tree/main/homestar-wasm#interpreting-between-ipld-and-wit">interpret</a> between WIT values and other data models at runtime without exposing these internal formats to function writers.</p> Embedding Wasmtime <p>The Homestar runtime embeds the <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/">Wasmtime</a> runtime to execute Wasm components associated with tasks in a workflow. The Wasmtime runtime is built and maintained by the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">Bytecode Alliance</a>. It provides multi-language support and fine-grained configuration for CPU and memory usage.</p><p>Wasmtime is at the forefront of the Wasm ecosystem, which includes their support of the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) stack that recently reached <a href="https://blog.sunfishcode.online/wasi-0-2/">WASI Preview 2</a>. WASI gives library developers and implementers like us lower-level primitives for working with files, sockets, and HTTP with a stable set of common interfaces to build on.</p><p>Some of the other platforms and frameworks that have adopted Wasmtime include <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/blog/wasmtime-a-standardized-runtime-for-wasmcloud">wasmCloud</a>, <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/spin">Spin</a>, and <a href="https://www.fastly.com/products/compute">Fastly Compute</a>.</p> WIT <p>In the following sections, we will use WIT interfaces to define the types of our functions and a <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#worlds">world</a> to describe the imports and exports associated with each Wasm component. Then, we will implement the interfaces in Rust, JavaScript, and Python.</p><p>WIT provides built-in types, including primitives like signed/unsigned integer types, floats, strings, and more interesting and complex types like results, options, and lists. WIT also provides a way to define custom, user-defined types like records, variants, and enums. Homestar supports all of these WIT types internally (except <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#resources">resources</a>, which we do not permit in guest code) when translating between other formats and data structures.</p> WASI Logging <p>EveryCLI reports logs executed by guest programs running on the Homestar host runtime. To emit log messages, Homestar implements the proposed <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-logging/tree/main">WASI logging WIT interface</a> which exposes the <code>log</code> method to function writers for integration into their programs. As we'll demonstrate later in this post, when you call <code>log</code> in your guest code, EveryCLI will display logs in a console at a specified level of verbosity and with contextual information.</p><p>In addition, EveryCLI provides detailed information that reports workflow events and runtime execution errors.</p> Writing Functions <p>In this post, we will write arithmetic operations in each source language to keep our example code simple. Our Rust program will perform addition and division, the JavaScript one will perform subtraction, and the Python program will perform multiplication. We will use division to show division by zero error reporting.</p><p>Our functions will be compiled into Wasm components using tools from or built upon the excellent work of the Bytecode Alliance. The Wasm component ecosystem is evolving quickly, so keep in mind that the techniques described in this blog post may be out of date. We'll provide links so you can check on the latest developments.</p><p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024">writing-functions-blogpost-2024</a> repository if you would like to follow along. The repository includes instructions for installing dependencies, tooling, and compiling components for each language. We will use <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/everycli/">EveryCLI</a> to run workflows that call the functions in these components.</p> Rust <p>For writing a function in Rust, we will use <code><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component">cargo component</a></code> to generate a Wasm component. If you're following along with the code examples, please run the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/tree/main/rust#setup">Rust setup</a> instructions.</p><p><code>cargo component</code> imagines what first-class support for WebAssembly components might look like for Rust.

Let's run these functions together in some workflows!</p><p>Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@everywhere-computer/every-cli">EveryCLI</a>, and then we'll write a workflow:</p> <code>npm i -g @everywhere-computer/every-cli
</code> <p>Homestar and the Everywhere Computer currently use <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/command-line-quick-start/">IPFS Kubo</a> as a content-addressed storage layer for Wasm components. In the near future, we'll support other forms of distributed storage.</p><p>EveryCLI starts a gateway that loads Wasm components onto IPFS, prepares workflows, and calls on the Homestar runtime to schedule and execute them.</p><p>EveryCLI provides a simplified workflow syntax that it uses to prepare the underlying workflow. Let's start by using <code>math.wasm</code> in <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/add.json">a workflow</a> to add two numbers:</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "add",
        "input": {
          "args": [3.1, 5.2],
          "func": "add"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/add.json<p>A workflow is an array of tasks that we would like to execute. Each task is given a <code>name</code>, which will be used to reference results in subsequent tasks. Our task <code>input</code> includes the name of the function to execute and its arguments.</p><p>Let's run this workflow! Start EveryCLI with <code>math.wasm</code> as an argument:</p> <code>every dev rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/math.wasm
</code> <p>EveryCLI starts a gateway that we can query for a JSON Schema representing the WIT interfaces in <code>math.wasm</code> at <code>localhost:3000</code>.</p><p>Post the workflow to the gateway:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/add.json
</code> <p>The response reports the result of adding <code>3.1</code> and <code>5.2</code> as <code>8.3</code>.</p><p>In addition, EveryCLI has passed along logs from the Homestar runtime:</p>Logs on running the add workflow<p>The logs report information about workflow execution and include our WASI logs. Our WASI log reports <code>"3.1 + 5.2 = 8.3"</code> with the category <code>guest:rust:add</code>. WASI logs always have the <code>wasm_execution</code> subject.</p><p>We can also see workflow settings, fetching resources (our Wasm components), initializing, starting, and completing the workflow. The "resolving receipts" log shows that Homestar is looking for cached results so it can avoid work where possible. The "computed receipt" log reports the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">CID</a>, a content identifier derived from the content's cryptographic hash, of the receipt from the add computation. EveryCLI returns the workflow result, but the computed receipts can be also used to pull results directly from IPFS by CID.</p><p>If we post the workflow to the gateway again, we see a different set of logs:</p>Logs on replaying the add workflow<p>This time we don't need to do any work. Homestar cached the receipts from our last run and reports that it is replaying the workflow and its receipts.</p><p>Notice also that our WASI log does not show up. WASI logging happens only on execution, not replay. We'll see in a moment how we can force re-execution to always see WASI logs.</p><p>Let's try <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/all.json">a workflow</a> that uses all four arithmetic operations from our Rust, JavaScript, and Python-sourced components:</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "add",
        "input": {
          "args": [3.1, 5.2],
          "func": "add"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "subtract",
        "input": {
          "args": ["{{needs.add.output}}", 4.4],
          "func": "subtract"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "multiply",
        "input": {
          "args": ["{{needs.subtract.output}}", 2.3],
          "func": "multiply"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "divide",
        "input": {
          "args": ["{{needs.multiply.output}}", 1.5],
          "func": "divide"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/all.json<p>In this workflow, each task except the first receives input from the previous task. For example, <code>subtract</code> awaits the output of <code>add</code> by using <code>{{needs.add.output}}</code> as a placeholder that will be filled in when <code>add</code> has completed.</p><p>Restart EveryCLI, passing in all of our Wasm components:</p> <code>every dev rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/math.wasm javascript/output/subtract-j54di3rspj2eewjro4.wasm python/output/multiply.wasm --debug
</code> <p>The hash of your subtract Wasm component may be different. Check <code>javascript/output</code> for the appropriate file name.</p><p>We use the <code>--debug</code> flag this time to force re-execution of the tasks in our workflow. The <code>--debug</code> flag lets us see our WASI logs on every run while we are developing our functions, but it should not be used in production because it eliminates the benefits of caching.</p><p>Post this workflow:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/all.json
</code> <p>The response reports a result of <code>5.98</code> which looks close enough for computer math!</p><p>Our WASI logging reports each operation:</p>Logs on running all operations workflow<p>We can see WASI logs from each component, labeled by category as <code>guest:rust:add</code>, <code>guest:javascript:subtract</code>, <code>guest:python:multiply</code>, and <code>guest:rust:divide</code>.</p><p>Lastly, <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/division_by_zero.json">a workflow</a> that attempts division by zero to check our error reporting.</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "divide",
        "input": {
          "args": [3.1, 0.0],
          "func": "divide"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/division_by_zero.json<p>Post this workflow:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/division_by_zero.json</code> <p>On running this workflow, we see two errors:</p>Logs on running division by zero workflow<p>The first error is our WASI log reporting a "Division by zero error". The second error is an execution error from the Wasm runtime. It's a bit inscrutable, but we can see "not able to run fn divide" which tells us which function failed.</p> Conclusion <p>In this post, we have introduced the Everywhere Computer and how you can get started writing functions and workflows for it.</p><p>So far, to execute workflows, we've used <code>curl</code> to POST manually constructed JSON workflows to the gateway. You may have noticed from the EveryCLI starts a Control Panel web interface:</p>The Control Panel running<p>For a demo of how the Control Panel works, including its graphical workflow builder and custom function schema forms, check out our <a href="https://youtu.be/M6n2dhjmYes?si=1WkIsiMQth_qJAsn&amp;t=943">February 2024 overview video</a>.</p><p>We have much more to share! We will write about the Control Panel, offloading compute to other nodes in a network based on their capability or a scheduling policy, and working with non-determinism like network requests and persistent state in a workflow in future posts.</p> Acknowledgments <p>We want to offer heartfelt thanks to those developing Wasmtime, ComponentizeJS, Componentize-Py, and the many tools available throughout the Wasm ecosystem. We're ecstatic to be part of this community and to be building on top of these platforms.

Introduction: Towards Decentralized Artificial Superintelligence <p>Speed of AI. With the release of the latest LLMs, the pace of innovation in AI has noticeably accelerated from its already fast pace. It’s now a torrent of innovation that every single startup, decentralized project and large multinational must come to terms&nbsp;with.</p><p>Decentralized AI. As three of the longest serving OG teams of the decentralized AI world, committed to open and beneficial AI, committed to decentralization and striving to build exit ramps away from centralized monopolies; we aim to give AI researchers, companies and governments an alternative that doesn’t lock them into walled gardens and silos to tilt to a particular bias, or worse, allow the risk of user de-platforming and the loss of their intellectual property, social graph and followers.</p><p>The need for scale. The resources needed to win this competition are immense. We joked internally that we are the “Rebel Alliance” against the large platforms — but it’s actually no joke. The world needs a full, vertically integrated stack of decentralized tools to harness and leverage AI, and give users an alternative in case the monopolies no longer serve the needs of all&nbsp;users.</p> Why NOW? <p>AI is not only moving fast, it’s accelerating. AGI and ASI loom&nbsp;near.</p><p>Artificial General Superintelligence (AGI) — when an AI system can perform all human tasks at least a human level of competence — looms near. The acceleration will continue past AGI, straight to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) when AI systems perform at far-beyond human levels of competence.</p><blockquote>It is imperative for humanity that artificial superintelligence is fundamentally decentralized.</blockquote><p>Not just “don’t be centralized” but can’t be centralized. Artificial superintelligence must be decentralized across the whole technology stack: from the network infrastructure, to AI infrastructure software (agents, data), to AI models &amp; prediction.</p><p>We at Fetch, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET have been leading decentralized AI for the past seven years. In fact, the founders of each have been driving AI for decades before that. We’ve been building towards fundamentally decentralized network infrastructure, decentralized AI infrastructure software (agents, data), and decentralized AI models &amp; prediction. We have long been aligned philosophically, with mutual respect among the teams, and have had several specific project collaborations.</p><blockquote>We have been building and moving quickly. Yet, centralized AI has moved faster and accumulated enormous capital: All towards AGI then&nbsp;ASI.</blockquote><blockquote>If we want AI to be fundamentally decentralized, we must deliver decentralized AI, with scale, stronger and more robust: All towards AGI then&nbsp;ASI.</blockquote><p>Charlie Munger famously said “Show me the incentives, and I will show you the outcome.” Well, here are the incentives. In this singular move, we have aligned the economic incentives of these teams and their communities.</p> 2. Pillars of&nbsp;Focus <p>Our efforts — as group of three organizations — will follow three&nbsp;pillars:</p>  We’re building decentralized Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) — for humanity and for the&nbsp;future.  On the continuum from today to the future, we balance the ASI future with efforts on decentralized AI tools for present-day applications in business and retail users. These are the world-class tools that all three Foundations have built; we will continue to develop&nbsp;these.  AI, AGI and ASI want compute, specifically the silicon and the energy to power the compute. We intend to use the scale of $ASI to move even more aggressively in securing compute for AI, decentralized-style.   3. Complementary Strengths <p>The Superintelligence Alliance brings together the best of decentralized AI.</p><p>Each team Fetch, Ocean, SingularityNET have strengths that can be leveraged by the Alliance. We’ve all been building different parts of the decentralized stack, with little overlap. SingularityNET has been building a path to AGI &amp; ASI, and is strong in R&amp;D — with seven live projects launched, many with their own tokens. Fetch has an L1 network that we can all leverage, leading edge technology for AI Agents, and recently invested $100 million in GPUs. They also have a top-notch business development and commercialization team. With Ocean, we’ve assembled a lot of building blocks to allow decentralized data sharing, access control and payment. Our Predictoor product has seen over $800 million in volume, just six months since launch, and it has its own exponential path to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Teaming up allows us to leverage a deeper bench of AI &amp; crypto builder talent and evangelists, spanning the globe. The Alliance has some of the leading researchers, developers and commercialization know-how, under one umbrella to push adoption of decentralized technology.</p><p>Finally, the value-flow from deep research, to tools &amp; applications, and finally to large-scale commercialization of data and AI services is now possible — all while giving users full control and&nbsp;choice.</p> 4. How the Alliance Becomes Greater than the&nbsp;Parts <p>The Superintelligence Alliance exists to give people the freedom of choice to own and control their data and AI, to respect each person’s autonomy and sovereignty. This is more important than ever in a world with artificial general intelligence then artificial superintelligence.</p><p>We apply these principles to our own collaboration as well. Even though a common website for the Superintelligence Alliance will be put up, each Foundation — Fetch, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET — will remain as independent legal entities, with the existing leadership, teams, communities and token treasury. As a baseline, existing initiatives from each Foundation will continue as planned. Any changes with respect to a given Foundation’s offering will be announced via official channels. Specific for Ocean Protocol: everything will continue as-is for now with the exception of Passive Data Farming and Volume Data Farming; details are&nbsp;below.</p><p>To a large extent, each Foundation already exhibits varying levels of decentralization in the control of the token, governance, the diversity of the community and the number of independent spin-out projects.</p><p>Over time, as the Foundations collaborate and the teams get the chance to work more closely together, we will announce joint projects and collaborations — either internally to strengthen the overall product offering and improve the user experience, or externally to bring stronger go-to-market services for large and enterprise customers.</p><p>Each Foundation is free to do as they like, to bring forward the values and adoption of decentralized AI — without coercion or compulsion to pressure other Alliance members. When cross-team collaborations make compelling and pragmatic sense, we’ll do it. If it doesn’t, two teams could be working on a similar topic with different approaches. Community members are free to join, and free to leave at all&nbsp;times.</p>Figure 1 — Levels of Integration of the Superintelligence Alliance<p>Governing council. To manage this symphony of decentralization, a governing council will be formed with Humayun Sheikh as Chairman, Ben Goertzel as the CEO, and Trent and Bruce will represent Ocean Protocol and we’ll do our part to contribute to a shared Superintelligence Alliance&nbsp;vision.</p><p>The text above it is essential, as it forms the core principles of our Alliance, and will guide how we move forward. Enticingly, this flexible framework leaves open the opportunity for other decentralized teams who share our values to join the Alliance in the future, to add even more strengths and capabilities.</p> 4. The New $ASI&nbsp;Token <p>From Day 1, the $ASI token (the renamed $FET token) will have a market capitalization ranking it around #20 on CoinMarketCap. This placement gives the Alliance significantly more exposure to a broader, global audience and puts $ASI as a strong candidate to be included in any index-based AI and crypto-ETF.</p><p>There are 225,000 wallet holders of $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens, as well as several hundred thousand more holders who leave their tokens on exchanges.</p><p>With the rise in token ranking of $ASI, we can expect our community to grow rapidly, and with it, an increase in trading volumes and attention from sophisticated players.</p> What Happens&nbsp;Next <p>With the announcement live, each Foundation will speak to business partners, answer questions from the community and start to plan the next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The first priority is to execute the token merge. The $FET token will be the reserve token of the Superintelligence Alliance. It will be renamed $ASI — ‘Artificial Superintelligence.’ Holders of $OCEAN and $AGIX need not do anything right now. You can continue to hold your tokens without worry as the exchange rate between $FET/$ASI and $OCEAN is fixed to 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and the 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX. Holders can choose to swap their tokens as soon as the token swap tool is available, or 10 years from now if they want to, at their leisure. The exchange rate will remain fixed. There is no&nbsp;rush.</p> Token Exchange Mechanism <p>Starting with $FET as the base token of the Alliance, the $FET token will be renamed $ASI, and an additional 1.48 Billion tokens will be minted, with 867 million $ASI allocated to $AGIX holders and 611 million $ASI allocated to $OCEAN token holders. The total supply of $ASI tokens will be 2.63 Billion&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>We took a snapshot on Monday, 25 March 2024. Here is the Max Supply (#) and Fully Diluted Value ($)&nbsp;summary:</p>Figure 2 — Fully Diluted Valuation ($) and Max Token Supply (#) of&nbsp;$ASI<p>Here is the calculation basis for the token minting to give a proportional share of new $ASI tokens to $OCEAN and $AGIX&nbsp;holders:</p>Figure 3 — Token Supply Calculation<p>Token holders will receive 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX. This exchange rate is fixed and will not change. We expect that smart arbitrageurs will notice if a price differential between the tokens arises, and then arb it out to maintain a balance and equilibrium in the exchange&nbsp;rate.</p> 6. Actions for Token&nbsp;Holders <p>$FET Tokens on Exchanges</p><p>If you have $FET tokens on an exchange, they will be automatically relabeled as $ASI tokens. No action is needed from you. We’ll coordinate with the exchanges on your&nbsp;behalf.</p><p>$OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on Exchanges</p><p>If you have $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on an exchange, no action is needed. We will work with each exchange to ensure a smooth conversion and your holdings will automatically be converted to $ASI tokens directly by the exchange.</p><p>One day, you’ll log in and you won’t see your $OCEAN or $AGIX — but don’t panic! The tokens are there — look for the $ASI symbol near the top of the&nbsp;list.</p><p>Don’t Deposit $OCEAN / $AGIX tokens into Exchanges after they’ve Executed a Conversion</p><p>When an exchange has converted all $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens, the tickers $OCEAN and $AGIX will be retired from the exchange. If anyone accidentally sends $OCEAN or $AGIX an exchange after the conversion event, we cannot guarantee that the tokens will be available or converted to $ASI. So please keep abreast of notices and announcements from your exchanges.</p><p>If you hold $OCEAN or $AGIX outside of an exchange and want to convert them to $ASI tokens, please see the next paragraph.</p><p>$OCEAN / $AGIX Tokens in Hard Wallets or&nbsp;Offline</p><p>For those of you holding your tokens in hard wallets or offline, a token swap mechanism will be available in the coming weeks to allow holders to exchange their $OCEAN and $AGIX for&nbsp;$ASI.</p><p>Once made available, this swap mechanism will be available indefinitely to allow long-term stakers to exchange their $OCEAN and $AGIX for $ASI tokens when their tokens unlock, without any FX or exchange&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Data Farming &amp;&nbsp;Staking</p><p>Some of you have locked your $OCEAN for up to 4 years in Data Farming. We’ve got you covered. Appendix 2 on Data Farming has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Timing for the Token Swap Mechanism</p><p>The token swap contracts have been tested and audited but given the complexity of the coordination with hundreds of business partners, we’ll complete a more detailed analysis, speak with partners &amp; exchanges, and come back to the community with a firm date to release the token swap tool. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p>DEXes and Pool Liquidity</p><p>We encourage liquidity providers to remove any $OCEAN and $AGIX related liquidity from DEXs at your convenience. Users may experience higher slippage in pools with lower liquidity. We recommend that you size your swap according to the available liquidity to minimize slippage.</p><p>Once you have your removed liquidity and have OCEAN in your wallet, wait until token swap contracts are ready to use and exchange OCEAN to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Once a threshold of 95% of the $OCEAN and $AGIX token supply is converted to $ASI, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET Foundations will remove any pool liquidity that we have provisioned.</p> 7. Conclusion <p>We’re excited. You’re&nbsp;excited.</p><p>This Alliance makes sense because the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. We can move faster, aggressively deliver more features and have the scale to compete globally and commercialize a decentralized stack of&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Our ambition is nothing less than to accelerate the path to artificial superintelligence, while carving out an essential role for humans and respecting the dignity and sovereignty of each one of&nbsp;us.</p><p>The covenant that we make to you, our community and the Superintelligence Alliance is the same — we will build the tools to help every human have a chance to thrive in a future where AI, AGI and ASI is a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Join us. Build with us. Be a part of the movement.</p> About Ocean <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable businesses and individuals to trade tokenized data assets seamlessly to manage data all along the AI model life-cycle. Ocean-powered apps include enterprise-grade data exchanges, data science competitions, and data DAOs. Our Ocean Predictoor product has over $800 million in monthly volume, just six months after launch with a roadmap to scale foundation models globally.</p> Appendix 1: Beware of&nbsp;Scams <blockquote>Most Importantly, We Really Can’t Stress this Enough — BEWARE of SCAMS&nbsp;!!!</blockquote><p>Our number one priority is to protect the community.</p><p>Moments like these are a prime time for scammers to appear with tempting, time-sensitive, “click-now!” links. Don’t fall for it. It breaks our hearts every time someone is scammed because there’s little we can do other than maybe file a police&nbsp;report.</p><p>We cannot stress how important it is to maintain vigilance and remember — there is no time urgency to swap your $OCEAN / $AGIX for $ASI. Do it at your&nbsp;leisure.</p><p>Here are some ways to stay&nbsp;safe:</p>  Cross-verify any call to action to exchange your tokens. Visit Fetch, Ocean Protocol and/or SingularityNET Twitter/X handles and check if our Tweets point to the same url or destination.  Rely only on official sources that you independently type in the destination on your browser and avoid following any links. There are many impersonator websites designed to look authentic, to steal your tokens. For instance, on Twitter — if you see @FetchAI, check the number of followers — it should be 200,000. Most impersonators will have only 50 bot followers — that’s a clear sign of a&nbsp;scammer.  In Telegram, only click on links from the pinned notices posted by Admins. Admins have been explicitly instructed not to post links in the message threads. All official messages will be pinned, not in the deluge of scrolling messages.  For Telegram/Discord, always use public channels or threads and do not engage in private messages promising to&nbsp;help.  Our Admins are instructed NEVER to proactively reach out to users. Be extremely wary of any direct messages from an “Admin” with a call to action. We’ve designed the process so that users can swap their tokens at their leisure with no urgency. The exchange rate is fixed between $OCEAN / $AGIX and $ASI, so regardless of price action — you will get your allocated share of&nbsp;$ASI.  NEVER share your private key or seed (12, 15,18, 24 words) used to generate your wallet with anyone, nor enter them into a&nbsp;website.  If you have a problem, reach out via Twitter/X by writing a DM or posting a public Tweet. One of our admins should see it and respond using the official account from Fetch, Ocean or SingularityNET. Nonetheless be very wary and maintain vigilance for any links and rely only on official sources and websites.  If you do fall for a scammer and you post a plea for help on a forum or Telegram, more scammers will come out of the woodwork to offer you to recover your tokens for a fee. Don’t fall for this scam. Send a message via Twitter to either Fetch, Ocean or SingularityNET and one of the Admins will get back to&nbsp;you.  <p>Stay safe! People will try to scam you out of your hard-earned tokens. We’ve designed the process so that you can swap your tokens in a relaxed manner with no rush. If you are unsure, Ask and keep asking until you are 100% sure that it is safe to execute the&nbsp;actions.</p> Appendix 2: Data Farming &amp; OCEAN&nbsp;Locking <p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming</a> (DF) is Ocean Protocol’s incentive program.

 Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET Unite to Create <br>Artificial Superintelligence Alliance  Artificial Intelligence Pioneers Combine to Create a Decentralized Alternative to Existing AI Projects Controlled by Big Tech<br> <br>Combined value of $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX is USD$7.6 Billion as of March 26,&nbsp;2024 <p>Zug and Singapore — March 27, 2024 — SingularityNET (SNET), the world’s first decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) network, Fetch.ai, a Web3 platform for the new AI economy, and Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange platform to protect data, have launched the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. The creation of the largest open-sourced, decentralized network through a multi-billion token merger is a major step that accelerates the race to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p><p>The Alliance is the brainchild of three leading minds in decentralized AI. Dr. Ben Goertzel, renowned as the “Father of AGI”, founded SNET as a blockchain-based marketplace and framework for AI services. Deep Mind founding investor Humayun Sheikh built Fetch.ai as a decentralized multi-agent platform to deploy and commercialize AI applications. Trent McConaghy, the architect of the AI-based software that most chip designers use to drive Moore’s Law, formed Ocean Protocol to provide a platform for data exchange and the seamless trade of tokenized data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>As part of the formation of the Alliance, the $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens that fuel the three Alliance member networks will be merged into a single $ASI token that will function across the combined decentralized AI network, providing unprecedented scale and&nbsp;power.</p> Built for Super Intelligence <p>“As the AI revolution intensifies it is imperative that AGI and ASI are not owned and controlled by any particular party with their own biased interests,” comments Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO and Founder of SNET. “They should be rolled out in an open, democratic and decentralized way. This has been the joint vision of SNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol from their inception, and for this reason it makes total sense that our three projects come together to form a tokenomic network that has greater power to take on Big Tech and shift the center of gravity of the AI world into the decentralized ecosystem.”</p><p>“In a world of exponential AI innovation, the giants of Big Tech dominate the headlines and conversation,’” remarks Humayun Sheikh, Fetch.ai CEO &amp; Founder. “We are forging a different path. Our mission with this merger is to combine our platforms to ensure ethical and transparent AI that facilitates direct interactions between developers and users to bypass the traditional gatekeepers of centralized authorities. This enhances data privacy and paves the way for a more democratic and trustworthy AI ecosystem and encourages global participants to contribute.”</p> Compelling Strategic Rationale   Capitalizes on Rise of AI and Growth of Three AI Projects: The combination is born of a period of unprecedented growth for the AI projects. The deal provides an unparalleled opportunity for these three influential leaders to create a powerful compelling alternative to Big Tech’s control over AI development, use and monetization.  Creates a Decentralized AI Infrastructure at Scale: Decentralized AI leverages blockchain technology to turn AI systems, whose inner workings are hidden from the public, into open networks for coordinating machine intelligence towards shared objectives. The fusion of SNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol’s research, brands, technologies and products creates a foundation to build a scalable AI infrastructure which ensures ethical and trustworthy practices.  Accelerates Investment into AGI: Goertzel, Sheikh and McConaghy have long been acolytes and early-adopters of Artificial Intelligence — all focused on making AGI a reality. This Superintelligence Alliance facilitates the commercialization of each foundation’s technology, and enables wide scale access to cutting-edge AI platforms and large databases. This groundbreaking move advances the path to AGI on the blockchain.   Transaction Details <p>Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol CEO &amp; Co-Founder, believes the combination can deliver on the promise of a vertically integrated stack of decentralized technologies with scale to compete globally. “The combination of our technologies creates a leader in R&amp;D, applications and commercialization of AGI,” Pon notes. “The unified $ASI token is the glue to orchestrate all actors with common incentives. $ASI tokens are used to secure the public network, as data access tokens and to unlock computation without needing traditional banking and payment rails. It is the native currency for the machine economy.”</p><p>When the proposal receives majority approval from the respective communities, the following will&nbsp;occur:</p>  $FET becomes $ASI with a total supply of 2.63055 billion&nbsp;tokens  $AGIX tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433350:1  $OCEAN tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433226:1  $ASI will have a total FDV of $7.6 billion USD (combined value as at March 26,&nbsp;2024).   Leadership and Governance <p>Upon closing of this token merger, a governing council for the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance will monitor and guide operations of the newly merged tokenomic network. The Alliance will be led by Ben Goertzel, Humayun Sheikh, Bruce Pon and Trent McConaghy. The organizations that guide development of the three merging networks, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol Foundation and SNET Foundation, will continue to operate as separate entities, but will collaborate closely in the shared $ASI tokenomic ecosystem and in the operation of the Alliance.</p><p>“Among our many commercial and research goals for this combined network to work is to launch a decentralized neural-symbolic AGI system with globally-superior capabilities in key areas like logical and scientific reasoning and artistic creativity,” Goertzel continues. “The impact of such a system may greatly exceed what we’ve seen from significant LLMs and lead the global economy into a new era of beneficial decentralized AGI and&nbsp;ASI.”</p><p>“This alliance is a fantastic step forward for those who are left out of the technologies produced by big tech, which mainly targets the affluent. Billions of people on our planet do not currently have access to advanced AI technologies and tools. The Superintelligence Alliance is here to tear down barriers towards a decentralized, democratic, and ethical AI future, reducing inequalities and making the world a better place for us, for our children and grandchildren and generations to come. Decentralised governance gives everyone a voice and a say in the ethics and oversight of the most powerful tools ever invented.”</p><p>About SingularityNET</p><p>SingularityNET was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel with the mission of creating a decentralized, democratic, inclusive and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). According to Dr. Goertzel, AGI should be independent of any central entity, open to anyone and not restricted to the narrow goals of a single corporation or even a single country. The SNET team includes seasoned engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and marketers. The core platform and AI teams are further complemented by specialized teams devoted to application areas such as finance, robotics, biomedical AI, media, arts and entertainment.</p><p>For additional information on SNET, visit: <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">https://singularitynet.io/</a></p><p>About Fetch.ai</p><p>Fetch.ai, a Cambridge-based AI company, is redefining the possibilities of an intelligent and connected world through its AI agent-based technology. Fetch.ai’s infrastructure technology enables developers and businesses to build, deploy &amp; monetize through an agent-based modular platform for the new generation of AI applications.

<p>Many strictly regulated industries such as banking and finance rely heavily on identity and access management solutions to secure their systems and infrastructure. Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the Okta breach last year, these organizations are attractive targets for hackers due to the nature and quantity of the information they handle. While hackers use sophisticated ransomware once access is gained, they obtain that access through surprisingly low-tech means: for example, by calling the companies’ help desks and, using a simple voice phishing (vishing) tactic to induce IT employees to disable two-factor authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Phishing awareness and resistance play a big role in protecting customer and corporate data, but organizations need a secure solution to safeguard their systems against phishing and credential theft, mitigating these attacks before they can occur. Many companies already manage physical access with ID badges, but integrating digital access control into these badges can offer one comprehensive solution that provides:</p> 
  
  Photo ID for visual verification  
  Access badge for door readers&nbsp;  
  Access token for passwordless digital authentication  
  
 The Value of Security Convergence — Combining Physical Security with Digital Security  
<p>Historically, physical security and digital security have been managed separately, working in parallel. Due to increasingly complex security threats, however, organizations require a more comprehensive approach to securing both physical and digital assets to reduce the risk of breaches.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Following the 2023 breach, Okta recommended customers take several steps to better defend themselves against potential attacks by adding:</p> 
  
  Multi-factor authentication (MFA) to secure administrator access  
  “Admin session binding,” requiring administrators to reauthenticate in certain instances  
  “Admin session timeout” defaulted to a 12-hour session duration and 15 minutes of idle time  
  
<p>These settings provide organizations with a more secure layer of roadblocks that limit how much hackers can do once they gain access to any systems. These settings require more frequent re-authentication by users, but a converged credential with FIDO2 authentication makes this a simple and more convenient process.</p> 
<p>The converged approach to identity management not only enables organizations to take a more holistic approach to threat management and have a more prepared security posture for preventing, mitigating, and responding to threats, but it provides users with a more convenient, passwordless solution for authentication.</p> 
 Example of a Converged Credential:  
<p></p> 
 Features of a Strong and Effective Converged Credential  
<p>Organizations in regulated industries need an identity solution that both complies with regulations and safeguards their operations against phishing and fraud. A converged credential streamlines security at both the physical and digital level, and includes the following features to eliminate the threat of phishing attacks:</p> 
  
  Secure, Phishing-Resistant Multi-Factor Authentication. Requiring more than two authentication factors increases security. Such factors may include something the user has (the card), something the user knows (a PIN), and something the user is (biometric data, like fingerprints) to provide a higher level of confidence in the authenticity of the user’s identity. This means it does not use a password, OTP or other shared secret as a factor.  
  Alignment with Current Security Trends. Using a converged credential that aligns with modern security trends and standards – including FIDO2, Mifare®, and DesFIRE® – enables organizations to be confident that they comply with security regulations.  
  Passwordless Experience. Replacing passwords with local authentication methods enhances the user experience while reducing vulnerabilities associated with password breaches.  
  
 Conclusion  
<p>While phishing is a relatively simple tactic, it has the potential to expose organizations to more complex and costly cyberattacks that could result in significant financial consequences, reputational harm, and customer dissatisfaction.</p> 
<p>By implementing a phishing-resistant solution, such as the converged physical and digital access credential solution offered by <a href="https://www.hypr.com/integrations/idemia">HYPR and IDEMIA</a>, organizations can be more confident in their ability to safeguard their operational and customer data from cyberattacks.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/consumers-look-at-security-first-costs-second-when-opening-a-bank-account/">PYMNYS study</a>, over 25% of consumers said safety (of money and personal information) is the most influential factor when opening a primary bank account. Previously, higher security was at odds with creating a member experience, but there is a new approach.</p>



<p>You can create a better member experience AND increase security simultaneously with <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">reusable credentials</a>&nbsp;.</p>



<p>What are reusable credentials? Using cutting-edge verification technology, your members only verify themselves once during onboarding. After that, they will have credentials that work across all interactions with your credit union. The credentials cut down wait times, eliminate repetitive verification hassles, and create a seamless member experience at every touch point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why this matters: This revolutionary approach has the potential to reshape the member journey by creating seamless interactions, increasing efficiency, and providing unparalleled member satisfaction. In addition to these benefits, this method also significantly minimizes fraudulent activities within your identity verification process.</p>



<p>How reusable credentials create a better member experience:</p>







 
 Streamlined Interactions: Reusable credentials eliminate the need for repetitive identity verification, ensuring a smooth and efficient member journey. 
 







 
 Reduced Wait Times: Members no longer need to endure long queues or waiting periods, as the verification process now takes seconds. 
 







 
 Smooth Branch Visits: With credentials persisting across interactions, in-person visits to the branch are quicker and more personalized, enhancing the overall experience. 
 







 
 Effortless Call Center Interactions: Members experience faster and more efficient interactions with call centers, as there is no need for extensive identity verification. 
 







 
 Stress-Free Teller Transactions: Teller interactions become stress-free as the burden of repetitive verification is lifted, allowing staff to focus on delivering a superior member experience. 
 







 
 Enhanced Security: While providing convenience, reusable credentials maintain the highest level of security. With unbreakable encryption, reusable credentials are tamper-proof and make fraud almost impossible. 
 







 
 Consistent Experience: Whether online or through mobile apps, members enjoy a consistent, secure, and frictionless digital experience, fostering trust and loyalty.

 Dive Deeper 



 How do Reusable Credentials Work? 



<p>Reusable credentials are a shift in the way identity is managed. It is moving away from centralized systems controlled by organizations to a model where individuals have greater control over their own identity information.</p>



<p>In the end, members can show their encrypted and unique credentials on their phones as irrefutable proof of who they are without disclosing information that can be used maliciously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process looks like this:</p>







 
 Initial verification: Once a member is verified using robust authentication methods, the system creates a reusable credential that can be used across various services and applications. 
 







 
 Decentralized identity: Decentralized identity (DI) technology powers reusable credentials. This technology (that utilizes encryption and other cutting-edge tech) ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and resistant to single points of failure.&nbsp; 
 







 
 Secure communication: The DI system provides irrefutable and secure communication across all channels, with built-in, ultra-secure identity validation. 
 







 
 User control&nbsp;: Individuals own and control their identity information. Unlike traditional systems where large organizations store and manage user data, DI empowers individuals to own and manage their digital identities. Protecting both individuals and organizations. 
 



<p>🎧 <a href="https://privacyfiles.com/?p=447">Listen to the Privacy Files podcast episode where Dr. Paul Ashley explains Decentralized Identity to get the whole picture</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 How Reusable Credentials Make a Better Member Experience for Credit Unions 



<p>Transforming Branch Dynamics for a Better Member Experience</p>



<p>The traditional branch experience often involves members waiting in queues for identity verification, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction. Not to mention that traditional identity verification methods (IDs, security questions, etc.) can be maliciously reproduced.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials significantly reduce branch wait times. Members breeze through the verification process, allowing them to focus on their financial needs rather than waiting in line. This streamlined experience enhances efficiency and leaves a lasting positive impression on members, contributing to their overall satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consistent Seamless Interactions for a Better Member Experience</p>



<p>Reusable credentials create a credit union experience where every member interaction is smooth regardless of the channel. Whether a member interacts in-branch, over the phone, or through digital channels, the authentication experience remains seamless. Repetitive security questions and cumbersome verification processes that differ in every channel are replaced with a unified, efficient system, fostering a sense of trust and reliability.</p>



<p>Remember, in the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/consumers-look-at-security-first-costs-second-when-opening-a-bank-account/">PYMNYS study</a>, over 25% of consumers said that safety (of money and personal information) is the most influential factor when opening a primary bank account. You can give members next-level security with reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Liberating Tellers for Member-Focused Excellence</p>



<p>Tellers are the face of the credit union, influencing member perceptions and experiences. However, the burden of identity verification often diverts their attention from delivering personalized service to preventing fraud.</p>



<p>“Tellers are the first line of defense. It’s our job to protect your account. But we aren’t perfect. Just like any sort of defense, we make mistakes or miss things. We are human and are subject to human error.” – A teller explaining <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/ag2aiv/bank_tellers_of_reddit_what_security_do_you_guys/">their experience on the job.</a></p>



<p>Reusable credentials liberate tellers from the time-consuming and stressful verification process, enabling them to concentrate on building meaningful connections with members. This shift in focus enhances the overall member experience, making each interaction more personalized, efficient, and satisfying.</p>



<p>Reusable Credentials are the New Era of KYC and Identity Verification</p>



<p>Reusable credentials are the perfect opportunity for credit unions to deliver an outstanding member experience. Beyond the technological upgrade, it signifies a commitment to efficiency, trust, and member-centric banking.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials will be the future of credit union success by minimizing wait times, ensuring seamless interactions, and empowering tellers to prioritize member experience. Anonyome Labs is here to help you seamlessly add reusable credentials to your credit union.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Certificate lifespan is getting shorter</p>
<p>Over the years the cybersecurity industry has undergone notable transformations requiring organizations to implement new best-practice standards, often at a short notice.</p>
<p>In 2020, Apple unilaterally opted for shorter TLS certificate durations, reducing them from three years to 398 days, thereby increasing the burden on certificate management. Subsequently, Apple introduced shorter lifespans for S/MIME certificates at the start of 2022. In the past year, both code signing and S/MIME users faced additional alterations, while <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/googles-90-day-proposal-for-tls-certificates/">Google proposed transitioning to 90-day certificates</a>, a subject we have explored in our <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/608200?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=player-page-feed&amp;utm_content=summit-page">latest webinar</a>. Anticipating further changes, particularly with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the looming risk of post-quantum (PQ) computing, organizations must enhance their agility.</p>
<p>Today, TLS/SSL certificates are typically valid for about a year, according to the Certification Authority Browser (CA/B) Forum requirements. This yearly renewal cycle is convenient for organizations to manage and schedule. However, transitioning to shorter-lived certificates, like the proposed 90-day validity period, will require more frequent renewal efforts. With 90-day validity, organizations will need to renew certificates four times every 12 months within that timeframe. In practice, due to the need for buffer time, certificates may need to be renewed every 60 days. Ultimately, this change could lead to replacing certificates more than six times every 12 months, depending on the renewal window chosen.</p>
<p>Enterprises will be required to handle both the management of digital certificates within their systems and the reverification of their domains every 90 days. According to Google’s <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/">Moving Forward, Together</a> initiative “more timely domain validation will better protect domain owners while also reducing the potential for a CA to mistakenly rely on stale, outdated, or otherwise invalid information resulting in certificate mis-issuance and potential abuse.”</p>
<p>Shorter certificate lifecycles will drive automation</p>
<p>Shorter-lived certificates offer numerous advantages, with automation being the foremost benefit. Google and other root programs advocate for automation to streamline certificate lifecycle management. Additionally, shorter certificate validity aligns with the upcoming adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). PQC algorithms lack a proven track record as they are still relatively new. Consequently, there’s a necessity to potentially switch algorithms more frequently, with an unpredictable timeframe, including the vulnerability window of existing algorithms to quantum computer attacks. Automation plays a crucial role in supporting this increased renewal frequency.</p>
<p>Industry calls for automation to reduce security risks</p>
<p>While the 90-day proposal from Google has not officially been discussed in the CA/Browser Forum, both certification authorities and certificate consumers agree that automation is a necessity for a smooth transition to certificates with a shorter validity period. We can see a similar recommendation in <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/publication/1800-16/">NIST Special Publication 1800-16</a>:</p>
<p>“Automation should be used wherever possible for the enrollment, installation, monitoring, and replacement of certificates, or justification should be provided for continuing to use manual methods that may cause operational security risks.”</p>
<p>Challenges of a 90-day certificate validity period for organizations</p>
<p>The need for TLS certificate workflows to be done multiple times a year means an increased workload for certificate operations, server owners, infrastructure, and webmaster teams. The inability to renew the domain verification and replace certificates at a rapid pace may increase the risk of outages. Additionally, the automated solutions do not guarantee a one-size-fits-all approach, as each context and organization has unique requirements and constraints.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you consider your next steps and plan your strategy with these key points in mind:</p>
 
 Spend the time to prepare for a 90-day or shorter maximum certificate lifetime future so that you can seamlessly handle the change 
 Start thinking about your security model(s) and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/post-quantum-cryptography">post-quantum</a> readiness 
 Consider how you pay for your certificates and evaluate how <a href="https://go.entrust.com/SSL-Flex2">subscriptions</a> can provide more deterministic costs 
 Invest in robust <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/digital-certificates/tls-ssl/entrust-certificate-services">certificate management</a> capabilities 
 Focus on standards-based APIs and integrations 
 Plan a path to support 100% automation, even if it means applying a hybrid approach for different parts of your organization

<p>Our recently released UK Fraud Awareness Report revealed worrying behavioral trends, such as a third of the public sharing ID documents via unencrypted channels and almost half of respondents not knowing what deepfakes were.</p>



<p>For an overview of the UK’s education gap when it comes to fraud, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/attitudes-awareness-uk-fraud/">blog, ‘What does the UK really know about fraud?’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the second of a three-part series, we explore the nation’s attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology and the steps Brits are willing to take to protect themselves.</p>



 Fight fraud with biometrics. 



<p>Biometric identification, such as automated facial recognition, is an optimal way of identifying business partners and customers, achieving security goals and complying with regulatory requirements. Our survey discovered that almost two-thirds of Brits (63%) were already using biometric technology, like fingerprint scans or FaceID, to access their online bank accounts, or approve bank transfers, with another 10% planning on using it in the future.</p>



<p>Less than a quarter of the population (24%) do not use biometric technology and do not plan on using it in the future.</p>

 Customer journeys: Start as you mean to go on. 



<p>The odd adage ‘start as you mean to go on’ rings true in every walk of life, especially in business, and especially at the beginning of a customer journey. Onboarding, the point at which the identity of the user is established and verified, is one of the most vulnerable stages for fraud. This is why service providers, especially banks or insurance companies, often establish more secure, but lengthier onboarding processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While speedy, seamless customer journeys are incredibly important, especially in the digital world, 75%&nbsp;of the UK population said they would be willing to go through lengthier online onboarding processes for accounts connected to larger sums or investments, if it made it safer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UK, over <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">£3 billion is lost to fraud every single year</a>. According to our survey, while over half of Brits (54%) would move banks, if they were to become a victim of banking fraud, almost a quarter (24%) would remain loyal and stay with their bank, while another 21% were unsure what they would do in the event of banking fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director Document Management &amp; Fraud at IDnow said that this should act as a wake-up call for traditional banks and fintechs that want to protect their customers, and in turn their business. ““Between deepfake videos and spoof texts that pretend to be from banks, it’s becoming harder for consumers to know what’s genuine and what is fraud. Meanwhile, huge amounts of data are stored online, making everyone ever-more vulnerable to data breaches.”</p>



<blockquote><p>While technology can be a curse when it comes to tackling fraud, it also has the potential to be a solution to the problem.</p>Lovro Persen, Director Document Management &amp; Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Preferred identity verification methods. 



<p>The digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Most industries are either required by regulation to implement identity verification checks or have chosen to do to optimize processes or fight fraud. Such checks are required for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">account opening in Banking</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">compliance checks in Crypto</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">age verification in Mobility</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">streamlined check-in processes in Travel</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">financial risk checks in Gambling,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">contract signing in Telecommunication</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, there were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-first-future-trends-2024/">61 billion digital identity verification check</a>s conducted in 2023, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of 2024. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are simply staggering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity verification requires users to provide and have information associated with their identity verified. This may be a physical identity document, such as a driver’s license, passport, or a nationally issued identity document. Identity verification services can range from automated, expert-led to in-person. Each method fulfils different security, regulatory and convenience requirements. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are numerous different methods of identity verification.</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">Automated identity verification</a> provides seamless 24/7 online experiences, enabling businesses to grow and scale with confidence, without compromising on security or data privacy. We offer extensive data checks from diverse and trusted sources, including official databases and credible records to confirm the existence of a legitimate identity in an intuitive and frictionless way. We also can validate more than 3,000 identity documents from 195 countries and growing. Our automated identity verification solutions leverage the latest in facial recognition and liveness technologies for seamless biometric verification, utilizing liveness, selfies and video to confirm the existence of an identity and that the person is physically present during the verification process.<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">Expert-led video verification</a> ensures optimal KYC customization while maintaining a balance between security and accessibility. Our face-to-face video verification with expert assistance allows businesses to compare photo taken during account creation process with photo from identity document. And, with liveness detection, you can add an additional layer of assurance to detect and protect against a variety of presentation attacks. Our specially-trained experts ask specific questions to identify social engineering. Expert-led identity verification can also help organizations improve inclusivity, accessibility, safety and convenience. Protect your most vulnerable customers and ensure they don’t miss out on the services they deserve.<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">In-person identity verification</a> enables your customers to have their identities verified at a public location, such as a gas station, near them. It also allows businesses to perform Point of Sale (POS) identification processes on-site. In-person verification ensures compliance with the German Money Laundering Act (GwG) and the Telecommunications Act (TKG) and a premium high-touch experience that doesn’t compromise on the speed and convenience of a digital solution.  



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC) processes</a> are an integral part of identity verification and are crucial for businesses to protect their customers – and themselves – from fraudsters. KYC can ensure the power of identity is put back in the hands of the people it belongs to and the businesses they are trying to interact with.</p>



 



    



 



<p>According to the UK’s Fraud Awareness Report, the most popular method of identity verification in the UK is a combination of data checks and document / facial recognition. Although not particularly commonplace in the UK, 9% of Brits said they would trust a human agent conducting a live video verification call. In Germany, this is considered the most secure and accurate method of identity check, as the fraud expert&nbsp;can pick up emotional signs of distress or suspicious behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, around a fifth (19%) of respondents do not know what method to trust the most, which reveals a deeper lack of understanding of the different verification methods, their benefits and their drawbacks. This is something that should be addressed as part of ongoing fraud education efforts.</p>

<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/19/a-short-history-of-chatgpt-how-we-got-to-where-we-are-today/?sh=66fdb2ca674f">ChatGPT</a> debuted in November 2022, the hype and hysteria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has continued to accelerate. Indeed, rarely can you read an article or watch a news clip without AI being inserted into the conversation. With AI-enabled <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/the-law-is-not-keeping-up-with-ai-deepfake-fraud-and-it-will-only-get-worse">deepfakes</a>, AI-displaced workers, alleged AI theft of intellectual property, and AI-fueled cyberattacks, the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/as-gen-ai-advances-regulators-and-risk-functions-rush-to-keep-pace">raging debate</a> is not only if and how to regulate AI, but also when and by whom.</p>
 Global Legislative Developments and Directives 
<p>Early calls for AI governance and industry self-regulation seem to be giving way to more rigid and enforceable legislative efforts. Afterall, world leaders are loath to repeat the unregulated social media experiment of the past 20 years that led to such unforeseen consequences as the rampant dissemination of misinformation and disinformation, fueling political and social upheaval.</p>
<p>To wit, the European Union is on the verge of passing the first comprehensive piece of legislation with the <a href="https://hbr.org/2024/02/the-eus-ai-act-and-how-companies-can-achieve-compliance">AI Act</a>, which promises to set the global benchmark for AI, much like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) did for data privacy protection. The AI Act provides prescriptive risk-based rules as to when AI can and cannot be employed, with severe penalties for non-compliers that include up to 7 percent of an enterprise’s global annual revenue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> this past fall, which is more expansive than the EU AI Act, contemplating everything from consumer fraud to weapons of mass destruction. The order demands more transparency from AI companies on how their models work and provides labeling standards for AI-generated content. However, an executive order is not a legislative act and the U.S. has already started down a decentralized path with individual states proposing their own legislation, including California’s <a href="https://statescoop.com/california-bill-would-form-new-ai-regulation-division/">Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Systems Act</a>, which aims to protect consumer privacy and promote ethical standards in the use of AI. Among provisions for transparency, accountability, and public engagement the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/californias-draft-ai-privacy-rules-show-ambitious-approach">draft rules</a> would require companies to conduct regular assessments of their AI systems to ensure compliance.</p>
 Perspectives and Considerations on AI Regulation 
<p>Proponents of AI legislation cite the protection of health, safety, fundamental human rights, democracy, rule of law, and the environment as paramount. However, others are concerned that legislation will hobble their domestic industry, ceding profits and AI supremacy to others, especially bad actors. On this note, the UK has taken a decidedly contrarian position with a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/united-kingdom-government-takes-pro-innovation-ai-approach-contrast-europe?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Main%20NL%2002/28&amp;utm_term=Main%20Newsletter">pro-innovation AI approach</a> that provides a policy of non-binding principles. Still others feel that <a href="https://medium.com/60-leaders/to-regulate-or-not-how-should-governments-react-to-the-ai-revolution-c254d176304f#:~:text=%2D%20AI%20is%20a%20powerful%20technology,reducing%20the%20risk%20of%20abuse">AI does not warrant new or different regulation than traditional software</a>, stating that the only difference between the two is the ratio of data-driven to rule-driven outcomes, which does make AI behavior less transparent but not less deterministic.</p>
<p>Then there is the conversation around AI ethics and empathy, or rather the lack thereof. Those favoring a more laissez-faire approach to AI regulation assert that regulating empathy and ethics is not really an AI problem per se but embedded in the historical data on which the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3697649/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) are trained. And this will take time to resolve with or without AI, and with or without regulation.</p>
<p>It seems regulators are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. No one wants to be the hapless bureaucrat that inadvertently enabled Skynet in the Terminator movie series, or the overeager regulator that quashed domestic innovation on the eve of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, ceding AI global leadership and economic prosperity for generations to come.</p>
<p>The path forward will be a balancing act, but the guiding star should be one in which AI is beneficial to all of humanity, regardless of country, status, or any other factor. A popular framework in this regard is that of Harmless, Honest, and Helpful AI. Initially proposed by the team at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/training-a-helpful-and-harmless-assistant-with-reinforcement-learning-from-human-feedback">Anthropic</a>, this approach focuses on reinforcement learning from human feedback and supervised fine-tuning to align a model that roots out inaccuracy, bias, and toxicity. This more curated approach can also help ensure that the AI is more secure as it can avoid eliciting a harmful and untrue output, and flag vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Discover the simplicity and security of magic link authentication in this article. We dive into how magic links work, providing a hassle-free and secure alternative to traditional passwords. By exploring its benefits, challenges, and comparison to other authentication methods, this post will equip you with valuable insights into this innovative authentication approach. Learn how magic links could revolutionize your online login experiences and enhance account security.</p>
 How does a magic link work? 
<p>Magic link authentication is a secure and user-friendly method of authenticating users during the login process. It sends a unique, time-sensitive URL to the user’s registered email address as a part of the authentication process.<br>
Instead of entering a password, users authenticate themselves by clicking on the received link. Once the magic link is clicked, the system validates the link, and if it’s correct and the private key hasn’t expired, the user gains access to the account.<br>
Magic links offer a passwordless approach to authentication, making it a compelling option in user verification methods and password breaches. It streamlines the password manager user experience, eliminating the need for password creation, memorization, and input. Moreover, a one-time password only helps reduce the risks associated with password-based attacks, such as brute force or password spraying attacks.</p>
 
The User Experience of Magic Links 
<p>From a user’s perspective, magic link authentication offers simplicity and ease. The user begins the verification procedures by providing their email address during the login process. Subsequently, a unique magic link URL is sent to the user who opens their email, which the user must click to complete the authentication process.<br>
This approach eradicates common pain points associated with passwords, such as the need to remember multiple passwords or frustration with password recovery processes. However, it requires users to access their email accounts. It ensures that their email account is secure, as the user’s email address becomes a single point of failure in this authentication model.</p>
 
Pros and Cons of Using Magic Links 
<p>Magic link authentication comes with many advantages, primarily focused on improving security and user experience. It mitigates risks associated with traditional passwords, such as the vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Moreover, it simplifies the user experience of passwordless authentication, reducing password fatigue and the inconvenience of password recovery processes.<br>
However, there are downsides to consider. The reliance on email as the user’s device and primary authentication method makes the user’s email provider or account a lucrative target for attackers. If an attacker gains access to a user’s email account, they can access any account that uses magic link authentication. Additionally, since emails can be intercepted or delayed, there’s a potential risk of identity fraud if the magic link falls into the wrong user friction hands or is not received by the user promptly.</p>
 
Technical Implementation of Magic Link Authentication 
 The Back-End Mechanism 
<p>The account creation and validation of magic links predominantly occur at the system’s back end. A unique token is generated when users open or request a magic link. This secret link token is usually bound to the user’s session and has a limited validity period to ensure security.<br>
The back-end system manages these tokens carefully, ensuring they are stored securely, usually in a hashed form, to prevent misuse in case of a data breach. Moreover, the tokens are matched and validated against the user’s user session and information when the magic link is accessed, ensuring the magic link endpoint hasn’t been tampered with or used beyond its expiration time.</p>
 
Front-End Handling and User Interaction 
<p>The user interacts with the system on their mobile device on the front end by requesting a magic link, usually by entering their email address login credentials. It’s essential to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience, guiding users through the process with clear instructions and feedback.<br>
The front end communicates with the back end to request the generation of the magic link and delivers it to the user’s inbox in just a few lines, typically via email. Additionally sign in screen and, it manages the redirection process once a user clicks on the magic link, ensuring that users are directed to the correct location and appropriate actions are taken based on the validity of the magic link.</p>
 
Security Considerations 
<p>Ensuring the security of magic links is paramount. The magic links work and should be generated using secure, random tokens that are hard to guess or predict. HTTPS should be the secure method used to transmit magic links to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.<br>
Furthermore, magic links should be time-bound, meaning they expire after a certain period or once used, preventing reuse or exploitation if intercepted after the validity period. Also, monitoring and alert mechanisms should be in place to detect and respond to suspicious activities, such as multiple failed attempts to access sensitive data breaches a magic link.</p>
 
Comparing Magic Link Authentication with Other Authentication Methods 
 
Magic Link vs. Traditional Username and Password 
<p>Magic link authentication simplifies the user login process, removing the need for password memorization and input. Unlike traditional username and password-based authentication methods, magic links offer enhanced security by mitigating common password-related attacks like brute-force or dictionary attacks. The absence of a password minimizes the risks associated with password reuse or weak passwords.<br>
However, traditional username and password methods have wide acceptance and familiarity among users and across platforms. While magic links streamline the authentication process for email providers, they also introduce a reliance on email provider access and security. In comparison, despite their vulnerabilities, passwords do not necessarily require users to gain access to another person’s identity or platform (email) as part of the authentication process.</p>
 
Magic Link and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) 
<p>Magic links can coexist and integrate with two-factor authentication (2FA) methods to authenticate access and bolster the mobile device’s security. While magic links replace the password, they can be used alongside a second, multi-factor authentication part, like a one-time passcode (OTP) or a biometric verification. This combination of authentication factors enhances the authentication process by requiring two separate verification steps, making unauthorized access more challenging.<br>
In contrast, using passwordless authentication with magic links alone simplifies the user experience but does not offer the same security assurance combined with a second authentication factor. Utilizing 2FA with magic links ensures a more robust security posture, providing additional protection beyond passwordless authentication.</p>
 
Magic Link vs. Biometric Authentication 
<p>Comparing magic links with biometric and authentication solutions highlights user experience and security level distinctions. Biometric personal identification methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, offer a seamless user experience, often requiring only a single action from the user. They also provide a higher level of security, as biometric data is unique to each individual.<br>
Magic links, while simplifying the authentication process, rely on the user’s email account security and the sent link’s integrity. The necessity to access an email to verify customers retrieved the magic link can be considered an added step in the sign in process when compared to the direct nature of biometric authentication. However, magic links do not require specialized hardware or sensors, making them more universally applicable and accessible.</p>
 
Future Prospects and Challenges of Magic Link Authentication 
 
Upcoming Trends in Magic Link Authentication 
<p>As technology evolves, magic link authentication is poised to benefit from emerging trends and innovations. Enhancements in email security and encryption technologies can make magic links work and link sharing and links more secure and resilient against attacks. Integrating the magic link emails and links with other authentication methods, like biometrics or hardware tokens, can also result in more secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.<br>
Furthermore, as organizations continue embracing user-centric designs with a strong security strategy, magic links offer a pathway to more straightforward and intuitive authentication experiences. This user-centric focus and technological advancements can drive the broader adoption of magic links in various sectors and applications.</p>
 Security issues with magic links 
<p>Despite its benefits, the magic link email as a secure authentication method faces criticisms and challenges that hinder its widespread adoption. The dependency on email as a single point of authentication raises security concerns, as unauthorized email access can lead to potential vulnerabilities. Moreover, users without consistent email access or facing email delivery speed and deliverability issues might find magic links less convenient.<br>
Another challenge lies in user education and awareness. Users must be informed about authentication protocols, the secure management of magic links and the associated security risks to utilize this authentication method effectively and safely.</p>
 Expanding Adoption Across Industries 
<p>The versatility of magic link authentication facilitates its applicability across various industries. The finance, healthcare, financial institutions, and e-commerce sectors can leverage the magic link flow and links to enhance user experience and security. However, each industry must consider its unique requirements and challenges, such as regulatory compliance and user demographics.<br>
While magic link authentication presents a promising alternative to traditional authentication methods, its adoption requires a thoughtful strategy that aligns with industry-specific needs, user behaviors, and emerging technological trends. Such a nuanced approach can ensure the successful and secure implementation of passwordless magic link links in diverse sectors.</p>

			 Hong Kong’s Competitive Leap: Fueling Tokenization Growth Across Asia 
<p>This month, we attended the Digital Assets Week Hong Kong conference and were struck by the rapidly growing ecosystem surrounding tokenization in the region. The gathering of regulator SFC and major institutions at the event sent a strong message:&nbsp;Hong Kong is positioning itself as a frontrunner jurisdiction for the tokenization of securities.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Hong Kong has witnessed the emergence of numerous live tokenized securities projects alongside the CBDC pilot program (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/press-releases/2023/02/20230216-3/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">HKSAR Government tokenized a green bond</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theasset.com/article/50768/hgi-launches-first-tokenized-fund-in-hong-kong?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">HGI tokenized a fund</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/media/display-page-ndp/en-20240207-tokenized-warrant.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">UBS tokenized warrant</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3254551/hong-kong-launches-worlds-first-wholesale-cbdc-pilot-city-positions-itself-cutting-edge-blockchain?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">wholesale CBDC pilot</a>, …). The regulator provides clear guidelines, nurturing tangible use cases.&nbsp;This fosters regional competition for leadership in tokenization, driving the industry and the region forward.</p>
<p>Specifically, on 2 November 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced two circulars related to tokenized financial instruments: “<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC52&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">Circular on intermediaries engaging in tokenized securities-related activities</a>” and “<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC53&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">Circular on tokenization of SFC-authorized investment products</a>”.</p>
<p>The guideline is straightforward:&nbsp;same securities, same rules, but with digital controls.&nbsp;There are four points we want to highlight:</p>
 
 Open for retail investors:&nbsp;Evolved from March 2019 “Statement on Security Token Offerings” where security token offerings are restricted only to professional investors (PIs), the new circulars permit primary dealings of tokenized SFC-authorized investment products by retail investors. These offers have to be authorized under Part IV of the SFO or have complied with the prospectus regime and not fall under any other applicable exemption under the Public Offering Regimes. Otherwise, the offers can only be offered to PIs. 
 Same business, same risks, same rules:&nbsp;The new circulars define that tokenized securities are fundamentally traditional securities with a tokenization wrapper, the existing legal and regulatory requirements governing the traditional securities markets continue to apply to tokenized securities. 
 Blockchain agnostic: SFC recognized all types of blockchain networks, including private-permissioned, public-permissioned, and public-permissionless. However, issuers have to address risks by implementing adequate controls regardless of the blockchains they use. 
 New risks management: Issuers have to address risks related to ownership (e.g., how it is transferred and recorded) and technology (e.g., forking, network outages, and cybersecurity). Elizabeth Wong from SFC emphasized in a panel during the DAW conference that issuers have to demonstrate to the regulators they have controls over their tokenized securities (e.g., recover tokens). 
 
<p>Here is an illustrative example of tokenized funds by SFC:</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The risks highlighted in the circulars can be addressed with open-source ERC-3643, the validated and audited permissioned token standard:</p>
 
 Enforce compliance&nbsp;to ensure adherence to existing laws, and only eligible investors can interact with tokens, regardless of blockchain type. 
 Track ownership through identity-based on-chain registries to maintain the integrity of ownership records. 
 Take full control&nbsp;over their tokenized security to freeze or recover tokens as needed. 
 Enable multichain capability&nbsp;to address forking and network outage issues. 
 Upgradable implementation of smart contracts&nbsp;to ensure flexibility to address any vulnerability of the smart contract or updates of regulation. 
 
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;the circular mandates due diligence for tokenization technology, highlighting the importance of partnering with established players. With over 6 years of proven experience and enterprise-grade certifications like SOC2, Tokeny is well-equipped to support the Hong Kong market.&nbsp;The regulatory framework is in place, the technology is primed, and the market is set for rapid evolution!</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my <a href="https://youtu.be/m8umHdZBbHM">YouTube explainer video</a> on the browser changes underway to replace the functionality of third-party cookies when it comes to authentication services. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome.</p>



<p>There are several web features out there that support critical, basic security features like logging in and logging out. Those same features enable tracking individuals as they surf the web. Unfortunately, fixing this is not as simple as turning those features off for trackers. From a purely technical perspective, whether these features are used for authentication-related purposes or tracking, they are indistinguishable from the web browser’s perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, of all the features described in a <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/03/16/understanding-browser-tracking-logins-the-invisible-trail/">previous post</a> that serve legitimate and clandestine purposes, third-party cookies are one of the more tractable problems to resolve. So, let’s look at where the work is happening, one of the new mechanisms being developed, and what the changes will look like.</p>



 The Role of the W3C in Browser Changes 



<p>The <a href="https://w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) is where most of the work happens between browser vendors and various other stakeholder groups to standardize functionality on the web. This global community effectively shapes the web, ensuring it’s secure, efficient, and open for everyone. Their work is crucial for the standards we rely on daily.</p>



<p>Diving into the details of how the W3C works is beyond the scope of this video, but feel free to reach out if you’d like to learn more!&nbsp;</p>



 Federated Credential Manager (FedCM) 



<p>Now, onto <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">FedCM</a>. Developed by Google and incubated within the W3C, this API represents a significant shift in managing privacy and online authentication. As I mentioned earlier, a browser’s biggest challenge is distinguishing between acceptable use and hidden tracking. The purpose of the FedCM API is to help the browser determine whether a transaction is happening with the individual’s knowledge and consent. Let’s delve into how it works and why it matters.</p>



<p>Rather than acting like one of those annoying cookie banners, FedCM is designed to be called when an individual clicks on the login or sign-in button on a website. Before the website (the relying party, or RP) and the site responsible for authentication (the identity provider, or IdP) share any information, FedCM exists to mediate the transaction and make sure the individual is aware and ok with what’s happening.</p>



<p>Again, though, it’s not that easy. The FedCM developers must find a way to support some conflicting goals. For example:</p>



 
 Of course, the IdP needs to know what RP is asking for an authentication request! Our IdPs don’t talk to just anyone! 



 Of course, the IdP shouldn’t know anything about the RP! The IdP might track the sites the user visits! 
 



<p>Both statements reflect use cases that are 100% valid. There’s a reason this problem hasn’t been solved yet.</p>



 Other Initiatives 



<p>&nbsp;FedCM is just the tip of the iceberg. Google, Apple, Mozilla, and others are all innovating under the W3C’s umbrella, working together towards a more private web. These initiatives are reshaping our online experience. Some of their work focuses on enabling ethically targeted advertising (that’s happening in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/">Private Advertising Technology Community Group</a>. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/privacycg/">Privacy Community Group</a>, on the other hand, has more than a few efforts in incubation, including one that’s focused on link decoration, known there as navigation-based tracking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each browser vendor also has their own internal projects that influence (and are influenced by) what’s happening in the W3C. Google’s <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/">Privacy Sandbox</a> is the most public of these efforts and describes various tools they’re trying to build a more privacy-preserving web experience.</p>



 Google’s Cookie Countdown 



<p>Coming back to third-party cookies, a major milestone is approaching. In Q1 2024, Google begins turning off third-party cookies for <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sandbox-tracking-protection/">1% of Chrome users</a>. This test run is critical for their long-term privacy strategy. They are years behind Apple, a company that turned off <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/features/">third-party cookies in 2017</a> for Safari users. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/">Firefox</a> turned off third-party cookies by default in April 2023. Any changes Google makes, though, impact far more people. The Chrome browser has, by far and away, the largest market share of desktop browsers. They are also part of a much larger company, Alphabet, which still has several products that require third-party cookies to be available.&nbsp;</p>



 Real-world Impacts and Preparations&nbsp; 



<p>This shift on Google’s part to turn off third-party cookies by default for just a tiny fraction of their users might seem minor, but its implications are vast. Organizations must prepare for potential challenges and educate their people on these evolving technologies. Support desks already know to check to see a browser’s settings, but not everyone can or will call support. Companies should start turning third-party cookies off by default now to develop their plans, including testing out FedCM, to adapt to the changes.</p>



 Proactive Organizational Strategies 



<p>It’s time for businesses that aren’t browser vendors to be proactive in helping the web develop. Develop strategies, train your teams, and help define the solutions.&nbsp; It’s not just about reacting; it’s about being prepared for a new era of the web. I’ve had this conversation with individuals representing dozens of organizations in the last three years, and the biggest challenge is the executives who are entirely focused on their bottom line. And I get that. These executives want to know what to do and when to do it. Until they have answers to those questions, they are not inclined to assign resources to help other organizations figure out solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if these organizations want to make sure the web works the way they need it to, they need to invest in that bit of speculation. They need to assign people to test the proposed APIs and offer constructive feedback on how the code might be changed to suit their use cases.</p>



 Viewer Engagement and Further Learning&nbsp; 



<p>Eager to learn more about upcoming browser changes or get involved? There are links in the show notes to where the work is happening and how you can find out more. Your participation can influence the future of web privacy.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>We’ve covered a lot today, from the W3C’s vital role to the specifics of FedCM and beyond. Remember, these changes are shaping a safer, more private web for us all. Stay curious, stay informed.

 As the 2024 Olympic Games approach, the city of Paris is preparing to welcome an unprecedented influx of visitors. Mobility operators must be ready to respond to a substantial number of new customers in a very short span of time. 



<p>Over the past decade, urban <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> has experienced major alterations, driven by rapid technological change. While getting around has never been easier, experiences vary from one operator to another. The advent of mobile-first is leading mobility service providers to focus their mobility journey around mobile-usage, in favor of a resolutely simplified experience.</p>



<p>In a world where mobility is at the heart of our lives, the organization of large-scale events raises major challenges in terms of accessibility and security. From July 26 to August 11, 2024, France will host the Summer Olympic Games, and is preparing for an unprecedented influx of visitors. These foreign visitors, accustomed to other modes of mobility and transport, will have to familiarize themselves in a short span of time with sometimes unfamiliar travel and booking experiences. Paris is equipped with many different means of transport, combining micromobility, public transport, service providers, transport rental companies and car-sharing. For mobility operators, the question arises as to their ability to accommodate a substantial number of new customers in a very short amount of time.</p>



 Let the games begin: challenges facing mobility operators. 



<p>Transport and urban mobility operators face a number of challenges: rapid user authentication, age and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driver’s license verification</a>, and the collection of documentation and user information. To address these issues, identity verification service providers are positioning themselves as key players in meeting these needs, while ensuring a fluid and secure user experience.</p>



<p>In the context of a major event such as the Olympic Games, all mobility operators will be faced with many more demands during this period. Numerous people will be moving from various key points in a limited span of time. It therefore seems essential to simplify access to means of transport requiring a stronger means of identification, without compromising transaction security.</p>



 A seamless user journey, reflecting a smooth transport experience. 



<p>For mobility players, offering instant access to their services is crucial. When service users are confronted with a complex and unclear <a href="https://www.idnow.io/customers-experience/">onboarding process</a>, their frustration increases, as does the abandonment rate. A fast, accessible onboarding process, whatever the channel, becomes a major competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Operators are therefore seeking to offer their users a seamless experience, notably through a simplified, instantaneous and entirely mobile onboarding process. This means being able to quickly verify users’ age, the validity of their driver’s license or, in the case of some car rental companies, proof of address. One of the main challenges is therefore to minimize the time needed for these checks, while maintaining a high level of security.</p>



<p>At major events, such as the Paris Olympics in 2024, where mobility services will be particularly in demand, the ability to handle a high volume of requests becomes even more critical. Automated identity verification solutions can play a key role in this context. Not only do they considerably speed up the onboarding process by eliminating the need for manual account validation, they also ensure that the user meets the necessary conditions (age, valid license) to access the service.</p>



<p>In the case of rental contracts, the use of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">electronic signatures</a> to finalize transactions, and the automatic capture and extraction of information from identity documents, further accelerate the subscription process, without compromising the security of the transaction. Finally, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">video biometrics</a> enhances the security of mobility operators by ensuring that the person creating the account is who they claim to be, thus reducing the risk of identity fraud.</p>



<p>For mobility operators, these tools are not only a means of improving the user experience, but also represent an opportunity to set themselves apart from the competition. In a context like that of the Olympic Games, it will also be important to respond efficiently to peaks in demand, while guaranteeing continuity and quality of service.</p>



 Mobility as a Service: the future of urban mobility? 



<p>For providers of transport services requiring advanced identity verification, such as car rental or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility services</a>, the implementation of appropriate solutions is crucial to effectively meet the influx of requests. Without automated systems, these operators risk being forced to invest in additional human resources, a costly and less efficient solution in the face of highly variable demand.</p>



<p>The solution could lie in the adoption of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility as a Service (MaaS)</a> service, offering a single account to access all a city’s transport and mobility facilities. Berlin’s <a href="https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/">JELBI </a>sets the standard. By downloading this application, users fill in their information just once and can then access all the mobility services available in the city. This centralized approach considerably simplifies the user experience, reducing the complexity of accessing the various transport services. France, meanwhile, has yet to find its own MaaS operating model.</p>



<p>At a time when mobility is reinventing itself, security and ease of access to services are becoming major issues. As mobility is constantly on the move, it’s vital to understand the issues involved in order to anticipate tomorrow’s needs. The Paris Olympics will be an opportunity to test operators’ ability to manage the diversity of means of transport, to absorb the influx of visitors and also to test the means of identity verification available.</p>



<p>In this context, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> is an indispensable solution, eliminating several points of friction for mobility operators. The aim is to enable users to access desired services quicker and to make their experience as seamless as possible. Operators, for their part, can look forward to being able to process flows faster by automating time-consuming and complex processes.</p>

We get&nbsp;it.</p><p>To address this issue, we are proud to announce the 5x Predictoor Boost program. Practically speaking, it means that the Volume DF payout going forward is ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>(And can rise with higher DCV, all the way to the 112,5000 OCEAN budget for Volume&nbsp;DF.)</p><p>Also, we have retroactively applied this to the DF81 payout by <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x785ecb5dc208de89f4bab854e3b519223d7178b4446404ded3f022df9bb6194e">airdropping</a> each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday.</p><p>AMA coming&nbsp;soon!</p> Introduction / Contents of&nbsp;Document <p>The rest of this document describes DF budgets, then zooms in on Volume DF. It describes the “why” of a DCV bound on Volume DF rewards, what OCEAN rewards it led to, and how those numbers improved under Predictoor DF. It describes the bug and the fix, and how the Volume DF rewards changed due to the fix. It describes the issue of violating community expectations somewhat. Finally, it describes the fix: 5x Predictoor Boost, which restores Volume DF Rewards to ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> DF Budgets <p>Overall DF budget. We are in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">Data Farming Main 2 phase</a>, as Mar 14, 2024. From DF Main 1 to DF Main 2, the overall DF budget increased 2x.</p><p>Now, weekly rewards budget is 300,000 OCEAN (plus ROSE for Predictoor DF).</p><p>DF Budgets per Stream. DF is divided into streams. The “Passive DF” stream rewards people for locking OCEAN. The “Active DF” stream rewards doing more work to add value to ecosystem; it has two sub-streams “Volume DF” and “Predictoor DF”.</p><p>Here is reward allocation &amp; some detail per each stream, as of DF Main&nbsp;2.</p>  <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF</a>. 150K OCEAN / week. Lock OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. The longer you lock for, the more veOCEAN (details below). Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.  Active DF. 150K OCEAN / week. It has these substreams:<br>i. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF</a>: 112.5K OCEAN / week. Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.<br>ii. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor DF</a>: 37.5K OCEAN / week + 20K ROSE / week. Predict future price movement, continuously (as a predictoor).  <p>For further details on each stream, please consult the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> About Volume&nbsp;DF <p>Volume DF is a substream of Ocean Data Farming. In it, users allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Volume DF is not Active DF per se; it’s a subset of Active DF. Volume DF is not DF: there are several streams / substreams and it is one of them. Each stream is meaningful on its&nbsp;own.</p> The Wash-Consume Problem, and&nbsp;Fix <p>Early versions of Volume DF encountered a problem: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">wash consume</a>. Let’s explain. Volume DF rewards on DCV. People found a way to game this: publish data assets, then buy &amp; consume those assets themselves. A circular loop that drove up DCV. Volumes ballooned to&nbsp;$Ms.</p><p>This was not real volume, of course. And it is wasteful to reward OCEAN for this behavior. The aim is to reward OCEAN for things that truly drive value ot the ecosystem.</p><p>Here’s how we fixed wash consume: we ensured that rewards paid never exceed $ from fees. This works because fees themselves do not go into the pockets of the wash-consumers. Therefore anyone wash-consuming would lose $. (In Ocean, fees are baseline 0.1%; and baseline 20.1% for Predictoor feeds.)</p><p>The specific implementation is:</p><blockquote>Volume DF rewards for asset and each veOCEAN holder, are bound by: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier.</blockquote><p>The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise. Call this the “DCV bounds” on the Volume DF&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This also means that some of the OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF for a given week may not get deployed as rewards for that week. Any OCEAN not rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p> How much OCEAN is rewarded to Volume&nbsp;DF? <p>Before Predictoor was rolled out, DCV in Ocean was very small. And DCV_multiplier was 0.1%. So the DCV bounds (small DCV) * (small DCV_multiplier) = negligible number. Therefore OCEAN rewarded for Volume DF was negligible.</p><p>Then Predictoor &amp; Predictoor DF was rolled out, which caused both larger DCV and larger DCV_multiplier of&nbsp;20.1%.</p><p>Decent DCV. Predictoor came with Predictoor DF, where 37,500 OCEAN is spent as sales to buy Predictoor feeds. This is a “baseline” that incentivizes people to run Predictoor bots. In practice, it’s working extremely well, driving high activity and stake-to-predict volume. Predictoor feeds are the only meaningful contributor to DCV. So, DCV is basically the Predictoor DF rewards of 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Decent DCV_multiplier. Where other feeds had 0.1%, Predictoor feeds&nbsp;20.1%.</p><p>Let’s combine those: DCV bounds (decent DCV) * (decent DCV_multiplier) = decent-ish number. So, OCEAN rewarded for Volume DF comes out decent-ish.</p><p>Let’s do exact numbers. We apply the formula above: 37,500 OCEAN volume, times DCV_multiplier=20.1% gives a bound of ≈7,500 OCEAN total. Therefore ≈7,500 OCEAN is practically available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.</p><p>The implementation described above was the intended behavior.</p> Discovery: a bug in DCV-bounds code <p>Thanks to decent DCV and decent DCV_multiplier in Predictoor DF, the Volume DF payout was supposed to be ≈7,500 OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>However the payout ended up between ≈20,000-25,000 OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>That is, 2.67x-3.33x more OCEAN was being paid out for Volume DF, compared to the intended design of Volume DF. (Remember, this is only a bounds based on DCV of 37,500 OCEAN/week. If DCV was high enough, the full budget of Volume DF would be paid out: 112,500 OCEAN/week.)</p><p>Something was up in Volume DF payout calculations. We dug deeper. As of Fri Mar 15, 2024, we discovered the specific bug in those calculations.</p><p>The bug had applied data consume volume (DCV) bounds too loosely, which over-rewarded each individual account during&nbsp;payout.</p><p>Recall that the DCV bound for each asset and each veOCEAN holder: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier. Where “% stake in asset” is the amount of veOCEAN that a user has allocated, compared to the all veOCEAN allocated, for a given&nbsp;asset.</p><p>The bound was supposed to be on a per-asset, per-staker level.</p><p>But, the DCV bound code was written was only on a per-asset level. That was the bug. It missed the per-staker part. That is, “% stake in asset” was&nbsp;missing.</p><p>It meant that a user could create 10 separate accounts with 1/10 of her veOCEAN in each account, and get 10x more rewards compared to a single account. Yes, a Sybil attack. Anyone exploiting this flaw would be rewarded unfairly&nbsp;highly.</p><p>(To be clear: it wasn’t a security issue per se; there were no funds at risk. But it enabled people to game the system and get unfair rewards&nbsp;.)</p> Fixing the bug in DCV-bounds code <p>The core fix was to apply the DCV bound on a per-asset per-staker level. That is, to add the “% stake in asset”&nbsp;term.</p><p>We fixed the bug within hours of finding it. The first payout on the fixed code was for DF81, on Thu Mar 21. The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9">DF81–82 blog post</a> provides further information: in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9#a4c1">Section 5</a> (highly detailed); and with a complementary explainer in its <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9#2693">Appendix</a>.</p><p>The OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF never reduced. However, the amount paid out was reduced, because that payout is bounded by DCV, and DCV hasn’t been high enough to ignore this&nbsp;limit.</p> Bug Fix’s Effect on Volume DF&nbsp;Rewards <p>As expected, accounts doing Volume DF got reduced rewards in DF81&nbsp;payouts.</p><p>Smaller stakers (those with a small % stake on an asset) had larger APY drops than larger stakers. This is because the same DCV bound was (wrongly) only at the per-asset level. Each account saw the same bound. After the bug fix, the APYs should be identical.</p><p>Let us illustrate.</p>  If an asset has just one staker, where % stake = 100%, their Volume DF payout for that asset doesn’t change at all, because the new term “% stake in asset” = 1.0. So introducing it doesn’t change the&nbsp;numbers.  If a larger staker had 50% stake in an asset, their payout would be multiplied by 50%, ie a 1/0.5 = 2x reduction for the asset. Reduced APY for Volume DF&nbsp;follows.  If a smaller staker had 10% stake in an asset, their payout would be multiplied by 10%, ie a 1/0.1 = 10x reduction for the asset. Reduced APY for Volume DF&nbsp;follows.  <p>The above APY discussion is all for Volume DF. The APYs on Passive DF are independent; they’re at ≈20% these days. Passive DF APYs were not affected by this fix, since the fix is for Volume DF. Please don’t confuse Passive DF and Volume&nbsp;DF.</p> Bug fixed, but a second issue&nbsp;emerged <p>Like any professional software development team: we identified a bug; we fixed it asap; we deployed it; we communicated the&nbsp;changes.</p><p>However this caused a problem: people had locked OCEAN for years on the basis of seeing historical APYs in Passive DF and Volume DF. A long-term commitment which we appreciate.</p><blockquote>Those expectations got violated somewhat, due to the reduced rewards for Volume&nbsp;DF.</blockquote><p>Many were upset. We get&nbsp;it.</p><p>At the heart of the problem: Volume DF with the bug was ≈20,000–25,000 OCEAN / week. After the bug fix, payout was ≈7,500 OCEAN / week (ie payout of DF81). That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction. There were corresponding reductions in Volume DF APYs; those vary per-user as described above.</p> Towards addressing the second&nbsp;issue <p>How can we fix the problem of: expectations got violated somewhat, due to the reduced rewards for Volume&nbsp;DF?</p><p>To make a specific goal: can we get Volume DF rewards back to at least ≈20,000–25,000 OCEAN /&nbsp;week?</p><p>We have constraints:</p>  It doesn’t make sense to “undo” the bug fix, because then we’d still have the bug, with the issues it&nbsp;entails!  We want to ensure that DF code implementation reflects the intent of its designers (us).  As always, the design of DF and its sub-streams needs to remain flexible enough to keep evolving. All so that OCEAN rewards deployed most effectively drive traction in Ocean, and especially data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).  Related to the last point, some alpha: we do have other Data Farming sub-streams in the works! Those need breathing space. And, Predictoor is growing so the Predictoor DF weekly budget may increase&nbsp;too.   Introducing 5x Predictoor Boost <p>We are proud to announce the 5x Predictoor Boost program. It is a solution to the problem&nbsp;above.</p><p>Recall:</p><blockquote>Volume DF rewards for asset and each veOCEAN holder, are bound by: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier.</blockquote><p>Before, Predictoor feeds had DCV_multiplier = 20.1%. 5x Predictoor Boost gives a 5x to this multiplier.</p><p>With 5x Predictoor boost, Predictoor feeds get DCV_multiplier =&nbsp;100.5%.</p><p>Let’s do exact numbers. We haveDCV of 37,500 OCEAN from (due to Predictoor DF), times DCV_multiplier=100.5% gives a bound of 37,687.5 OCEAN total (≈37,500 OCEAN). Therefore 37,687.5 OCEAN is practically available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.</p><p>(And as DCV rises, up to the whole Volume DF budget of 112,500 OCEAN becomes available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.)</p><p>The 5x boost only applies to the first 37.5K rewards given out on Volume DF. After that, the usual dcv_multiplier=20.1% applies. This helps to ensure breathing space for new DF substreams or increased Predictoor DF&nbsp;budget.</p> Implementation of 5x Predictoor Boost <p>What happens&nbsp;today:</p>  Retroactively apply this new formula to DF81 payout (which was yesterday — Thu Mar 21, 2024). In practice, we have airdropped each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday. <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x785ecb5dc208de89f4bab854e3b519223d7178b4446404ded3f022df9bb6194e">Here’s the&nbsp;tx.</a>  <p>What happens in before next DF&nbsp;payout:</p>  Update the DF payout code to apply the 5x Predictoor boost, for future weeks. (Applicable to first 37.5K&nbsp;rewards)  Update documentation, etc as&nbsp;needed.   Conclusion <p>Due to a bug fix, the Volume DF OCEAN payouts shrunk. Previously, under the bug, payouts were about 20,000–25,000 OCEAN. DF81 payout (Mar 21, 2024) was the first time the bug fix was applied. The Volume DF payout for DF81 was 7,500 OCEAN. That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction. (APYs for Passive DF and Predictoor DF were not affected.)</p><p>While this was a legitimate bug fix, the drop in reward caused community expectations to be violated somewhat.</p><p>Many were upset. We get&nbsp;it.</p><p>To address this issue, we are proud to announce the 5x Predictoor Boost program. Practically speaking, it means that the Volume DF payout going forward is ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>(And can rise with higher DCV, all the way to the 112,5000 OCEAN budget for Volume&nbsp;DF.)</p><p>Also, we have retroactively applied this to the DF81 payout by airdropped each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday.</p><p>AMA soon!</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  <p>In a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/how-tenant-restrictions-v2-can-be-used-to-prevent-data/ba-p/3915339">previous blog</a> in the Data Exfiltration series, we discussed different types of tenant restrictions policy. In this blog, we’ll discuss migrating from tenant restrictions v1 to authentication plane tenant restrictions v2. In future blogs, we’ll discuss migrating to Universal tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions are a vital tool to help prevent data exfiltration from unauthorized access to external Microsoft Entra ID tenants and consumer Microsoft accounts. Tenant restrictions v1 lets you create an allow list of tenant IDs and Microsoft sign-in endpoints to ensure that users access external tenants that your organization authorizes. While tenant restrictions v1 served well for many years, tenant restrictions v2 offers more granularity and easier policy management with no additional licensing requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions v2 has several benefits over tenant restrictions v1. For example, admins can:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Update the policy from the Microsoft Entra portal rather than from each network proxy. There’s no need to update the header.&nbsp; 
  Increase the size limitations of your maximum proxy header length. There’s no limit to the number of partners you can add with tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp; 
  Selectively indicate which user groups access which apps in external tenants rather than allowing entire tenants for all identities.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll explain the differences between how the two tenant restriction types work independently from, and in tandem with, cross-tenant access settings (outbound) to highlight the benefits of upgrading to tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started with tenant restrictions&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions require routing all user authentication traffic through a proxy. Typically, the proxy is the on-premises network egress, but it can also be a cloud-based proxy. The proxy injects a header indicating that an allow list of destinations is enforced on the traffic, regardless of the originating device or network location. In tenant restrictions v1, the destination allow list is in the header. In tenant restrictions v2, the header has a tenant ID and policy ID. Traffic arrives at Microsoft Entra ID, which reads the header and enforces the policy. If the traffic destination isn’t in the allow list, the user receives an error message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Example of a user getting blocked by tenant restrictions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How tenant restrictions v1 works&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two types of identities: internal and external. Your organization creates and manages internal identities with your identity provider (IdP) but doesn’t manage external identities such as personal accounts or those created by an external organization. Tenant restrictions v1 applies to both account types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following diagrams, two types of identities (green is internal and black is external) are on the corporate network or connected with a virtual private network (VPN). Both identity types go through the corporate network egress proxy when attempting to access Microsoft 365 services. Typically, both receive the same header injection of allowed destinations. This enforcement has some limitations. If you maintain the allow list in the network proxies, administrators update the header at each proxy when you add or remove a tenant. It’s also important to note that the headers have size limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Tenant restrictions v1 applies to external tenant destinations equally with no user or app granularity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can improve tenant restrictions v1 by adding cross-tenant access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restrictions v1 with outbound cross-tenant access settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Microsoft Entra ID, you can configure the cross-tenant access settings feature to control outbound access on a per-user, per-group, and per-application basis. This policy applies to your internal identities, regardless of device or network location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following diagram, the users go through the egress proxy. Cross-tenant access settings and tenant restrictions are applied. However, the tenant restrictions v1 allow list is the only policy that applies to external identities. This option improves internal user management, but the architecture has limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both tenant restriction v1 and cross-tenant access settings are evaluated, and the most restrictive policy is applied. However, cross-tenant access settings only apply to internal identities. If you allow access to an external tenant for your users, even with group or application restrictions, you enable all external identities to access any resource in those tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Cross-tenant access settings adds user and app granularity for internal identities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restriction v2 with cross-tenant access settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restriction v2 works in tandem with cross-tenant access settings. Tenant restriction v2 is a cloud-based policy that applies to external identities. Internal users’ access is controlled by cross-tenant access settings. This separation allows per-user and per-application granularity for internal and external identity scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following example, the organization puts group and application restrictions on their internal identities. However, they can block other external identities from accessing external tenants unless they create exceptions. In this case, an exception is made for Bob from Tenant C. He is allowed access to only Microsoft Exchange so he can check email while on the corporate network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Tenant restrictions v2 adds granular user and app awareness to external identities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The previous diagram demonstrates the flexibility that tenant restrictions v2 offers. Because tenant restrictions v1 and v2 have the same licensing requirements, the one-time migration involves recreating policies and updating the header injection at your network proxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more in the tenant restrictions v2 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/tenant-restrictions-migration">migration deployment plan.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further enhance tenant restrictions, learn about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-universal-tenant-restrictions">Universal tenant restrictions</a>. This feature adds data layer protection and prevents token infiltration that can bypass your corporate network proxy’s tenant restrictions header injection. The feature injects the headers and has a low latency connection to Microsoft 365 resources without needing to hairpin traffic through your corpnet proxies.&nbsp;</p>

 Creating Value with Identifiers  Why identifiers are essential to secure cross border trade, and how we have applied best practices and design principles <p>Transmute enables global trade digitization. Essential to this mission is facilitating an optimal digital identifier strategy for our customers, in which our Verifiable Data Platform plays an important part. In this white paper we discuss some points of inspiration and the design choices and principles we have made to bring efficient, safe, intuitive — and beautiful — identifiers to the supply chain&nbsp;sector.</p> Inspiration <p>In designing our identifiers, we have looked to major internet players for inspiration: HBO, LinkedIn and&nbsp;GS1.</p> HBO <p>HBO is a great source of inspiration, consistently following identifier design practices. For example, here is the URL for accessing the movie Dune:<br>https://play.hbomax.com/player/urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>This URL consists&nbsp;of:</p>  Scheme (https), indicating that there is a resource resolvable over secure&nbsp;HTTP  Host (play.hbomax.com) with HBO’s domain&nbsp;name  Path of HBO’s video player (player), available to authenticated HBO&nbsp;users  Sub-path with a unique identifier of the movie Dune (urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ)  <p>We will dissect the structure of the identifier in a moment, but first it’s important to note the same identifier of Dune is used elsewhere to resolve different resources. For example:<br>https://www.hbomax.com/dk/da/a/param-feature/urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>Which links to a publicly available “movie poster” page, in this case on a Danish microsite as per the&nbsp;path.</p><p>Looking closer at Dune’s identifier, urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ, this is a URN consisting of:</p>  Scheme (urn)&nbsp;, indicating a unique but not necessarily resolvable identifier  Namespace, NID (hbo)&nbsp;, which arguably should be registered with IANA, <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces/urn-namespaces.xhtml">but&nbsp;isn’t</a>  Namespace-specific string, NSS (feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ), which notably consists of a categorization of what is identified (feature:) as well as a unique&nbsp;string   LinkedIn <p>LinkedIn follow a very similar pattern as HBO for linked in posts:<br>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7062908400073887744</p><p>Again, the URL is comprised of:</p>  Scheme (https),  Host (www.linkedin.com)  Path (feed/update)  Sub-path with a URN identifier (urn:li:activity:7062908400073887744)  <p>And again, the identifier is a URN constructed as:</p>  Scheme (urn),  NID (unregistered) (li),  NSS (activity:7062908400073887744), consisting of a categorization of what is identified (activity:) and a unique&nbsp;string.  <p>LinkedIn also allows for natural identifiers for identifying people (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/</a>) and companies (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/transmute-industries">https://www.linkedin.com/company/transmute-industries</a>). There are two interesting points to note&nbsp;here:</p>  The use of natural keys (nis-jespersen and transmute-industries). When this is possible, humanly recognizable keys derived from the business domain is a strong&nbsp;feature.  A more questionable part of this design is that LinkedIn is not sticking with URN identifiers. A better and more consistent design could have been for example: https://www.linkedin.com/company/urn:li:company:transmute-industries   GS1 <p>GS1 governs identifiers for elements used in trade such as product types (GTIN), organizations (GLN) and transport identifiers (SSCC). These can be extended, for example a GTIN with a lot number traditionally looks like this: (01)09520123456788(10)ABC123 where (01) and (10) are codes for GTIN and lot respectively, followed by their values, in combination forming a unique compound key for the&nbsp;lot.</p><p>GS1’s <a href="https://ref.gs1.org/standards/digital-link/uri-syntax/">Digital Link standard</a> defines how the GS1 identifier must be represented as URIs. The Digital Link of the above example could be <a href="https://id.gs1.org/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123">https://id.gs1.org/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123</a> (this is the so-called canonical form). Importantly, it could also be <a href="https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123">https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123</a>, allowing the brand owner to host resolvable information about the&nbsp;product.</p><p>Per the spec, identifying properties are on the path, whereas non-identifying properties are placed in query parameters. Weight, for example, is non-identifying, so the Digital Link for (01)09520123456788(3103)000195 where (01) codifies the GTIN followed by its value, and (3103) codifies Net Weight and 000195 is 195 grams, can be <a href="https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788?3103=000195">https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788?3103=000195</a>.</p><p>Peculiarly, GS1 has not opted to leverage the registered <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5134.html">“epc” URN namespace</a> in the Digital Link standard. The above GTIN could be represented like this:<br>https://brand.example.com/urn:epc:id:gtin:0952012.3456788.</p><p>Granted, the QR code for this would be bigger; an important argument. Apart from that this seems like a missed opportunity to spread a best practice identifier pattern broadly into GS1’s established user&nbsp;base.</p><p>In conclusion of this little tour of inspiration, we’ve found that HBO and LinkedIn have taken practically identical approaches to identifying and localizing their platform resources. GS1 seems to have been on a similar path before changing direction for Digital Link. Next, we will look into some of the drivers which have led HBO and LinkedIn to the same best practice&nbsp;design.</p> Design Principles <p>In this section we will focus on properties which make a good identifier. We will also consider some properties which make them bad, if not dangerous.</p><p>Why does HBO bother adding urn:hbo:feature: and not just a “naked” identifier such as <br>https://play.hbomax.com/player/GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>And, similarly, why do we consider this to be well formed:<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/urn:transmute:presentation:bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</p><p>But not this:<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</p> Unique Resource Identifier <p>First of all, bdb8a296-ed17–41a6-b5e6–46n157747bee is not a URI, whereas urn:transmute:presentation:bdb8a296-ed17–41a6-b5e6–46n157747bee is.</p><p>There is a caveat, formally the URN namespace should be registered with IANA such that they can guarantee uniqueness. Our stance is that our use of the unregistered namespace (transmute) is sufficiently unique; a stance which we share with the likes of HBO and LinkedIn.</p> Usability <p>During development and integration, engineers often juggle identifiers from various platforms at once. Hints about which platform and type of resource the identifier is associated with makes it much easier to work with. As you glance over a table of identifiers, being able to pick out the one you are looking for is a time saver. Platforms often prefix identifiers with such context, in our case for example transmute:presentation intuitively and clearly point towards the origin and type of resource.</p><p>A developer should also intuitively trust that an identifier is unique. While UUIDs are a little long, they are recognizable and a developer instinctively comprehends the identifier’s uniqueness.</p><p>Finally, these aspects should come naturally. In working with identifiers, the good experience is the one you don’t experience.</p> Casing Convention <p>The natural keys employed by LinkedIn were kebab-cased (nis-jespersen). This is preferred because most operating systems and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-handle-underscores-dashes-differently-89672">search engines</a> treat dash-separation as separate words. In contrast, both camelCasing and snake_casing are generally considered one big word. Kebab-casing is also considered <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/41595/what-is-the-casing-convention-for-url-routes">more readable</a> than the alternatives.</p> Location Decoupling <p>The decoupling of the resource and its location(s) allow us for example to get Verifiable Credential data with<br><a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6">https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6</a></p><p>And verify it with<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6/verify</p><p>This is similar to how urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ was used to retrieve both the Dune trailer microsite and the full movie&nbsp;player.</p> Security <p>Without this decoupling, there is just one identifying URL, for example:<br><a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee">https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</a> <br>which means the entire identifier string is now a WHATWG URL, not an IETF URI, in turn allowing for UNICODE encoded internationalized domain&nbsp;names.</p><p>It is Transmute’s position that UNICODE is great for display strings, but dangerous for identifier strings. We wholeheartedly support the ability to capture people’s name in their local representation. Indeed, the author’s full name includes an “ø”. But we are saddened by the careless adoption of UNICODE in international domain names, which has unnecessarily exposed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">internationalized domain name homoglyph attack</a> surface. For example an ASCII o is very difficult to tell apart from a cyrillic о (not the same character!), allowing for microsoft.com and mіcrоsoft.com (not the same domain!) to&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200102175251/http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/papers/homograph_full.pdf">coexist</a>.</p><p>We do not fancy ourselves that we can fix the internet. But we vigilantly seek to minimize exposures anytime we have the chance; in this case by adopting ASCII-based URN identifiers where we have the&nbsp;chance.</p> Key Origins <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key">natural key</a> is derived from business or application data which are unique in their nature and are typically intuitively understood by humans. By contrast, a synthetic or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key">surrogate key</a> is technically generated solely for the purpose of uniqueness, without direct linkage to the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>We saw how LinkedIn in some cases uses the person or organization name as natural keys. This is possible for finite resources which carry such natural identifiers. In such cases it is preferable to adopt human recognizable and intuitive keys. Where possible we have similarly adopted natural keys where resources are finite and under Transmute’s control. Prevalently, though, v4 UUID synthetic keys are used, in particular for all customer controlled resources.</p> Transmute Identifier Design <p>This section attempts to formalize Transmute’s identifier design, pertaining to our Verifiable Data Platform&nbsp;(VDP).</p> Resource Identifiers <p>VDP resources are identified with&nbsp;URNs.</p><p>The general pattern for VDP URN identifiers are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>urn:transmute:[resource-type]:[v4-uuid|natural-key]</p><p>Where:</p>  urn, the URN&nbsp;scheme,  transmute, the unregistered URN&nbsp;NID,  [resource-type]:, first part of the URN NSS, indicating the type of resource in singular&nbsp;form.  [v4-uuid|natural-key], second sub-delimited (unique) part of the URN NSS; a v4 UUID for user governed resources, kebab-cased natural key for Transmute governed resources.   API Resources <p>Resources are accessed on the VDP <a href="https://restfulapi.net/">REST</a> (REpresentational State Transfer) API following this general&nbsp;pattern:</p><p>https://platform.transmute.industries/[resource-type]/[resource-identifier]</p><p>Where:</p>  https, the HTTPS&nbsp;scheme,  platform.transmute.industries, the platform&nbsp;host  [resource-type], first part of the path, indicating the resource type in plural according to <a href="https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/">REST naming best practices</a>.  [resource-identifier], identifying part of the path, URN as described above.   Versioning <p>Note that we are not including API versioning on the path. Of course, we may have to introduce breaking changes on the API at some point (it has not yet been necessary). When this day arrives, we will adopt a <a href="https://restfulapi.net/versioning/">header-carried</a> design for version management.</p> Combining REST and Well-Formed Identifiers <p>The combination of self-explaining URNs and collections style REST endpoint URLs entails a degree of redundancy, for example the inclusion of&nbsp;:credential and /credentials in the same&nbsp;request.</p><p>LinkedIn faces the same situation on their <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/dma/content/activities">LinkedIn REST API</a>, where for example “activity” is repeated on the path and in the identifier:</p> GET ‘https://api.linkedin.com/rest/dmaActivities?ids=List(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7074127827113058304)' <p>Like LinkedIn, Transmute finds this is an acceptable consequence considering the combined benefits gained from strong identifiers and&nbsp;REST.</p> Content Negotiation Three representations of the same Verifiable Credential resource, respectively: text/html, application/json, and application/pdf.<p>Following <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/">cooluri</a> best practices, different representations of the same resource are available, subject to content negotiation. The best example of this is Verifiable Credentials, which are available both as HTML, JSON and&nbsp;PDF.</p> Verifiable Data Platform&nbsp;Examples <p>This section lists identifier examples of resources currently supported on&nbsp;VPD.</p>  urn:transmute:credential:b5d5f8d6–3a83–4n1s-a4d5-a56cd09a5ac6  urn:transmute:presentation:bdb8a296-ed17–41a6-b5e6–46n157747bee  urn:transmute:identifier:09en1584–9366–44af-8a0b-1aaf95d83607  urn:transmute:contact:ef54af47–4303–4874-bee6-fe54c279b851  urn:transmute:template:commercial-invoice-credential  urn:transmute:workflow:definition:us-cbp-entry  urn:transmute:workflow:instance:f5fb6ce4-b0b1–41b8–89b0–331ni58b7ee0  urn:transmute:adapter:neo4j  <p>Note the extra hierarchical layer of workflow:definition and workflow:instance NSS sub-delimiters, reflecting the many-to-many relationship between the workflow definitions and instances.</p>Example of a workflow referencing a Workflow Instance and a Workflow Definition.<p>These are examples of credential and template resources on the platform:</p>  <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:cc485f9e-627d-466c-b0b9-3ddf2ae0c60d">https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:cc485f9e-627d-466c-b0b9-3nis2ae0c60d</a>  <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/templates/urn:transmute:template:commercial-invoice-credential">https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/templates/urn:transmute:template:commercial-invoice-credential</a>  <p>Here, the template identifier is passed in the queries string for issuing a Commercial Invoice credential from the template-based form:</p>  <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/issue?template=urn:transmute:template:commercial-invoice-credential&amp;step=1">https://platform.transmute.industries/issue?template=urn:transmute:template:commercial-invoice-credential&amp;step=1</a>  <p>Some additional example of resource querying:</p>  <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/templates?pageSize=10&amp;page=0&amp;unsupported=false&amp;search=commercial+invoice">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>/marketplace/templates?pageSize=10&amp;page=0&amp;search=commercial+invoice  <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations?direction=outbound">https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations?direction=outbound</a>  <p>Fragments are used to reference verificationMethods of a DID Document as per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a>:</p>  did:web:platform.transmute.industries:organizations:org_WioDDk68cALd3YoN#z6MksU7WFxyMS3jupvdTUnBn15vfjvh5taZbwixdfrqs1vJj   Wrapping Verifiable Credential <p>As all Linked Data classes, Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations have @id properties, and at first glance it may seem like a natural choice to identify the VDP resource. However, this identifier is entirely in our customer’s control, and can like any other property during issuance; or it could be issued on a different platform and only stored on VDP. Such untrusted user input is ill fitted as database primary keys, as we cannot guarantee uniqueness.</p><p>Moreover, the @id property is optional per the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model</a> specification, which further underscores the point: a primary key cannot be optional.</p><p>Adopting the VC and VP’s @id as platform resource would have led to very unintuitive and intrusive platform behavior: rejecting storage requests, injecting identifiers into customers’ data objects, etc — clearly unacceptable from a business platform dealing with trade data. We believe this is a generic challenge faced by all but the most puristic Linked Data platforms, in which users expect, understand, and appreciate such behaviors and restrictions.</p><p>So, instead VDP maintains these classes in abstracted resources which wrap around the basic VC and VPs, separating the VC/VP itself from the platform’s representation of it. This has several benefits:</p>  There can be perfectly acceptable business reasons to have non-unique or anonymous nodes in a data graph, and this lets customers be in complete control of their verifiable data&nbsp;graph.  The wrapper can contain valuable metadata about the resource, for example the sender and receiver of a verifiable presentation.  The abstraction allows for storing multiple representations of the same credential, kept as different formats, controlled as media&nbsp;types.  Example of a presentation containing two credentials with colliding ids, urn:ex:x, stored comfortably in VDP within resources urn:transmute:credential:1 and urn:transmute:credential:2 (URNs simplified for clarity). Status List Credentials <p>Bitstring revocation credentials are an exception to this principle. Per <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/">the spec</a>, revocation credentials must be resolvable, so their identifier (referenced by the revocable credential) must be a URL, not a URN. For&nbsp;example</p> ‘id’: ‘https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/97abfc14-5n1s-45ff-bfde-de30eb772c20’ <p>As a consequence, revocation credentials are bound to VDP in that they cannot be moved neither to nor from other platforms. This is both acceptable and a logical consequence of the purpose they&nbsp;fulfill.</p> Execution Challenges <p>This section is based on interviewing our engineering team, reflecting upon the process of designing and implementing the above identifier design. The truth is developing this part of our platform has led to challenges and frustrations amongst the team. It is our hope that others can learn from our experience and plan for a smoother process towards implementing a great identifier design.</p> Leadership <p>Management has struggled to share the vision for Linked Data and combine it with pragmatic execution. Designing Linked Data relationships permeates the stack, and often got in the way of fast execution. When not communicated properly, there were tendencies towards disliking Linked Data before it was even properly understood.</p><p>This experience was mirrored in the engineering team as a sense of being too involved in the design process: “the vision gets muddy with too many people involved”.</p><p>Indeed, authoring this document is meant as an attempt to once and for all get team alignment on the company’s identifier strategy.</p> Value <p>Consistency in the API design has been a reoccurring challenge. When the vision and principles are not communicated well enough to the team, the normal self-correction mechanisms do not kick in, and so inconsistencies slip through. The deviations add up and become self-perpetuating, leading to bugs, miscommunication, and frustration.</p><p>When consistency is essential, it means the normal MVP feature approach fits poorly with identifiers. There is clearly an investment to be taken seriously. You should not do a half baked job of this; you are better off not starting at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The engineering team have had periods where this tweaking identifier semantics sugar has felt like “work, not value” which could be forever improved, but with diminishing impact.</p> Requirements <p>Something as fundamental as identifiers takes strong requirements up front. Sporadic bug tickets, for example that a collection should be plural, becomes a debate of the framework which it is held against, whether it is a bug at&nbsp;all.</p><p>In interviewing, one engineer requested a README document to avoid inconsistencies — essentially requesting this document. Once we had gone through it he immediately explained an API endpoint which he believed was inconsistent. The team self-correction worked! It is clear that a document like this one should have been produced much sooner in the&nbsp;process.</p> Commercialization <p>There is a duality in the team’s feelings about where we have gotten. We are proud of our identifiers! But we also recognize that they are long and may seem over-engineered and unapproachable, not least in our target supply chain sector market where it is common practice quoting for example “manufacturer numbers”. As much as we love the technical details, we realize they may be a hard selling&nbsp;point.</p><p>However, we insist that identifiers are essential to building systems with safety, privacy and value in focus, especially in today’s increasingly connected world. It has always been true that identifier collisions can be costly. The context and requirements for identifiers have changed dramatically since the analogue days. We take it upon ourselves to design for a safe and efficient future, even if — especially if — our customers do not fully appreciate everything which this&nbsp;takes.</p> Database Identifier Decoration <p>Rather than storing the full URNs at database level, we still only store the raw keys, adding the URN decoration around it. This means removal before it goes into the DB, and add it back on the outbound. There is a lot there you have to remember when making changes. And you have to think about future scenarios too, for example if Transmute got bought, that might affect the transmute namespace, and you would be adding more layers. As one engineer puts it “adding context adds complexity”.</p><p>Not storing the URNs is effectively a case of not making full use of our own investment. Partly due to history, partly due to the mid-process confusion described above. For example, there have been worries that the special code would have to deal with lower environments identifiers (subdomains used only internally), a result of conflating URLs with URNs. The database level is essentially the last, missing step of the process described in this section, and now that the principles are fully understood it will be a matter of time before we get&nbsp;there.</p> Conclusion <p>Transmute sells identifiers, and we aim to sell amazing products. So our identifiers need to be&nbsp;amazing.</p><p>We have studied examples of major internet players, HBO and LinkedIn, how they both construct URN identifiers, which are then used in URLs. We also studied the GS1 Digital Link, which has good reason to take a different approach, prioritizing backwards alignment.</p><p>We analyzed the drivers behind these design principles: URI benefits, separation of concerns, security, and key origins. Based on these, we were able to formalize VDP’s identification design.</p><p>Finally, we shared some honest reflections on the real-life transformation our team has been through. It is our hope that others who share our ambition will benefit from these learnings.</p><p>Consistency is an essential measure of quality. This document should make clear not just what quality identifiers look like, but also motivate&nbsp;why.</p><p>We encourage comments and discussion on this article, as well as signing up for free on <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/creating-value-with-identifiers-ef9446b87835">Creating  Value with Identifiers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 As the Brazilian igaming market prepares for lift off, we discuss regulatory surprises, the challenges of encouraging players to leave the black market, and the feasibility of Brazil becoming the largest gambling market in the world. 



 



<p>Although at first glance, there may not appear to be a huge amount in common between the Brazilian aviation industry and the Brazilian gambling industry, for lawyer Neil Montgomery, there are parallels that gambling operators would be well served to follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Late last year, the Brazilian online gambling industry took significant steps toward regulation, when Law No. 14,790/2023 was enacted further addressing fixed odds sports betting and igaming. While last month’s departure of <a href="https://www.telecomasia.net/news/other/mansurundefineds-resignation-could-impact-launch-of-bets-in-brazil/">government chief advisor, Jose Francisco Mansur</a>, is likely to result in considerable delays to the licensing process, it will not dampen the appetite for the official launch of a fully regulated gambling market in Brazil at federal level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The excitement and anticipation for a regulated market at federal level (since some Brazilian states – like Paraná and Rio de Janeiro – have already made state licenses available) is borne largely from two things: the federal government realizing it is missing out on significant tax revenue, and Brazilian players being able to benefit from a safer and more secure player experience that only a regulated platform can offer. However, Neil does warn that unless gambling operators take the necessary steps to become ‘regulation-ready,’ including adherence to KYC, identity verification, and responsible gambling measure requirements, there is likely to be trouble ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumer legislation is strict and strictly enforced in Brazil so foreign operators are going to have to confront the nightmare of doing business when it comes to consumer claims.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neil explains that Brazil is infamously ranked number one in the world in terms of airline passenger claims. The reason, he suggests, is that although Brazil complies with international conventions on the limitation of carrier liability, said conventions do not apply to so-called ‘moral damages,’ or the pain and suffering inflicted on the passenger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I believe a similar situation will repeat itself in the gaming industry because disgruntled consumers will now have a local door to knock on and use the Brazilian courts to obtain favourable awards. Brazilian courts will look at sports betting and igaming operators as wealthy companies and an expectation for companies to compensate damages cost to consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, Neil explains all about consumer legislation, tax, KYC, and why Brazilian gambling operators may have the upper hand on their stronger foreign counterparts.</p>



 Now that Brazilian regulations for sports betting and online casinos have passed, was there anything in the final draft that surprised you, positively or negatively? Is there anything you would like to see revised in future iterations? 



<p>Well, I think that in general terms, it was very positive. We had to wait until the very last minute in 2023 to see the law passed because there was a lot of discussion as to whether this was coming out this year or not. The federal government, of course, was focused on getting it passed since it has an objective of reaching zero tax deficit in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any additional revenue is welcome and of course the sports, betting and gaming markets are seen as a very good source of additional revenues. For this revenue to be included in the 2024 budget, everything had to be passed in 2023. A positive surprise was the inclusion of igaming in the law because it was originally only supposed to govern fixed odd sports betting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Brazilian law, we still need to wait and see what the Ministry of Finance will do with its many ordinances. There are 12 expected to be released, and we’ll see what the definition of igaming is. Another surprise was the fact that operators will need to have 20% Brazilian ownership. However, the way it is worded was a bit ambiguous because it doesn’t explicitly refer to a Brazilian individual and so adopting a two-tier corporate structure in Brazil (where the foreign operator would first incorporate a local holding company and have that company incorporate the local operator applying for the license – the latter thereby having a 100% Brazilian shareholder). The other positive was player tax being reduced from the initially proposed 30% to 15%. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There were certain paragraphs vetoed by President Lula, such as the player having to calculate income tax on net winnings on an annual basis. All vetoes are still to be heard at Congress, and there’s a lot of uncertainty as to how the income tax is going to be calculated and collected.</p>



 Have you noticed a surge in interest or activity among Brazilian gaming operators since it passed? 



<p>Well, there are very few Brazilian operators because most of them are all foreign operators that will now have to set up shop in Brazil to obtain a federal licence. For many years, players have been used to playing on offshore platforms. Upcoming law changes will make the experience of using an unlicensed platform much harder. For example, there will be restrictions on advertising and on payment methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foreign operators will therefore have to obtain a licence from the Ministry of Finance and players will have to play only on licenced operators in Brazil. Right now, we’re in a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/"> grey market</a> until the full legal framework is laid out, but from the moment licences are made available at federal level, it will officially become a black market, and will be considered significantly riskier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will always be ways of circumventing the regulated market, but I think it’s going to be more cumbersome for them to be able to play in the black market. So, hopefully the ordinances will allow a balance between what operators need to do, what the players need to do, and what the government needs to do so that the new regulated market will be sufficiently attractive to encourage players to bet in a licenced environment.</p>

 With many Brazilian players already familiar with gambling on the grey market, how ready and willing do you think players will be to switch to regulated, domestic platforms, where they will be required to complete a KYC process and follow tax payments? 



<p>It all depends on how easy it is to operate in the regulated market. I think there’s still some uncertainties regarding how the tax will be calculated and collected. I think if they had published the methodology of how the player’s income tax will be calculated then that would have been very positive in terms of encouraging players to place their bets in the domestic market. We just need to wait and see what happens. However, if the legal framework is more time and cost consuming than continuing to place bets on the black market, then of course we’re going to have channelization issues, which of course the federal government would like to avoid. Also, will the regulations leave enough room to guarantee the return on investment, because the licence fee is going to be quite high: 30 million Brazilian Reals, which is about $6 million for a 5-year licence. That puts Brazil as one of the most expensive places in the world to obtain a licence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Also, of course, let’s not forget the real reason for regulating the market, which is player protection and investment protection, so hopefully the balance will be found to avoid players continuing to place their bets on the black market.</p>



 Brazil is forecast to become the largest gambling market in the world. Do you see any obstacles in its way to achieving that? 



<p>Well, I’m an eternal optimist, so if a good balance can be found, which will require all stakeholders to make concessions, then I think so. In Brazil, professional football depends massively on sponsorship provided by operators, and there has been an increase in the value of sponsorship over the years and now that the law has passed, I have seen the amounts go up quite significantly. It’s likely to lower again at some point in the future, but right now sponsorship amounts are record-breaking, and every week we receive news that a football club is receiving twice, three times the amount of sponsorship of previous deals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there’s a lot of appetite for Brazil to become the largest gambling market in the world, and I think it will generate a lot of jobs, a lot of investment, but we need to find the balance. This is the key issue; we are in a newly regulated market and everything’s new for everyone. This is the big opportunity we have been waiting decades for, and now is the time to get it right.</p>



 As a lawyer, what is your opinion of the Brazil licensing requirements? Too arduous, too many loopholes, or to be expected? 



<p>Well, the law has been framed in a way that if an operator doesn’t obtain a licence, they’re going to be subject to many restrictions to access the Brazilian market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Brazilian federal government has always said that once licences are made available then they are going to enforce legislation. We have seen at state level many enforcement actions by certain states, especially Rio Janeiro and Paraná, because not only do we have the federal licence regime, but we also have state licences because federal legislation has taken so long to be enacted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2020, states have enacted their own legislation to grant state licences for traditional lottery and for fixed odd sports betting, as fixed odd sports betting was legalized in Brazil as a form of lottery, and we have seen many clients of ours receive notices and subpoenas as they have not obtained a state licence. One of the main problems we have is of the legal problems caused by the dichotomy between federal and state licences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re awaiting the official licencing requirements. We only have the main points in the law. So, we know it’s an open licencing model with no limit on the number of licences issued, which is good, that’s the model I have been advocating for many years. We know it’s going to cost 30 million Brazilian Reals for a five-year licence, and each operator can promote up to three brands, and not necessarily the operator’s own brand, so there could be licencing arrangements with other brand holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plan is to have two windows per year during which the applications can be filled. 134 companies submitted applications last year, well, submitted an expression of interest and the federal government has promised priority in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Hopefully the Ministry of Finance will have sufficient human resources to process all these applications, because they are going to be flooded with a lot of paperwork. Everything is going to be done electronically, which should be more efficient, but there’s going to be a lot of documents that need to be provided. We still do not know whether documents coming from overseas will have to satisfy the formalities of notarization. It’s going to be the first experience in Brazil in terms of licencing at federal level, but hopefully we’ll get there!&nbsp;</p>



 In your legal opinion, how well-prepared are Brazilian operators, particularly start-ups, to navigate the complexities of the new regulatory landscape in the online gambling sector? 



<p>Well, there’s going to be a surge in igaming lawyers in all aspects of the law, because this is a very detailed, regulatory environment. So, there are many different aspects to it. So, I think Brazilian operators may have an advantage of knowing the law better, and how it could evolve with upcoming regulations, as they know the market so well. Maybe they don’t have the strength that foreign operators have, but at least they have the knowledge of the local market and knowledge of the local law, which should give them a certain competitive advantage. Foreign operators who set up shop in Brazil will gradually have to learn their way around the treacherous waters of the Brazilian legal system because, as we say, Brazil is not for amateurs.</p>



 With other countries in the Americas opening, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/peru-gambling-regulation/">such as Peru</a>, how important do you think the region will become in the global gambling market in the next 5 to 10 years? Is the future bright? 



<p>I think Latin America is the new frontier of the gaming industry. So, most of it is still uncharted territory, especially Brazil, but I think things will become clearer with time. But, yes, Latin America is the place to be at the moment and I think we’ll be in the spotlight for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have seen other surprise advancements, even in the Muslim world, with land-based casinos being floated in the UAE for example, and even places like Saudi Arabia are now considering casinos. So, I think igaming is seen as something that needs to be focused on and Latin America, Mexico, all the way down to Argentina and Chile are going to be in the spotlight with Brazil likely to become the main player in that regional market.</p>

In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions via Predictoor.</p><p>👉 This week, we discovered and fixed a bug in Volume DF. It applied DCV bounds too loosely, which over-rewarded each individual account. We have fixed the bug. Accounts doing Volume DF should expect reduced rewards from DF81 payouts onwards. <a>Section 5</a> has details; the <a>Appendix</a> has a complementary explainer. UPDATE [one day later]: we have introduced <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-5x-predictoor-boost-in-volume-data-farming-c9a93b33b928">5x Predictoor Boost</a>, which restores Volume DF reward&nbsp;levels.</p><blockquote>DF81 was the first round of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">DF Main 2</a>. In it, OCEAN rewards doubled to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF now get 150K OCEAN/week.

Rewards counting started 12:01am March 14, 2024 and ended 12:01 am March 21. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF82 is live today, March 21. It concludes on March 28. 300K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF82  <a>Section 5</a>: Bug Fixed in Volume&nbsp;DF  <a>Appendix</a>: Complementary Bug Fix Explainer   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF, and Predictoor DF.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF82 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;2.</p><p>Budget. This round has 300,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of&nbsp;rewards)  Active DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of rewards). To each substream:<br>– Volume DF: 112.5K OCEAN<br>– Predictoor DF: 37.5K OCEAN + 20K&nbsp;ROSE  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier. This <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">prevents wash consume</a>. The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise.  <p>Any OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF that wasn’t rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p><p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Bug Fixed in Volume&nbsp;DF  5.1 Summary <p>This week, we discovered and fixed a bug in Volume DF. It applied DCV bounds too loosely. We’ve fixed it now. Accounts doing Volume DF should expect reduced rewards from DF81 payouts&nbsp;onwards.</p> 5.2 Status Quo&nbsp;Behavior <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/">df-py</a> is the GitHub repo implementing DF rewards formulae. The issue is in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/issues/821">df-py issue #821</a>; we bring relevant info&nbsp;here</p><p>Here is the main formula for Volume DF rewards, before the fix. It’s from df-py’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/blob/cca4665cfb0670d23b67767ce6e724c56be338e3/df_py/volume/reward_calculator.py#L182C1-L205C18">reward_calculator.py</a>.</p> R[i, j] = min(<br>    perc_at_j * perc_at_ij * self.OCEAN_avail,<br>    ocean_locked_ij * TARGET_WPY,  # bound rewards by max APY<br>    DCV_OCEAN_j * multiplier,  # bound rewards by DCV<br>) <p>R[i,j] is the reward amount in OCEAN, for user i and asset&nbsp;j.</p><p>Inside the min() function, the first term is the baseline reward amount. The second &amp; third terms bound by max APY and DCV respectively. The problem is in the third term with DCV_OCEAN_j.</p><p>If DCV is sufficiently low that Volume DF rewards should be bounded it (typical), and if Alice splits her veOCEAN across 2 accounts, then Alice will get more rewards compared to if a single account. This is incorrect behavior.</p><p>We can tell that this happens in the DCV_OCEAN_j line, because it’s only a function of j and not of i as&nbsp;well.</p> 5.3 Problem with Status Quo&nbsp;Behavior <blockquote>The # rewards that Alice gets should only be a function of how much veOCEAN Alice has, not whether she has one account or two (or&nbsp;100).</blockquote><p>The bug exposed Volume DF to Sybil attacks: Alice got 2x more reward than she was supposed to for having 2 accounts. If she had 100 accounts, she would have got 100x more (up to where the asset-level DCV bounds kicked in). In other words, Volume DF over-rewarded each individual address.</p><p>It also meant that each account got over-rewarded, since they were only bounded by DCV of the asset, not by their pro-rata stake in the&nbsp;asset.</p><p>This was the case since asset-level DCV bounds were introduced: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">DF23</a> on Feb 2,&nbsp;2023.</p> 5.4 Reproducing the&nbsp;Problem <p>The following code exposes the issue, in test form. The first test is for one account; the second is for two accounts. It should have rewarded the same total OCEAN (50) whether there was one account, or&nbsp;two.</p> def test_bound_by_DCV_1nft_1accounts():<br>    DCV_OCEAN = 100.0<br><br>    stakes = {chain1_id: {nft1_addr: {user1_addr: 1e6}}}<br>    nftvols = {chain1_id: {OCEAN_addr: {nft1_addr: DCV_OCEAN}}}<br>    OCEAN_avail = 10000.0<br><br>    with patch("df_py.volume.reward_calculator.calc_dcv_multiplier") as mock_dcv:<br>        mock_dcv.return_value = 0.5<br>        rewards_per_user, _ = _calc_rewards(stakes, nftvols, OCEAN_avail)<br>    assert rewards_per_user == {user1_addr: 50.0}<br><br>def test_bound_by_DCV_1nft_2accounts():<br>    DCV_OCEAN = 100.0<br><br>    stakes = {chain1_id: {nft1_addr: {user1_addr: 0.5e6, user2_addr: 0.5e6}}}<br>    nftvols = {chain1_id: {OCEAN_addr: {nft1_addr: DCV_OCEAN}}}<br>    OCEAN_avail = 10000.0<br><br>    with patch("df_py.volume.reward_calculator.calc_dcv_multiplier") as mock_dcv:<br>        mock_dcv.return_value = 0.5<br>        rewards_per_user, _ = _calc_rewards(stakes, nftvols, OCEAN_avail)<br>    assert rewards_per_user == {user1_addr: 25.0, user2_addr: 25.0} <p>We had the first test before, and it passed. Whereas the newly-introduced second test failed. In it, of the two accounts got 50 OCEAN, for 50+50 = 100 OCEAN total. Correct would have been 25+25 = 50 OCEAN&nbsp;total.</p><p>This is good news: we had reproduced the issue in reproducible tests. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/pull/809/files#diff-936f12da0a54dc6256a4ffd1e8418c94405af8f70bb269a34a6cbf968d88528c">Here’s the PR</a>; the code shown is modified slightly for readability.</p> 5.5 The Fix to the&nbsp;Problem <p>Here’s the change in code. The “before” line in red didn’t properly bound rewards. The “after” line in green does. The main fix was just one line. (<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/pull/809/files#diff-afc4732bb19ebf7622890387838941eddb3d67d74dee5cd6dc7127a6fe889a7f">Here’s the&nbsp;PR</a>.)</p>Red = before the fix, green = after the fix. DCV bounds are now scaled by the user’s proportion of rewards, perc_at_ij.<p>The specific fix is: the DCV bounds need to also scale by the account’s proportion of stake in the asset, perc_at_ij. Like all proportions, 0 &lt;=perc_at_ij ≤&nbsp;1.</p><p>With the fix in place, the previously-failing test now passed.&nbsp;Great!</p> 5.6 How does this affect users going&nbsp;forward? <blockquote>In previous rounds, accounts were being over-rewarded in Volume DF because it wasn’t properly bounding on&nbsp;DCV.</blockquote><blockquote>Accounts can expect the proper amount of reward now, from DF81 payouts onwards. It is almost certainly less than&nbsp;before.</blockquote><p>Here’s why one should expect less rewards in Volume DF. The additional term perc_at_ij in the rewards line has value between 0 and 1, and is rarely 1 because one user rarely has all the&nbsp;stake.</p><p>In other words, there’s an OCEAN reward allocated for a given asset (based on its DCV compared to other assets), and that reward is spread among different accounts (based on their relative stakes in the&nbsp;asset).</p> 5.7 Final Clarifications <p>Just to say it: we won’t retroactively reduce any rewards. For starters, even trying would be pretty uncool! Second, it’s not very pragmatic to implement.</p><p>Also, this only affects Volume DF rewards. There is no change to Passive DF Rewards, or to Predictoor DF&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>It’s also not a security vulnerability. Yes it was a Sybil attack, but in this case it means that a person could Sybil-attack to take comparatively more rewards for themselves. Emphatically, it was not a security bug: there were no funds at risk, and there were no funds&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>UPDATE: one day after we published this post, we have introduced <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-5x-predictoor-boost-in-volume-data-farming-c9a93b33b928">5x Predictoor Boost</a> to restore Volume DF reward&nbsp;levels.</p> Appendix: Bug Fix Explainer <p>This subsection describes the bug fix changes end-to-end, in a different voice.</p><p>You may see see a significant drop in your Volume DF rewards this week. This is indeed the correct behavior after the bug&nbsp;fix.</p><p>Let’s elaborate. We discovered a bug that gave more rewards payout for Volume DF than the design intent. We fixed the bug within hours of discovery. With the bug fixed, users will see a sizeable drop in Volume DF payout compared to previous weeks. Although this drop is large, the code is updated with the correct functionality that Volume DF rewards were supposed to have all&nbsp;along.</p><p>Here’s that rewards&nbsp;logic:</p>  asset X generates data consume volume&nbsp;DCV.  then, Volume DF rewards for asset X are either DCV_multiplier= 20.1% (Predictoor feeds) or 0.1% other&nbsp;assets).  those asset rewards for are divided among veOCEAN holders who allocated veOCEAN to this asset, according to their stake. This is where delegations get counted&nbsp;too.  <p>Then, repeat the above for each of the&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Realistically, there is only volume on Predictoor feeds. So DCV is basically the Predictoor DF rewards of 37,500 OCEAN. Multiplying the 37,500 OCEAN times 20.1% for Predictoor feeds means about 7,500 OCEAN.

 Unveiling a New&nbsp;Era <p>In our digital age, the management of digital identities has become a critical concern. Traditional centralized systems, managed by entities like Google and Facebook, often fall short in safeguarding user privacy and security. This introduces Decentralized Identity (DID), a paradigm shift that promises not just a technological revolution but a cultural transformation, emphasizing digital independence and security.</p><p>The evolution of identity management from centralized to decentralized models, with DID at the helm, marks a significant departure from the status quo. Initially, online identification relied on methods like emails and passwords, with enhancements such as WebAuthn bolstering user authentication. However, these centralized systems presented considerable privacy and security vulnerabilities, leading to an urgent call for a new approach. DID, utilizing blockchain technology, represents this new frontier. By empowering users with control over their personal data, DID ensures privacy and enhances security, heralding a new era of digital interactions that prioritize user autonomy.</p><p>This shift to DID introduces numerous benefits:</p>  Streamlined Verification: Simplifies the authentication process, allowing for safe and efficient identity&nbsp;checks.  Enhanced Security: By distributing data across a decentralized network, DID minimizes the risks associated with centralized data&nbsp;storage.  Greater Privacy: Users control their personal information, sharing only what’s necessary and with whom they&nbsp;choose.  Reduced Data Breaches: The decentralized nature and encryption methods lower the potential for large-scale data breaches.  <p>Blockchain technology underpins DID’s advantages, providing a decentralized framework that transforms personal data management. This not only secures information through encryption but also assures data integrity, as altering recorded information requires network consensus. Blockchain’s role is pivotal in overcoming the limitations of centralized systems, offering a verification mechanism that bolsters trust without compromising privacy.</p><p>As we look towards a future shaped by these advancements, DID stands as a beacon for a user-centric digital ecosystem. This evolution from centralized control to decentralized empowerment signifies more than technological progress; it marks a shift towards a digital existence where privacy, security, and user autonomy are paramount. The journey towards this future, driven by blockchain’s innovative capabilities, promises to redefine digital identity management, ensuring a more secure, transparent, and empowering online&nbsp;world.</p><p>In conclusion, the move to decentralized identity systems is not merely a response to the shortcomings of centralized models but a forward-looking vision for a digital society grounded in autonomy and trust. As this paradigm shift unfolds, DID emerges not just as a technological solution but as a cornerstone for a future where digital interactions are rooted in empowerment and transparency, reshaping our digital lives in profound ways. This transition to a decentralized framework marks a pivotal moment in our collective digital journey, promising a more secure, private, and user-centric online experience.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/basics-and-importance-of-decentralized-identity-56098fd64fe5">Basics and Importance of Decentralized Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The National Security Agency (NSA), in conjunction with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), recently released its “<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3699169/nsa-releases-top-ten-cloud-security-mitigation-strategies/">Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies</a>” for organizations to make their cloud environments more secure. The report contains a Cybersecurity Information Sheet (CSI) for each strategy, which includes MITRE ATT&amp;CK and D3FEND mappings and cloud-specific mitigation guidance.</p>  
<p>The agency emphasizes that these measures are critical for every company that uses cloud services as these environments are increasingly targeted by malicious cyber actors (MCAs). Earlier this year, the NSA, CISA and a host of international cybersecurity agencies <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3686651/russian-cyber-actors-target-cloud-hosted-infrastructure/">issued a joint advisory</a> analyzing the way that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are evolving their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to focus on initial access and disruption of cloud services. The new guidance provides mitigation strategies to counter these threats.</p> 
<p>Full strategy list:</p> 
  
  Uphold the cloud shared responsibility model  
  Use secure cloud identity and access management practices  
  Use secure cloud key management practices  
  Implement network segmentation and encryption in cloud environments  
  Secure data in the cloud  
  Defending continuous integration/continuous delivery environments&nbsp;  
  Enforce secure automated deployment practices through infrastructure as code  
  Account for complexities introduced by hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments  
  Mitigate risks from managed service providers in cloud environments&nbsp;  
  Manage cloud logs for effective threat hunting  
  
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #1: Cloud Security Starts With Identity Security&nbsp;  
<p>Much of the guidance centers on having a robust identity security program. Insufficiently secure identity systems leave organizations exposed to any number of threats including phishing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks, identity fraud, MFA bombing attacks and more. Last year saw a 71% spike in cyberattacks that exploited stolen or compromised credentials, according to IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">2024 threat report</a>, accounting for 30% of attacks. The report also revealed that 90% of the cloud assets for sale on the dark web were cloud account credentials.</p> 
 Phishing-Resistant MFA Is No Longer Optional  
<p>Two of the top strategies directly relate to secure identity practices, and several others on the list call out the need to protect credentials and the threat posed by passwords and shared secrets. Specifically, the guidance recommends the use of phishing-resistant MFA as widely as possible. It defines phishing resistant methods as FIDO standards based public key cryptography or PKI-based CAC/PIV cards, pointing to the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">phishing-resistant MFA fact sheet</a> issued earlier by CISA.</p> 
<p>Example of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication flow:</p> 
<p></p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #2: Context Is King  
<p>Multiple measures in the guidance emphasize the need for detailed contextual information about the system’s activity and behavior. This data is critical to govern access and drive appropriate and timely responses to potential threats. For example, the report highlights the need for <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/context-based-authentication-to-improve-security">context-based authentication</a>, using conditions such as geo location</p> 
<p>The effectiveness of such context-based access controls depends on the fidelity of the information flow, which in turn depends on monitoring risk from a wide variety of sources. Ideally, an organization’s cloud identity control systems would leverage the same risk data being collected for threat hunting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #3: Minimize Complexity  
<p>Before rolling out MFA and other cloud security solutions, it's crucial to fully understand the range of scenarios they'll be used in. The NSA guidance cautions against an uncoordinated approach, which can leave gaps in coverage and create complexity. Using multiple IAM systems and different authenticators can create confusion for users and hinder adoption. It also makes it harder to manage and monitor security effectively.</p> 
<p>This becomes especially critical in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Attackers move back and forth between on-prem and cloud environments. The guidance recommends the organizations implement identity solutions that can unify disparate systems and support all of their use cases. Authentication protocols should follow the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST SP 800-63 </a>Digital Identity Guidelines.</p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #4: Embrace Zero Trust Principles  
<p>Whether you’re of the camp that Zero Trust is a marketing buzzword, or if it’s your guiding north star, the principles behind Zero Trust are solid security best practices. A Zero Trust approach makes data, systems, and networks harder for attackers to compromise in the first place, and slows them down if they do manage to get a foothold.&nbsp; Much of the NSA Cloud Security guidance is, in effect, Zero Trust tenets made actionable, starting with <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a> and least-privilege access control, to strong cryptographic protocols and network segmentation. Implicit in all of the guidance is to bake in Zero Trust best practices as you migrate to the cloud. It’s harder to re-architect already established systems, especially if there is not adequate segregation of duties. For example, your authentication systems should be separate from your IdP.</p> 
 Tips for Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA  
<p>The NSA recommendation for phishing-resistant MFA stands out as one of the simplest yet most effective strategies. Until now, it's been the high-stakes sectors like financial services, insurance, and critical infrastructure leading the charge in adopting phishing-resistant controls. The NSA guidance makes clear that it’s time for security teams across the board to catch up. Here are some things to keep in mind:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Prioritize a consistent experience. Users want a simple login process that is the same across cloud systems and resources as well as other channels. Employ independent, phishing-resistant authentication controls that work with multiple identity sources to provide a uniform experience.  
  Take a phased approach. Start with critical systems and high-risk users to minimize disruption and maximize impact. As you troubleshoot and succeed, gradually extend the approach to wider systems and user groups.  
  Beware of FIDO imitators. There is a vast difference between "FIDO-like" or "FIDO-compliant" and "FIDO Certified." Verify vendors' certifications on the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">FIDO website</a>, ensuring all solution components, authenticators and servers, are certified.  
  
 How Organizations Can Meet NSA Cloud Security Provisions  
<p>The new guidance from NSA underscores the critical role identity plays in fortifying cloud security defenses. With malicious actors increasingly targeting cloud environments, and specifically identity systems, following recommended best practices becomes indispensable. The rapid <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/preventing-generative-ai-attacks">weaponization of generative AI</a> in attacks makes this even more critical.</p> 
<p>HYPR's Identity Assurance platform, which includes HYPR Authenticate, HYPR Adapt, and HYPR Affirm, ensures that identity security meets NSA standards. It combines advanced passkey-based authentication with adaptive identity risk management, automated identity verification, and a user-friendly experience.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">HYPR Authenticate</a> provides highly secure FIDO-based, phishing-resistant MFA. It ensures that biometric templates are linked to individual devices, addressing privacy and security concerns while following NSA guidelines. It covers all user groups and scenarios, from desktop to cloud environments.</p>

<p>If you’re an IAM (Identity and Access Management) manager in a small or medium-sized business, you know the challenge of trying to secure a growing ecosystem of SaaS (Software as a Service) applications. Every day, there’s a new app that one of your employees must have, and it’s your job to ensure access is granted quickly, consistently, and securely. But with each new app, the risks of inconsistent access management grows. Is there a way to solve this challenge? Of course, there is. Why else would I be writing this and you reading it?</p>
<p>Read on.</p>
<p>Many apps can’t be easily integrated into your IAM system. The apps might support SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for single sign-on (SSO), but that’s often locked behind an expensive “Enterprise” tier. And even if you can afford it, automated provisioning requires SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), which is even less commonly supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCIM is an open standard that defines a schema for exchanging user identity information between systems. It allows IAM systems to automate the provisioning, de-provisioning, and management of user accounts in SaaS apps, ensuring that access is always in sync with the user’s current role and employment status.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without SCIM, IAM managers are forced to rely on manual processes and custom integrations to manage SaaS app access. As your team and SaaS portfolio grow, these manual processes become increasingly unsustainable and error-prone.</p>
 The Challenge: SaaS App Sprawl and Access Management Complexity 
<p>So what do you do? Many fall back on spreadsheets and a patchwork of playbooks to try to keep up. But this approach has serious risks – and the risks get worse as you add more apps and more people with varying access needs and roles. This perfect storm of complexity spirals out of control, leading to inconsistencies, security risks, and compliance issues.</p>
 The Risks of Inconsistent Access Management 
<p>When onboarding and offboarding processes vary from app to app, it’s easy for things to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Imagine a new sales rep who starts work excited to dive in and close some deals, only to find they can’t access the CRM because their account hasn’t been provisioned. Or consider the IT team that thinks they’ve completed an employee’s offboarding, only to discover weeks later that the ex-employee still has access to sensitive data in a cloud storage app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These inconsistencies not only frustrate employees and waste time they also create serious security risks that compound with each new app.</p>
 The Dangers of Access Creep 
<p>Then there’s the access creep. As employees move between roles, their permissions don’t always keep up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ex-engineer Al Sutton revealed that despite quitting 18 months ago he still retained access to Twitter’s central file store on GitHub, a website used by software developers to store source code.” — <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/08/24/ex-twitter-staff-have-access-secret-software-code-whistleblower/#:~:text=Ex%2Dengineer%20Al%20Sutton%20revealed%20that%20despite%20quitting%2018%20months%20ago%20he%20still%20retained%20access%20to%20Twitter%27s%20central%20file%20store%20on%20GitHub%2C%20a%20website%20used%20by%20software%20developers%20to%20store%20source%20code.">The Telegraph</a></p>
<p>Consider a tech startup that uses GitHub Teams to manage their code repositories. When an engineer leaves the company, their GitHub account isn’t always immediately deprovisioned from the company’s GitHub organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the IT team is busy or forgets to follow up, the ex-employee could retain access to critical codebases, infrastructure-as-code templates, and other sensitive IP long after they’ve left. This lingering access is a major security risk even if the engineer has no malicious intent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If the engineer’s personal GitHub account is ever compromised, hackers could then gain access to the company’s crucial assets. As your company grows and more employees cycle through, the risk of this happening increases.</p>
 The Danger of Poor Visibility 
<p>Perhaps most concerning is the lack of visibility into user permissions across SaaS apps. Even with an IAM system in place, the lack of automation makes it impossible to fully track and manage access across all SaaS apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider an auditor who asks to see a report of everyone who has admin access to your financial systems. If those permissions are managed in a spreadsheet or worse, in someone’s head, you’re going to have a tough time pulling that report together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you can’t confidently prove who has access to what, you risk failing the audit and losing out on big deals with security-conscious customers. Achieving SOC2 compliance with inconsistent access management is a daunting task that only gets harder as your SaaS ecosystem expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And even if you’re not pursuing SOC2 compliance, put yourself in your customers’ shoes: would you buy a product from a company that can’t even track something as basic as what their employees have access to?</p>
<p>The longer you wait to address these issues, the more entrenched and intractable they become. That’s why it’s critical to implement a solution now, before your SaaS environment grows too complex to manage.</p>
 The Solution: Centralized IAM Playbooks 
<p>By bringing all your access management processes together in one place – including manual steps, automated workflows, and everything in between – you can ensure consistent, timely execution of access changes across all your apps, now and in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You gain a single pane of glass to monitor and manage permissions. And you can easily generate the reports you need to breeze through your next compliance audit, no matter how many SaaS apps you’ve added to your stack.</p>
 Why Legacy IAM Falls Short 
<p>But not all IAM solutions are up to this task. Legacy IAM systems often lack the flexibility and extensibility needed to implement truly centralized playbooks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They might handle the basics of single sign-on and provisioning, yet struggle to accommodate the custom workflows and manual steps that are a reality of life with SaaS apps, especially as your app portfolio diversifies.</p>

<p>With the turn of the 20th century and the rise of the internet, transactions and services became increasingly digital – and so did our identities. Unlike physical identities where a person is in complete control of their identification documents and knows when these documents are missing or stolen, digital identities are stored on servers and databases owned by third-party vendors that offer their services in a digital format. So, it’s highly unlikely a person would know when their digital identity is stolen or compromised. In effect, a cybercriminal could pose as a legitimate user and inflict financial and reputational damage over a long period of time before the breach is detected.</p>
<p>As cloud adoption and digital transformation has accelerated over the last few years, so has application sprawl, with the average company having over 254 SaaS apps, and less than half of those being used on a regular basis, according to a Productiv study. And an average mobile phone user has 80 apps installed, with 62% of those apps not used on a regular basis, according to a DataProt study. This SaaS sprawl has led to password fatigue and reuse as well as dormant accounts, increasing the attack surface for cybercriminals to launch successful identity-based attacks. It’s no wonder that phishing and credential compromise are the two most common initial attack vectors.</p>
<p>Taking a layered approach to identity-first security</p>
<p>With the advent of generative AI technologies and criminal SaaS offerings such as phishing as a service that enable cybercriminals to launch effective and targeted phishing campaigns, identity has quickly become the perimeter that organizations need to secure against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>In order to build an effective identity-first security strategy, organizations need to take a layered approach to a proactive defense – starting with an effective AI-based biometric solution to verify identities accurately while detecting fake IDs and deepfakes.</p>
<p>Then, enabling high assurance phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passwordless-login">passwordless authentication</a> (e.g., certificate-based authentication with passkeys) can help authenticate seamlessly while protecting against phishing and MFA-bypass attacks.</p>
<p>You can further eliminate the dangers that come with SaaS application sprawl and password fatigue&nbsp;by implementing a true passwordless experience with <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/single-sign-on">single sign-on (SSO)</a> and just-in-time user provisioning capabilities. This can streamline the authentication process and help eliminate dormant accounts, reducing license costs associated with granting user licenses for applications that users never log in to.</p>
<p>Finally, tying in a robust adaptive risk engine that can evaluate the risk score of a user based on contextual information (IP address, geolocation, travel velocity, behavioral biometrics, etc.) introduces friction in the process by requiring a second <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">MFA</a> or blocking access when risk levels are higher than a set threshold.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in some recent breaches, bringing in an identity verification step with physical credentials and liveness detection during MFA/password resets – to secure a high-value transaction or out-of-compliance user –&nbsp;can build a robust, proactive identity-first security strategy.</p>

<p>Ensuring the safety of sensitive data and privacy shifts from just a priority to an absolute necessity. Authentication, the gatekeeper of these digital resources, is crucial in this fight against cybercrime.&nbsp; In this article, you will learn what it is, why it’s helpful, how it differs from other types of authentication, and how you could implement it in your organization.</p>
 What is Step-Up Authentication? 
<p>Step Up Authentication is a dynamic form of multi-factor authentication. It works by adjusting the level of security and user verification based on the associated risk of a specific action, transaction, or mobile account.</p>
<p>Different triggers can prompt Step Up Authentication’s activation, like irregular user behavior, access requests from unfamiliar locations or devices, or high-risk transactions accessing sensitive data. Users may initially authenticate via traditional methods (username/password), but Step Up Authentication comes into play as the perceived risk escalates, demanding additional login credentials.</p>
<p>Step Up Authentication uses a hierarchical model adaptive authentication scheme, scaling from simple to complex; it provides the flexibility to apply the optimal level of security based on the perceived threat or the user’s risk profile.</p>
 The Anatomy of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes operation of Step Up Authentication is a balance between risk assessment and corresponding adjustments to the step up authentication work up level. Each transaction or request initiates a process where the system evaluates the risk level and prompts the user for a related step up authentication.</p>
<p>To make these decisions, the system utilizes various risk assessment metrics. These include factors such as the sensitivity of the requested data, the location of the user’s location request, the behavior of the user, and even the time of the request.</p>
<p>Policy management plays a big role here, as it sets the rules and parameters for when and how the system should step up the authentication process. These policies, dictated by the nature of the business and its unique security requirements, ensure that the system remains secure and user-friendly.</p>
 The Evolution of Authentication 
<p>The progression of authentication techniques paints an interesting picture of human ingenuity in the face of evolving threats. Beginning with the humble password, these techniques have developed in response to escalating risks and more sophisticated threat actors.</p>
<p>The initial stage was dominated by password-based authentication systems, a straightforward and user-friendly method, yet not without its weaknesses. Passwords, being susceptible to breaches via techniques like brute-force attacks and phishing, necessitated a more robust system.</p>
<p>Subsequently, security tokens emerged as a new layer of protection. Yet, their physical nature introduced inconvenience and added risk of loss or theft. Later, the advent of biometric authentication marked a significant stride forward against identity theft, tying access to unique human characteristics such as fingerprints or retinal patterns.</p>
<p>The most significant leap in this evolutionary process was the introduction of multi-factor authentication, combining multiple layers of security to create a formidable barrier to unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>While both Step-Up Authentication,&nbsp; Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Adaptive Authentication serve the goal of improved security, they differ significantly in their approach.</p>
<p>MFA  involves presenting two or more independent credentials at every step up authentication vs. event. This could include something the user knows (password), something the user has (token), or something the user is (biometrics). MFA’s strength lies in its layered defense, using multiple authentication factors and making it challenging for unauthorized users to gain access even if they compromise one aspect.</p>
<p>Adaptive Authentication employs real-time risk assessments, considering many factors such as device reputation, IP reputation, geolocation, and behavior anomalies. Based on these assessments, Adaptive Authentication may permit, or deny authentication apps, or step up the authentication process.</p>
<p>Step-Up Authentication adjusts its various authentication factors and requirements based on the perceived risk level of a transaction or request. It might begin with a simple or two-factor authentication, such as a password, and add more layers as risk escalates. It offers the flexibility of user-friendly authentication for low-risk actions and robust security for higher-risk operations.</p>
 Viewing vs. Editing Data 
<p>One of the significant features of Step-Up Authentication is its ability to adapt to the nature of the user’s actions. For instance, when a user views data, the authentication process might require only the user’s password or a simple username and password in/password combination. This allows users to perform low-risk actions with minimal friction.</p>
<p>However, when the same user attempts to edit or export sensitive data, the system recognizes the higher risk and steps up the authentication process. This could involve using additional authentication credentials, such as a one-time password, biometric verification, or answering security questions. This dynamic response to requires users based on the action type underlines the adaptability and intelligence of Step-Up Authentication.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication in Practice 
<p>In practice, you’ll encounter Step Up Authentication in different scenarios, Financial institutions often apply it during high-value transactions. Cloud services employ it when users request access to susceptible information. It’s becoming increasingly ubiquitous across digital platforms, from email services to social media networks.</p>
<p>Sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and corporate entities, utilize Step Up Authentication as an essential tool in their security arsenal. It is increasingly recognized as a powerful means to secure sensitive data, protect user identities and stolen credentials, and maintain system integrity.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication Use Cases 
<p>Step-Up Authentication is not just a theory but a reality with practical applications across various digital platforms. For example, take a standard action like transferring funds from a banking app. Users might log in to the app using a username/password or biometric authentication. However, when the user initiates a high-value transfer, the system might request additional identity verification as a one-time password (OTP) sent to the user’s registered mobile number or email.</p>
<p>Another use case can be found within corporate systems; an employee may be able to access common, low-sensitivity resources using a simple password. Still, when attempting to access further sensitive resources, more sensitive information, or administrative controls, the system prompts them to undergo further authentication, such as answering security questions or presenting a physical token.</p>
 The Strengths of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>By assessing its impact, the merits of Step Up Authentication become abundantly clear. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to bolster security, creating a robust defense against a wide array of cyber threats.</p>
<p>But its benefits extend beyond security; it contributes significantly to improving user experience, as the need for rigorous additional authentication factors and measures only arises under elevated risk conditions. This reduces friction and potential frustration in day-to-day user interactions.</p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, Step Up Authentication also aids in meeting regulatory requirements for data breach protection. Moreover, it has become a potent tool in the risk management arsenal, offering an adaptive and responsive approach to data breaches and threat mitigation.</p>
 Pitfalls and Proactive Measures 
<p>Like any system, Step Up Authentication has its potential pitfalls. These include technical implementation challenges, user acceptance, and the ever-present struggle to balance security with ease of use. However, with a strategic approach, these obstacles can be navigated effectively.</p>
<p>Proactive problem-solving measures, such as comprehensive user education programs, policy optimization, and ongoing system monitoring and updating, are key to addressing these challenges.</p>
 Security Implications and Concerns in Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Though a significant security improvement, step-Up Authentication has potential risks and vulnerabilities. Understanding these security implications and how they can be mitigated is essential to ensure robust protection against cyber threats.</p>
<p>One potential concern is user acceptance and cooperation. Given its nature, users may need clarification on the changing requirements for authentication. This issue is not just a usability concern but also a security concern, as user non-compliance or bypass attempts can introduce vulnerabilities into the system.</p>
<p>Another concern revolves around the accuracy of risk assessment. The effectiveness of Step-Up Authentication depends primarily on correctly identifying and responding to potential risks. Inaccurate risk assessments can lead to security breaches if high-risk actions are not identified correctly and high-risk resources don’t trigger a step-up in authentication.</p>
<p>The additional security measures used in Step-Up Authentication, like biometrics or security questions, bring potential vulnerabilities. For instance, biometric data can be spoofed, and security questions can often be guessed or discovered through social engineering.</p>
 Mitigation Practices for Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Mitigating these concerns involves several strategies:</p>
 
 Clear communication about how the system works and its necessity can be beneficial to increase user acceptance. 
 User training can also help ensure that users understand the authentication requirements. 
 Refinement of the risk assessment algorithm and learning from past mistakes are critical for improving risk assessment accuracy. 
 Regular auditing and testing can help identify potential weaknesses in the risk assessment process. 
 
<p>As for the vulnerabilities related to additional security measures, it is key to ensure these are implemented with their own security best practices. For instance, biometric data should be stored securely, and liveness detection tools, like <a>BlockID,</a> should be used to prevent spoofing.</p>

<p>In today’s fast-paced world, time is a precious commodity. While machines perform tasks at remarkable speeds, the human workforce often encounters periods of non-machine idle time, hindering overall productivity. Enter digital machine intelligence, a solution poised to transform the way we capture and analyze production performance to alleviate this issue and propelling the payment card issuance and personalization industry into a new era of efficiency and innovation.</p>
<p>What Is Idle Time?</p>
<p>In manufacturing, the widely accepted definition is that idle time is the duration of time we wait while a machine or person, though fully functional, is not productive.</p>
<p>Idle time = scheduled production time – actual productive time.</p>
<p>The key here is the machine is fully functional (no errors, no broken parts, no system down, no communication issues, etc.), but it is not producing output for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Why Is It Important?</p>
<p>The most recent data I have gathered as a business analytics consultant in the card issuance and personalization space suggests that the average availability time for a company without any analytics solution or continuous improvement program ranges from 16% to 38%. This means that anywhere from 62%-84% of the time machines are not running when they could be. Closing that gap is where we see the largest impact when implementing continuous improvement and data-driven productivity gains on the production floor.</p>
<p>What Are Sources of Idle Time?</p>
<p>There are many common sources of idle time shared across all industries, but here we focus on those related to card issuance and personalization centers:</p>
 
 Machine or operator waiting for work or jobs – this issue stems from job planning or an issue with the preceding steps. 
 Machine or operator not authorized to perform work and waiting on approval – this could be due to quality checks, security checks, supervisor checks, missing job instructions, and so on. 
 Machine or operator is missing raw materials needed such as consumables and operator materials. 
 Machine or operator not present – this can happen for a variety of reasons including scheduled or unscheduled break, reassignment to another activity, or absenteeism with no backup resource available. 
 Machine or operator is on standby due to personal process limitations such as dual custody is required and only one operator is available, missing card needs to be found, a security incident related to the previous job run occurs and an investigation is underway, or machine calibration checks are needed. 
 The machine is undergoing setup for a variety of reasons including job loading or material loading, machine is getting cleaned or calibrated, or the workstation is getting set up for the job. 
 External dependencies are at play including a halt to production ordered by the customer, a quality or maintenance lead who initiates immediate work stoppage, a power or network outage, a supplies shortage, external software delays, an emergency evacuation, or any situation where wait times are instituted. 
 
<p>How to Reduce Idle Time</p>
<p>The first step to resolving any problem is to understand the root cause and magnitude. This is the basis of knowledge-based management or Lean Six Sigma manufacturing: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.</p>
 
 Define: The definitions have been made clear on what idle time is; now the next step is to measure them. 
 Measure: To gauge machine productivity accurately, track scheduled work time and measure actual operational periods, focusing on the cumulative bursts of output like finished personalized products. If a software-hardware solution is not available, your best bet is manual monitoring with a stopwatch for the entirety of the day, ensuring unbiased and unhindered data collection. However, one caveat is that an on-site observer may not pinpoint process and employee-related issues with the utmost precision. 
 Analyze: After obtaining data for a single machine’s scheduled work versus actual work for a day, calculate the idle time. If the idle time exceeds 15% (idle time divided by scheduled work time), there is a problem requiring attention. Achieving the industry average of 15% idle time is possible with the implementation of software-hardware tracking systems along with fostering a continuous improvement culture. Thorough data collection enables the creation of a Pareto chart, identifying the easiest-to-solve issues, or “low-hanging fruits.” Targeting these areas strategically will maximize gains. In cases of insufficient data, a return to the measure phase is necessary to confidently identify root causes. Implementing tools like Ishikawa diagrams helps isolate overlapping causes, guiding resource allocation and energy to the right focus areas. 
 Improve: Identifying the problem is just the beginning; the real challenge is solving it. Now armed with insights into the issue’s source, you can brainstorm solutions – whether it involves process modifications, personnel retraining, or technological changes. Often, this is where an external consultant can offer valuable perspectives, leveraging industry experience and unbiased insights. Once a solution is pinpointed and evaluated, an implementation plan, coupled with a trial and measurement system, ensures fair assessment and feedback from all stakeholders. This initial trial is crucial for the success of the broader rollout. Lack of an experienced continuous improvement engineer often leads to challenges and failures at this stage, making external consultation advisable. 
 Control: After the successful trial and subsequent large-scale rollout, sustaining the solution becomes the most challenging phase. The absence of proper controls, feedback mechanisms, and the ability to steer the process, teams, and operation often leads to solutions unraveling after a few months. Management’s shift in focus and personnel reverting to familiar habits contribute to this breakdown. Control is about identifying any future pains that come up and developing and adapting the solution to overcome these bumps on the road so the gains of the solution can be earned for the long run. The key to process control is to know when it is going out of control, which requires continuous monitoring and data collection every minute of every hour to identify long-term trends. This is where having software running in the background collecting data analytics is key. Without control, processes fall apart. 
 
<p>The Power of Production Analytics</p>
<p>Idle time is by far the largest contributor to operational inefficiencies in card issuance and personalization environments. Many factories are using logbook-based manual measurements to understand what is happening, which can be marred by bias, human error, and lack of detail. Without a software-hardware based analytics solution, many key opportunities to improve go undiscovered. Once these problems have been clearly identified, there is a critical process to analyze the data to identify key root causes. After that, a rigorous and creative solution-generating process must take place with a carefully orchestrated trial preceding a large rollout of the solution. Additionally, any gains from these depend entirely on the factories’ abilities to control and sustain those gains in the long run, which requires continuous data monitoring and solution steering.</p>

				  Verifiable credentials are a way to package and share tamper-proof digital information so that you can always authenticate where it originally came from. What makes this technology powerful is that anyone can cryptographically verify the issuer of the credential, and that no changes to the data have occurred since the credential’s creation, enabling the information inside to be trusted and immediately acted on.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>To put it simply, verifiable credentials are packages of data created in a decentralized network by issuing organizations or parties and stored locally by the data owner in a digital wallet.</p>
<p>Once created, the party issuing these packages can be verified by anyone with the appropriate software. As a credential is created, the issuing party digitally signs the information inside, and once it is signed, any attempt to alter the data will be visible on the network and “break” the credential, so to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>What can a verifiable credential represent?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use cases are almost endless, any information tied to identification or an identity can be turned into a verifiable credential: you can represent a person, a car, a building, an organization, or a connected device, and any information that can be associated with these entities.</p>
<p>For example, colleges and universities can issue documents such as diplomas or transcripts to students as verifiable credentials. These can be easily shared with anyone who needs to verify that information. Verification is instant and doesn’t require going back to the university for manual proof, providing a much more efficient experience for everyone.</p>
<p>To learn more about this read our recent article on <a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">Open Badges 3.0</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end of paper documents and manual processes</p>
<p>In today’s system, credentials are everywhere: you likely have a driver’s license, passport, maybe a badge to access your place of employment.</p>
<p>But paper documents have several drawbacks:</p>
<p>They can be stolen, copied, forged or misplaced.</p>
<p>Someone needs to be in the same physical location to acquire them</p>
<p>They need to be stored securely.</p>
<p>Using them can share more data than needed, or require you to copy down the information they contain manually.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials enable you to hold all the same information, digitally, in a way that you have more control over and can share how you like.</p>
<p>From an organization standpoint they provide a way to quickly share information across different systems without a need for complex direct integrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Let’s walk through a quick example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the DMV can issue you a driver’s license, which contains personal information such as your date of birth, eye color, height, weight, full name, license number, and address. When attempting to purchase an age-restricted item, the vendor will often check your license to confirm your age and that you can legally purchase the item. When you hand over your ID, you hand over all of the information, not just your date of birth — and that information can easily be misused.</p>
<p>In the same scenario, a verifiable credential is still issued by the DMV, and it still contains all that personal data, but, crucially, the data can be separated and shared in a much more selective way. And we can even go a step further and simply share eligibility: the shop doesn’t need to know your actual birthdate, they just need to know if you’re over a certain age, which can be shared in the form of simple yes or no.</p>
<p>To learn more about making purchases with verifiable credentials read our article on how they will change <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-digitally-transform-banking-finance-and-payments/">finance and payments.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does decentralization matter?</p>
<p>This is a huge topic that deserves its own blog but a quick few points are:</p>
<p>As other digital identification methods start to catch on, such as mobile driver’s licenses, it’s important to remember that simply digitizing a document does not make it secure. What is critical is how that document is stored and shared.</p>
<p>By storing verifiable credentials locally on the end user’s mobile device you can be sure they control that data and can share it only with whomever they choose to.</p>
<p>If the mobile driver’s license is not decentralized, it means that the system needs to be contacted to verify a person’s identity. This provides a slower verification process, can run into issues if the database is unreachable, and represents a huge target for bad actors.</p>

 Recently released compliance survey reveals operators’ most common concerns, why players abandon onboarding and the likely effect of UK’s upcoming financial risk checks. 



 



<p>The online gambling market shows no signs of slowing. In fact, by the end of 2024 the revenue generated from the sector is <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/worldwide">projected to exceed $107 billion</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As new markets like Peru and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a> open, and established markets like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK </a>and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Canada </a>revise their regulatory frameworks, the challenges faced by betting and gambing operators’ compliance teams are becoming increasingly complicated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With this in mind, IDnow commissioned SBC Media to investigate the compliance challenges most likely to affect operators in 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’ features insights and opinions from 104 global compliance professionals from the gambling industry, and looked at four areas: compliance, fraud, onboarding and financial risk checks.</p>



<blockquote><p>In understanding the compliance challenges that betting and gaming operators face, we believe we can better address our clients’ pain points and empower them to provide the journey that their customers deserve.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President Global Gaming at IDnow. </blockquote>



 Biggest compliance pain points for gambling operators. 



<p>According to the survey, the most common compliance challenge was source of funds checks, which was cited as one of the most difficult issues by more than a fifth of global respondents, rising to nearly 30% of European-based compliance professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the other end of the spectrum, respondents found age verification the least difficult to deal with, followed by identity verification, reflecting the availability of robust third-party solutions to handle that crucial part of onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another question posed in the survey was related to speed of implementation, and how long it took operators to fulfil certain compliance requirements, such as obtaining a licence, undergoing an audit and complying with regulatory requirements in a new market. While being first to market is obviously an important factor, and can be a significant competitive advantage, results from the survey suggest that becoming compliant is not something that should be rushed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two-fifths of operators said they typically take 6-12 months to fulfil the compliance requirements ahead of entering a new territory, while around 30% suggested the process took 3-6 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what is the most important thing to factor in when entering new markets. At around 60% each, respondents were split between the ability to utilize existing compliance software (identity verification and AML solutions) and speed of implementation as the most important factors.</p>



 Biggest fraud concerns in the gambling industry. 



<p>The second section of the survey was designed to identify the prevalence and trends of different types of fraud and the prevention of fraud attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It revealed that bonus abuse and attempts at document fraud remain most commonplace (65% and 57% respectively), despite improvements to identification and prevention tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking to the future, there is also concern about social engineering attacks (54%) and the growing threat of facial recognition spoofing attacks (33%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Read about the growing threat of social media fraud, which leverages social engineering, in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was also broad consensus on whether AI-powered anti-fraud tools were the way forward. More than 70% of respondents either already have such tools or plan to implement them in the next 12 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The results of this survey should act as a wake-up call for gambling operators in the UK and elsewhere to prepare themselves for the emerging fraud and compliance challenges. To address these challenges, operators will need a multi-dimensional approach to identity verification and fraud prevention, that enables seamless gambling experiences anytime, anywhere,” said Roger.</p>

 The importance and dangers of onboarding. 



<p>Onboarding is a pivotal stage in the customer journey and can make or break your business. In a regulated industry, like financial services or gambling, the balance between offering a seamless yet safe and secure onboarding experience has never been more important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of speed and simplicity in the onboarding process was emphasised by the survey responses, with regulatory requirements seen as less of a barrier (31%) to completion than a complex and lengthy registration experience (55%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document submission proved to be the biggest challenge for global players (51%), with both ID document submission and personal financial information submission (51%) proving to be an obstacle to the completion of onboarding.</p>



 What do operators really think about financial risk checks? 



<p>No topic has been more polarizing to the UK’s gambling industry than the proposed financial risk checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As no operator yet has experience of working within the scope of these checks, the survey posed two questions: what they expected the impact of such checks would be on the UK market and what effect they would have on the wider international industry. Most compliance professionals (66%) expressed concerns that the move would lead to lower sign-ups for licensed operators, but would, in turn, strengthen the black market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth noting that some of the answers were nuanced and several respondents were open to the idea that an affordability check could have some positives for the industry such as improving trust levels among players, reducing fraud and helping to create a level playing field for smaller operators.&nbsp;</p>

In this mode, the policies don’t impact access but log the results of policy evaluation. This allows administrators to assess the impact before enforcing these policies. Thanks to proactive actions taken by administrators to enable or customize these policies, over 900,000 users are now protected with MFA. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve been actively listening to your feedback. Customers shared that Microsoft-managed policies impact the number of Conditional Access policies that organizations can create. We’ve addressed this by making a significant change: Microsoft-managed policies will no longer count towards the Conditional Access policy limit. Another adjustment relates to existing Conditional Access policies. If you already have a policy in the “On” state that meets or exceeds the requirements set by the Microsoft-managed policy, the latter will not be automatically enforced in your tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, we communicated that these policies would be automatically enabled 90 days after creation. However, based on customer feedback, we recognize that some customers need additional time to prepare for these policies to be enforced. As a result, we have extended the time frame before enforcing the policies for this initial set of policies. For these three policies, you will have more than 90 days to review and customize (or disable) your Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies before they are automatically enforced. Rest assured, you’ll receive an email and a <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MessageCenter">Message Center</a> notification providing a 28-day advance notification before the policies are enforced in your tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call to Action</p>
 
 Review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>.  
 Add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>
<p> </p>
 
 Once ready, the policies can be moved to the ON state.<br>  
 
<p>For additional customization needs, you can duplicate these policies and make further adjustments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier in February, SpruceID participated in Utah’s Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill, a public event held in Salt Lake City at the Utah State Capitol. This yearly event celebrates Utah’s outdoor recreation opportunities and contributions to the state’s economy, health, and quality of life. SpruceID joined the Department of Natural Resources at a booth during the event to highlight our State of Utah pilot program for digital credentials, in partnership with the Division of Technology Services and the Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>The objective of the pilot program is to demonstrate the feasibility of verifiable digital credentials for state-issued credentials across various use cases, such as off-highway vehicle education course certificates. The pilot aims to pioneer a privacy-first digital credentialing program that empowers residents to take control of their online data and seamlessly integrate with the government’s existing infrastructure while ensuring a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience.</p><p>The booth at the Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill provided us with a platform to connect with policymakers, legislators, and the general public. We took the opportunity to demonstrate the digital credential experience for both holders and verifiers while educating attendees about the pilot program for digital credentials in Utah.&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s world, technology has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from paying bills and traveling to accessing healthcare and public benefits. This shift to digital services has highlighted the need for innovative government leadership in digital identity and credentialing solutions. Traditional paper or plastic credentials have increasingly shown limitations leading to privacy concerns, susceptibility to fraud, and poor user experiences.</p><p>As the pilot becomes publicly available, participants can download a digital credential for their OHV education course certificate to store on their mobile device and take it whenever they are on the trails. Whether in a highly trafficked area or remote location without cell service, the holder can access their permit and present it as a QR code for the verifier to scan in just a few taps. The verification checks the credential validity and that it has a digital signature by the Utah DNR without pinging back to the Utah servers. This means that verifications do not enable additional tracking or a new centralized database. Not only is this a more convenient and secure option for users, but it also saves significant time filling out and processing paperwork.</p> Looking Ahead <p>Our participation in Utah’s Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill was an opportunity to showcase the pilot program for digital verifiable credentials and a pivotal moment to engage with the Utah community and gather invaluable feedback. </p><p>This event demonstrated the program's potential impact on improving the efficiency, security, and privacy of state-issued credentials. We are grateful for the chance to contribute to Utah’s outdoor recreation community and look forward to the journey ahead as we work towards a more connected, secure, and digitally empowered society.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

			 The Moreliquid Money Market EUR (MMMEUR) token unlocks easier, faster and cost-efficient access to low-risk yields from Euro Money Markets for professional investors by tokenizing the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund. Qualified professional investors can subscribe to moreliquid’s money market token in either fiat or crypto currencies. For those investing in digital assets for the first time, moreliquid offers a secure and easily accessible web3 custody solution.&nbsp; 
<p>Luxembourg – March 19th, 2024 – <a href="https://www.moreliquid.io/">moreliquid</a>, a leading digital securities investment platform, today announced its groundbreaking initiative to tokenize the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund by introducing the Moreliquid Money Market EUR (MMMEUR) token. This move signifies a major advancement in integrating traditional financial instruments with blockchain technology, offering institutional and high-net-worth investors a unique and dynamic way to engage with the Euro money markets.</p>
<p>Regulated under the jurisdiction of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the MMMEUR token offers monthly coupon payments, providing a steady and predictable income stream for institutional and high-net-worth investors. The token’s evergreen maturity date ensures long-term engagement possibilities. Reflecting its underlying asset, the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund, the MMMEUR token is designed to give qualified investors exposure to a diverse portfolio of short-term securities, carefully curated to meet stringent criteria for maturity, issuer reputation, market listing, and credit ratings as required by law. The specifics about the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund are available <a href="https://www.assetmanagement.hsbc.co.uk/en/institutional-investor/funds/ie0030028439">here</a>.</p>
<p>Issued on the Polygon network, the MMMEUR token sets its minimum investment at €100,000. It requires investors to be residents of the EEA, targeting primarily institutional and high-net-worth investors interested in the Euro liquidity market. This requirement ensures that the fund attracts committed and qualified investors, contributing to a stable and focused investment environment.</p>
<p>Expanding the utility of real-world asset tokens, Moreliquid allows the MMMEUR token to be managed, transferred, or utilized as collateral for loans. This integration enhances the functionality of the MMMEUR token, providing investors with increased liquidity, versatility, and security in their investments. By leveraging moreliquid’s secure and compliant DeFi platform, investors gain control and flexibility over their digital real-world assets, merging traditional finance with blockchain innovation.</p>
<p>The MMMEUR token, developed in collaboration with<a> Tokeny</a>, is available for purchase directly through cryptocurrency wallets. Utilizing the open-source ERC3643 standard for its issuance, the MMMEUR token ensures that blockchain-based securities regulations are met seamlessly, highlighting innovation, compliance, and transparency. <a href="https://copper.co/">Copper </a>and <a href="https://www.dfns.co/">Dfns</a> have been selected as the wallet management solution and infrastructure for the MMMEUR token, ensuring top-tier security and compliance. Copper’s expertise in digital asset protection assures investors of secure and regulated management of their MMMEUR tokens.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — March 5th to March&nbsp;18th <p>Welcome to the Veriscope Regulatory Recap! In our latest edition, we delve into sweeping crypto regulatory updates worldwide, from Europe’s fresh stablecoin standards to the UK’s latest crypto compliance proposals, from Indonesia’s tech-forward finance guidelines to Nigeria’s firm stance on crypto operations within its borders. Let’s unpack the latest moves shaping the digital asset&nbsp;world.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Shifts <p>The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is undergoing significant transformations, driven by a common goal among nations to align digital asset markets with investor protection, financial stability, and anti-money laundering standards.</p><p>In Europe, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is focusing on new rules for stablecoins, which are digital currencies designed to have a stable value. These rules are part of a larger set of regulations known as&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>Additionally, the UK treasury has proposed changes that could require stricter observation of crypto businesses to prevent money laundering. This means crypto companies might soon need to follow the same rules as traditional financial companies.</p><p>Over in Asia, Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) is setting guidelines for using new technology in finance, including crypto, starting in 2025. This is to ensure that innovations are safe for users and the&nbsp;market.</p><p>In Africa, Nigeria’s Securities Regulator is making it mandatory for crypto businesses to set up in the country if they want to operate there. They’re also raising the fees these companies need to pay. This move aims to give the Nigerian government more control over crypto activities.</p> EU Advances Crypto Regulation with New EBA Stablecoin Draft <p>The European Union is making significant progress in clarifying crypto regulations as the European Banking Authority (EBA) unveils draft requirements for stablecoins under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework.</p><p>This move, aimed at asset reference tokens (ARTs) capable of referencing a variety of currencies and assets, signifies a crucial step towards comprehensive crypto market regulation.</p><p>The potential impact on the crypto ecosystem is twofold. Positively, clearer regulations could enhance market confidence, attract more institutional investment, and foster a safer trading environment.

<p>When it comes to cyberattacks, March has come in like a lion for Microsoft. Last week, Microsoft said in an SEC filing that that information stolen in a hack of senior leaders’ email accounts is now being used to “gain or attempt to gain access” to company source code repositories and other internal systems. The fallout remains unknown. Just a few days earlier, threat researchers at Proofpoint <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta577s-unusual-attack-chain-leads-ntlm-data-theft">reported a phishing campaign</a> by the well-known threat group TA577 that targets Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication information. Attackers sent thousands of tailored emails designed to steal employees' NTLM “hashes” (or challenge/response values) from hundreds of organizations around the globe. These “hashes” can be cracked with far-reaching consequences, depending on an organization’s security measures.</p>  
 Why Is NTLM Authentication Vulnerable  
<p>A still widely used protocol in Windows environments, NTLM provides a natively implemented and easy to use method for authenticating into applications on enterprise servers. At more than thirty years old, it’s also a perennial attack target.</p> 
<p>Weaker cryptographic algorithms, unsalted password hashes stored on the client and server / domain controller, and a lack of server authentication &nbsp;by default, leave the NTLM protocol susceptible to a variety of attacks, either in the first NTLMv1 or the newer NTLMv2 version. These include interception, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a>, relay and pass-the-hash attacks, as well as straightforward brute force and password cracking — eight-character NTLM password hashes can be brute-forced using <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-a-rainbow-table-attack">rainbow tables</a> and other techniques within three minutes. NTLM does not support modern authentication methods like biometrics, multi-factor authentication, or phishing-resistant FIDO keys.</p> 
 What’s Different About the TA577 NTLM Authentication Campaign?  
<p>The abuse of the NTLM protocol for gathering victim’s information and potentially stealing NTLM challenge/response material is not a new technique, and has been observed in the past in different ways. One notable example was the <a href="https://blog.lumen.com/newly-discovered-watering-hole-attack-targets-ukrainian-canadian-organizations/">compromise of the San Francisco airport website</a> and several other organizations across the world, where threat actors used the compromised sites to serve malicious code that triggered SMB connections to attacker-controlled servers.</p> 
<p>The newest campaign takes a new twist by using phishing thread-jacking techniques to deliver zipped HTML attachments customized for each individual target.</p> 
 How the Attack Works  
<p>The malicious emails appear to be replies to a legitimate message thread. Upon opening, the HTML file triggers a meta refresh attempt to connect to a text file set up by the attacker on a rogue Server Message Block (SMB) server. The attacker-controlled server can then steal the NTLM authentication values when the protocol performs its standard challenge/response exchange. Those values change according to the version of the protocol, and whether it is a NTLMv1 or NTLMv2 exchange, but consist of a nonce (a random value of a single use) that’s encrypted using the user’ passwords as the key.</p> 
<p>A very common technique used to make it easier to then crack the obtained challenge/response values, is to leverage a well known and fixed server challenge. The protocol requires the server to include a challenge, consisting of a 16-byte random number, on every connection. By making the server challenge a fixed one, it’s possible to use pre-calculated hash tables and reduce the time and processing required to crack the user’s passwords.</p> 
<p>The following diagram shows the steps of the attack:</p> 
 NTLM Phishing  
<p></p> 
 Consequences of a Successful NTLM Attack  
<p>Stolen NTLM challenge/response values can be used to obtain victim’s credentials and hijack accounts, access sensitive information and potentially elevate privileges. Attackers can then move laterally within the network and compromise additional systems in the case they’ve already obtained a foothold into the victim’s organization network.</p> 
 How HYPR Protects Against the TA577 NTLM Attacks  
<p>Microsoft has long provided mitigations and mechanisms to disable the use of the NTLM protocol, including migrating to more secure replacements like Kerberos. However, organizations have been slow to implement these recommendations due to the complexity and dependency of multiple products and legacy systems on these protocols.</p> 
<p>When the legacy NTLM authentication protocols cannot be disabled and are still part of the organization’s environment, the resistance to NTLM attacks comes from the strength of the user’s passwords.&nbsp;In these environments, leveraging HYPR’s passwordless approach with certificate-based authentication allows organizations to enforce smart-card usage for passwordless, and remove the dependency of users having to login with their passwords. This provides opportunities to implement mitigation strategies to some of the NTLM weaknesses, such as the use of IT or programmatically-managed strong passwords.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR reduces the risk to organizations from attacks on NTLM authentication by TA577 and other threat actors. HYPR’s phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">Enterprise Passkeys</a> were built to protect Microsoft Entra ID environments from credential-based attacks while making login easier for users. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/press-releases/hypr-leads-passwordless-revolution-with-launch-of-microsoft-approved-enterprise-passkeys">Microsoft approved and validated</a>, Enterprise Passkeys use highly secure FIDO2 authentication protocols instead of passwords or other types of shared secrets. With HYPR in place, there is no password for an attacker to steal.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>As the NTLM authentication protocol relies on passwords, those — indeed all passwords — are a prime target for bad actors. It’s much easier to login with valid credentials than to find a new vulnerability to exploit. Moreover, attackers constantly come up with inventive ways to breach security controls. Organizations need to eliminate the source of insecurity. As a Microsoft partner and member of MISA, HYPR integrates tightly with Microsoft environments and products. Working seamlessly with Microsoft Entra ID, the HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines passkey-based authentication with continuous risk monitoring and automated identity verification to provide the highest level of identity security.</p>

  <p>The introduction of cross-tenant access settings for Microsoft Entra External ID marked a pivotal shift in how organizations manage security and collaboration across different tenants. This blog post dives into the essence of these settings, focusing on their significance for secure B2B collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three key areas of focus, include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The critical aspect of trusting multifactor authentication (MFA) from business collaborators, including the exploration into the balance between maintaining high security standards and ensuring a seamless user experience for B2B guest users, plus highlighting a perspective to simplify authentication processes and reduce administrative burdens.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Offering a closer look at the cross-tenant access settings and how these settings enable more granular control over cross-tenant collaborations. Real-world use cases illustrate the application of these policies in managing and restricting access to ensure security without hindering productivity and cooperation.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Insights into leveraging Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access policies for improved security and collaboration and to ensure a smooth user experience.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Trust MFA from business collaborators (B2B collaboration) by default&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's interconnected digital landscape, organizations are increasingly embracing B2B collaboration to streamline workflows and facilitate cooperation with external partners. As part of this collaborative approach, many businesses routinely create guest user accounts within their Microsoft Entra tenants and grant trusted partners access to their resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance security, many have already extended the requirement for MFA to B2B guest users. This, however, requires external users in cross-tenant access scenarios to register an additional authentication method in the foreign tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for B2B guest users to register for an additional MFA method in the resource tenant basically increases the account security, but at the same time it adds layers of complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 User experience disruption in a B2B collaboration scenario&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B2B guest users who have already implemented MFA in their home tenant and have become accustomed to the convenience of advanced MFA methods like Windows Hello for Business, encounter disruptions when attempting to access the resource tenant. Even if users have already provided strong authentication in their home tenant, they will still be prompted for authentication again in the resource tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: MFA prompt for B2B guest user who access protected resource in foreign tenant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Administrative overhead for IT and users&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the guest user and the resource tenant's IT team face additional administrative tasks. For the guest user, navigating a new MFA setup and maintaining an additional MFA registration can be annoying. For the tenant administrator and the support team, managing these additional MFA registrations can increase overhead significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cases where a guest user loses access to their device or does not have a backup for a new device, regaining access to their account involves additional administrative tasks for both the guest user and the resource tenant's IT team. The guest user may need to perform a new MFA setup, while the tenant support team need to manage the additional MFA registrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you wondering why guest users must register an additional authentication method per resource tenant when they already have one in their home tenant? Well, let's talk about the trust settings in cross-tenant access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Simplifying the authentication process&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more efficient approach to managing MFA in cross-tenant B2B collaborations is to trust the MFA from a guest's home tenant. Doing so eliminates the need for additional MFA registration and maintenance in the resource tenant. This means that the user can continue to use his usual strong authentication method that he uses in his home tenant and does not have to register another method in the resource tenant. This is a considerable relief for the user and the support team of the resource tenant no longer has to deal with the MFA registrations of the guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MFA default trust settings are configured in the Microsoft Entra admin center (<a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">https://entra.microsoft.com</a>). In the default configuration, a Microsoft Entra ID tenant does not trust any incoming MFA from other tenants. To change the behavior, the inbound defaults must be edited. The following screenshots provide a walkthrough and show the desired configuration. The "Trust multifactor authentication from Microsoft Entra tenants" setting is disabled by default and must be enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Cross-tenant access settings in Microsoft Entra admin center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Cross-tenant access settings - Default Trust settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple configuration enables B2B guest users to use their existing MFA in their home tenant to satisfy existing MFA requirements in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once configured, B2B guest users can use additional authentication methods that have a higher authentication strength than MFA methods that are only available in a foreign resource tenant. This is a very important advantage because this configuration also enables the use of phishing-resistant authentication methods for B2B collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Comparison of the authentication methods available in the home tenant and a resource tenant</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about available authentication methods, refer to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strength-external-users">Microsoft Entra documentation about authentication strengths for external users.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this configuration is designed to enhance the user experience and ease the administrative efforts, it can inadvertently create security risks. For instance, guest users might opt for simpler, less secure authentication methods in their home tenant compared to the authentication methods typically used in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid these risks, the cross-tenant access trust settings work seamlessly with Conditional Access and authentication strengths. Plus, with MFA trust, guest users can use the same phishing-resistant authentication methods used in their home tenant like Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 keys, and certificate-based authentication to get access to the resource tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This key advantage can be used to increase the login security of guest users. When the default trust settings are adjusted, the Conditional Access policies and authentication strengths should be reviewed at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We explored the benefits of using MFA trust to leverage the same strong authentication methods used by guest users in their home tenant to improve security, usability and efficiency. In the next chapter, we will look at how tenant administrators can control outbound collaboration settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Outbound access restrictions&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access settings, organizations can manage their collaboration with other Microsoft Entra organizations. These settings provide more granular control over access, allowing you to manage how you collaborate with external organizations. In this section, we will take a closer look at the outbound settings feature and its capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restrictions vs. inbound and outbound settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions and cross-tenant access settings are two powerful tools that can help you control access to your organization’s resources. While they are often configured together, it’s important to understand that they operate separately from one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/tenant-restrictions-v2#tenant-restrictions-vs-inbound-and-outbound-settings">Microsoft Learn</a> article:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Although tenant restrictions are configured along with your cross-tenant access settings, they operate separately from inbound and outbound access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cross-tenant access settings give you control when users sign in with an account from your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, tenant restrictions give you control when users are using an external account.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of cross-tenant access settings this way:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inbound settings control external account access to your internal apps.&nbsp; 
 Outbound settings control internal account access to external apps.&nbsp; 
 Tenant restrictions control external account access to external apps.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize, tenant restrictions allow you to create a policy to control access to external apps when users sign in with an external account from your networks or devices while the inbound and outbound access settings focus on guests accounts in your tenant or guest accounts in resource tenants (what your users is accessing and where).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this all cleared up let’s focus on using an outbound access setting and a real-world application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-world use case&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a real-world use case to leverage the outbound settings control. The Contoso organization is used in the following use case:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contoso would like to implement more detailed controls with B2B business collaborators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Contoso would like to only collaborate with specific organizations. This includes the ability to securely add or remove partner organizations as the need arises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Additionally, Contoso would need the ability to restrict applications that can be accessed in any partner resource tenant along with the ability to restrict and control user access to partner resource tenants.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setup and configuration&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set up the outbound restriction for the needed use case, we will need to configure the outbound defaults. This essentially will block all outbound collaboration. Note that this can be scoped to either include all users, selected users or all or selected external applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From within the Microsoft Entra Admin center, navigate to the External Identities menu and select the cross-tenant access setting feature. From here select the default settings config followed by edit outbound defaults.&nbsp; Select Block access followed by the applies to option. We can either select a subset of users or apply this to all users. In this example all users are blocked and all external applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Outbound defaults</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>Figure 6: Outbound block access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempting any access in a resource tenant will result in the below notification. This is expected since the tenant wide outbound access default setting is in place explicitly blocking any resource tenant level access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Resource tenant blocked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By looking at the user sign-in logs, we can establish the same conclusion via the failure reasoned and the resource tenant accessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 8: Sign-in logs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable collaboration when the outbound access default setting is applied, a tenant ID or domain name of a resource tenant or origin must be included in the cross-tenant access settings of Microsoft Entra. In the example below, the tenant of Contoso’s partner organization “Wingtip Toys” is added and the outbound access configuration setup to allow collaboration with selected Contoso users. In this case, the users with group membership to “External-TR-ContosoAccess” will be allowed access to selected application as per figure 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, a Privileged Access Group (PAG) can be used allowing no permeant standing access. Access must be requested via Privileged Identity Management (PIM). The PIM activation process can be set up to require an approver, MFA or additional authentication context via Conditional Access. E.g. step-up authentication or location-based policy restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 9: Outbound access settings users and groups</p>
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 10: Outbound access settings external applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon configuring the needed outbound access settings any user that is part of the selected user or group outbound configuration setting will be allowed access to the selected external applications. In the below example we can see the demo user accessed a selected external application as per previous configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 11: sign-in log successful</p>
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>With cross-tenant access and outbound access settings, customers can granularly restrict and control collaboration with external resource tenants. This enables more control over what your internal accounts can access externally and where.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A word of caution: Before enabling, it’s important to understand this is a tenant wide configuration and you will need to understand and evaluate your organizations collaboration needs and scope the outbound access setting and allowed organizations accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, we explored how to use cross-tenant access and outbound access settings in Microsoft Entra to manage and secure external collaboration. Cross-tenant access allows you to share your resources with users from other tenants, while outbound access settings and tenant restrictions let you control which external tenants your users can access. You can configure both features at the tenant level and specify the allowed or blocked organizations according to your business needs. Additionally, we have discussed how to use Default MFA Trust to use existing, strong authentication methods from foreign tenants in cross-tenant access scenarios and improve your security posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next blog, we will look more closely at tenant restrictions and authentication strengths and contexts. Keep following this blog series, post your feedback, and we hope you join us again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vMmZNwOsIs">YouTube explainer video</a> on how tracking and authentication use the same mechanisms to meet their goals, and how browsers can’t tell the difference. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome!</p>



 Introduction 



<p>Welcome to The Digital Cow Network! My name is Heather Flanagan, principal at Spherical Cow Consulting. Let’s talk about how individuals are tracked as they surf the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve all know we are tracked as we surf the web. Sometimes, it’s to show us target advertisements to get us to spend more money. More nefariously, it influences our political leanings or generally sows societal chaos. Why isn’t there more control to prevent this from happening? Shouldn’t there be something that protects all web users, from the least tech-savvy to the most informed individuals? Yes, but it’s not that simple. The underlying mechanisms that trackers use are the same tools used to support third-party logging into a website, also known as federated authentication.</p>



<p>And you know what? Browsers can’t tell the difference when mechanisms used for tracking or when they are used for logging in. They are technically indistinguishable. This makes changing or removing those features more complicated than you’d think.</p>



 The Dilemma of Browser Tracking  



<p>What are these mysterious mechanisms, and why are they used when people log in to a website if they are also part of an invasion of privacy? Time for a quick history lesson!</p>



<p>The Internet came out of a research project. Everyone knew everyone else, or at least they knew the people online had to be a part of a very small community in order to use this new thing. The web came much later, but it still had that research and exploratory mindset, that nearly green field drive that suggested building little widgets that people could turn into anything they could imagine was the path towards innovation. The Internet, and therefore the web, was built on something that didn’t have robust, automatable trust mechanisms built in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of these innovations was the concept of a piece of data that would allow developers to keep information local to a browser so each web page didn’t have to ask for the same information over and over again, something called saving state. It also encouraged the use of IP addresses, once upon a time the unique address for each computer on the network, as a way to indicate whether an individual (the only one probably using that computer) to access something remotely. It encouraged a lot of things and people through of all sorts of ways to use these building blocks of the web to do new things, from supporting third-party accounts when logging in to targeting advertisements to individuals.</p>



<p>That’s enough history. Let’s dive into the mechanics. From third-party cookies to IP addresses and browser fingerprinting, these tools are essential for a smooth online experience but can also be used for tracking. Understanding these mechanisms is key to navigating the digital landscape.</p>



 Segment 3: Third-Party Cookies and Privacy  



<p>HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small blocks of information created by a website and placed on an individual’s computer or other device by their web browser. The idea behind doing this was to make it so people didn’t have to share information every time they went to a new page. Imagine if you had to log in Every. Single. Time. you went to a new web page owned by the same company. It’s crazy talk! Being able to “maintain state” from one page to the next is great for the user experience (UX).</p>



<p>Here’s where it gets murky. There is more than one kind of cookie, and for the sake of this explainer, we’re going to talk about first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are a way for a single domain to maintain state across all the web pages in its domain. It’s definitely a desirable thing for a clean UX. These cookies are ONLY accessible by the domain that created them. No other domain can read what’s in that cookie.</p>



<p>Then there are third-party cookies. These cookies are accessible to any website at any domain. And sometimes that’s fine. Let’s look at CNN. The company CNN owns cnn.com, headlinenews.com, cnnradionet.com, money.com, and probably several others. The parent company wants visitors to have a consistent experience, which means leaving bits of data for their various domains to read. They want all their services to look and act like you (probably) want them to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third-party cookies are also used so that when you tell a website you want to log out, it knows what to log you out of. That’s a big security feature right there and something that needs to be adapted when browsers no longer support third-party cookies. Though, to be honest, implementing this properly is really hard and many sites have already given up on the idea of a secure, global logout.</p>



 Segment 4: The Complexities of Browser Fingerprints and IP Addresses  



 IP Addresses 



<p>Most people don’t have to think about a computer’s numeric address. That said, computers communicate via numbers, and both your devices (your phone, tablet, and desktop) and the computers hosting the websites you’re visiting all have these addresses. They are called IP addresses and are a fundamental necessity to ensuring Internet traffic knows where to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once upon a time, these addresses were tightly tied to specific computers that didn’t move around. There were also enough of these addresses for all the computers on the Internet. And with that in mind, it made sense to say, “I know who is at this IP address. That address can access my computer.” While the basic assumptions about IP addresses are no longer always accurate, there’s still something to them. Some websites still create access policies based on what IP addresses are allowed. It’s a very smooth UX; the individual doesn’t have to do a thing. It just works.</p>



<p>When you go to a website, one of the things that happens is that the visit is recorded in a log. Logs are necessary to troubleshoot problems. They are also a way to understand who and what is visiting a website. And if that data is shared behind the scenes, a single IP address can be followed like you can follow footprints in the snow.</p>



 Browser Fingerprints 



<p>When you install a web browser, you probably add plug-ins, add-ons, your favorite fonts, your preferred settings, and so on. Here’s a fun fact: if you have done those things, you might have an impressively unique “fingerprint” that distinguishes your browser from all others.</p>



<p>There are a few websites that will let you check this out. For example, <a href="https://amiunique.org/">https://amiunique.org/</a> and <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/</a> will let you see just how unique your browser setup is when compared to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you visit a website, it often asks your browser about all its settings to offer you the best UX. It might have a slightly different way of presenting information if you’re using Chrome or Firefox. It might pop up a sadness window if you’ve blocked ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Browser fingerprinting isn’t usually used to let you log into a website. However, some enterprise software may be looking for a specific plug-in or configuration as part of its requirements to allow you access.</p>



 Link Decoration and Bounces  



 Link Decoration 



<p>But wait, there’s more! One of the more subtle and ubiquitous features of trackers and authentication services is link decoration. Also referred to as “navigation-based tracking,” this feature adds extra information to the URL. That information can be part of an authentication token. It can be part of a query so the website knows what to display after you’ve done a product search. When you click on the link in an email, it will add the method you used to the address so the website owners know what advertising works for them.</p>



<p>Browser vendors are cautious when changing what they’ll support in links. Of course, they also have to worry about being able to identify when links are being used for tracking or something else. So many features that the web experience is built on requires link decoration. And so many trackers love it. It’s complicated.</p>



 Bounces or Redirects 



<p>The last one we’ll review in this post is bounces, also known as redirects. Bounces and redirects are as fundamental to the web experience as link decoration. These are used extensively to support critical login features for protocols like OAuth and SAML, used by websites everywhere. Authentication is complicated, and there is almost always more than one computer behind the scenes making it happen. These computers, possibly from different domains, need to talk to each other to get you logged in. They bounce data back and forth before returning a “go” or “no go” to your login experience.</p>



<p>Bounces are also, unfortunately, used by trackers to get around the third-party limitations on cookies described in the section above.</p>



<p>Remember that browsers are trying to prevent websites from reading cookies they didn’t write. Cookies are for the first party; third parties need to find another website to bother. But what if there is an advertising agreement between these two parties? They really want to share that data! The easiest thing to do is to make that third party become a first party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When an individual visits a website directly, that makes it a first-party experience. You visit Website A; Website A is now a first party. But what if Website A has an agreement with an advertiser at Website B and adds a single pixel to their web page? Then the individual loads that pixel, thus “visiting” Website B. Website B can now set or edit a first-party cookie. They can do that every time you visit a website they have an agreement with, thus building up a record of what sites you’ve visited, where you’ve made purchases, etc.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Browser vendors can’t just wave a magic keyboard and fix all tracking challenges. Turning off all the mechanisms that allow tracking will also break some of the most critical security features of the web. Work within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is underway to find a way through this mess. Browser vendors have also been making their changes. Apple turned off third-party cookies years ago. Mozilla turned them off by default for all Firefox users in 2023. Google Chrome is still working on it, but they are much bigger than all other browser vendors combined and have much more business riding on these features.</p>



<p>In our next post, I’ll focus on the work around the deprecation of third-party cookies.&nbsp;</p>

KERI utilizes hash-chain verifiable data structures, called Key Event Logs (KELs), without a total-ordered globally distributed consensus mechanism.</blockquote><p>This blog is the second part of a three-part series, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to&nbsp;KERI:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1: Why should you adopt&nbsp;KERI?</a>  Part 2: What exactly is&nbsp;KERI?  Part 3: How do you use KERI? (Coming&nbsp;soon)  <p>This part explains only essential components that constitute the KERI protocol while not going into deep technical details.</p> An Identity Overlay for the&nbsp;Internet  Fragmentation in the decentralized identity ecosystem <p>As outlined in a recent “<a href="https://blog.productintuition.com/p/wallet-strategy-pt-1-decentralized-identity-ssi">Wallet Strategy</a>” series by <a href="https://blog.productintuition.com/p/wallet-strategy-pt-1-decentralized-identity-ssi">Dan Robertson</a>, one of the biggest problems in the decentralized identity space is its presently fragmented ecosystems. This is an extremely complex issue that involves many business and technical aspects—including credential formats, credential exchange protocols, and many more. This blog limits the scope of the discussion to identifiers and key management, also known as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID&nbsp;methods</a>.</p><p>As of March 2024, there are a total of 189 DID methods registered in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID Specification Registries</a>. This number has been increasing steadily since the registry was created in 2020, and there are likely a hundred more DID methods out there in the wild, which have not yet been registered.</p><p>Although a large proportion of these methods are experimental, some of which have no longer been maintained, this number has raised significant concern among many members of the digital identity ecosystems. In the past few years, this topic has also been the subject of heated debates. While some argue that the abundance of DID methods is a sign of a thriving ecosystem, many contend that the sheer diversity has spawned considerable interoperability challenges.</p><p>While this blog shall not take part in the debate, one cannot help but wonder “Could there possibly be a unifying DID method that covers the use cases of all others?” This is precisely what KERI attempts to&nbsp;be.</p> An elephant in the&nbsp;room <p>However, we have to address a big elephant in the room before we continue.</p>Ref: Xkcd comic, “<a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">How Standard Proliferate</a>”.<p>KERI is indeed a DID method that was designed to be the “one universal standard that covers everyone’s use case”. However, adding one more DID method to the ever-growing list does not necessarily mitigate the situation, and it remains uncertain if KERI will ever achieve widespread adoption.</p><p>Putting all that aside, KERI provides unique properties and benefits not found in other DID methods, as elaborated in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1</a> of this series. What makes KERI special is also the fact that it is not just another DID method. The KERI protocol has a grander vision of being the identity overlay for the internet.</p><blockquote>KERI is a decentralized identity protocol designed to be a secure identity overlay for the internet.</blockquote> An Identity Overlay for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The internet is arguably one of the most important inventions in human history, enabling instant connections between everyone across the globe. The success of the Internet is attributed to its hourglass model where the Internet Protocol (IP) is the one common protocol for all supporting protocols below it and all applying protocols above it, i.e., the IP protocol being the spanning layer of the Internet.</p>Ref: <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the Trust over IP Stack</a>, Version 1.0, 17 November&nbsp;2021<p>Unfortunately, as the late Kim Cameron once wrote in <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">The Laws of Identity</a> in 2005, “The Internet was built without an identity layer.” Given the immense complexity and widespread usage of the Internet, attempting to reconstruct its infrastructure to integrate such a layer is simply unfeasible. Hence, the development of an identity solution must be overlaid on the existing Internet framework. To achieve global interoperability, such an identity overlay must also embody an hourglass shape, serving as a trust-spanning protocol that seamlessly links all Web2 and Web3 applications.</p>Ref: The <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a><p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force (TSPTF)</a> under the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP (ToIP)</a> Foundation is currently developing the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">trust spanning protocol</a> where KERI is used as one of its candidate protocols for Verifiable Identifiers (VIDs).</p> Foundational Components of&nbsp;KERI <p>The previous section explains what KERI is at the conceptual level where it is designed to be the identity overlay for the internet and is also a variant of DPKI. To get deeper into the technical details,</p><blockquote>KERI is a decentralized management protocol for persistent self-certifying identifiers, called Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs), using novel key pre-rotation mechanisms. KERI utilizes hash-chain verifiable data structures, called Key Event Logs (KELs), without a total-ordered globally distributed consensus mechanism.</blockquote><p>There are four foundational components for the KERI protocol as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Autonomic Identifier (AID)  Pre-rotation  Key Event  Key Event&nbsp;Receipt   1. Autonomic Identifier (AID) <p>The KERI protocol is dedicated to the long-term management of a special class of identifiers that are both self-certifying and persistent. These identifiers are called autonomic identifiers (AIDs) in the KERI protocol.</p><blockquote>Note: The word “autonomic” is an adjective that means self-ruling, self-governing, or self-regulating.</blockquote> Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) <p>A Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) is an identifier that is uniquely and cryptographically derived from one or more key pairs. It is self-certifying—i.e., self-authenticating—since the controller of the SCID who holds the private could cryptographically verify their control by digitally signing a message, e.g., via a challenge-response protocol. The mapping between an identifier and its controlling key(s) is self-contained in the identifier itself. Hence, a SCID is considered a decentralized identifier as it does not rely on any trusted third party to generate or&nbsp;manage.</p><blockquote>Note: An entity that holds an authoritative set of private keys is called a controller of an&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Basic SCID <p>A basic SCID is a variant of SCIDs that is cryptographically generated and bound to a single key pair. A basic SCID is ephemeral/non-transferable since it does not support the rotation of its key pair and therefore must be abandoned once the controlling private key becomes weakened or compromised from exposure. Hence, a basic is not persistent and is not suitable for long-term use.</p><p>The figure below demonstrates a process for creating a SCID, the controller captures sufficient entropy—e.g., using random noise from electronic equipment— to generate a key pair. A common basic SCID could be generated by using a hash digest of the public&nbsp;key.</p> AIDs are Persistent SCIDs <p>An AID is a variant of a SCID is that persistent as it may persist despite the evolution of its key state. In other words, the controller of an AID is capable of rotating their key pair while retaining the same AID. The mechanism for evolving the AID’s key state is called pre-rotation.</p>Difference between a basic SCID and an&nbsp;AID An AID is a primary root of trust in&nbsp;KERI <p>A root of trust is defined as a component or process of the system upon which other components rely. An AID is also a primary root of trust in the KERI protocol, which is purely cryptographic and decentralized, not relying on any centralized entity or even any blockchain network.</p><blockquote>An AID is used as a primary root of trust in the KERI protocol that is purely cryptographic. As a consequence, the security of KERI-based identity systems only relies on cryptography, requiring no trust in external entities or even any blockchain network.</blockquote> 2. Pre-rotation <p>In the KERI protocol, the mechanism used to evolve a key state of an AID is known as pre-rotation. Except for a few special cases, an AID is cryptographically bound to at least two sets of key pairs, each of which holds different control authorities over the&nbsp;AID:</p>  The first set is called the current key(s), which holds the signing authority. The current key(s) of an AID can be used to, for instance, sign arbitrary messages such as verifiable credentials, authenticate the AID’s controller, and anchor external data to KERI’s ledgers, called key event&nbsp;logs.  The second set is called the next key(s), which holds the rotation authority. The next key(s) of an AID can be used to change the key state of the AID, including changing the current keys, that is, transferring the signing authority to another set of&nbsp;key(s).  <blockquote>Here, the “s” refers to the case where a multi-signature scheme is employed, where multiple key pairs are required to establish signing and rotation authorities.</blockquote> Pre-commitment <p>When an AID is created (i.e., incepted), the controller of the AID makes a pre-commitment to the next key(s) that hold rotation authority over the AID. The next key(s) are hidden using a cryptographic hash function, and they are only revealed at the moment the key state of the AID is&nbsp;rotated.</p><p>The next key pair — both private and public keys — must be kept secure and hidden until a key rotation is required. The rotation event revokes the current key pairs that hold signing authority as well as replacing the next key pairs that hold rotation authority.</p><p>This process is called pre-rotation since the next key pair is pre-committed for rotation while the actual rotation event may occur at a later&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>Formally, pre-rotation is a cryptographic pre-commitment of an AID to the next key pair(s) for key rotation.</blockquote> Recovery from Quantum&nbsp;Attack <p>As pre-rotated next key(s) are hidden by a cryptographic hash function, the next key(s) are thus resistant to quantum attack. This is because hash functions are not vulnerable to the Quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s Algorithm</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current key of an AID could still be broken by a quantum attack, allowing a threat actor with access to a quantum computer to gain the signing authority over the AID. However, the legitimate controller of the AID could still regain control over the AID by using the next key(s) to rotate the AID’s key state, perhaps using a quantum-safe algorithm for the new set of current&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Hence, the use of pre-rotation in the KERI protocol makes it quantum-recoverable.</p> 3. Key&nbsp;Event <p>The key state of an AID is determined by a data structure called a key event that consists of the current key(s) and pre-rotated next key(s) as well as other configurations for the&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note: The key state of an AID is defined as a set of currently authoritative key pairs for the AID and any other information necessary to secure or establish control authority over an&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Key Inception Event <p>The AID is itself cryptographically derived from its very first key event, called an inception event, thus giving the AID its self-certifying property. The inception event must also be cryptographically signed by the current&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The example below demonstrates a scenario where an AID has single key pairs for its current and next keys. An AID is derived and bound to the key inception event, which includes:</p>  the first public key, which is used as the current&nbsp;key,  the digest of the second public key, which is used as the pre-rotated next&nbsp;key.  <p>The first public key could be revealed to other entities while the pre-rotated second public key must be kept&nbsp;hidden.</p>An AID is derived from an inception event that consists of two sets of keys, namely the current key and (pre-rotated) next key. The current key is used to sign the key inception event. The AID is pre-committed to future rotation by the second&nbsp;key. Key Rotation&nbsp;Event <p>The pre-rotated next key(s) of an AID may be used to create a subsequent key event, called a rotation event, that changes the AID’s key state. The rotation event must be signed by the next key(s), revealing the next key(s). Hence, the next key(s) can be used for rotation only once, after which the next keys must be either discarded or repurposed as members of the new set of subsequent current key(s). The controller of the AID must also assign a new set of pre-rotated next key(s) in the rotation&nbsp;event.</p><p>Following the example above, the AID could be rotated to revoke the signing authority of the first key pair by using the private key of the pre-rotated second public key to sign a rotation event. In the rotation&nbsp;event,</p>  the second public key is now repurposed to be the new current&nbsp;key,  a new key pair, the third public key, is pre-committing to the future rotation of the&nbsp;AID.  The key state of the AID is evolved by revealing the second (pre-rotated) key and using it to sign a key rotation event. The rotation event includes a new next key that pre-commits the AID to future rotation. Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL) <p>As the key state of an AID evolves, the key events are cryptographically linked in a hash chain that provides a key history for the AID. Such a data structure is called a Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL).</p><p>Formally, a KEL is a hash-chain verifiable data structure used to verify the key state of an AID as it evolves through its lifecycle. A KEL could be compared to a transaction ledger in a traditional blockchain, where key events are transactions in the KERI protocol.</p><p>Following the example above, the KEL of the example AID starts with the inception event with the first public key and the hash digest of the second key. The inception event is chained to subsequent rotation events via the pre-rotation mechanism.</p>A key event log of the AID that contains a hash chain of its key&nbsp;events.<p>Hence, the control authorities — both signing and rotation — of the AID at any point in the KEL can be validated in a self-contained manner by verifying the signatures and recalculating the hashes that connect the key events in the KEL, all the way back to the inception event.</p><blockquote>Note: A KEL is technically a type of “blockchain” in the traditional sense of an ordered list of records that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.</blockquote> 4. Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>At its core, the KERI protocol establishes an infrastructure facilitating the exchange of key events as well as key event receipts. This highlights the protocol’s designation as the “Key Event Receipt Infrastructure.”</p><p>The exchange of key events and key event receipts could carried either directly between controllers of AIDs or indirectly through supporting infrastructures.</p> Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>In the KERI protocol, communications and transactions revolve around the exchange of key events among controllers of AIDs. When a controller receives a key event, they can sign it using the key associated with their AID. This signed key event is called a key event receipt, which provides a non-repudiable proof that the recipient has received—i.e., witnessed—the key&nbsp;event.</p> Key Event Receipt Log&nbsp;(KERL) <p>Key event receipts of an AID could be recorded in a verifiable data structure called a key event receipt log (KERL). A KERL contains the signed key event history of an AID. A verifier of an AID may verify the AID’s key state by using a&nbsp;KERL.</p> Direct mode <p>Key events and key event receipts can be exchanged directly between two controllers. This is known as the direct mode in the KERI protocol.</p><p>In the direct mode, a controller of an AID may send its KEL to another controller, called a validator of the AID. Upon reception of a key event, the validator signs the received key events to generate a key event receipt and subsequently returns it to the controller as an acknowledgment. The controller now has a signed receipt that attests that the validator received and verified the key event message. This provides a trust basis for transactions between the controller and the validator. The validator may not later repudiate its signed receipts nor refer to a different key event history in interactions with the controller without detection by the controller.</p><p>Each party would thereby in turn be the controller for their AID and the validator for the other’s AID. Each could maintain a KEL of their own AID as well as a KERL of the other’s AID. This allows each party to be trusted with respect to this pairwise interaction.</p> Indirect mode <p>Since a controller of an AID may not always be online. The controller may designate witnesses that store and forward key events to any requestor. This is known as the indirect mode in the KERI protocol.</p><p>The purpose of the indirect mode is to provide a highly available trustworthy service for discovering the KEL of an AID. The witnesses also sign the key events to create witnessed key event receipts.</p><p>An example of the indirect replay mode with a set of witnesses that are designated by the controller is shown&nbsp;below.</p> Additional Infrastructures <p>Since the witnesses are designated by the controller of the AID, they may not be entirely trusted by validators of the AID. For example, the AID and its witnesses could be compromised or behave maliciously such that the witnesses provide inconsistent key event histories, called duplicity.</p><p>Consequently, a validator of the AID could designate additional infrastructure to detect duplicity of the AID’s key event history. These additional infrastructures include watchers, jurors, and judges. The infrastructures may be designated a validator or a group of validators to “watch” the witnesses to detect any duplicity in the AID’s key event history as well as make decisions on the validity of the AID’s&nbsp;KEL.</p> Blockchain as KERI witnesses and&nbsp;watchers <p>As discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1</a>, while the KERI protocol does not necessarily rely on a blockchain, KERI may leverage blockchain for the discovery and verification of KELs. In other words, blockchains could be utilized in a KERI-based identity system practically taking the roles of KERI witnesses and watchers. Hence, you could have the best of both worlds, obtaining the advantages that traditional blockchains offer. Since the root of trust in the KERI protocol is within the AIDs themselves, the AIDs could be migrated from one blockchain network to another, avoiding the ledger-locked problem that plagues most blockchain-based DID&nbsp;methods.</p> KERI in a&nbsp;Nutshell <p>Conceptually, the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol is a decentralized identity protocol designed to be an identity overlay for the Internet. Each word in KERI has the following meanings:</p>  Key refers to asymmetric key cryptography that is used to control persistent self-certifying identifiers, called Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs).  Event refers to a series of Key Events in a hash-chain verifiable data structure called Key Event Logs (KELs) that record the key-state evolution of AIDs via the Pre-Rotation mechanism.  Receipt refers to signed receipts of key events, called Key Event Receipts that provide non-repudiable proof while exchanging key events between&nbsp;AIDs.  Infrastructure refers to the protocol for exchanging non-repudiable key event receipts, including the designation of Witnesses, Watchers, Jurors, and&nbsp;Judges.  <p>The next part of the series discusses “How do you use KERI?” which includes references to other introductory materials and a collection of open-source implementations, standards, and whitepapers.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-2-what-exactly-is-keri-e46a649ac54c">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI.

<p>With the acceleration of digital transformation and hybrid work, the number of devices and machines accessing critical data and resources has increased exponentially. The growing number of devices accessing sensitive data gives rise to an expanded attack surface that leaves organizations vulnerable to cyberattacks that can cause financial and reputational damage.</p>
<p>The traditional network perimeter is no more. Identities – whether human or machine – have become the new line of defense when it comes to protecting against cyberattacks. To effectively manage your devices, you need complete visibility over all devices and machines in your organization. While digital certificates are an effective way to create and manage machine identities and device authentication to secure data and communication between a device and an organization’s critical resources (whether in the cloud or on-premises), managing the lifecycle of these digital certificates across disparate environments and a multitude of different devices is proving to be a challenge for many enterprise IT teams.</p>
<p>Managing Digital Certificates Across Devices and Operating Systems</p>
<p>Having a complete certificate lifecycle management (CLM) solution that enables automation is key to having control and ensuring compliance across your digital certificate estate. In addition, an effective PKI solution should support multiple protocols to support certificate enrollment across a number of devices (mobile, laptops, IoT, etc.) and operating systems to provide end-to-end CLM across a global enterprise.</p>
<p>Much like the remote/hybrid work option allows people to be flexible, a PKI solution must integrate with mobile device management (MDM) solutions to allow organizations to do the same, in turn supporting advanced identification, authentication, and authorization schemes, enabling organizations to deploy and manage MDM solutions effectively with strong machine identities. Microsoft Windows devices that account for a large number of workforce devices use the WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment Extensions Protocol (WSTEP), which allows for secure certificate enrollment and revocation capabilities.</p>
<p>Automation is a key requirement for CLM to ensure seamless certificate enrollment and revocation processes. Having a cloud-based PKI as a service that integrates with MDM solutions eliminates the costly overhead with on-premises infrastructure and ensures your organization is being actively managed and secured.</p>
<p>As digital transformation continues to accelerate, it’s up to you and your organization to continue to grow and evolve with the trends and reduce complexity for enterprise IT departments worldwide.

   by Paul Fisher  Among these emerging technologies, identity wallets have sparked considerable debate and optimism—not to mention quite&nbsp; a number of working groups. While they promise a future of seamless and secure digital identity management, their proliferation may be premature, serving more as a distraction than a solution, until we achieve truly ironclad identity authentication.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>Among these emerging technologies, identity wallets have sparked considerable debate and optimism—not to mention quite&nbsp; a number of working groups. While they promise a future of seamless and secure digital identity management, their proliferation may be premature, serving more as a distraction than a solution, until we achieve truly ironclad identity authentication.</p>
 The Allure of Identity Wallets 
<p>Identity wallets propose an enticing vision: a user-centric model where individuals have full control over their identity credentials, sharing them effortlessly and securely across services and organizations. This concept aligns with the broader trend towards empowering users and enhancing privacy. By consolidating identity verification in a single, secure location, identity wallets seem to offer a panacea for the fragmented, insecure, and cumbersome processes plaguing current online interactions.</p>
 The Core Issue: Authentication Integrity 
<p>However, the rush towards adopting identity wallets overlooks a fundamental flaw in our current cybersecurity infrastructure—the integrity of identity authentication itself and the endless number of protocols. The foundation of any IAM system is its ability to accurately and securely authenticate the identity of users. No matter how sophisticated or user-friendly an identity wallet may be, its effectiveness is inherently limited by the reliability of the initial authentication process.</p>
<p>Outside these working groups, &nbsp;reality we face is stark. Phishing attacks, identity theft, and account takeovers are rampant, exploiting weaknesses in password-based systems, biometrics, and even two-factor authentication methods. The security community has long acknowledged these vulnerabilities, yet a truly ironclad solution remains elusive.</p>
 Distraction from the Real Challenge 
<p>The fervor surrounding identity wallets risks diverting attention and resources from addressing the root problem—developing authentication mechanisms that are both impervious to existing threats and adaptable to future challenges. While identity wallets can streamline identity management once a user is authenticated, they do little to enhance the security of the authentication process itself.</p>
<p>This is not to dismiss the potential benefits of identity wallets outright. They represent a significant step forward in managing digital identities. The path forward requires a collective reevaluation of our priorities. The cybersecurity and identity communities must channel iefforts into research and development of authentication technologies that can withstand the sophisticated threats of today and tomorrow. Innovations such as cryptographic proofs, advanced biometrics, and behavioral analytics hold promise, but require significant investment to realize their potential.</p>
<p>Moreover, fostering an ecosystem that supports interoperability and open standards will be crucial. This approach will not only enhance the security and usability of authentication methods but also ensure that emerging solutions like identity wallets can integrate seamlessly into the broader IAM framework.</p>
<p>What do you think? Digital wallets and all aspects of IAM will be high on the agenda at KuppingerCole’s European Identity &amp; Cloud EIC2024 conference. There will be opportunities to learn about Safeguarding Digital Identities in Today's World, to get insights into How AI Can Help IAM Deliver Better and Stronger Authorization, to get answers the question: Can you trust AI in IAM? And much more!</p>

<p>In this 2-part series we are excited to introduce a new area of our work. We have divided this first introductory publication into two short reflections to invite flexible engagement. As we continue to explore the concept and produce new multimedia materials we will update the links and images to reflect this emerging content. The modular, conversational design of this publication is intentional and has been created to respect the dynamic and collaborative nature of the initiative.</p>  Part 1: Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing it? (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/introducing-life-ennobling-economics-part-1-d950ae770ef2">Linked&nbsp;here</a>)  Part 2: the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the&nbsp;LEE.  <p>A downloadable interactive pdf of this full publication is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3x9hYWM3n0zqyTnFzetGDSdlnspRzOr/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>.</p> Part 2 — the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the&nbsp;LEE  Using narratives, diagrams and images to open a generative dialogue <p>In our first publication we introduced two questions that we are using to navigate towards a foundational logic for Life-Ennobling Economics. In this next post we are using those overall queries to share some initial thoughts, together with the cascading questions that are continuing to arise. A strong reflection at this point is that it’s difficult to express many of the core sentiments of LEE using only words. The articulation of certain ideas feels premature and constrictive and this is something that we want to hold up to the light. On the one hand, it feels important to drive clarity and not to hide behind vague, even poetic phrasing. Yet on the other hand, a sense of humility, awe and deep curiosity makes us reluctant to distil and label these early ideas. How can we adequately express diverse interpretations, yearnings and fears for this future that we are daring to open ourselves towards? How might you as the reader? How might your children, parents or more-than-human relations?</p><blockquote>Q1: What would a future economy look and feel like if it was rooted in the recognition of the full web of life, grounded by a non-bounded theory of value and enabled by technological ecosystems of&nbsp;care?</blockquote><blockquote>Q2: If the journey to get there involved moving beyond theories of property, labour, extraction, private contracts, governance and monetary colonisation what would we be shifting from and&nbsp;towards?</blockquote><p>In the sections that follow we are outlining three core worldview philosophies that we think could underpin a desirable future economy. From there, we have identified six structural shifts that we are hypothesising would need to occur for that to become a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>3 WORLDVIEW PHILOSOPHIES</p> Philosophy 1 <p>Rooted in the recognition of the full web of life: From violence, scarcity and separation to a thriving planetary community of interbecoming.</p><p>What would it mean to fundamentally reimagine ourselves as permeable, dynamic interbecomings, deeply entwined in diverse right relationships and joyfully part of a full planetary consciousness. This concept challenges the traditional economic view of humans driven primarily by rational, objectified, self-interest. Instead, it suggests a new understanding of self where our individual interests are indistinct from what we can collectively become.</p><p>This shift in perspective would call for a re-evaluation of the infrastructures that shape our lives and identities. It would question how we think about everything; from education and learning, health care and human development to the roles and functions of prisons and the judicial system. For example, what does justice mean in a world where we see ourselves as interconnected becomings?</p><blockquote>What do we mean by when we use the term Interbecoming?</blockquote><blockquote>Interbecoming is an extension of the word Interbe which was invented by the Buddhist monk Thích Nhất Hạnh. The becoming element signifies the emergent potential of what it means to verb as a community into the future. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esyQnwz_yJ0">short video</a> he describes how you cannot be by yourself alone, to be you need to be with everything and everyone else and therefore to be means to inter-be.</blockquote> Philosophy 2 <p>Grounded in a non-bounded understanding of value: From extractive profit-driven goals to entangled, intergenerational and distributed value&nbsp;systems.</p><p>In our current economy our measures of success are calculated using a narrow set of accounting rules. This is a collectively accepted norm, but can a genuine measure of value be bounded by time or context? In an interconnected world, externalities seem to be a delusion yet they are currently excluded from our calculations of profit and GDP. Imagine an economy where value was understood to be attributed to relationships themselves rather than the things that are related? How would our economy behave if the collective goal and source of status was increasing regenerative potential or stocks of&nbsp;care?</p><blockquote>The illogical tyranny of&nbsp;metrics</blockquote><blockquote>“People becoming unhealthy can actually have a positive effect overall on GDP, as revenue from associated healthcare boosts growth. Similarly, the extraction of oil and gas pushes GDP up, while pushing us closer to the precipice of climate breakdown.” — Caroline Lucas, MP (<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-07-10/debates/FFE2C4E7-4ED0-4537-BA1F-0DE8B46CA084/EconomicGrowthAndEnvironmentalLimits">UK Parliamentary Debate,&nbsp;2019</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Hazel Henderson’s layer cake was the <a href="https://twitter.com/KateRaworth/status/1528866241683017728">original inspiration</a> behind Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics framework. It is a metaphor for how the current monetised economy (the top layers of cake) are entirely dependent on the non-valued, supportive lower&nbsp;layers.</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Annie Spratt</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> Philosophy 3 <p>Enabled by technological ecosystems of care: From the utilitarian ‘othering’ of technology to animistic interfaces of wisdom and&nbsp;care.</p><p>The accelerating technological complexity of our world can be seen as a threat. However, it could also offer new opportunities to nurture the capacity of society to understand itself more fully, rather than trying to mould and regulate it. Imagine a future where our governing institutions are empowered to advance and scaffold the continuous learning of a self-aware system. Where we can sense the unique, embodied value of every context, thus fostering care for the entangled impacts, both positive and negative. Ultimately we have a choice; will we use the stunning power of advanced technologies to embrace a new freedom to care, or will we use it to destroy everything we depend on and hold&nbsp;dear?</p><blockquote>Busy fools?</blockquote><blockquote>‘We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom’- E.O.&nbsp;Wilson</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176CNiZYM1v2xcEzDVO4SHuEfRQoosCVL/view?usp=sharing">The Cornerstone Indicators </a>work is an example of participatory dialogues being combined with smart data, to create intuitively understandable multi-contextual indicators of care.

Image: Vlad Afanasiev<p>6 STRUCTURAL SHIFTS</p> Shift 1 <p>Beyond Property: From exerting control over ‘objects’ to seeking reciprocal relationships with the full web of&nbsp;life.</p><p>Words like property and ownership are often associated with ideas of dominion and control, allowing us to treat elements of the living world (such as land and rare earth minerals) as objects. Deep down though, do we really believe that timber holds more value than a forest? Or that a whale’s life is interchangeable with a barrel of oil? What would it mean to explore a world beyond property, a world of self sovereign agents who we are respectfully in treaty&nbsp;with?</p><blockquote>The paradox of individual identity</blockquote><blockquote>The idea of self-sovereign agents is being used to express a conviction that life is not a sum of its constituent parts. Instead, both the whole and the parts co-arise with equal agency. The word identity is derived from the Latin idem, the same and identidem, again and again. We identify ourselves by our internal consistency, but this concept only exists in contrast to external self identifying elements (and vice versa). This idea has been expressed by diverse thinkers from <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-experience-of-meaning/jan-zwicky/9780773557437">Zan Zwicky</a> to <a href="https://www.systematics.org/journal/vol9-2/TheWhole_Bortoft.pdf">Henri Borthoft </a>and is carefully explored by Daniel Wahl in Designing Regenerative Cultures¹ and Iain McGilchrist in The Matter with&nbsp;Things².</blockquote><blockquote>‘To shut ourselves off from these other voices…is to rob our own senses of their integrity, and to rob our minds of their coherence. We are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human’ — David&nbsp;Abram</blockquote> Shift 2 <p>Beyond Labour: From humans employed as resources to vocations of creativity, purpose and&nbsp;care.</p><p>In our industrialised economies humans are often framed as a functional resource. However, rapidly advancing technologies (such as machine automation and alternative distributed currencies) have the potential to weaken the requirement for labour to service financial capital. What would it mean to emancipate the idea of work from its current focus on hierarchy and external incentives? Could we build a future economy that harnesses our inherent, embodied intelligences and unleashes our intrinsic motivations and ability to discover? Perhaps this would be a future of virtuous flow where human satisfaction is rooted in low impact, transcendent goals.</p><blockquote>Can a state of flow be virtuous?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://timjackson.org.uk/finding-flow-lancet/">Professor Tim Jackson</a> has proposed the concept of flow as a pathway towards sustainable fulfilment.</blockquote> Shift 3 <p>Beyond Extraction: From extractive resource claims to the infinite guardianship of the global&nbsp;commons.</p><p>Even the word resource is innately extractive and predicated on violence. When we see a sentient animal or element of an ecosystem and name it as a natural resource, we are using language to justify collective violence in pursuit of private comfort. We have become highly proficient at accessing diverse fodder for the global economic supertanker; from the deep sea beds to the depths of the Amazon rainforest nowhere is considered too difficult to access if the price is right. What would happen if we erased ‘resource’ from our active vocabulary, and redirected our ingenuity toward stewarding the global&nbsp;commons?</p><blockquote>Do words&nbsp;matter?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714174/46011659/INAYAN_LANDSCAPE+%281%29.gif/36b31524-6d41-6ed3-8cda-bf444bde3fe0?t=1659621341143">Inayan — “Unethical deeds”</a>: Inayan is a word that doesn’t exist in the English language. For the Kankanaey people in the Philippines it expresses a community value of refraining from harmful behaviour towards living and inanimate relations. For example, it is inayan to pollute the&nbsp;rivers.</blockquote> Shift 4 <p>Beyond Private Contracts: From linear agreements that optimise for the few to multi-party, dynamic, digital treaties of&nbsp;respect.</p><p>Many of our existing contracts are structured as bilateral agreements. By design, these agreements ignore the complex interplay of values and the mutual need for care that is integral to most transactions. With the emergence of capabilities such as many-to-many and smart, self-executing contracting, we see an opportunity to revolutionise this root structure of the economy. For example, how would our interactions change if we could easily assemble contracts that recognise relational value? Could we collectively drive a bureaucratic revolution that would create new ways to acknowledge and manage the intricate, entangled flows of&nbsp;value?</p><blockquote>Are these new contracts too technical or theoretical to engage&nbsp;with?</blockquote><blockquote>From a conceptual provocation (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">Smart Commons provocation</a>) to a live multi-partner collaboration (<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.notion.site/Beyond-the-Rules-19e692bf98f54b44971ca34700e246fd">Beyond The Rules Portal</a>), we are working out loud to test the theory and practical applications of these new forms of contracting.</blockquote>Credit: Terri&nbsp;Po Shift 5 <p>Beyond Governance: From centralised enforcement to nurturing institutions of stewardship.</p><p>Historically our dominant governance structures have sought to control and instruct. However, with the increasing complexity of both our societal systems and escalating risk pathways, this theory of governance no longer appears viable. From their top-down view, many governments are struggling to intelligently regulate the increasingly complex systems of property that they guarantee.</p><p>The most probable directions of future societal travel do not seem appealing. On the one hand we might fail to resolve our global coordination challenges and continue to experience ever intensifying crises (for example, individual countries reopening coal mines to reduce energy costs in the short-term ). Alternatively, we might find ways to overcome perverse incentives but the means to do so will potentially lead us towards authoritarian dystopias. With this in mind, how can we transition away from a centralised model of control, and embrace a governance style that fosters collective learning and empowers the entire&nbsp;system³.</p><blockquote>Is there an adjacent, third&nbsp;option?</blockquote><blockquote>Consilience: the idea that evidence from independent, unrelated sources can “converge” on strong conclusions.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/global-neighbourhoods-digital-democracy">In Taiwan</a>, the combination of open data and civic participation has created a transparent governance model that drastically reduced the impact of the Covid-19&nbsp;virus.</blockquote> Shift 6 <p>Beyond Monetary Capital: From the accumulation of financial wealth to a social contract that regeneratively stewards the diverse capitals of&nbsp;life.</p><p>What would it mean if we understood capital wealth as an expression of crystallised suffering? Recognising that financial capital is intertwined and enabled by living and social systems could be an important pivot point towards a future rooted in mutually assured thriving. Perhaps then we would feel empowered to reject a monetary system that continues to colonise, exploit and exclude by design. Imagine how our relationship to financial capital might change if we understood the act of investing to be a commitment to our collective futures? What would a system look like where the ways of creating and stewarding money are decentralised and respectful of incommensurate value&nbsp;flows?</p><blockquote>Is the plurality of existing alternative currencies a blessing or a distraction?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya3IuJx8O9o">Bernard Lietaer</a> who co-designed the Euro has proposed three core design principles that fundamentally shape the interaction between money and society: a) who issues a currency, b) the qualities it is given, and c) what it can be used&nbsp;for.</blockquote><blockquote>In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">this provocation</a> we explore 10 design principles that could underpin a cohesive yet diverse regenerative monetary&nbsp;system.</blockquote> What’s next and how can people become involved? <p>We have created these first two sections as a landing point for the LEE movement. The idea will be to leave this initial piece in its original form and update the links to new materials as they emerge. What happens next depends on who engages and in what capacity. When we initially proposed the idea, we had imagined that LEE might manifest as a collaborative book and we are still open to that possibility. However, we feel strongly that whilst a tangible artefact would be a powerful tool, it should not be the end goal. Instead, we are aspiring to create a container that can scaffold a distributed exploration and implementation of LEE principles.</p><p>Publications in the&nbsp;pipeline</p><p>We are working on the following pieces and will publish them&nbsp;soon:</p>  Exploratory conversations with critical friends who have read the early versions of the LEE&nbsp;concept.  An outline of how Dark Matter Labs is organising itself to work on the questions raised by the&nbsp;LEE.  Internal conversations: what would it mean for the different strands of our work if we embraced Life-Ennobling Economics as our overarching mission?  <p>Potential pathways for engagement</p><p>We are interested to hear diverse perspectives and will adjust our approach depending on the feedback we receive. As an initial prompt perhaps one of these descriptions is relevant to&nbsp;you:</p><blockquote>Funding support: we are hoping to convene a partnership of funders who can support, elevate and actively contribute to this vision. The scope of ambition is wide but we will curate the process as a series of modular steps. If you are interested in supporting us, either as a general contribution or as a standalone module, then we would be very happy to discuss your ideas. Email: jayne@darkmatterlabs.org</blockquote><blockquote>Collaborative support: We expect to organise a series of diverse gatherings and working groups. As a first step we will create a live database of potential collaborators and propose a series of online and in-person events following initial conversations. If this is something you would like to hear more about, we would be grateful if you could send us a short email to let us know your area of interest. Email: emily@darkmatterlabs.org</blockquote><blockquote>Staying updated: our hope is that the ongoing LEE work will provide a convening point for a wider body of thinking on alternative economies. Please feel free to send us your email contact and we will keep you updated on progress and new publications.

<p>In this 2-part series we are excited to introduce a new area of our work. We have divided this first introductory publication into two short reflections to invite flexible engagement. As we continue to explore the concept and produce new multimedia materials we will update the links and images to reflect this emerging content. The modular, conversational design of this publication is intentional and has been created to respect the dynamic and collaborative nature of the initiative.</p>  Part 1: Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing&nbsp;it?  Part 2: the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the LEE (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/introducing-life-ennobling-economics-part-2-da43434545c8">linked&nbsp;here</a>).  <p>A downloadable interactive pdf of this full publication is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3x9hYWM3n0zqyTnFzetGDSdlnspRzOr/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>.</p> Part 1 — Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing&nbsp;it? <blockquote>The term life-ennobling is in itself an adjacent extension of <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/social-justice/2023/02/07/ruthie-wilson-gilmore-abolition-geography%EF%BF%BC">Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s work</a> on life-affirming institutions.</blockquote><p>Our economic systems are failing to serve the interests of our living planet and the great majority of those who inhabit it. It is not our intention to restate the multiple crises that this mismatch has fuelled and continues to perpetuate. Instead, we are sharing our emerging thinking as we strive to build pathways towards alternative ways of organising society. Reading this opening paragraph you may already be holding many questions. For&nbsp;example:</p>  ‘Surely we don’t need yet another type of economics?’.  ‘We already have Doughnut Economics, Wellbeing Economics, Solidarity Economics, Ecological Economics — the list goes on — wouldn’t it make more sense to focus on implementing their principles rather than proposing a new version?’  ‘What gives Dark Matter Labs the authority to suggest a new form of economics? This seems like an audacious and perhaps even arrogant proposal to&nbsp;make.’  <p>We are holding many of these questions ourselves and fully acknowledge that we are standing on the shoulders of giants. LEE draws on the work of intersectional scholars, feminist and ecological economists and fuses their insights with indigenous wisdom, the life-affirming passion of the abolitionists and the dynamism of radical technologists.</p><p>As we move deeper into the work we are planning to weave the questions and wisdom of our ecosystem into the things that we are learning. We will embrace the friction that comes with an organic conversation and share this unfolding journey using different mediums. If you have comments on the content, or ideas to shape the format of the conversation, then we would welcome feedback.</p>Credit: Martin&nbsp;Lorenz The concept <p>We are proposing Life-Ennobling Economics as an invitational vision and as a call to action. It is an ennobling invitation to break free from ideological constraints, to embrace the radical potential of new technologies, and to challenge the structural codes of our current socio-economic systems. Implicit in this opening position is an understanding that the structure and values of the economy must be in service to all forms of life (present, future, human, non-human and machine) providing a scaffold of care and&nbsp;respect.</p><p>One way of understanding LEE is as a series of linked questions:</p>  What would a desirable future economy actually look&nbsp;like?  What would need to shift for that to become a&nbsp;reality?  What does that mean in the context of our current socioeconomic and political reality?  What can we build or seed to test those assumptions?  <p>We have started to explore these questions as part of our own organisational strategy. We have visualised our response as a 3D matrix and we will publish more about this&nbsp;soon.</p><p>To open the dialogue with a wider audience we are testing three core worldview philosophies that we think could underpin a desirable future economy. From there, we have identified six structural shifts that we are hypothesising would need to occur for that to become a reality. The aspiration is to begin building and testing elements of these proposed shifts on the ground, in diverse contexts and communities.</p> What are the core elements of the hypothesis? <p>We are presenting the opening hypothesis as three short sections: (1) an overall framing (2) a philosophical framework (3) an action orientated scaffold. In some places we have included links to more in-depth content and we will expand on the concept in our upcoming publications, including a series of conversations with critical&nbsp;friends.</p><blockquote>1. Overall&nbsp;framing</blockquote><blockquote>The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s&nbsp;house</blockquote><blockquote>— Audre&nbsp;Lorde</blockquote><p>The central augment being put forward by the LEE is that whilst we indisputably need to shift to a new economy, we will not get there using the mental models, tools or value systems of the current one. If we allow ourselves to sit with this statement for a moment, how do we feel? Possibly a sense of deflation, frustration or hopelessness. This is not our intention. Rather, we are proposing that we allow ourselves to lean into the idea of a beyond paradigm movement of unusual allies. Donella Meadows retrospectively adjusted her <a href="https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">thesis ↗</a> to include an additional level that she named the power to transcend paradigms. Building on this insight, LEE is inviting us to explore what could happen if we allow ourselves to sense into the edges of everything that we are capable of becoming. From nature rights activists and abolitionists to the advocates of self sovereign technologies and universal basic income, many diverse voices are advocating for a common shift. What might be unlocked if we could collaborate across a broad spectrum of unusual&nbsp;allies?</p><blockquote>2. A philosophical framework</blockquote><p>Iain McGilchrist has commented that in modern society we are living under a philosophical error that is far from abstract and instead runs deep to the way that we experience the world¹. Collaboratively building a coherent philosophical base for a more generative future feels critical, because it is this foundational logic that shapes the more tangible layers of our societies. For example, if we start from a value system that promotes individualism and competition then we are likely to design narrow indicators of progress such as GDP, that further entrench these values. In contrast, in a system centred on regenerative vitality we would probably lean towards more embodied measures of success, thus reinforcing the interconnected basis of societal wellbeing².</p><p>To begin exploring and crafting a shared philosophical baseline we are using the following questions to frame our opening thoughts:</p><blockquote>Q1: What would a future economy look and feel like if it was rooted in the recognition of the full web of life, grounded by a non-bounded theory of value and enabled by technological ecosystems of&nbsp;care?</blockquote><blockquote>Q2: If the journey to get there involved moving beyond theories of property, labour, extraction, private contracts, governance and monetary colonisation, what would we be shifting from and&nbsp;towards?</blockquote><p>We are deliberately using a beyond x,y,z rather than a steps towards framing to explore the proposed structural shifts. We hope that this will encourage a less prescriptive and declarative mindset as we consider what we might collectively work towards. For&nbsp;example:</p>  What could be unlocked if we looked beyond our current understanding of terms such as natural resources, money, institutions and governance?  How can we ensure that voices from the ideological left or right, those who are privileged or oppressed, indigenous or geographically separated can are respectfully represented within the LEE framework?  What might we imagine (or perhaps glimpse existing fragments of) if we let go of a solution oriented&nbsp;mindset?  Are there already existing pockets of these alternative worldviews spread across diverse communities?  <blockquote>3. An action oriented&nbsp;scaffold</blockquote><blockquote>“We’ve been told repeatedly that the current political economy can provide the answers, ignoring systematic faults and invested interests in the way of change. Isn’t the real question here then, how we go about redesigning this political economy in a way that includes other voices, values, and&nbsp;ideas.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Gail Bradbrook</blockquote><p>Establishing a strong theoretical baseline is a priority for this initiative, but it also feels important to begin testing and elevating alternative pathways. There is already a stunning global constellation of organisations, movements and thinkers who are actively embodying regenerative crafts and values (for example we recently mapped actors <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14C7-2GVpMM1dZu5o8Q7hgHAOnBMMfCJ3/view?usp=sharing">working on a just transition for housing</a> in Europe). We hope that by broadening the conversation, welcoming unforeseen allies and recognising diverse interests, the LEE can contribute to strengthening this distributed network.</p><p>An initial suggestion for this scaffold is to think of it as two connected threads:</p>  Case studies: we cannot be sure of how the future will play out. However, we can draw on historical events and foresight methods to explore the more likely scenarios. What might we discover if we collate an evidence base of existing signals of change from around the world (for example UBI trials and distributed currencies)? Or perhaps we can gain new insights from building out exploratory case studies, over varied time horizons, for specific sectors such as finance and food systems. How could our understanding shift if we embrace practices such as vision-questing, somatic and dream work? Perhaps you have practices or ideas that you think might be powerful for this collective visioning? We would be grateful for any suggestions and references.  Systemic capabilities: building on the case studies, we hope to identify a speculative portfolio of systemic capabilities that can be developed, tested and iterated in parallel to the existing system. Potential pathways might include designing large scale participatory dialogues, launching transitional financial instruments or developing the policies and tools for distributed decision making structures.   Living the questions <p>In Part 2 of this post we have illustrated our current understanding of some of the questions raised above. We are also working on a series of conversations where we will present some initial reactions to this proposal and explore the points of resonance and friction.</p><p>This blog was designed and written by Martin Lorenz, Emily Harris and Indy Johar as part of Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB.</p><p>The list can never be complete but to the following, thank you for your wisdom, foresight and work — your voices have given shape and clarity to the LEE concept: Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Ilya Prigogine, Stuart Kauffman, Hermon Daly, James Lovelock, Donella Meadows, Kate Raworth, Daniel Schmachtenberger, Fritjof Capra, Daniel Wahl, Katherina Pistor, Aime Cesaire, Iain McGilchrist, Tim Jackson, Nora Bateson, Elinor Ostrom, Sheila Watt-Cloutier, E. F. Schumacher, Farzana Khan, Thich Nhat Hanh, Mariana Mazzucato and David&nbsp;Abram.</p><p>References:</p>  Iain McGilchrist is a psychiatrist and polymath most famous for his work on how the different hemispheres of the brain impact individual behaviour and thus society as a whole. His view is that this psychological error is based on a belief that the world is made up of a series of parts, rather than understanding that everything happens out of the coming together of complex wholes.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p>Cloud IaaS is used extensively to develop, deliver new applications, and reengineer existing ones. This is often because cloud services provide an environment for accelerated development without the need for capital expenditure and avoids lengthy procurement delays to obtain hardware. However, this also creates challenges, in particular security as a shared responsibility, and this increases complexity since each cloud service provides security capabilities in diverse ways. While the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) must take steps to secure the service they provide, it is up to the customer to secure the way they use the service. Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP) are intended to reduce complexity by helping organizations using multiple cloud services to identify and manage the risks for which they have responsibility.

 Stakers can claim DF80 rewards. DF81 runs Mar 14— Mar 21, 2024. DF Main 2 is&nbsp;here  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions via Predictoor.</p><blockquote>As of this DF round (DF81), <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">DF Main 2 is here</a>. OCEAN rewards double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>Data Farming Round 80 (DF80) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am March 7, 2024 and ended 12:01 am March 14. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF81 is live today, March 14. It concludes on March 21. 300K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF81   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF, and Predictoor DF.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF81 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;2.</p><p>Budget. This round has 300,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of&nbsp;rewards)  Active DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of rewards). To each substream:<br>– Volume DF: 112.5K OCEAN<br>– Predictoor DF: 37.5K OCEAN + 20K&nbsp;ROSE  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier. This <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">prevents wash consume</a>. The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise.  <p>Any OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF that wasn’t rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p><p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming docs</a> provide all key info, guides on how to earn, and detailed info about reward schedule, APYs, and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> blog post is a thorough listing of all DF articles in one&nbsp;place.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Aergo is excited to announce Booost’s expansion as an Aergo sub-brand specializing in consumer NFT. <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/digital-assets-as-a-gateway-expanding-enterprise-led-nft-initiative-cb770dcf44ec">As stated in the previous article</a>, Aergo will focus on enterprise-led NFTs, while Booost will specialize in web3 functionalities and NFTs tailored for consumer engagement, particularly leveraging location-based models. This strategic division allows us to tap into distinct markets and cater to diverse needs from both B2B and B2C&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>Firstly, Aergo will add dynamic NFT (dNFT) functionality for enterprise customers to utilize with various services. Aergo has already established blockchain infrastructure for numerous companies. By introducing dNFTs and leveraging accumulated network data, Aergo will be pioneering NFTs tailored for specific enterprise environments, extending beyond mere blockchain recording and authentication.</p><p>This innovation stands to revolutionize markets like STO (Security Token Offering) and RWA (Real World Asset). Unlike static NFTs, dNFTs feature continuously updatable metadata, consolidating changes like mortgages and titles without individual raw data storage. This shift offers superior data management and security for enterprises and government agencies, particularly those favoring private networks.</p><p>Take the automotive market for example, where dNFTs are issued when a vehicle is sold. The NFTs record the vehicle’s maintenance and fueling records, which are essential for value conversion which now can be easily performed by simply looking up the dNFT without accessing the blockchain where the raw data is stored. This can be utilized for more accurate valuations, simplifying trades and collateralization. dNFTs can also streamline pre-owned sales for automakers by calculating vehicle purchase values and associated maintenance costs. Luxury car brands also can leverage dNFTs to enhance loyalty programs, offering tailored rewards like event-based incentives and consumer participation rewards to their clientele.</p><p>Meanwhile, Booost will increase its user base by expanding various web3 functions and consumer-focused NFT features. Beyond the event information and location-sharing services successfully tested at the previous Korea Blockchain Week, Booost plans to test and upgrade advertising services linked to NFTs at various domestic and international web3 and crypto&nbsp;events.</p><p>Booost’s primary focus is on location-based advertising (LBA), inspired by Niantic’s groundbreaking integration of gaming with real-world elements. Our innovative LBA model will incorporate features such as event check-ins, admission tickets, raffles, airdrop events, and more, offering a compelling and immersive experience for users and more targeted marketing for retail, enhancing customer engagement</p><p>These dynamic and consumer NFT technologies will be implemented in enterprises and across various industries. Aergo will support companies in various fields including manufacturing companies, governments, and retail to easily utilize dNFTs. The BOOOST app will be a gateway to the web3/consumer NFT markets, expanding the Aergo-based NFT issuance and ecosystem while Aergo taps into the enterprise NFT&nbsp;markets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/booosting-the-dynamic-nft-and-consumer-nft-markets-bee8ca91635e">‘BOOOST’ing the Dynamic NFT and Consumer NFT Markets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  There is no minimum transaction threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in&nbsp;Estonia.  The definition of VASPs in Estonia now covers a wider array of crypto services, expanding AML compliance requirements.  Licensing fees and capital requirements for crypto businesses have been increased in&nbsp;Estonia.  <p>In 2017, Estonia became the first country to set the European legal framework for virtual currencies. The country then enacted amendments to its anti-money laundering (AML) legislation that define cryptocurrencies as value represented in digital form that is digitally transferable and acceptable as a payment instrument but not a legal&nbsp;tender.</p><p>In the following year, the European Union (EU) <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-block-perspective-march-2023">adopted the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)</a>, which introduced AML and know-your-client (KYC) obligations for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. To comply with the EU directive, Estonia made changes to its Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act, which were implemented in March&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Since then, Estonia has started treating virtual currency service providers as “financial institutions,” subjecting them to the same reporting regulations and requirements as other financial institutions within the&nbsp;country.</p><p>In March 2022, Estonia further tightened its regulations with <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112032022002">amendments to its Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act</a>. These amendments enforced the FATF Travel Rule, set more stringent licensing conditions for crypto service providers, and broadened the AML Act’s reach to include new virtual currency services.</p> Key Features of the Travel Rule in&nbsp;Estonia <p>By introducing <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a>, Estonia expanded the definition of “virtual currency service” to include virtual currency transfer services and services related to the issuance of virtual currency.</p><p>Based on the changes, intermediaries between buyers and sellers and services that bring buyers and sellers together, decentralized platforms, services that delegate transactions to third parties, ICO platforms, and other similar services all fall under the VASP category. Hence, they must comply with AML and licensing requirements.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators raised the cost of obtaining a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) license to €10,000. They also set a minimum share capital requirement of €100,000 for licensees and introduced a new administrative fee for changes in crypto-related activities.</p><p>Businesses also had to submit extra documents, such as a two-year business plan, financial details, descriptions of the information technology systems for identifying and monitoring transactions, information about customers and their beneficial owners, and details required for fulfilling the Travel Rule obligation.</p><p>Moreover, regulators updated the management board requirements and introduced additional grounds for refusing or revoking a VASP&nbsp;license.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>Having implemented the FATF Travel Rule in March 2022, the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) gave crypto businesses only three months, up until June 15, 2022, to enforce the rules. However, there is no minimum transaction threshold for reporting transactions.</p><p>Under the Estonia Crypto Travel Rule, VASPs must collect data on a transaction’s originator and share it with the service provider of the transaction’s recipient when completing a virtual currency exchange or transfer. For legal persons, the information to be gathered and shared includes:</p><p>- Full Name &amp; Place of&nbsp;business</p><p>- Unique transaction identifier</p><p>- Crypto wallet identifier or payment account identifier</p><p>- Registry code or residence country identifier</p><p>Meanwhile, the information to be collected for natural persons includes:</p><p>- Full&nbsp;Name</p><p>- Unique transaction identifier</p><p>- Crypto wallet identifier or payment account identifier</p><p>- Identity number and personal identification code</p><p>- Date of birth, place of birth, and residential address</p><p>To comply with the Travel Rule and avoid license revocation, VASPs must maintain accurate records. While transactions involving private wallets are not directly covered by the rule, VASPs initiating such transactions are obligated to perform risk assessments.</p><p>Additionally, the revised AML Act imposes stringent penalties for non-compliance. Fines can reach up to €400,000, with additional penalties of up to 300 fine units (€4 per unit) for violations, including failing to meet capital requirements, neglecting VASP duties, and creating anonymous wallets or accounts.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Estonia, the Crypto Travel Rule applies to all VASPs operating within its borders, including foreign VASPs, which must register locally to offer their services. VASPs here means crypto exchanges, crypto transfer providers, and any services related to virtual currency issuance.</p><p>Initially, Estonia offered two different licenses to crypto exchanges depending on their functions: the Exchange Service License and the Wallet Service License. However, it has now changed to just one license: the Estonian Cryptocurrency Exchange&nbsp;License.</p><p>To apply for the Estonian Cryptocurrency Exchange license, VASPs must meet stringent requirements that cover but are not limited to the following:</p><p>- The virtual currency company should be registered in&nbsp;Estonia.</p><p>- The company’s business plan must include its intended business activities as well as operational procedures and expected spending.</p><p>- A description of the information technological system and other systems to be used to operate the business.</p><p>- The company’s intended security measures to protect customer&nbsp;assets.</p><p>- Information about the company’s assigned audit firm, including their name, personal identity code, or personally identifiable information (PII).</p><p>- A share capital of at least EUR 100,000 for exchange services and EUR 250,000 for transfer services.</p><p>In transactions involving unhosted (non-custodial or self-hosted) wallets, Estonian VASPs are not obliged to transmit detailed personally identifiable information (PII). However, they must assess the transaction’s risk, retain essential information about both the transaction’s originator and beneficiary, and provide this data to regulatory or supervisory bodies when requested.</p><p>While PII from the beneficiary is not always mandatory in transactions from self-hosted wallets, the originator must supply PII when transferring to a VASP. Additionally, transactions of high value or those conducted frequently may require the beneficiary’s PII as&nbsp;well.</p> Global Context and Comparison <p>The FATF guidance and various global regulators further stipulate that VASPs must apply the Travel Rule to transactions above the $1,000 threshold. This minimum requirement varies based on jurisdictions. For instance, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">in the US</a>, this limit is higher at $3,000, while some jurisdictions, like Estonia, do not have one at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Moreover, contrary to the guidance of FATF, Estonia doesn’t need VASPs to gather and share any personal information about the Beneficiary customer. Most jurisdictions require the beneficiary’s name to be obtained and transmitted. This may cause issues when an Estonia exchange exchange interacts with a foreign exchange, as they may reject the transaction that has no information about the beneficiary.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>By enforcing the FATF Travel Rule and revising its AML laws, Estonia has set a framework that necessitates a detailed approach to transactions and service provider operations. These regulations aim to ensure transaction transparency and combat financial crimes, posing challenges for both regulators and industry participants to navigate this evolving landscape. In this evolving regulatory landscape, any actions taken must be carefully considered for their impact, with a focus on maintaining both security and a positive user experience.</p> Frequently Asked Questions <p>Q1: What is the FATF Travel Rule, and how does it apply in&nbsp;Estonia?</p><p>The FATF Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share transaction data between senders and receivers for transparency. In Estonia, this rule applies to all transactions regardless of their&nbsp;value.</p><p>Q2: Who is considered a VASP under Estonian regulations?</p><p>In Estonia, the definition of a VASP is broad, including crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and any service related to the transfer, exchange, or issuance of virtual currencies.</p><p>Q3: What are the licensing requirements for crypto businesses in&nbsp;Estonia?</p><p>Crypto businesses must obtain a VASP license, meet criteria such as a minimum capital requirement (which varies by service type), and pay a licensing fee, which has been increased to ensure only compliant entities&nbsp;operate.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust. It is a public protocol designed to drive data discoverability and compliance into blockchain while preserving privacy and sovereignty. SHFT is its native token and fuel of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Shyft Network facilitates the transfer of verifiable data between centralized and decentralized ecosystems.

<p>Suppose you’re a growing company. Then you’ve got a growing Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) problem–because that happens when you grow. You’ve probably been using a combination of spreadsheets, emails, checklists, and half-remembered procedures to handle onboarding, offboarding, and compliance audits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then along comes an IAM vendor who pitches their shiny identity provider service: a vision of IAM nirvana with automated provisioning, de-provisioning, and access requests. All you have to do is sign up and push a couple of buttons. (After you pay them, of course.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what the IAM vision looks like:</p>
 
 One Platform, Seamless Control: Manage all your SaaS applications’ identities and access in a single, centralized IAM platform. No more jumping between different tools or spreadsheets. 
 Automated Efficiency: Streamline user access with automated provisioning and de-provisioning across all connected applications. Forget manual tasks and ensure instant access when needed. 
 Cost-Effective Security: Secure your SaaS environment without breaking the bank. Expect transparent pricing for essential IAM features like SCIM/SAML support. 
 
<p>Great vision. But according to the customers we’ve talked to, it’s a mirage.</p>
<p>Here’s what IAM reality looked like once they encountered it:</p>
 
 Fragmented Landscape: Many IAM tools only manage a limited subset of SaaS applications, leaving you with a patchwork of tools and manual processes for the rest. 
 Paywalled Integrations: Access to crucial features like SCIM/SAML often requires upgrading to more expensive tiers with your SaaS providers. 
 Inconsistent Implementation: Even when available, SCIM/SAML implementations can vary significantly between SaaS providers, causing compatibility issues and integration headaches. 
 Manual Mayhem: Unsupported applications force admins to resort to manual workarounds, relying on static documentation and informal communication (emails, Slack, spreadsheets) to manage access, leading to inefficiency and security risks. 
 
<p>So they experience IAMBM – an acronym I just made up for Identity and Access Management Buyer’s Remorse. Automating a chaotic, uncontrolled, disorderly process does not make it harmonious, controlled, or orderly. You replace a messy manual mess with a messy automated mess.</p>
<p>Bill Gates said it right: “The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.”&nbsp;</p>
 Shifting the Paradigm 
<p>Consider orchestration before automation. YeshID’s orchestration lets you capture and organize your tasks in playbooks. As you organize your activities–in one place, with a single source of truth–you can automate when it’s cost-effective, convenient, and technically feasible. You can integrate manual processes, partly automated processes, and completely automated processes using a single interface. Orchestration lets you delegate tasks, follow up, and distribute work without losing visibility and control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orchestration will make your IAM activities transparent, orderly, distributed, and more secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IAM is about people, not just technology. Don’t fall into the automation trap. By empowering your team and focusing on clear, trackable processes, you can achieve secure and efficient access management without the “buyer’s remorse” hangover.</p>

<p>How do we prove who we are in an increasingly digital world?&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of identity has evolved from social constructs to centralized digital profiles defined more by technology companies than individuals themselves. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) aims to put personal ownership back into the equation through emerging solutions centered around distributed ledger technology and cryptography.&nbsp;</p><p>In a conversation that ranged from philosophy to blockchain technology, Lohan Spies discusses how SSI and related innovations might empower youth in developing nations, enable marginalized populations’ participation in regulated economies, and help regenerate land while fighting climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the way, complexities around public/private key management, unintended consequences of new systems, and the excitement of driving real global change through collaboration come clearly into focus.</p> Defining Digital Identity <p>The concept of identity has shifted greatly in the digital age. As Spies explains, "The traditional way for identity was very much a social construct." People associated names and faces and built interpersonal trust through repeated interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet lacked an innate understanding of identity, however; online systems resorted to centralized user profiles attached to email addresses, unique IDs controlled more by service providers than individuals.</p><p>This approach enabled security risks, data breaches, and unilateral account shutdowns without recourse. Spies contrasts these realities with self-sovereign identity "where you have full control and ownership of your identity, meaning nobody can take it away from you." Control and ownership sit right at the crux of the philosophical and practical divide.</p> Realizing the Potential of Self-Sovereign Systems <p>For digital identity solutions to reach their full potential, Spies believes several essential ingredients need to coalesce. "The first thing that's extremely important is that we do have standards and video specifications," he explains, "because that is the one thing that aligns us or not."</p><p>However, Spies cautions against rigid standardization stifling innovation, noting that "some people might have a different view...but ultimately, I think we're going to get to a point where we will diverge into a common understanding of what's acceptable and what's not acceptable."</p><p>This balanced approach allows for experimentation on the fringes by "people that are willing to go through those extremely complicated use cases" while still working towards interoperable frameworks.</p><p>“The hope is...it aligns us,” Spies notes of identity standards while allowing for “people that are willing to go through those extremely complicated use cases” on the fringes.</p><p>Second, spreading access to cryptography and related capabilities helps empower individuals rather than leaving specialized knowledge in the hands of a small subset of people.&nbsp;</p><p></p><blockquote>“We kind of call it democratizing in a way, the concept of cryptography,” Spies explains regarding this drive to distribute understanding and control, “really giving it to everyone to leverage and utilize to their own benefit.”</blockquote><p></p><p>Finally, governance structures need to evolve in tandem with technological ones. From local contexts to national digital identity initiatives spanning public and private entities, multipronged coordination paves the road to real-world adoption.</p><p>The payoff of this coordination could prove immense in daily life for everyone. Imagine crossing borders digitally rather than waiting in queues. Consider accessing regulated financial systems regardless of formal government identification documents. Or think about connecting payments directly, not just to account numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>In the realm of payments, self-sovereign identity could enable direct transactions without relying on intermediary institutions. "I think there's just a natural progression to bring identity and payments closer together," Spies explains.</p><p>Rather than sending money to an account number and routing through banks or payment apps, funds could move directly between verified individuals. The secure digital identities of self-sovereign systems would serve in place of centralized platforms that currently mediate transactions.</p> Use Cases, Obstacles, and Promise <p>If coordinated properly, self-sovereign systems could greatly benefit populations in need across the globe. Spies points to the <a href="https://www.generationunlimited.org/yoma?ref=blog.holochain.org">YOMA project from UNICEF</a>, which empowers youth in developing countries, where he is working to help integrate digital identity technology to increase access to education and employment credentials.</p><p>Other models help shift marginalized groups away from all-cash economies into greater digital inclusion. Environmentally, distributed identity solutions offer promise by securely tracking and verifying sustainability data. Spies details one such application in regenerative agriculture:</p><p></p><blockquote>"From the ground, it's verifiable data...we can make sure that a human or IoT device can be identified and how we can make sure that that data feeds up into the chain of various layers. But we know we can trust the data that originated from the ground."</blockquote><p></p><p>This trusted provenance allows for the creation of what Spies calls "nature certificates," which go beyond traditional carbon credits:</p><p>Of course, obstacles remain in these early days. Complexities of public/private key management persist, though various startups work toward solutions. Mainstream understanding and education around the relevance of self-sovereign systems currently fall short as well. As the internet’s unintended impact shows, we must take care to avoid exclusion where promises of inclusion abound.</p><p>However, with expanding real-world deployment comes cause for optimism. Spies expresses excitement “to see this technology really being adopted, really solving real-world problems.”&nbsp;</p><p>New collaborations between digital identity projects are driving tangible progress in addressing real-world challenges. If holistic human needs and ethical considerations guide developers and adopters alike, efforts like YOMA and Holochain could portend more equitable and empowered societies ahead.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>SAP recently announced the end-of-life of their SAP Identity Management solution in 2027, with an extended maintenance period until 2030. With already being in 2024, this leaves three to at maximum six years for migrating SAP Identity Management to another solution. Three years, if avoiding the extended maintenance period and associated cost (even while the premium is only slightly above the regular maintenance fee), is not long enough for the transition of an IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) solution. In other words: It is time to start planning.</p>
 IAM solutions provided by SAP and the SAP solution approach 
<p>SAP recently <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/preparing-for-sap-identity-management-s-end-of-maintenance-in-2027/ba-p/13596101">proposed a solution approach</a> based on <a href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/cloud-identity-services">SAP Cloud Identity Services</a>. This article has been frequently misinterpreted in saying “SAP endorses a combined solution based on SAP Cloud Identity Services and Microsoft Entra ID”. In fact, it says that SAP will continue its investment in both SAP Cloud Identity Services and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/cloud-iam.html">SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance</a> (Cloud IAG) and “that these enhancements are designed to facilitate integration with other partner identity management solutions, like Microsoft Entra ID, that provide a comprehensive approach to enterprise-wide identity and access scenarios.”</p>
<p>SAP unveils its strategy for the own IAM-related solutions as well as their focus on a flexible integration strategy for scenarios that require IAM capabilities beyond what SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud IAG provide.</p>
<p>SAP Cloud Identity Services are a SaaS solution supporting a good set of IAM capabilities, ranging from Access Management features for authentication and identity federation to SCIM-based provisioning, integrated directory services, and authorization management for Policy-Based Access Management (PBAM). SAP focuses on utilizing open standards, but also on integration to other IAM solutions in the organization. Access Governance features are provided by SAP Cloud IAG, which is primarily focused on the SAP ecosystem and neatly integrates with the SAP Cloud Identity Services.</p>
 Challenges and limitations 
<p>With SAP itself supporting an integration approach with other identity management solutions “that provide a comprehensive approach”, the question is where such expansion and integration is needed. There are two dimensions to look at. One is the breadth and depth of capabilities that are needed versus what is provided by SAP’s own solutions, which needs a thorough requirements analysis. To keep in mind here: Access Governance capabilities are delivered by the “companion product” SAP Cloud IAG, not by SAP Cloud Identity Services.</p>
<p>The other is the breadth and depth of integration to target systems. The focus on SCIM-based provisioning is one important area here. While SCIM is increasingly supported by SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions, SCIM interfaces are very rarely found in legacy on-premises applications.</p>
<p>A simple rule is: The more non-SAP solutions, the more legacy and on-premises integration, and the larger and more complex the organization is, the more likely such integration approach is needed.</p>
<p>Plus: There are several IAM solutions out there that can cover what SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud IAG provide in capabilities. There are options. And some of them provide very powerful, in-depth support even for complex SAP environments.</p>
 Taking a structured approach 
<p>Don’t oversimplify a decision that will impact your IT for the next 10-15 years at least, when taking common lifetimes of IGA solutions. Analyze the options you have thoroughly.</p>
 
 Start with your overall IAM strategy: How will your Identity Fabric of the future look like? 
 Analyze what you have and what (SAP Identity Manager, due to end-of-life) must change 
 Understand what you will need 
 Go into the detailed analysis of requirements 
 Run a thorough tools choice process to find the right solution 
 
<p>For that tools choice process, best practice for an organization that has SAP Identity Manager in place is to have SAP Cloud Identity Services and Cloud IAG as one of the shortlisted options, amongst other IAM solutions. Such process also will allow you to assess combinations such as SAP Cloud Identity Services in combination with Microsoft Entra ID or other enterprise IAM solutions.</p>
<p>In any case: Don’t take it easy. Spend the time for planning and assessing the options you have, to find the right solution for your enterprise. Impacting factors include aspects such as</p>
 
 The current and future SAP landscape versus a multi-vendor strategy for Line-of-Business applications 
 The complexity of the non-SAP application and system landscape in scope of IAM 
 The state of IAM solutions beyond SAP Identity Manager 
 The overall IAM strategy towards a modern Identity Fabric 
 The organizational structure, specifically regarding responsibilities for SAP environments vs. IAM 
 
<p>There is no simple answer to the right approach for replacing SAP Identity Manager. Don’t oversimplify.</p>

<p>Today’s healthcare organizations must address a multitude of high-priority challenges. With competition at an all-time high, healthcare organizations are under pressure to meet patient and member demands for easy, personalized digital experiences. Healthcare providers, workers, and partners are also insisting on seamless digital experiences that streamline their work for greater operational efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the healthcare industry is facing unrelenting cyberattacks that wreak havoc upon patient care, budgets, and business operations. According to the 2024 ForgeRock Breach Report (ForgeRock is now a part of Ping Identity), healthcare systems have remained the number one breach target for over five years.&nbsp; Electronic health records containing personal identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI), such as medical records and patient data, are highly sought after by cybercriminals. Unauthorized access is the root cause of most breaches – emphasizing the dire need for modern digital identity cybersecurity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most healthcare organizations are using <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/iam-modernization.html">legacy systems</a> that weren’t built to deliver personalized experiences and secure access for millions of diverse identity types to on-premises, cloud, and SaaS apps from any device, at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing a modern, HIPAA compliant <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/identity-fundamentals/identity-and-access-management.html">identity and access management (IAM)</a> platform should be on every healthcare leader’s radar. Modern IAM is proven to protect sensitive information and data by drastically reducing cyberattacks. It also improves user experience and engagement, such as removing friction from the authentication process, all while protecting sensitive data against ransomware, fraud, and other cyberattacks. HIPAA-compliant IAM platforms also enable healthcare organizations to meet compliance requirements for regulations such as HIPAA, TEFCA, HITECH, the 21st Century Cures Act, and many more.</p>

				  Learn how some educators are taking advantage of new technologies to provide faster student and employee verification and eliminate redundant paperwork and manual processes.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The Problem</p>
<p>In the US <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/highest-school-enrollment-count.html#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20college%20enrollment%20remained,percentage%20point%20increase%20from%202020">17.3 million students were enrolled in college</a> in 2022, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/184010/school-enrollment-in-public-and-private-institutions-2008/#statisticContainer">17.16 million were enrolled in high school.</a> Each student generates data — such as transcripts of courses taken and grades achieved — all of which will need to be shared and verified over the course of the school year and beyond.</p>
<p>With the growing interest in higher education, colleges in the US received roughly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2023/03/30/college-applications-are-up-dramatically-in-2023/?sh=6b7324349c4d">seven million applications in 2023,</a> each of which requiring a short list of supporting documents.</p>
<p>Student athletes will need documents for sports they participated in, as well as medical paperwork, such as physicals or injury reports, to be on file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gitnux.org/college-housing-statistics/#:~:text=50%25%20of%20college%20students%20in,colleges%20have%20on-campus%20housing">50% of college students who live on campus </a>need an identity and access management system to access dorms, dining halls, labs and libraries.</p>
<p>Each of the <a href="https://educationdata.org/number-of-college-graduates#:~:text=The%20total%20number%20of%20graduates,college%20students%20graduated%20in%202021">4.16 million students who received some level of degree in 2021</a> will need to prove that achievement when they apply for a job and will need to keep supplying that data for many jobs to come.</p>
<p>Employers will want to verify that the degree is real, a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/how-employers-verify-college-degrees#:~:text=This%20type%20of%20check%20is,which%20usually%20incurs%20a%20fee">manual process most often handled by the school records office</a>. This process can take up to <a href="https://clarifacts.com/faqs/education-verification-turnaround-time/#:~:text=Education%20Verification%20Turnaround%20Time&amp;text=The%20normal%20turnaround%20time%20for,or%20state%20and%20federal%20holiday">72 hours</a> unless subject to additional delays such as school holidays, resulting in a lot of work for the school.</p>
<p>Verifying these degrees is not just a “nice to have,” fraudulent degrees and transcripts are estimated to be a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/02/21/how-thousands-of-nurses-got-licensed-with-fake-degrees/?sh=4de695cb5c6d">seven billion-dollar-a-year industry</a> worldwide, with real impact. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/02/21/how-thousands-of-nurses-got-licensed-with-fake-degrees/?sh=4de695cb5c6d">Thousands of nurses</a> have recently been caught practicing using fake or purchased credentials.</p>
<p>What if there was a really simple way of managing all this, so that all this data was portable, held by the student, and instantly and reliably authenticatable?</p>
<p>How decentralized identity can help</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technology is a way to digitize data so that its original source can be cryptographically proven and any attempt to alter it will be caught. It is designed so that a person can hold their own data, locally, on their mobile devices in the form of a verifiable credential. This makes data easy to share directly with other parties, each of whom can verify the authenticity of the data with simple, mobile software. Critically, this system of holding one’s own data, sharing it directly, and verifying it easily means that direct integrations can be avoided (saving money) and third parties are no longer needed as data brokers (simplifying data privacy), — a revolution in data management.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective for an educational institution, paperwork such as grades, transcripts, and diplomas can now be issued to students directly with a verifiable credential. The student or graduate holds their records and shares them with whoever needs the information, such as when signing up for more classes or applying for college or a job.</p>
<p>Similarly, a student’s identity card can be issued as a verifiable credential, meaning educators have a way to verify a student’s identity for access to accounts, buildings, research collections, laboratories, and more. Verifiable credentials can easily be configured with rules to grant and revoke this access and expire upon graduation.</p>
<p>By issuing verifiable credentials for identity and data, an educational institution can remove the need for passwords, locks, key fobs, or access cards, manual checks in the records office, digging through servers, paper documents and more. By issuing degrees through a verifiable credential, any business with the proper verifier agent can immediately know that the information presented to them is trustworthy, removing the need to go back to the school at all.</p>
<p>How Open Badges fit in</p>
<p>Currently, if you want to verify a person’s transcript, diploma, or certificate, you will need to contact whomever issued the transcript or diploma or certificate. This often means contacting them directly.</p>
<p>But what if that issuing party no longer exists? Schools close, businesses go under or become absorbed. Even if the original data exists, it can be time-consuming to track it down.</p>
<p>This is where Open Badges 3.0 comes in. As a type of verifiable credential for storing data about academic achievements, or certifications, an Open Badge credential can be verified without having to directly check in with the institution that issued them, meaning it can essentially “live forever.”</p>
<p>In contrast to earlier versions of the Open Badges format, the badge can be held by its owner and shared directly. Previously, the badge was hosted by a website (with the risk that it, too, could go bust and disappear, taking the credential record with it).</p>
<p>Open badges 3.0 offer a new smart, decentralized way to store transcripts, grades, and diplomas. Even if a school closes, merges with another, or loses the records, the student has a record and can prove what they have accomplished.</p>

 Digital identity pilot implementation to start in Q1 2024: Kick-off with 2,700 citizens from Austria, Romania and Spain to test wallet solution 



<p>Rennes/Munich, March 12, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, is pleased to announce the start of the pilot implementation phase for the EU-wide SOTERIA research project which aims to develop a user-centric, citizen-driven tool to help European citizens manage their personal data.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal of the project is to combine the creation of a digital identity to access online services with a user-friendly platform that allows for secure and easy data management, while increasing citizens’ awareness of their personal data. “SOTERIA is a large scale demonstrator that shows how a digital identity wallet can enable citizens to protect and control their personal data while making access to online services easier than ever before,” says Montaser Awal, Director of Research at IDnow and coordinator of the SOTERIA project.</p>



 E-voting, e-exam, and e-health field tests in three EU countries 



<p>Launched in October 2021, the SOTERIA project is nearing the final pilot implementation and testing phase of the identity wallet solution, which was developed by IDnow and the other SOTERIA partners as part of the project. The wallet will be integrated into the platforms of <a href="https://scytl.com/">SCYTL</a>, <a href="https://ipcenter.international/">IPCenter</a> and <a href="https://www.science.eus/en/institutions/biobizkaia">Biobizkaia Health Research Institute</a> (with the support of <a href="https://infocons.org/">INFOCONS</a> association) in Romania, Austria and Spain, respectively, for use cases in e-voting, e-exam, and e-health.</p>



<p>This month, the three pilot use cases will kick off with field tests consisting of 900 citizens each from Austria, Romania and Spain. For the e-voting and e-exam use cases, participants will authenticate themselves through the SOTERIA app and test the onboarding, which IDnow provides via proven identity verification methods. These include several new security checks developed within the project, reinforcing the fraud detection capability of the solution further. Then the citizens will go through the voting or exam process, and at the end, have the choice to add their voting receipt or their exam results to their wallet. For the e-health trial, citizens will have the possibility to add their health data to their wallet, while choosing the type of data and documents they want to store. This will allow them to have all important health information about themselves in their pockets.</p>



<p>The benefits of this testing phase are twofold: The 2,700 citizens will test the authentication process and the access to an online service with the help of a stored digital identity; while the wallet’s capability to store documents and attributes (e.g., e-voting receipt, e-exam results, e-health data) in the form of verifiable credentials will also be tested. Afterwards, the citizens’ feedback will be analyzed and evaluated by <a href="https://www.audencia.com/en">AUDENCIA</a> and will be used to improve the platform. These findings can then inform the further development of digital identity wallets under the upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS2 (electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) regulation</a>.</p>



<p>Awal adds: “Thanks to the findings in the use cases with citizens, SOTERIA will help strengthen security, privacy, and personal data protection across all layers of the digital economy, and will help pave the way for a trustworthy EU digital environment. We are very proud that the R&amp;D team at IDnow gets to lead this ambitious consortium of 13 European partners. It is testament to our innovative spirit and curiosity that forms part of our DNA at IDnow.”</p>



 



<p>About SOTERIA</p>

  Today, we’re open sourcing Ozone, a tool that lets a team of moderators or curators collaboratively review reports, create labels, and inspect content on the atproto network. Later this week, we’re opening up the ability for users to run their own independent moderation services.

<p>Bluesky was created to put <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">users and communities in control</a> of their social spaces online. The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders. Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">open-sourcing Ozone</a>, our collaborative moderation tool. With Ozone, individuals and teams can work together to review and label content across the network. Later this week, we’re opening up the ability for you to run your own independent moderation services, seamlessly integrated into the Bluesky app. This means that you'll be able to create and subscribe to additional moderation services on top of what Bluesky requires, giving you unprecedented control over your social media experience.</p>
<p>At Bluesky, we’re investing in safety from two angles. First, we've built our own moderation team dedicated to providing around-the-clock coverage to uphold our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a>. Additionally, we recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to moderation — no single company can get online safety right for every country, culture, and community in the world. So we’ve also been building something bigger — an ecosystem of moderation and open-source safety tools that gives communities power to create their own spaces, with their own norms and preferences. Still, using Bluesky feels familiar and intuitive. It's a straightforward app on the surface, but under the hood, we have enabled real innovation and competition in social media by building a new kind of open network.</p>
<p>In designing these moderation services, Bluesky operated by three principles:</p>
 
 Simple and Powerful: Give users a pleasant default experience, with customization options under the hood 
 User Choice: Empower users and communities to develop their own moderation systems 
 Openness: Create an open system that increases trust in the governance of our digital spaces 
 
<p>We first shared our vision for <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a> before Bluesky even had 20,000 users last year. Now, we serve over 5 million users. In this blog post, we’ll dive into how moderation works on the network, where you can choose and customize all the pieces that make up your social media experience.</p>
 Sensible Defaults with User Choice 
<p>In everything we build, we aim to provide a polished user experience with further customization options for those you who want them. When you sign up for Bluesky, you will be subscribed to Bluesky’s built-in moderation service by default. This is similar to how custom feeds work on Bluesky — we’ll show you a couple feeds by default, but you can also create and subscribe to more. Bluesky’s moderation service combines around-the-clock coverage by our team to resolve user reports according to our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a> with several automated moderation systems. This provides a strong foundation for moderation on the app. You can read our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023">2023 Moderation Report</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s vision for moderation is a stackable ecosystem of services. Starting this week, you'll have the power to install filters from independent moderation services, layering them like building blocks on top of the Bluesky app's foundation. This allows you to create a customized experience tailored to your preferences (see example below).</p>

  
  An example moderation service that users can subscribe to.

<p>In the first stage of this week’s rollout, these independent moderation services filters will be available on the desktop version of the app. Soon, they’ll also be available on mobile, so you can shape your social media experience across all platforms.</p>
<p>This hybrid approach is intended to provide a cohesive experience, where our in-house moderation works in conjunction with additional layers customized to each community. The Bluesky app, as an online space that we created and maintain, will always have the foundation of the moderation we provide. Independent moderation services will let you and community builders further customize your own spaces, and open APIs will let developers evolve and innovate on these systems.</p>

  
  Configurable options per label from an example moderation service. 


  
  Example of a post that the moderation service The Chiller has labeled as “rude.”

<p>One team will never be perfect at moderation and curation for the entire world, with its wide variety of contexts, cultures, and preferences. So we’re excited about opening the ecosystem to empower experts, developers, and users with local context to provide their own input that you can additionally subscribe to, on top of Bluesky’s moderation service.</p>
<p>For additional information, read our technical explainer for moderation architecture across the AT Protocol <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/blueskys-moderation-architecture">here</a>.</p>
 How will this all work? 
<p>Here’s what users, moderators, and developers can expect to see this week:</p>
 From a user perspective: 
<p>First and foremost, we want Bluesky to be a great and intuitive experience as soon as you install the app. But if you want to customize your experience, you can easily browse and select from other independent moderation services and subscribe to them in the Bluesky app — as easily as you’d follow another account.</p>
<p>For example, someone could make a moderation service that blocks photos of spiders from Bluesky — let’s call it the Spider Shield. If you get a jump scare from seeing spiders in your otherwise peaceful nature feed, you could install this moderation service and immediately any labeled spider pictures would disappear from your experience.</p>
<p>Moderation services can also accept reports, so if you came across an unlabeled picture of a spider, you could report it to the Spider Shield for review.</p>
 From a moderator perspective: 
<p>If you want to offer a moderation layer on top of what the Bluesky app provides, you can do this without running a lot of infrastructure or building your own client app. We’ve built open source software to simplify the process of running a moderation service. While you need some technical know-how for now, we expect this process to get simpler over time.</p>

  
  Screenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network.

<p>Today, you can already run a mute list or block list that other users can subscribe to. But it often gets tied to your account in a way that makes it hard to delegate responsibility to others. Once you’re running a popular blocklist, that list becomes associated with your account, and users may start directly tagging you in the app. This can get overwhelming at scale.</p>
<p>Ozone, the open source moderation labeling system we’re releasing today, lets you set up a service like a blocklist, but more nuanced — instead of just adding accounts, you can label specific posts too. You will have access to a reporting queue, and users will be able to send reports via the in-app reporting flow. You will be able to set custom labels, and specify what those labels should do. Moderation services will not be tied to individual users, and multiple people can manage them. Tooling designed for teams and communities can help take the burden off individuals and make it possible to run a sustainable moderation service.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, let’s say you’re the creator of the previously mentioned Spider Shield labeler that labels photos of spiders. You can set up an Ozone dashboard that provides a queue of spider pictures that have been reported, reducing the need for people to tag you directly every time they find a new spider picture online. It’s customizable — you could create one kind of label that blocks pictures of real spiders, and one kind of label that blurs out illustrations of spiders. You could recruit others who don’t like spiders to help you manage the reports, and even hand the project off to someone else altogether without disrupting the people who are using it.</p>
 From a developer perspective: 
<p>As a developer, you've got options when it comes to labeling content. You can use our software, like Ozone, or you can apply labels directly through the API. Ozone is built to help humans review moderation reports, but you can also use automated labeling to power your moderation services. Check out Ozone's open-source repo <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to set up Spider Shield as a fully automated service that uses machine learning to find and label spider pictures, you can do that without even touching Ozone, our moderation tool. And if you want to customize Ozone for your own purposes, you can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">submit a PR</a> or fork the project. Our goal in building this open source moderation tooling is to help apps in the AT Protocol ecosystem handle trust &amp; safety challenges without having to start from scratch.</p>
<p>The generic, customizable nature of labels allows you to get creative with them — it would be possible to use labels to “verify” nature accounts that don’t post pictures of spiders, for example. Although the initial functionality of labelers is intended to hide, block, or blur content, it could eventually be used for curation or verification too. We think that the atproto developer ecosystem will find even more ways to use labels and independent moderation services, and will drive innovation in how moderation works on social networks.</p>
<p>Moderation services can work across the entire atproto network, not just the Bluesky app. Imagine if someone creates a new photo-sharing app called Skygram. The Spider Shield moderation service built for Bluesky could easily be used on Skygram too. That's the power of "composable moderation" — all the pieces can be mixed and matched in tons of different ways, even across completely separate apps.</p>
<p>We think it's important for Bluesky to lay the groundwork for a great experience in the app, which is why our moderation service is the default for all Bluesky app users. But we also believe in giving users the freedom to choose and the right to leave. So if Bluesky's moderation doesn’t meet your needs and you want an altogether different experience, you can make that happen. You'll need to build or use a different client app with your own moderation service, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up. However, all content shown in the Bluesky app must adhere to Bluesky’s community guidelines.</p>
 FAQ 
<p>Where can I find the open-sourced Ozone tool?</p>
<p>You can find the GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">here</a>.</p>
<p>Why are you open-sourcing Ozone?</p>
<p>By making Ozone open-source and providing it as a ready-to-use tool for independent moderators on the AT Protocol, we're creating a system that encourages collaboration and transparency. Unlike most social media companies that develop their safety tools in private, Ozone's development will be out in the open. This means that new social apps built on the AT Protocol can benefit from all the improvements made by Bluesky and other organizations. By working together and sharing knowledge, we can create better tools faster and build a social media ecosystem that works for everyone.</p>
<p>How is this different from community moderation on Mastodon?</p>
<p>Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. Our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">post on federation</a> goes into more detail on how Bluesky differs from Mastodon.</p>
<p>What do I need to do to moderate my own community on Bluesky?</p>
<p>All users of Bluesky’s client app are subscribed by default to Bluesky’s moderation. If you would like to run a moderation service that layers on top of these defaults, you can create a new account for that new service and get it up and running with Ozone.</p>
<p>However, if you want to opt out of our defaults, this is still possible — we believe it’s important to give users the right to leave and not lock you in. You would need to use or develop a separate client app that connects to the AT Protocol, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up.</p>
<p>How will running a moderation service be sustainable?</p>
<p>Moderation services, much like feed generators, will likely start off as community-run projects. Just like the 40,000+ custom feeds on Bluesky, or the many Mastodon instances that exist, they may continue to operate as independent projects of individuals or organizations. However, there is also nothing stopping a moderation service from having paid subscribers.</p>

<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is crucial in managing and authenticating users and securing access to organizational resources. IAM involves identifying users in a system and controlling their access to resources by associating user rights and restrictions with the user’s device and established identity. On the other hand, a passwordless authentication method is an advanced user verification method that doesn’t require the user to enter a password. Instead, it uses various other forms of authentication, such as biometrics, hardware tokens, and SMS, significantly reducing the vulnerabilities associated with passwordless technology use.<br>
Incorporating passwordless authentication into IAM establishes a more secure and user-friendly system access method.

Instead of traditional usernames, authentication methods like biometrics, tokens, or SMS are used to authenticate users, which are not susceptible to the same kinds of attacks as passwords.<br>
In a passwordless environment, malicious actors are deprived of the opportunity to get login credentials, exploit weak passwords to gain access, or use stolen passwords for unauthorized access. This fundamentally enhances an organization’s security posture by bypassing the typical risks associated with password-based systems and data breaches.</p>
 Reducing Threats and Enhancing User Experience 
<p>Passwordless IAM augments security and significantly enhances the user’s mobile device and experience. Users no longer need to remember and manage multiple passwords, simplifying the login process. It also alleviates the common issues related to password resets, lockouts, and password management, streamlining user access to systems and applications.<br>
An improved user experience, combined with more secure authentication factors with advanced authentication methods, strengthens the user’s overall security. Users are less likely to adopt insecure practices such as using weak passwords or reusing passwords across multiple services, contributing to the user’s identity in a more secure environment.</p>
 Success Stories and Learnings from Implementations

<p>Over 40% of financial institutions (FIs) are dealing with increased fraud and financial crime, putting more pressure on banks to choose between friction and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quick overview: Conventional KYC methods are becoming obsolete. These outdated approaches demand time-consuming, manual processes that are inefficient for banks and tedious for customers. But the new era of KYC is here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials: Reusable credentials are a revolutionary verification solution where the customer only has to verify themselves once. This cutting-edge technology removes friction from operations and fortifies every touchpoint (in the branch, app, contact center, etc.), ensuring heightened security. With reusable credentials, banks can:</p>



 
 Stop fraud by reducing weak security points 



 Take the pressure off your employee&nbsp; and prevent human error 



 Create a better customer experience with seamless processes at every touch point. 
 



<p>Why this matters: This is the next step in identity verification. There is now a way to have less friction without having to sacrifice security through reusable credentials.<br></p>



<p><a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">👀 See how reusable credentials are reshaping bank operations in our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.”</a>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The big picture: Humans are human, which means we can make mistakes or be taken advantage of by social engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.social-engineer.com/state-of-vishing-report/#:~:text=Social%2DEngineer%27s%202023%20State%20of,%2C%20network%2C%20or%20financial%20breach.">State of Vishing Report</a> found a 10% increase in compromises when the fraudulent caller was a female as opposed to a male caller. Reusable credentials instantly take care of this problem. Your customer will have a hyper-secure, encrypted credential that your employee will request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No guesswork is involved. Your customers and employees know that the account is secure.</p>



 Dive Deeper 



 Why the Traditional KYC Methods Are Not Working 



<p></p>



<p></p>



 The Achilles’ heel of current KYC processes is its temporary nature. 



<p>Once the initial identity verification occurs during account opening, it becomes a one-time, non-reusable process. This leaves day-to-day interactions vulnerable, forcing employees to repeatedly verify customer information through methods susceptible to exploitation, such as:</p>



 
 Security questions 



 Teller judgments on IDs 



 SMS verifications 



 Over-the-phone verification. 
 



<p>Using reusable credentials allows customers to be seamlessly verified at every touch point. No reverification. No room for fraud. Only a seamless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Stop Fraud with Reusable Credentials 



<p>In the continual battle against fraud, where every weak link in security can lead to losses, reusable credentials fortify FIs. Traditional KYC methods are vulnerable to social engineering and create an environment where fraud can thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A FI employee <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/19at82r/call_center_loses_1500_in_provisional_credit_to_a/">shared their story</a> showcasing that humans are unfortunately susceptible to social engineering: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[A] member is claiming he attempted a deposit of $2,900 over the long weekend that was not processed … I thought it was a no-brainer. [The] account was [less than] 45 days old, and aside from the initial $10 deposit to open the account there was no other activity. There’s no way a supervisor would agree to PRCR. And yet, when the ticket came in, there was a comment that the Call Center’s director approved a PRCR of $1,500 “so the member can pay his bills.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sure enough, within an hour, the member pulled $800 out at another ATM. A few hours later, another $200. The next day, about a dozen or so $10 withdrawals from Cash App, and finally another ATM [withdrawal] of $330. [The] account now has less than $15.</p>



<p>Any odds on us seeing this $1,500 coming back to us? [The] call center rep feels bad because she is “normally a really good judge of character.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The problem: Weak points of traditional security measures. Security questions, often easy targets for social engineering, can be guessed or manipulated. Bank tellers, despite their expertise, may struggle to differentiate between authentic and forged IDs. SMS-based verifications, a common practice, can expose customers to phishing attacks.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The solution: Embracing reusable credentials that close vulnerabilities for identity verification. By adopting an approach similar to the success of TSA Precheck in travel, banks can usher in a new era of fraud resistance. They provide a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding, making fraud attempts nearly impossible.</p>



<p>Fraud prevention is not just a reactive measure; it’s a company-wide initiative. Reusable credentials significantly reduce the workload associated with fraud-related projects, allowing financial institutions to reallocate resources.</p>

 Take the Pressure Off Your Employees 



<p>“Tellers are the first line of defense. It’s our job to protect your account. But we aren’t perfect. Just like any sort of defense, we make mistakes or miss things. We are human and are subject to human error.” – A teller talking about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/ag2aiv/bank_tellers_of_reddit_what_security_do_you_guys/">their experience.</a></p>



<p>The heartbeat of any financial institution is its dedicated workforce, tirelessly navigating the delicate balance between service and security. Traditional KYC and identity verification require manual processes and diverse verification methods that put immense pressure on employees to stop fraud while providing a great customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials revolutionize this situation by offering a streamlined solution that alleviates the pressure on bank employees. Employees are freed from repeatedly needing to validate customer information with a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding. This shift enhances operations and empowers employees to focus on delivering excellent customer experience.</p>

 FAQ: Reusable Credentials and Decentralized Identity&nbsp; 



What is the reusable credentials process?




 
 The First Identity Verification A decentralized identity (DI) system verifies a customer’s identity during account creation using robust authentication methods. 
 







 
 Creation of Reusable Credentials: Once the identity is verified, the DI system generates a reusable credential. These credentials are encrypted, making them tamper-proof and incredibly secure. 
 







 
 Customer-Controlled Data: Unlike conventional identity systems where the FIs oversee and store user data, decentralized identity transfers this to the customer. For banks, this translates to customers possessing their credentials securely stored on their devices, offering the convenience of storing and presenting credentials directly within your banking app and interfaces. 
 







 
 Persistent Verification: Reusable credentials stop the need for repetitive verification processes. Whether logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, customers simply present their reusable credentials as irrefutable proof of identity. 
 




What are the benefits for banks to use reusable credentials?
 
 Enhanced Security: Reusable credentials reduce reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud, replacing security questions susceptible to social engineering or SMS-based verifications vulnerable to phishing. 
 



 
 Frictionless Customer Experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for bank customers to enjoy continuous and secure interactions across various touchpoints. 
 




How can banks use reusable credentials to prevent fraud?
 
 The Highest Level of Security: Reusable credentials use advanced cryptographic techniques to make information tamper-proof and nearly eliminate the risk of fraud. 
 



 
 Absolute Proof of Identity: Once a customer’s identity is verified and turned into a reusable credential, it becomes irrefutable proof of their identity, minimizing the risk of social engineering or phishing. 
 



 
 Strengthen Security Points: Reusable credentials limit places where fraudulent activities can occur, minimizing potential attack points found in traditional verification methods. 
 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance, including:</p>



 
 Healthcare 



 Government services 



 Education 



 Farming 



 Mining 



 Travel and hospitality 



 Retail and e-commerce 



 Human resources and employment 
 




<p></p>



<p>Although widespread adoption is still evolving, various pilot programs and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving challenges and improving user experiences across industries.</p>

				  Together, Indicio and SITA are changing how we travel —&nbsp;and in doing so, how we can share and trust data to make the world a better place.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>I’m proud to announce that Indicio’s partnership with SITA is deepening with a <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-takes-the-lead-in-indicio-series-a-funding-round-cementing-a-partnership-delivering-trusted-digital-identity-for-travel/">new and important investment</a> in our company.</p>
<p>Both companies have been on an transformative journey for the past four years: making seamless travel a reality. We have developed new solutions to the challenge of digitizing identity documents; we have set new standards for biometrics, data privacy and protection; we have won some of the most prestigious awards in the digital identity space; and, most of all, we solved one of the most challenging trust problems in the world: how to pre-clear passengers for immigration ahead of their arrival and get them across borders in seconds.</p>
<p>In delivering the world’s first implementation of a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) following ICAO standards, in Aruba in March 2023, we drew a map of the future. It’s a seamless world, where verifiable identity and data makes interacting with each other smoother, faster, and more secure — because we now have genuine confidence that identity and data can be trusted.</p>
<p>For airports and airlines and governments, that future is here, it’s happening right now; we’re implementing it. That is why our partnership with SITA is so exciting. It means global reach at the start of a new era. For travelers, it’s the end of rushing to wait. We’re freeing data to do what it can do when it’s trusted: Speed everything up, make everything simple.</p>
<p>But the technology we developed for the DTC is transformational for every industry, business operation, and service where identity and data need to be authenticated and trusted and where paper-based processes and traditional digital approaches are getting in the way of making things simple, efficient, and fast.</p>
<p>Because we’ve created the most powerful form of digital identity, that power can be used in so many innovative ways, big and small, to create better processes, products, and customer experiences. And because our solutions work on any system, we have an organic way to integrate identity and data across all sectors, creating spectacular new opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p>Travel is leading the way —&nbsp;but we are delivering exciting use cases from agriculture to AI, education to finance that are not far behind. Innovation in one use case feeds innovation in another. Suddenly, a landscape of borders — not just geographic and national — but sector and vertical, can be easily crossed. The digital world created by the internet is open when you can authenticate and trust. This is what we’re doing. And we’re tremendously excited about this investment because it helps to accelerate our development roadmap to deliver these benefits to all.</p>

<p>In partnership with Mastercard Open Banking, with services provided by Finicity, a Mastercard company, Fannie Mae continues to work toward improving access to affordable housing with secure banking-powered technologies, speeding up the application process for lenders and reducing the need for manual document preparation.</p>



<p>In addition to helping lenders validate assets and assess a borrower’s rent payment history and cash flow, <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/desktop-underwriter-desktop-originator/asset-reports?utm_campaign=pte-sf-duenh-202403&amp;utm_source=vanity&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=awa-van-noa-len-o-n&amp;utm_term=len">Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) validation service</a> gives lenders the power to verify a borrowers’ income and employment information using a single 12-month asset report. This digital enhancement is saving lenders time while enhancing the borrower experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Demand for a better mortgage process&nbsp; 



<p>Traditionally, borrowers have been asked to manually collect and share stacks of sensitive income documents with mortgage loan officers, a time-consuming and less secure process that creates inefficiency for both the borrower and the lender.&nbsp;</p>



 A complete digital verification solution for mortgage lenders&nbsp; 



<p>DU provides a digital option that simplifies and removes friction from the application process. When applying for a mortgage, borrowers can access Finicity’s user-friendly <a href="https://www.finicity.com/connect/">Connect</a> consent flow to link their bank accounts, enabling their data to be easily shared with the lender.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With one report from Finicity, DU can help lenders validate a borrower’s asset, income and employment information while simultaneously analyzing cash flow and rent payment history to help approve more potential homeowners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the verifications needed to process a mortgage application can be conducted on the spot, without paperwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fannie Mae’s latest innovation leverages <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Mortgage Verification Service</a> (MVS) from Finicity as a leading report supplier to power the verifications needed to process a mortgage application. &nbsp;</p>



 
 Fannie Mae’s Digital Verification Solution requires an asset report of 12 months or more to run 



 Lenders must request that this feature be <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/form/single-source-activation">turned on</a> 
 



<blockquote><p>“With Desktop Underwriter® (DU®), lenders can now get even more benefits from using a single 12-month asset report. We continue to look for ways to help lenders streamline their validation processes and improve the borrower experience, and this latest enhancement helps them do just that.”&nbsp;</p>Peter Skarnulis, Fannie Mae Vice President, Business Account Management Solutions</blockquote>

When we inspire others to understand and value women's inclusion, we forge a better world.” Needless to say, Ping Identity is both thrilled and honored to inspire inclusivity among our coworkers, peers, and greater network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of what inclusivity means to people at Ping, I spoke with several female team members to get their perspectives on contemporary gender issues. I’m grateful to these women for sharing their hard-won insights learned from working in the tech space.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>In this episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast, host Mathieu Glaude, alongside Hakan Yildiz from <a href="https://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> and Vladimir Simjanoski from <a href="https://www.blokverse.com/">Blokverse</a>, engage in an insightful examination of the intricate world of digital credential protocols, including Aries, OpenID4VC, ISO, and KERI. This episode is a treasure trove of insights on the future of digital identities, focusing on interoperability, privacy, and combating challenges like deepfakes.</p>
<p>The discussion begins by comparing digital credential exchange protocols and their applicability in varying contexts, from government-issued digital identities to private-sector applications. A highlight is the exploration of the architectural models—server-client vs. peer-to-peer—and their impact on the scalability and privacy of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Privacy considerations take center stage, especially concerning surveillance and data-sharing autonomy. The episode also tackles the critical issue of deepfakes, proposing enhanced content authenticity through digital credentials as a solution.</p>
<p>Interoperability emerges as a central theme, with a vision of wallets supporting multiple protocols to facilitate diverse interactions between issuers, holders, and verifiers. This flexibility is seen as key to the widespread adoption of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Mathieu invites listeners to actively participate in shaping the future of digital credential protocols by joining the Trust over IP Foundation’s Credential Exchange Protocol Task Force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast is a must-listen for anyone interested in the future of digital identities and the role of technology in securing and verifying digital credentials.</p>

<p>Startups build ad-hoc IAM systems, a tangled mess of spreadsheets, emails, and memory traces in the brains of the team members. As organizations grow, the tangles grow. Think about it:</p>
 
 When a new hire joins, how easy is it to get them productive? How long does it take until they’ve been given access to everything they need?&nbsp; 
 When it’s time for a compliance audit, do you need to sweat over spreadsheets, check multiple app interfaces, and comb through email chains, hoping you don’t miss something?&nbsp; 
 Is “Shadow IT” growing? When well-meaning employees start using convenient new apps, are they bypassing IT? Or does IT maintain visibility and control without bureaucracy?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Is offboarding easy? When someone leaves, can you quickly cut access to all the apps they used while retaining access to the data they created?&nbsp; 
 
<p>Cheer up! Things will get worse.</p>
<p>As your company grows and your tech stack gets more complex, whatever chaos you had will get worse. Why?</p>
 
 You’re juggling multiple playbooks. One spreadsheet for onboarding, a checklist for audits, a half-remembered process for software requests. 
 Time becomes essential. Onboarding tasks, regular access reviews, or even handling forgotten password resets shouldn’t rely on your memory. 
 Your processes aren’t static. New apps get adopted, rules change, one-off issues reveal cracks in your workflows. Updating your playbooks becomes a time-consuming chore. 
 Your organization changes. New groups appear. Old groups merge. Consultants, temps, and suppliers need access 
 Collaboration is a nightmare. Chasing down other teams to get tasks done, sending reminders, consolidating responses, and hoping they update the results in the right place… it turns your attempted efficiency into another massive time suck. 
 
<p>The YeshID Difference: One Playbook, Total Control</p>
<p>Now imagine this:</p>
 
 Effortless orchestration: A new employee begins, and your centralized YeshID playbook spins into action. Accounts are created, exploiting the best available integrations. For anything without an integration, YeshID creates tasks with clear owners and deadlines. Task reminders? Automatically sent to the right department. You get progress reports, not a growing sense of dread. 
 Compliance is no sweat: Audit looming? YeshID pulls who has access to what and current settings across every supported app, then surveys users and managers to verify who truly needs what access. Reports become accurate and stress-free. 
 Offboarding without the panic: Employee departs, and your playbook cuts off access to integrated apps instantly. It also generates tasks with clear owners for everything else, ensuring no security holes slip through the cracks. 
 A playbook that evolves with you: YeshID is your adaptable IT brain. It leverages your IAM, automates manual steps, sends timely reminders, and handles approvals across teams. Change a process? Update the playbook, and everyone instantly follows the latest version. 
 
<p>Sound too good to be true? Let YeshID be your partner in keeping your identity and access management realm simple, effective, and secure. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Get YeshID Onboard for free</a> and start today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Anonyome Labs team has headed to Washington, D.C., for the biggest credit union advocacy event of the year—the Governmental Affairs Conference, March 3–7, 2024!</p>



<p>If you’re attending the conference in D.C., we invite you to meet with us to learn how to streamline your operations, boost member satisfaction, and stop fraud with the revolutionary verification solution, reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Our sales team will be on hand to explain how reusable credentials are replacing inefficient and risky conventional Know Your Customer (KYC) methods with a frictionless system in which customers only have to verify themselves once.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials leverage ground-breaking decentralized identity and blockchain technology to create a cryptographically protected&nbsp;digital ID that is persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. The same credential ecosystem creates proof of identity for any customer interaction with the credit union.</p>



<p>While planning your visit to D.C. and all of the key sessions and events, why not schedule a one-on-one meeting with the team from Anonyome Labs, where we’ll show you exactly how reusable credentials can work for your institution and, as a bonus, give you access to our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.” This valuable tool will be a great resource to take back home to your credit union team for review.</p>



<p>We are excited to also share that on Day 4 of the conference (March 6), you can catch our team during an exclusive interview with Anonyome Labs’ VP of Sales, Matt Ure, on CU Broadcast Hosted by Mike Lawson.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is proud to be a sponsor of the first America’s Credit Unions GAC, the massive in-person and online event highlighting the meaningful work credit unions do to improve the financial well-being of their members and communities. This year’s program includes keynotes by former U.K. Prime Minister, The Rt Hon Theresa May MP, and renowned actor-humanitarian Gary Sinise.</p>



<p>Don’t miss this important opportunity to advance the credit union industry with the latest innovations and offerings. &nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll find the team from Anonyome Labs in the industry hall of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center every day of the conference, March 3 to 7. Come say hi!</p>



<p><a href="https://promo.sudoplatform.com/americas-credit-unions-gac/">Follow this link to book a meeting on site in D.C.!</a><br><br></p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a> is the leader in proactive identity protection technologies. From verifiable credentials to VPNs and encrypted communications, we leverage our cryptography and blockchain technology expertise to take data privacy and security to the next level. Check out our podcast, <a href="https://privacyfiles.com/">Privacy Files</a>, to hear what your peers and experts are saying about the state of member and consumer privacy in real time.</p>

 Bot detection is essential for identifying nonhuman traffic on websites, mobile apps, and APIs, protecting against threats like account takeovers, transaction abuse, and denial of service attacks. With the bot detection market expected to grow from $667 million in 2023 to $3.6 billion by 2033, at an 18.3% CAGR, according to <a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/bot-security-market">Future Market Insights</a>, the demand for such technologies is rapidly increasing. This growth is driven by the anticipated rise in beneficial bots, such as AI agents and search engine crawlers, and harmful bots, which can cause significant disruptions and fraud. To address these challenges, leading providers are developing advanced solutions beyond traditional firewalls, incorporating behavioral analysis and device risk signals to identify and block malicious bots more effectively. 



 







 Evolving Threats and Modern Defenses Against Bots 



<p>The bot detection solutions market is evolving rapidly to address the growing sophistication of bots and the expansion of threat vectors. Vendors leveraging behavioral signals are well-positioned to dominate a market facing complex challenges from advanced bot activities and diverse threats. As fraudsters employ artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to launch sophisticated bot attacks, solution providers are countering with passive detection methods that emphasize user experience while effectively identifying bots. According to the <a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/bad-bot-report/">Imperva Bad Bot Report</a>, about two-thirds of bots in 2022 were highly sophisticated malicious bots, the highest level ever recorded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern defenses include behavioral biometrics and device signals, moving from traditional firewalls and CAPTCHAs to more subtle, low-friction detection techniques like analyzing mouse movements and keystroke dynamics. The scope of bot detection has broadened from focusing mainly on account takeovers and transaction abuse to addressing emerging threats like programmatic ad fraud, social media fraud, and asset theft in gaming. With the rise of beneficial AI agents, distinguishing between helpful and harmful bots has become paramount, highlighting the importance of sophisticated bot detection solutions that can navigate the nuanced landscape of modern cyber threats.</p>



 The Importance of Bot Detection Across Use Cases 



<p>Bot detection serves multiple use cases, including thwarting and identifying account takeovers, web scraping, transaction abuse, programmatic ad fraud, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, such as:</p>



 
 Account Takeover Protection 



 Web Scraping Detection 



 Transaction Abuse Prevention 



 Programmatic Ad Fraud Detection 



 Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention

 The Urgent Need for Bot Detection 



<p>Businesses across various sectors, particularly the advertising industry, are becoming acutely aware of the financial losses attributed to malicious bot activities. Advertisers’ growing concerns over the legitimacy of website impressions have driven publishers towards adopting bot detection technologies, highlighting a pivotal shift towards ensuring the integrity of digital advertising practices. This awareness has led to an escalated demand for sophisticated bot detection solutions to safeguard against escalating financial threats. The evolution of bots, marked by their sophistication and the diversification of threat vectors beyond traditional attacks like denial of service (DoS) and account takeovers (ATO), has made them a tool for exploitation in more complex fraud schemes. Consequently, the necessity for accurate and authentic web traffic metrics has never been more critical.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kasada.io/2023-state-of-bot-mitigation/">96% of Organizations Faced Financial Losses Due to Bots</a>: Leading to company-wide mandates to reduce the risk of bot attacks such as account takeovers and transaction abuse.&nbsp; 



 $84 Billion in Digital Advertising Fraud: In 2023, <a href="https://www.ana.net/miccontent/show/id/er-tv-may19-whiteops">digital advertising fraud amounted to $84 billion</a> and is projected to escalate to $172 billion by 2028 due to rising bot activity. 



 69% Increase in CTV Bot Fraud: In 2022, bot fraud in Connected TV (CTV) surged, <a href="https://doubleverify.com/newsroom/ctv-ad-fraud-surges-with-a-69-increase-in-bot-fraud-in-2022-and-significant-growth-in-ctv-fraud-schemes">leading to inflated video ad impressions</a>. This rise is part of broader trends in emerging fraud vectors, including programmatic ad fraud and AI-generated fraud on social media. 



 <a href="https://artsci.wustl.edu/ampersand/are-bots-winning-war-control-social-media">Estimated 68% of Twitter Users are Bots</a>: This highlights concerns over first-party fraud risk and misinformation spread, urging social media companies to implement robust bot mitigation strategies. 



 <a href="https://cmosurvey.org/">57% of Marketing Campaign Spending on Digital Channels in 2022</a>: With rapid growth expected, advertisers are emphasizing the need for bot detection to ensure traffic legitimacy. 



 Publishers Moving to First-Party Ad Strategies: Due to Chrome’s cookie deprecation, there’s a heightened demand from publishers for accurate user metrics. 
 



 How Bot Detection Works 



<p>Upon the arrival of website traffic, a web application firewall serves as the first line of defense as traffic progresses through the login flow – detection analysis is informed by passive signals such as mouse and keystroke dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

 Empowering Korea’s Central and Local Governments: Driving Blockchain Innovation in Government Infrastructure <p>Cities worldwide are competing to become hubs for blockchain innovation, and the City of Daegu, South Korea, is among those taking proactive steps to position itself as a leading blockchain city.</p><p>Daegu is spearheading efforts to advance the ABB (Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Big Data) sector, recognized as the key driver of future growth. With a focus on bolstering blockchain technology, Daegu has established a Blockchain Technology Innovation Support Center. The center, launched in December 2023 through a public initiative by the Ministry of Science and ICT, is dedicated to nurturing projects.</p><p>Daegu Embarks on Aergo Blockchain Mainnet</p><p>Venturing into blockchain technology, <a href="https://plus.hankyung.com/apps/newsinside.view?aid=2023112750785&amp;category=&amp;sns=y">Daegu has established public blockchain networks based on Aergo and Avalanche</a>. The goal is to integrate diverse blockchain services onto a single city-level infrastructure, paving the way for the city’s evolution into a comprehensive blockchain city. Setting itself apart from other municipalities, Daegu is prioritizing the creation of blockchain-powered services including:<br>- Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs), <br>- Security Token Offerings(STOs), and <br>- Decentralized Identity Verification(DID)</p><p>In line with this initiative, Aergo Foundation and the City of Daegu are actively fostering the development of Proof-of-Concept cases including intelligent mobility supply chains, electronic prescriptions, and herbal product authenticity certification.</p><p>Rising Trend of Central and Local Governments Embracing Blockchain</p><p>Daegu leads the charge as an increasing number of local governments explore integrating blockchain technology into public services. Municipal authorities are actively exploring blockchain’s potential for administrative tasks like document authentication, public records maintenance, and voting systems. By embracing blockchain, local governments aim to enhance transparency, streamline bureaucratic processes, and elevate the effectiveness of governmental functions.</p><p>Leveraging the experiences from past cases, the Aergo Foundation and its key partners, including Blocko and CCCV, are spearheading efforts to develop more comprehensive and competitive use cases based on the Aergo mainnet. Furthermore, the Aergo Foundation has been actively participating in Korea’s government-led Blockchain Trust Framework(K-BTF). This case further reinforces Aergo’s commitment to establishing a presence in the public blockchain service sector. More details regarding K-BTF will be released&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Previous Aergo and Blocko Cases with the Korean Central and Local Governments</p>  Blockchain Voting: Gyeonggi-do, one of the largest provinces of Korea, implemented a blockchain-based voting system to collect resident input on community projects, resulting in a successful vote with 9,000 participants casting their votes through both online and offline channels. With the increasing interest in blockchain-based voting, we anticipate witnessing the development of more cases in this&nbsp;area.  Blockchain-based real estate administration system(land registry): Blocko implemented a blockchain solution for land registry in South Korea. The system enabled financial bodies to use government data by sharing it on a ledger across Jeju Province. Major Korean banks including Shinhan Financial Group, Korea Exchange Bank, and Korea Development Bank participated in the initiative. The banks conducted all real estate transactions based on the blockchain.  Blockchain-based micropayment: Korea’s central bank, the Bank of Korea, explored blockchain-based micropayment settlement infrastructure. Blocko provided a blockchain system for transaction validation, participant authentication, and wallet management by creating transaction processes and mobile implementations centered around the micropayment solution. The project aimed to assess the efficiency of microtransaction settlements on distributed networks in expediting transaction outputs and reducing&nbsp;costs.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/empowering-koreas-central-and-local-governments-driving-blockchain-innovation-in-government-91730fd4cd7b">Empowering Korea’s Central and Local Governments: Driving Blockchain Innovation in Government…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Hundreds of keynotes and sessions in six tracks are awaiting you. While the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">agenda</a> is already far developed, there still will be some additions. Anyway, time to have a look at the agenda. I did and selected ten favorite sessions from that long list.</p>
<p>In the morning of June 4th, one of the pre-conference sessions is the EIC2024 Decentralized ID Deployment Bootcamp. The first part of it is about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5479/1">Decentralized ID Basics, Trends &amp; Adoption: Strategic Insights Sprint for Executives</a>. Run by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3037">Dominik Beron</a>, CEO of walt.id, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1568">Drs. Jacoba C. Sieders</a>, independent consultant, and me, we will look at where decentralized identity stands and how we expect this to evolve. The session will provide you with the understanding about everything you need to know about decentralized identity for the many other conference sessions around this topic, including eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDI wallet. A great start to the conference and a good reason for travelling in early.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of June 4th, you must not miss the keynote of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3419">Dr. Moritz Heuberger</a>, Advisor to the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community, on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5490">eIDAS 2.0 in Germany: Progress, Impact, Challenges</a>. With the European Parliament just recently voting for eIDAS 2.0, it is now about making it a reality.</p>
<p>Another highlight session on this subject is the panel on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5510/1">Latest on eIDAS Legislation and What it Means for People, Business and Government</a>. Here, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3462">Dr. Rob Brand</a> from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, Dr. Moritz Heuberger, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3453">Vedran Lalic</a>, Head of Office at European Parliament, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3243">Viky Manaila</a>, Trust Services Director at Intesi Group, will look at the eIDAS regulations and its impact.</p>
<p>Another important theme at EIC is what I have named “AIdentity”, the intersection of AI and Identity. One of the sessions you should attend is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/775">Dr. Scott David</a> will lead a panel including <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/368">Joe Andrieu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/709">Joni Brennan</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3447">Wenjing Chu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3515">Lynn Parker Dupree</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3507">Anil John</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2786">Nick Mothershaw</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/626">Drummond Reed</a>. AIdentity is one of the big challenges to address, with digital doubles (or twins) acting on our behalf.</p>
<p>One more session around Decentralized Identity you must not miss is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5590/1">The Wallets we Want</a>. There will be wallets. But will this be the wallets we (the consumers) want? Listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2874">Daniel Goldscheider</a> from the OpenWallet Foundation, Anil John, Technical Director of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3241">Paolo de Rosa</a>, Policy Officer at the European Commission, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3556">Dr. Pramod Varma</a>, CTO of the EkStep Foundation and former Chief Architect of Aadhaar.</p>
<p>The intersection of traditional CIAM and future decentralized identity will be the topic of the panel Panel: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5602/3">Decentralized Identity for Onboarding and CIAM</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1582">Daniel Buchner</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3513">Nick Lambert</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3129">Rob Otto,</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3554">Nick Price</a> will look at how CIAM can benefit from decentralized identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1005">Martin Sandren</a>, IAM Product Lead at IKEA, will talk on June 6th about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5608/2">Passkeys in the Enterprise</a>. This is a talk from practice about passkeys, a means for authenticating to services that is becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Another brilliant speaker is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3401">Emilie van der Lande</a>. She will talk about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5614/1">AI's Shadow Realm: Navigating the Ethical Abyss</a>. Her talk is about the multifaceted ethical, social and technical challenges that emerge as AI systems become increasingly integral to our daily lives.</p>
<p>As many know, I’m an advocate of policy-based access control (PBAC), authorization, and just-in-time access. In the panel <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5615/2">Why Authorization Standardization is Imperative</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/924">Allan Foster</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/675">David Brossard</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/589">Gerry Gebel</a> will talk about standardization for authorization and how to finally deliver on the promise that XACML once held.</p>
<p>While EIC 2024 is at the forefront of the global Identity Management evolution, you will also find a lot of down-to-earth topics on the agenda. One I want to highlight is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5699/2">Best Practices for Resynchronizing AD and Entra ID After Forest Recovery</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3542">Jorge de Almeida Pinto</a> will talk about this. In an age of ever-increasing cyberattacks, we must prepare for disaster. Thus, we must improve our recovery skills.</p>
<p>EIC 2024, as always, stands for both though leadership and best practices. Have a look at the agenda and don’t miss the prime discount – book latest on March 8th to benefit from the special price. EIC, as always, will be a fully hybrid event. If you ever can’t join in Berlin or not for the full four days, you still can join EIC and enjoy the great sessions and speakers.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> There is no such thing as Privacy 
<p>In 1999, the then CEO of Sun Microsystem Scott McNealy famously said, "<a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/sun-on-privacy-get-over-it/">You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it</a>."&nbsp; In 2008, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm">TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson published his bank account details</a> after rubbishing the furore over the loss of 25 million people's personal details on two computer discs and subsequently lost money.&nbsp; Now we have reams of data protection regulations and laws, but was Scott McNealy right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1:&nbsp;An image generated by AI - Is this the future of privacy on the internet?</p>
 What is Privacy? 
<p>Different groups of people and societies consider different aspects of their life to be private. For example, while there has been concern that teenagers don’t appreciate the privacy implications of what they post on social media, a <a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communities-murphy-marwick-2014.pdf">UK study</a> found “…[they] are less disturbed by abstract invasions of privacy by government agencies and corporations than the very real and ever-present experience of trying to negotiate privacy in light of nosy parents.”</p>
<p>In Europe, the notion of privacy developed to counter the way governments had used personal data to identify and oppress individuals during the first half of the twentieth century. This led to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - “<a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/law-reference/european-convention-human-rights-article-8-0#:~:text=1%20Everyone%20has%20the%20right,his%20home%20and%20his%20correspondence.">Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence</a>.”</p>
<p>This legislation was conceived when only governments had the resources to collect and process data about large numbers of people and punched cards were state-of-the-art data processing technology.</p>
 GDPR, Schrems II and EU-US Data Privacy Framework 
<p>EU data protection has evolved over time. In 1995 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31995L0046">EU Directive (EC/95/46)</a> was enacted to enable the free flow of personal information between member states. In 2018 this was superseded by the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a>.&nbsp; In 2020 a law student, Maximilian Schrems, brought a case against Facebook objecting to Facebook transferring his personal data to the US. The so called <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II judgement</a> invalidated the the EU-US Data Protection Shield and led to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework which was <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en">approved by the European Commission on 10th July 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This long running saga revolved around access by the US Government to personal data of EU residents and whether the safeguards around the use of this data were equivalent in the US to those in the EU.&nbsp; So, it was really all about government access.</p>
<p>These regulations have obliged organizations and cloud service providers to adopt complex technical and legal measures to protect the personal data that they hold.</p>
<p>Properly protecting this data is a good thing but does it ensure privacy?&nbsp; Is it any more effective than the toilet brush in Figure 1?</p>
 Data is the New Capital 
<p>The last twenty years have seen a massive explosion in the amount of data that can be collected, stored, and processed.&nbsp; Digital technology and the internet have made this possible and cloud services have made this affordable.&nbsp; Data analytics, Machine Learning and AI, in turn, have made this data extremely valuable.&nbsp; Data is the new capital.</p>
<p>Data has always been a valuable asset. The Rothschild’s family fortune was initially made by arranging to be the first to know the outcome of the battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; Analysis of deaths and disease in the 18th and 19th centuries underpinned financial services such as life insurance and annuities.</p>
<p>Although social media is often cited as the cause of the data explosion, its roots can be traced earlier.</p>
<p>In 1989 a husband-and-wife team set up a <a href="https://www.dunnhumby.com/united-kingdom/">data analytics company</a> in their home in Chiswick in London. Their approach involved understanding how to retain customers by analyzing their shopping behavior—what they referred to as being&nbsp;“voyeurs of the shopping basket.” &nbsp;&nbsp;This led to the development of customer loyalty cards.</p>
<p>The data collected by these cards provide the retailer with a deep insight into the buying habits of their customers. This data helps them to optimize the products stocked in individual stores, to identify premium customers, and, <a href="https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningtimes/target-really-predict-teens-pregnancy-inside-story/3566/">it is claimed</a>, even work out when a customer is pregnant.</p>
<p>At the start of the COVID pandemic, UK supermarkets used this data to identify and offer support to vulnerable customers before the government.</p>
<p>The person using these cards agrees to provide intimate details of their lives in return for some loyalty benefits. For retail customers, these details include dietary habits, indicators of their health problems through the purchase of off-the-shelf medication and their sexual activity.&nbsp; For hospitality cards, the data provides insights into the card holder’s travel, location, preferences, and companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, people can choose to reveal their personal information in return for some rewards and data protection laws obliging the organizations that collect this data to protect it and limit how it is used.</p>
 Anonymity 
<p>While people knowingly disclose some personal data there is also a large amount of data about them that they may not be aware of. &nbsp;For example, the internet contains millions of images of peoples’ faces uploaded to social media, published on news websites, and other open sources.&nbsp; This includes people who may not have been the main subject of a photo but who were in the background.&nbsp; This data can be used by AI facial recognition technology to identify individuals from data that they did not even know existed.&nbsp; Is this fair and if so, how should we use this data?</p>
<p>The firm <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/">Clearview AI</a> has developed a facial recognition system that they claim can help law enforcement to identify suspects, witnesses, and victims.&nbsp; They also claim this technology has helped find child predators, rescue victims, and track down the suspects involved in the Capitol Riots.</p>
<p>These are laudable aims but not every country’s data privacy laws support this approach. In 2022, the UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) fined Clearview AI £7.5M for allegedly unlawfully storing facial images.&nbsp; In November 2023, this fine was overturned in a <a href="https://assets.caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2023/819/ukftt_grc_2023_819.pdf">judgement by the First Tier Tribunal</a>.&nbsp; The ICO is now <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/11/information-commissioner-seeks-permission-to-appeal-clearview-ai-inc-ruling/">seeking permission to appeal</a> this judgement.&nbsp; There are <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2023/decision-austrian-sa-against-clearview-ai-infringements-articles-5-6-9-27_en">similar disputes within the EU</a>.</p>
<p>The Light of Other Days, a&nbsp;2000 science fiction novel&nbsp;written by&nbsp;Stephen Baxter, based on a synopsis by&nbsp;Arthur C. Clarke examines the impact on society of a quantum-based technology that allowed anyone to see and hear what was happening anywhere and at any time. This shattered all normal concepts of privacy. When people realized that they can be observed and can observe others without their knowledge it profoundly changed their behavior. While this allowed the perpetrators of crimes to be correctly identified and politicians’ plots to be uncovered, it altered society in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Today, the internet contains a vast amount of publicly available data about everyone as well as a history of everything they wrote and liked on social media – how will this change us?</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — February 21st to March&nbsp;4th <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we dive into Taiwan’s upcoming digital asset regulations, Russia’s FATF assessment, the US’s legislative push on crypto reporting, and the UK’s steps towards regulating stablecoins and staking services. Join us as we navigate these global shifts in the crypto regulatory landscape.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Shifts <p>Around the globe, countries are revisiting their regulatory stances on cryptocurrencies, marking a period of significant adaptation in response to the digital asset market’s expansion.</p><p>In Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is preparing to present new digital asset regulations by September 2024, focusing on investor protection and market integrity. This move is part of Taiwan’s broader effort to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of digital assets into the traditional financial ecosystem.</p><p>Another major development over the last two weeks came from Russia, as its standing with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has shifted due to perceived gaps in crypto oversight. Reportedly, the FATF’s assessment points to the need for clearer guidelines and definitions within Russia’s regulatory framework to monitor and control digital financial transactions effectively.</p><p>In North America, the United States is witnessing legislative efforts aimed at refining the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related services. Recent proposals challenge existing guidance on financial institutions’ reporting of crypto assets and seek to bolster the Secret Service’s capabilities in investigating crypto-related cybercrimes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UK is advancing towards implementing cryptocurrency regulations, with a focus on stablecoins and staking services.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1761086134405255416?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>These developments highlight a global trend towards recalibrating regulatory frameworks to better accommodate the unique aspects of digital assets. As countries grapple with the complexities of crypto regulation, the outcomes of these efforts will likely shape the future of digital&nbsp;finance.</p> Taiwan Sets September Deadline for Comprehensive Crypto Regulation <p>Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission is gearing up to introduce a draft of new digital asset regulations in September 2024, marking a significant step towards regulating the burgeoning digital asset market. The draft, as outlined by FSC Chairman Huang Tien-mu, aims to bolster market regulation and investor safety amidst concerns over the potential for fraud within the digital currency&nbsp;space.</p><p>The proposed legislation, including the Virtual Asset Management Bill introduced in October, seeks to enhance customer protection and industry oversight, imposing stiff penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Speaking of its possible impact on Taiwan’s crypto ecosystem, clearer regulations may attract more institutional investors, fostering a safer and more stable investment environment. On the downside, stringent measures and the potential for heavy fines could dampen innovation, especially among startups and smaller entities struggling with compliance costs.</p> US House Committee Challenges SEC&nbsp;Guidance <p>The US House Financial Services Committee has shown majority support to repeal the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which mandates financial institutions to list customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets. This guidance, criticized for potentially inflating balance sheets and hindering banks from engaging in digital asset custody, faces opposition for its implications on the sector’s operational dynamics.</p><p>Critics argue that SAB 121 limits traditional financial institutions’ participation in the burgeoning crypto market, especially in the context of the SEC’s approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, predominantly custodied by non-bank entities. On the flip side, proponents of the guidance advocate for its role in clarifying custody responsibilities amid the volatile crypto landscape.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">A Guide to Crypto Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Japan</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-philippines">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the Philippines</a></p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>In the vast expanse of the digital world, we’re drawn back to a place that feels familiar yet has evolved beyond recognition. ‘The Dawn of the DID’ explores the essence of digital identity, akin to survivors returning to a mall not for nostalgia but driven by instinct. Memory of what these spaces used to represent in their lives — safety, identity, community — now demands a new form of navigation. This series delves into decentralized identities (DIDs), a beacon of autonomy and security in the digital age, much like the important places of our past. It’s more than a return; it’s a reinvention of how we define and protect who we are in the interconnected world.</p> <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/basics-and-importance-of-decentralized-identity-56098fd64fe5">Basics and Importance of Decentralized Identity</a> <p>Decentralized identity heralds a significant shift in online personal identity management by prioritizing individual control, thereby enhancing privacy and reducing susceptibility to fraud. By deviating from centralized control models prone to security breaches, it employs blockchain technology to distribute identity data across a secure network, eliminating single points of failure. This not only strengthens privacy through selective information sharing but also streamlines online transactions and interactions by simplifying verification processes. In essence, decentralized identity embodies a transformative approach to digital autonomy, promising a future where individuals can fully manage their digital footprints, marking a crucial step towards realizing a more secure, private, and user-centric digital ecosystem.</p> Blockchain’s Role in Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Blockchain technology is indispensable to decentralized identity systems, acting as a secure and immutable ledger that enhances the integrity and trustworthiness of digital identities. Its distributed nature ensures that identity data is stored across a network, making it resistant to tampering and fraud, thus eliminating reliance on a central authority for verification. This setup not only guarantees the authenticity of each digital identity but also offers users unprecedented control and privacy over their personal information. By facilitating secure, transparent transactions and interactions without compromising user privacy, blockchain is redefining the landscape of digital identity, making it more secure, user-centric, and adaptable to the needs of the digital&nbsp;age.</p> Overview of Ontology’s Ecosystem <p>Ontology’s ecosystem is meticulously crafted to redefine the management and exchange of digital identities and data across the web through a sophisticated multi-chain structure. This innovative platform ensures scalability and robust security for a wide array of applications and services, promoting seamless interoperability across diverse blockchain networks. Central to its design is the emphasis on privacy, user sovereignty, and trust, enabling individuals and organizations to effortlessly create, manage, and leverage digital identities. Ontology’s approach not only champions a decentralized, user-driven internet but also establishes a transparent, secure framework for digital interactions, ushering in a new era for blockchain technology’s role in digital identity and data exchange.</p> Cross-Chain Capabilities <p>Cross-chain capabilities represent a transformative leap in blockchain technology, enabling distinct blockchain networks to communicate and exchange data and value seamlessly. This interoperability is pivotal for developing a comprehensive digital identity framework that is both unified and efficient. By facilitating the transfer of information and assets across various blockchains, cross-chain functionality ensures that digital identities and their associated credentials can be recognized and utilized in a wider array of applications and services. This not only enhances the utility and accessibility of digital identities across different platforms but also significantly contributes to the creation of a more interconnected and interoperable blockchain ecosystem. Through cross-chain capabilities, the vision of a truly decentralized web, where digital identities are portable, secure, and universally accepted, becomes increasingly attainable, marking a crucial step towards achieving a cohesive digital&nbsp;world.</p> Verifiable Credentials Explained <p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are a cornerstone innovation in the realm of digital identity, enabling the secure and privacy-preserving verification of personal credentials. This technology uses cryptographic techniques to provide a tamper-proof layer of security, ensuring that credentials such as academic degrees, professional certifications, and KYC (Know Your Customer) information are authentic and have not been altered. VCs empower individuals by allowing them to prove their qualifications and identity attributes digitally, without the need to reveal excessive personal information. This streamlines various verification processes, making them more efficient and less invasive. For organizations, VCs reduce the risk of fraud, as the credentials can be directly verified against the blockchain, where they are immutably recorded. The adoption of VCs is a significant step forward in creating a more trustworthy and user-friendly digital world, where transactions and interactions are facilitated with ease and confidence.</p> NFTs in Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are revolutionizing the concept of digital identity by offering a unique and secure method to represent and verify online identities and assets. Unlike traditional digital assets, NFTs are unique, with each token having distinct characteristics and ownership records on the blockchain, making them irreplaceable and invaluable for asserting the authenticity and ownership of digital identities and assets. This unique property of NFTs can be harnessed to create digital passports, certificates, or any form of identity verification that requires indisputable proof of authenticity. Furthermore, NFTs can encapsulate user attributes and preferences, enabling personalized and secure interactions in the digital space. By expanding the utility of blockchain technology beyond its conventional applications, NFTs pave the way for innovative approaches to managing digital identities, ensuring a higher level of security, privacy, and control for users in the digital&nbsp;realm.</p> DeFi and Digital Identity Integration <p>The integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) with digital identity systems heralds a significant evolution in how financial transactions and services are conducted. By leveraging verified identity information within DeFi platforms, this integration ensures that financial operations are not only secure but also inherently transparent. It allows for a streamlined approach to accessing financial services, where individuals can utilize their digital identities to prove their credentials, manage assets, and engage in transactions without the traditional barriers imposed by centralized financial institutions. This fusion of DeFi with digital identity not only amplifies the trust and efficiency in financial ecosystems but also opens the door to innovative services tailored to individual needs and histories. Furthermore, it addresses significant concerns such as fraud, identity theft, and privacy, ensuring that individuals have full control over their financial and personal data. As such, the integration of DeFi and digital identity is set to redefine the landscape of financial services, making them more accessible, inclusive, and aligned with the ethos of a decentralized, user-centric digital&nbsp;world.</p> DID and AI: Harnessing Intelligent Identity Management <p>In the emerging AI era, the significance of authenticating human identity becomes paramount. The convergence of Decentralized Identity (DID) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces a future where intelligent identity management systems are essential. This integration not only streamlines identity verification through AI-driven fraud detection and privacy management but also personalizes user interactions via predictive analytics. Such advancements ensure that digital identities are managed with enhanced security and efficiency, marking a pivotal evolution towards safeguarding human identity in the digital domain against sophisticated threats.</p> DID and Real-World Assets: Bridging the Digital-Physical Divide <p>Decentralized Identity (DID) systems are revolutionizing the way we interact with real-world assets through blockchain technology, bridging the gap between digital and physical realms. By enabling the digital representation of physical assets through NFTs or tokenization, DID systems facilitate proof of ownership, provenance tracking, and secure and transparent asset transfers. This digital-physical linkage empowers users with immutable proof of ownership and the ability to seamlessly trade or verify the authenticity of assets ranging from real estate to artwork. As a result, DID systems are not only enhancing the security and efficiency of asset management but also opening up new avenues for investment, trading, and ownership in the digital&nbsp;age.</p> Future Directions in Decentralized Identity <p>The future of decentralized identity (DID) is poised for broad industry adoption, driven by advancements in privacy and cross-chain interoperability, fostering a user-centric and secure ecosystem. This evolution predicts a digital space where users have unparalleled control over their identities, facilitated by seamless, secure data and asset exchanges across blockchain platforms. Ontology’s leadership in providing privacy-focused solutions amplifies DID’s potential to enhance and personalize digital interactions significantly. This shift towards a more inclusive, interconnected, and empowered digital world is indicative of the transformative impact of technological innovation and widespread adoption in the DID landscape.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-dawn-of-the-did-e806e02f56a2">The Dawn of the DID</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In our digital era, presentation, and injection biometric attacks pose an unprecedented threat to the sanctity of identity verification. As we navigate a landscape increasingly dependent on digital transactions, the looming menace of AI-generated deepfakes demands innovative strategies to combat identity fraud. Gartner Analysts Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja affirm this urgency, stating, “Identity verification leaders must understand this emerging threat and take a proactive approach to secure their solutions*.”</p>
<p>*Emerging Tech: The Impact of AI and Deepfakes on Identity Verification – Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja</p>
<p>Presentation attacks, also known as spoofing or imitation attacks, involve attempts to deceive biometric authentication systems using fake biometric samples, such as photos, videos, or other replicas of the genuine user. With the advent of deepfakes, the methods used to detect presentation attacks have become outdated as many deepfake videos are very well created to be presented as a live video, with great rendering of an attacker superimposing their image on a live video.</p>
<p>One way to identify genuine users and prevent presentation attacks, like deepfakes, is through “liveness detection.” Liveness detection helps distinguish between genuine, live individuals and manipulated synthetic representations. Here’s how liveness detection helps identify users:</p>
 
 Dynamic Movement Recognition: Liveness detection systems analyze the dynamic aspects of facial expressions, eye movements, and other micro-expressions that occur naturally in live subjects. 
 Response to Stimuli: Liveness detection may involve prompting the user to perform specific actions or respond to stimuli during verification. 
 3D Depth Analysis: Liveness detection often utilizes advanced techniques like 3D depth analysis. By assessing the three-dimensional aspects of facial features, the system can verify the spatial relationships between different facial elements, making it harder for static images or videos to pass as authentic. 
 Texture and Reflection Analysis: Liveness detection examines surface characteristics such as texture and reflections on the face. Natural skin has unique textures and reflects light in specific ways that may be hard to emulate. 
 
<p>All these technology components have been embedded across various liveness detection engines and have effectively prevented a “Presentation Attack” often used to game the system. Most deepfake attacks happen when an attacker injects a fraudulent video to game the liveness detection engine. There are usually three types of injection attacks that occur:</p>
 
 Virtual H/W Camera Injections: Utilizing a virtual camera instead of a real camera to submit a photo or video. Software like Manycams is used to do this. 
 JavaScript Injections: Utilizing browser console to inject spooﬁng JavaScript code to be run instead of existing one on the webpage 
 Client Server Protocol Injections: A fraudster breaks the data channel between the browser and server or Classic IT infrastructure “Man in the Middle” type of attack. 
 
 Defeating Presentation Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>1Kosmos responds to this challenge with LiveID and LiveID+. LiveID leverages the front-facing camera on the mobile device (selfie camera) and records a video of the user. Once LiveID has determined the user is genuine, through a liveness check, LiveID will capture a “selfie” of the user and use it as a biometric reference for authentication. LiveID+ is an advanced SDK client-side solution. By actively identifying and thwarting injection attacks in real time, LiveID+ sets a new standard for security, offering robust protection against the deceptive tactics of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Adding additional capabilities to LiveID with LiveID+ allows organizations to prevent this growing attack vector. The new client-side SDK will catch injection attacks and not permit any identity proofing or authentication attempt if an injection attack is detected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advent of deepfake technology poses a formidable challenge to identity verification processes. As our digital transactions surge and passwordless biometrics become mainstream, the threat from AI-generated deepfakes will become more pronounced. Liveness detection is a good way of combating presentation attacks. However, the evolution of more sophisticated injection attacks, especially those utilizing injection techniques, necessitates innovative security measures like LiveID and LiveID+.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Setting the stage 
<p>On February 29, 2024, the European Union (EU) Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240223IPR18095/meps-back-plans-for-an-eu-wide-digital-wallet">voted </a>in favor of amendments to the eIDAS regulation, marking a significant milestone on the road to a unified standard for European digital identity services. The regulation, which is expected to enter into force by the end of March upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU, will trigger a series of implementation steps. The countdown begins with a six-month period to finalize the technical specifications of the EU Digital ID Wallet, followed by adjustments based on legal file and experiences in large scale pilots. By 2026, all EU member states are mandated to provide digital wallets to every resident, accessible at no cost for acquisition and usage.</p>
<p>Under the new regulation, citizens and businesses could potentially leverage digital wallets to link various personal attributes securely, including driving licenses, diplomas, and national ID cards. Section 5 of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">Architecture Reference Framework</a> lists the current mandatory, optional, and possible additional attributes that are included in the eIDAS framework.</p>
<p>The implementation of eIDAS promises a secure, privacy-friendly means for individuals to prove their identity and electronically sign documents, fostering access to public and private services across the EU. The removal of virtual borders facilitated by eIDAS is anticipated to deepen the Digital Single Market and foster further integration within the EU. However, the true measure of success lies in ensuring that these principles extend beyond the borders of the EU.</p>
 Bridging boundaries 
<p>Achieving interoperability at various levels is essential, including integration with internal organizational systems and compatibility with other verified identity solutions. To gain widespread adoption, the wallet must provide user-friendliness and work seamlessly across international boundaries. Embracing interoperability as a guiding principle is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for organizations aiming to thrive in an increasingly interconnected digital world.</p>
<p>Moreover, digital identity issuance and applicability should not be limited to a single organization or use case. If a user possesses a verified digital identity, they should have the ability to utilize it across various purposes, with diverse service providers spanning different industries, and even with public institutions. Consequently, solutions need to be adaptable and scalable, offering flexibility to accommodate varying levels of assurance for each use case or process, while also being scalable to meet the evolving demands of interoperability and security.</p>
<p>At EIC 2023, several presentations focused on digital identity in the context of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet. These included presentations that considered how digital wallets can be used in the private sector in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eudi-wallet-eic-2023">EUDI Wallet - Critical Success factors for Digital Single Market and Private Sector Use</a>; how organizations can take advantage of the latest developments in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; Digital Identity Wallet Readiness: What Your Organization Needs to Know About Digital Identity Wallets</a>; and the potential challenges and use cases in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; EU Digital Identity Wallet</a>.</p>
 Maximizing business potential 
<p>In my previous blog post, I delved into some of the challenges posed by the eIDAS regulation and the EU Digital ID Wallet. However, in this post, we will shift our focus to explore the potential business advantages. Moving beyond the regulatory landscape, the business implications of digital identities extend far beyond traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) frameworks. These digital identities serve as enablers for cross-organizational use, offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80803/reusable-verified-identity">reusable</a>, decentralized approaches that improve and expand business processes. In addition, as discussed in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti#heading4">Advisory Note</a>, enterprises have already reached a point where centralized identity management is neither desirable nor possible because existing centralized approaches to identity, authentication, interoperability, and security don't fit and won't scale with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>To ensure adoption and integration within enterprises, the following areas will be addressed by the EU Digital Identity Wallet:</p>
 
 Identity Verification (KYC):&nbsp;The EU Wallet will offer robust identity verification capabilities to streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for organizations. By leveraging secure and efficient verification methods, enterprises can enhance the security and reliability of customer identity verification. 
 Strong User Authentication: Enterprises mandated to implement strong user authentication measures will benefit from the EU Wallet's advanced authentication features. 
 Integration with Major Platforms: The EU Wallet will support authentication on major online platforms, including social networks, search engines, and e-commerce marketplaces. By enabling interoperability with these gatekeeper platforms, enterprises can ensure widespread acceptance of the EU Wallet among users. 
 
<p>Therefore, as organizations navigate the implications of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet, it's imperative to recognize not only the challenges but also the vast array of business opportunities presented. The wallet serves as a central repository for proof of identity and other attributes, streamlining numerous business use cases and offering users unparalleled convenience. In addition, integrating digital wallets with existing IAM systems can streamline onboarding processes for remote workers, saving time and money while increasing security. For partner collaboration, digital identity wallets provide secure access to shared resources and data, promoting trust while ensuring privacy and compliance.</p>
<p>Regardless of their size or industry, enterprises can benefit significantly from adopting digital identity wallet solutions. By embracing these technologies and tailoring their implementation strategies to their specific needs and challenges, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and user satisfaction in today's digital economy.</p>
<p>Find out what identity, cloud, and security industry experts, thought leaders, practitioners, and peers are thinking and doing by joining us at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC 2024</a> taking place in Berlin and online from 4-7 June.  We will be discussing the latest developments and the role that digital identities play in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/mtracks/169">enterprise </a>space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global Impact: How will the EU Digital Identity Wallet affect non-EU residents or businesses operating outside the EU?</p>
<br>The European Digital Identity Wallet should apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Security Concerns: What are the key security challenges, and how does the regulation address them to ensure the protection of user data?</p>
<br>Given that the EU Digital Identity Wallet requires the storage of documents, cryptographic keys, and other sensitive information on mobile platforms, it is vulnerable to various risks, including loss, hardware malfunction, and unauthorized access by hackers and thieves. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of digital wallet data is critical and requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure controlled access for authorized users. Nevertheless, its legal backing and the EU's commitment to neutrality, security and user privacy sets the EU Digital Identity Wallet apart from corporate digital wallets.</blockquote>
