<p>With tensions escalating at the Ukraine-Russia border, Czech Republic officials are planning to ask European Union counterparts to restrict travel for Russians who don’t hold biometric passports, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/czechs-propose-eu-tightens-passport-rules-russians-2022-02-23/">Reuters report</a>.</p>



<p>The proposed restrictions will apply to Russians seeking to enter the Schengen Area, in which travel between the 26 participating states is relatively unrestricted. With Russia’s advance on Ukraine underway, Czech authorities appear to be concerned that bad actors might find their way into the Schengen zone.</p>



<p>Czech Interior Minister Vita Rakusan explained that the country will call on partners in the European Union to mandate that Russian citizens seeking to enter the Schengen Area have biometric passports “so we have clear certainty that the person entering with the passport really is that person.”</p>



<p>The move helps to illustrate the importance of biometric border control, adding a new urgency to its deployment. EU officials had already been planning to implement new entry and exit requirements this year that will require the collection of biometric data from third-party nationals seeking entry to the Schengen Area, with SITA having <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sita-encourages-eu-countries-use-abc-kiosks-achieve-schengen-ees-compliance-020303/">pitched its biometric self-service kiosks</a> as a solution that could help to ensure compliance with the new requirements at airports.</p>



<p>Another biometric technologies vendor, Vision-Box, announced last summer that it was working with Finnish border authorities to implement what it called <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/finland-becomes-schengen-border-pioneer-using-vision-box-biometric-tech-707063/">the first EU Entry/Exit System</a> within the Schengen Area. At the time, Vision-Box VP Jeff Lennon said that the project made Finland – which shares a border with Russia and has fought multiple defensive wars against its neighbour – “the Smart Borders pioneer”. </p>



<p>While urgent concerns over Russian incursion are now offering a dramatic illustration of the importance of biometric border control and biometric passports, the latter have been a growing trend in recent years thanks to their general benefits in helping to secure borders and make the cross-border screening process less burdensome for travelers. In a report issued last summer, Allied Market Research predicted that the global <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-passports-expected-help-drive-125-13-billion-e-passport-market-070703/">biometric e-passport market</a> would see a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 29.5 percent between 2021 and 2028.</p>

<p><a href="https://zwipe.com/">Zwipe</a> is looking to increase its presence in India through a new partnership with sKarn RoboticS. sKarn was only founded in 2019, though it has already caught the eye of Indian administrators and was named as the government’s Global Revolutionary Founder of the Year and the Global Innovative Product of the Year in 2021.</p>



  



<p>The partnership with Zwipe, meanwhile, covers both access control and payment applications. sKarn will order biometric cards from manufacturers that are part of Zwipe’s <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-strengthens-middle-east-position-with-saudi-card-maker-811292/">extensive international</a> <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-teams-up-another-hong-kong-card-manufacturer-042804/">partner</a> <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-adds-mexicos-forzacard-partner-network-7012208/">ecosystem</a>, and then leverage that technology to grow its business in India. The company will release co-branded biometric payment cards, and market biometric access cards to private and public organizations that want to strengthen their security.</p>



<p>On that front, sKarn’s is initially planning to issue a few thousand cards to interested clients during a pilot that will begin in the third quarter of the year. The company will then scale up to a full rollout shortly after, assuming that all goes well with the pilot. sKarn will offer the cards alongside the other products in its WeCript security portfolio.</p>



<p>“Our mission is to provide highly secured digital services that significantly empower end-users with top rated privacy, security and digital experience,” said ‘The Karn’, the Founder and COO of sKarn RoboticS. “Zwipe’s extremely secure biometric payment and access control cards strongly complement our core values and fit perfectly in the WeCript ecosystem.”</p>



<p>“It is great to see an ambitious and fast-moving high-tech security solution provider recognize the value of biometric cards for its customers,” added Zwipe CEO André Løvestam. “We are looking forward to our collaboration with sKarn RoboticS and their customers.”</p>



<p>Zwipe tweaked its biometric payment card technology to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-modifies-biometric-payment-cards-access-control-applications-120101/">support access control applications</a> at the tail end of 2021, and believes that a diverse portfolio will be <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-anticipates-breakthrough-year-2022-010302/">critical to its growth in 2022</a>. The company also selected <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-appoints-mena-gm-teams-with-indias-masterline-74202105/">Masterline as its Strategic Business Partner</a> in India back in April.</p>

<p><a href="https://shuftipro.com/">Shufti Pro</a> has released a new <a href="https://shuftipro.com/resources/whitepapers-reports/global-identity-fraud-report-2021/?utm_source=Press+Release+&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=ID+Fraud+Report+">Global ID Fraud Report</a> that indicates that fraud has continued to climb during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company placed the overall fraud rate at 21 percent in 2020, and that has now jumped another three percent over the course of 2021.</p>



  



<p>According to Shufti Pro, those numbers speak to the growing sophistication of fraudsters, and to the vulnerability of a remote work environment. People are opening roughly 30 percent of the phishing emails that get sent every day, and click on the malware link in that those emails 12 percent of the time. That is a phenomenal rate of return given the sheer volume of phishing fraud, which is why Shufti believes that phishing will be an increasingly popular method of attack for cybercriminals heading into 2022.</p>



<p>Shufti also predicted a spike in identity fraud, and in the use of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/shufti-pro-helps-verify-identities-morpho-labs-crypto-backers-110409/">cryptocurrencies</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/shufti-pro-enables-remote-onboarding-nft-investors-112905/">other virtual assets</a> for money laundering purposes. On that front, the company noted that synthetic IDs, account takeovers, and impersonation were common fraud strategies in 2021, and that millions of dollars were laundered through virtual assets during the past year. Fraudsters are still making counterfeit documents, though those forgeries are now part of a much more complex and multi-pronged identity fraud strategy.</p>



<p>“We are surprised to see the remarkable turn of fraudsters from simple manipulation of identity documents to tech-driven tampering to dodge identity verification,” said Shufti Pro CEO Victor Fredung. “As we move on to 2022, I would advise businesses in every industry to employ robust mechanisms to combat identity thieves and financial criminals.”</p>



<p>The findings in the Shufti Pro report are based on 11 months of identity verification activity. The company is best known for its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/opal-turns-shufti-pro-enable-remote-onboarding-113003/">remote onboarding solution</a>, which uses face and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/shufti-pro-adds-nfc-verification-identity-verification-platform-042301/">document verification</a> to confirm the authenticity of an ID and match it to a selfie of the owner. The solution was <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/shufti-pro-gets-listed-salesforce-appexchange-052108/">listed on the Salesforce AppExchange</a> in May of 2021.</p>

<p><a href="https://hummingbirds.ai/">Hummingbirds AI</a> will be looking to accelerate its business when it makes the trip to next month’s SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas. To that end, the company has revealed that it will be one of 50 finalists pitching angel investors and venture capitalists as part of the <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/pitch/">SXSW Pitch Festival</a> during the first weekend of the event.</p>



  



<p>At the Festival, Hummingbirds will be competing with its GuacamoleID solution in the Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Voice category. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/video-hummingbirds-ai-guacamole-id-connectid-711125/">GuacamoleID</a> is a facial authentication product that officially <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/id-talk-at-ces-protecting-workplace-privacy-with-hummingbirds-ais-nima-shai-gregg-stein/">debuted at CES earlier this year</a>, and provides continuous identity verification for people using devices equipped with a camera.</p>



<p>In that regard, GuacamoleID operates much like any other face-based access control solution, in the sense that it uses facial recognition to ensure that only registered users can gain access to sensitive materials. However, GuacamoleID takes things a step further to provide ongoing identity verification beyond an initial login. The solution will automatically revoke access if it does not recognize the person in front of the screen, and can also monitor the background to thwart any spies that might try to look over a legitimate user’s shoulder. In those cases, the platform will similarly pull access if an unfamiliar face enters the camera’s field of vision.</p>



<p>The SXSW Pitch Festival will kick off on March 12 and wrap up with an Awards Ceremony on Sunday, March 13. The winning startups in each of the 10 categories will be announced at that time, while one of those winners will be declared Best in Show for the entire event. The 50 finalists (five in each category) for the 14th annual Pitch Festival were selected from an applicant pool of 655 total companies.</p>



<p>Hummingbirds noted that the majority (82 percent) of Pitch Festival participants have secured funding, while 17 percent would go on to be acquired by a tech giant like Apple or Google. Smart Eye Technology has also released a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-app-stops-people-spying-on-your-screen-083105/">document sharing app that hides the screen</a> if it notices a potential snoop.</p>

<p>Clearview AI is trying to become a more permanent fixture of the US law enforcement landscape, its CEO has revealed in an interview with Reuters. The embattled company is specifically targeting the federal government, and wants to convert some of its trial contracts into more long-term arrangements with various agencies.</p>



  



<p>As it stands, Clearview has already inked deals with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/gao-finds-broad-support-facial-recognition-clearview-ai-among-federal-agencies-082701/">at least a dozen federal agencies</a>, including the FBI and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ice-contracts-use-clearviews-controversial-biometric-tech-081706/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a>. However, most of those deals are only <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-gets-air-force-contract-research-ar-glasses-020704/">worth five or six figures</a>, and the company believes that it has an opportunity to turn those into more long-term seven or eight-figure contracts in 2022.</p>



<p>According to Clearview, its interest in government clients is a key part of its broader growth strategy. The company currently has a staff of about 50, but wants to bring on 18 more employees in the next 12 months. Five of those 18 are expected to be engineers who will help to refine Clearview’s controversial AI technologies.</p>



<p>On that front, Clearview also revealed that Terrence Liu is now serving as the company’s Vice President of Research. Liu joined the company in 2021 following a stint at Bloomberg LP, and placed his name on a new patent application alongside CEO Hoan Ton-That. Thus far, Clearview has opted not to disclose the names of any employees other than the CEO, so the news of Liu’s involvement could indicate that the company is looking to take a more public-facing position.</p>



<p>The patent application, meanwhile, details a more streamlined process for the training of facial recognition algorithms. Clearview is planning to use the technology to lower the cost of facial recognition searches (processing costs are already down 95 percent since 2018), and to improve its accuracy over time. For example, Clearview adds distortion to some images to teach its algorithm to work through the effect, and it eventually wants to be able to generate aged up (and aged down) images so people can be matched to younger and older photos of themselves.</p>



<p>Of course, Clearview’s ambitions could still be hampered by its ongoing legal struggles. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/canadian-provinces-issue-further-injunctions-against-clearview-ai-121504/">Several countries</a> have ruled that the company’s invasive data collection practices <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/france-becomes-latest-country-censure-clearview-ai-privacy-violations-010305/">violate their respective privacy laws</a>, and the company is facing a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/plaintiff-bipa-lawsuit-against-clearview-ai-wants-data-destroyed-041302/">similar battle in the United States</a>. The company has pressed on despite those setbacks, and has largely ignored any rulings that attempt to limit the scope of its activities. In that regard, the company’s pitch deck claims that it will have <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-leaked-pitch-deck-biometrics-expansion-plans-502182/">100 billion images in its database</a> before the end of the year.</p>

				  12月にハイパーレジャー東京ミートアップイベントに、インディシオが招待され、プレゼンテーションさせて頂きました。その時の要約をこちらに記します。  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Trussted Data Ecosystemの仕組み　</p>
<p>この図式にあるように、Trussted Data Ecosystemは、</p>
<p>シームレスで効率的なデータエクスチェンジシステムです。Issuer, Credential Holder, Credential Verifierを含みます。どうして私たちがこのようなシステムを構築しているかというと、現在存在しているデータモデルは、信頼できないシステムだからです。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>インディシオがTrussted Data Ecosystemに取り組んでいる背景：アナログからデジタルへの歴史</p>
<p>＜紀元前3200年前から1964年まで＞私たちはアナログの世界で書類を郵送したり、持ち運んだりして書類をエクスチェンジしてました。</p>
<p>Notarity (公証人) から封を閉じられたスタンプ付きの封筒や郵便局で登録された書類など、持ってきた人がポケットに入ってた封筒を手渡したりしてきましたね。</p>
<p>＜1964年からこれまで＞信頼できる効率化されたプライバシーが保護されたハイブリットな世界が出来上がりましたが、便利になった分、たくさんの信頼を犠牲にしました。書類をスキャンしてアップロードしたり、デジタル化されたドキュメントやデータをEメールするようになり、効率は高まりましたが、トラストやプライバシーを失いました。Eメールを受け取ったり送ったりすることで中央集権型となり、便利にはなりましたが、送信や受信したEメールは、信頼やプライバシーを失いました。</p>
<p>＜Decentralized Idneity（分散型ID）の世界＞このような三つの要因　Trust, Efficiency, Privacyをオプティマイズすることで、効率を最大限にし、データエクスチェンジの際、分散型IDを利用することで、プライバシーを保護することが可能となりました。</p>
<p>アナログ vs. デジタル：プラスチックでできている免許証は、もし偽造された場合、もし例えば、プラスティックの免許証の一部の加工の仕方が一般に目にするものと違っていたり、都道府県が表記されていなかったりすると、これは偽物じゃないかと思うかと思います。このように、アナログの世界では物理的な変化があるとこのデータが本物か偽物かが判断できます。これが、デジタルの世界になると、デジタルIDが本物か偽物かどうかを判断するのには、物理的なプラスティックなカードではなくなるので、わかりにくくなりますが、Decentralized ID分散型IDの世界だとわかります。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>信頼性のあるモデル</p>
<p>信頼性はTrustedモデル（信頼性のあるモデル）に存在しています。こちらの図式にありますのが、Trustモデルのガバナンス（ステークホルダーとの信頼関係を築くための管理体制）です。</p>
<p>このガバナンスは、二つのフォームによって成り立っています。一つは、コードで書かれた暗号化された信頼と、署名を読み取りに行ったり、本当の情報を読みに行ったりします。</p>
<p>もう一つは、哲学的な信頼です。この図の右にあるお店のオーナーが、データが送られてくる機関または業者が、どの信頼できる機関であるかどうかを選んで決めさえすれば、このガバナンス内で、信頼されたデータを受け取ることができます。</p>
<p>データを受け取った時に、データが信頼された機関から送られてきたかどうか、このガバナンスで、Machine Reachableなやり方で実行されます。そして、お店のオーナーは、送られてきた情報が、信頼できる情報かどうかを判断します。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>＜ビルディングブロック＞　＊図式は、Cardeaプロジェクトで使われた説明図です。</p>
<p>インディシオで世界中のクライアントに使っているビルディングブロックは、オープンソースのものですので、全く同じものが誰にでもアクセスできます。一番下の部分にあるブロックにイミュータブルデータ（作成後にその状態を変えることのできないデータ）のブロックがあります。このブロックは、Issuer（発行者）のDecentralized Identifier(DID)が保存するためにあります。スキーマは、違った参加者の間で共有されるかもしれません。クレデンシャルの定義、基本的には、それぞれのフィールドのパブリックキーとなるものが、それぞれの Issuer（発行者）によって署名されます。レボケーション(取り消し)レジストリー情報は、最終的な確認を常に最新情報としてアップデートされています。テールファイルに続いているアキュムレーターやデルタ、これらの四つの基盤となるデータがパブリックレジャーに書かれます。これらの四つの基本となるデータが全体のシステムをサポートしています。またインディシオは、私たち自身でネットワークを運営しています。テストネット、デモネット、プロダクションネットワークです。ハイパーレジャーINDYベースのネットワークの中でも一番大きなネットワークです。５つの大陸に跨って、25のノードオペレータがいます。ノードオペレータは、ソフトウエアをアップデートしたり、プレミアムコードを書いたりしています。デモネットは、ネットワーク上でテストする方々のためにあります。そして、メインネットは、プロダクションユースケースのためです。他のネットワークとのやりとりは、世界中で行われており、ヨーロッパや、アメリカ、その他様々なところで使われております。顧客の様々な機能のタイプによって、例えば、政府によっては自身のプライベートネットワークが必要となり、決められた範囲内に情報が置かれていないといけない場合もありますし、その場合は、それぞれの地域で法律が違うので世界のネットワークでの運営は避けています。</p>
<p>このVerifiable Credentialの技術で面白い点は、Verifiable Credential が扱うデータ、PIIはパブリックレジャーに残らないことです。エンドユーザーがコントロールしています。そのためにプライバシーが守られているデザインで、コンプライアンスも保護されています。レジャーが使われるのは、データが正確なものかどうかを確かめるためだけに使われます。IDを発行したIssuerから署名されており、他の誰からも署名されてないのを確認されて、Holderに届きます。そして、誰か信用している人から署名されていることを確認します。Holderのウォレット（お財布）の中あるデータは、すでに同意されたものが保護されたまま、やりとりされます。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>＜クリプトグラフィー暗号について＞</p>
<p>ハイパーレジャーインディのエコシステム上で走っています。どのような暗号法による計算によって、実際に証明書が発行されているか、クリプトグラファーが１４３ものステップを一つ一つ説明してくれました。もしこのクリプトグラフィーに興味があって、詳細を見たい方、オンラインで、ドキュメンテーションが見れます。Issuerは、暗号ツールを使って署名したり、DIDやパブリックキーを使ったり、またはパブリックキーと同じようなものを使って、レジャーにおきます。署名されてきちんと処理された証明書がIssuerそしてHolderに届くように承認します。 ハイパーレジャーで使われている、ZKPスタイル、zero knowledge proofの仕組みによって、エンドユーザは、選別的情報開示またはpredicate proofs述語証明と呼ばれるやり方で、一部のフィールドを見えないようにしたり、または選んだフィールドだけを見えるようにした証明書を提示できます。例えば、年齢が18歳以上という規定があり、年齢が18歳以上かどうかだけを確認する場合は、体重や住所は必要ない情報ですので、開示する必要がないですよね。こういった必要な情報だけを開示する設定ができます。これらは、クリプトグラフィーの中でも重要な部分で、Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature / CL signature と呼ばれる署名スタイルです。</p>
<p>Verifierは、ほとんどの情報をキャッシュできることです。空港の中など、インターネットのアクセスが限られている場所が多いと思います。Wifiのコネクションが悪いところでも、HolderとVerifierとまだやりとりできます。</p>
<p>＜Cardeaプロジェクト＞</p>
<p>病院などのメディカルIssuerがデータをHolderに渡し、そして、Holderは政府や航空会社の人たちに、空港などでワクチン接種の証明書や、PCR検査の結果などを見せます。みなさんはご存知かと思いますが、こういった状況の中では、いつも政府と医療関係者やそのコミュニティがうまく一緒に調和できるとは限らないんですよね。ですので、こういった状況では大変便利なツール・技術となります。なぜなら直接、政府と医療関係のシステムをインテグレーション しなくても、プライバシーを保護しながらデータを受け渡しできるからです。</p>
<p>私たちのクライアントの中には、ヨーロッパの顧客が多いです。彼らは、GDPRのレギュレーションの中で、ビジネスをしている会社ですので、プライバシー保護法には非常に敏感でPIIパーソナルデータの扱いに気をつけています。GDPRの違反で、多大な罰金を払っている会社の記事を新聞などでご覧になったかと思います。Verifierが、ビジネスに必要な扱わなければならない情報だけを扱うことで、コーポレーションにおいてはリーガルチーム、法務部やエグゼクティブにはかなり助かるツールなんですね。重要なのは、技術的な部分とビジネスやそのオペレーションの部分のバランスを取りながら、ソリューションを築いていくことです。それぞれの会社にとって、ビジネスチーム、リーガルチーム、マーケティングチーム全ての部署の人たちがハッピーに満足できるように進めていくことで、満足いく結果が生まれます。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>＜コードアーキテクチャ＞</p>
<p>基盤となるライブラリは前までは、ハイパーレジャーインディだけだったのですが、今はハイパーレジャーUrsaと分裂しました。なぜなら他のいくつものプロジェクトとも共有できるようになったからです。クリプトグラフィ・ライブラリに様々な面白いオプションができて、クリプトグラフィック暗号Suiteが可能になったからです。今では中国のアルゴリズムも含まれています。一部の方々は、どうしてユニバーサルに信頼されていないアルゴリズムを含まなければいけないんだろう、と思われる方がいるかと思います。けれども、クリプトグラフィックライブラリの違ったコンポーネントは、一部の国や地域にそったレギュレーションの必要条件に合わせなければなりません。ハイパーレジャーインディプロジェクトでは、cl signaturesに集中していたのですが、新しいシグネチャスタイルが査定されて、cryptographic suiteに付け加えられました。シンプルなシグネチャも付け加えられました。新しいsignatureスタイルは、シンプルな署名も扱えます。Jason LD　Signatureでパッケージを署名することで、全てのデータを明らかにすることができます。フィールドは５つしかないのですが。ZKPスタイルのSignature署名は、意味がないのかもしれません。</p>
<p>そして、BBS　Plusというのも査定されました。新しい署名タイプで、ハイパーレジャーウルサのライブラリに付け加えられました。これらはレイヤーが上の部分を利用することができます。</p>
<p>この左側にある緑の部分にあたる部分ですが、レジャーそのものを形作ってます。現在、コンセンサスアルゴリズム　インディプレナムコード、これはPBFT (practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) ビザンチン障害耐性をもつ分散合意アルゴリズムの 1 つです。</p>
<p>レジャーを常にシンクさせています。そうすることで、みんながレジャーに何が書かれているかを同意することができ、変更できません。</p>
<p>インディノードは、トランザクションを受け取るところで、トランザクションをレジャーから査定したり、書いたり、読んだりまたは誰か使う必要がある人に戻したりするところです。</p>
<p>ハイパーレジャープラグインもあります。実験的なトークンのプラグインです。例えば、ネットワーク上でトークンを使って、トークンネットワークフィまたはバリューエクスチェンジの他のタイプを試したりします。</p>
<p>これらのプラグインは、みなさんがノードやプレナムコードを強制的に変化させたりすることなく、ネットワークの機能を延長させることができます。</p>
<p>右側の部分をみてみましょう。これらはノードコードの若干上にありまして、アプリケーションに書き込むようにしています。</p>
<p>indie resolver は、DIDが基本的なアドレスです。DIDメソッドを用いて、解明します。そして、ある情報を取りにいくのに、どこのレジャーにいけば良いかなどです。</p>
<p>Resolverの上にあるSDKは、エージェントコードより簡単で、エージェントコードがその上にあります。典型的なエージェントコードは、AriesAgentです。クラウドエージェントパイソンまたはACA-Py(Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python)また、Biフォールドプロジェクトは、このAries Framework Javascriptの上にあります。</p>
<p>他の違ったフレームワークもGoやJAVAにもあります。全てインターオペラブルに使われています。なぜなら同じプロトコルとスタンダードを維持しているからで、エンタープライズやモバイルアプリがそれぞれ一番上にありまして、コミュニティによってカスタマイズされています。IndiesやAries　Ursaを使ってみたい方、是非この図の上から初めてください。この図のしたから始めないでくださいね。すでにあるエージェントを使ったり、コードやサンプルを今いらっしゃる業界の必要に応じて修正したら良いです。</p>
<p>プレゼンテーション後、たくさんの良い質問を頂きました。中でも皆さんが気にされていたのは、ゼロ知識証明に関することだと思いました。質問は、「ゼロ知識証明は既に社会実装可能な技術でしょうか。技術的困難は残されていますか。」でした。ゼロ知識証明は、すでに実装されています。技術的な詳細も公開されています。新しい署名スタイルができれば、リビューされたり、実行したりできます。ですから、技術は使用可能な状態ですので、開発を遅らせる必要はないです</p>
<p>もし詳細など、御質問等などございましたら、兼原麻弥 maya@indicio.techまで直接、お気軽にご連絡ください。</p>

  “Our strong year reflects the continued shift towards the critical adoption of digital environments where businesses are adapting to meet their users online.” – Mike Tuchen, CEO, Onfido.  



  



<p><a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> has issued its latest business update, illustrating an acceleration in the identity verification specialist’s momentum over the last year.</p>



<p>Calling 2021 “a breakthrough year”, the company said that revenues were up 90 percent year-over-year, exceeding $100 million. In the United States market in particular, Onfido saw year-over-year growth of 134 percent.</p>



<p>The numbers reflect the broad and intensifying demand for remote onboarding and authentication solutions, a trend that has led to booming business for leading vendors of biometric solutions, particularly those that revolve around selfie-based facial recognition. For its part, Onfido said that its platform had processed over 100 million identity checks in September, and that this number had increased by 50 percent five months later.</p>



<p>Accordingly, Onfido has boosted its workforce by 50 percent over the past year, bringing it to a staff of 600.</p>



<p>Onfido’s update depicts strong momentum even after the company delivered <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-saw-serious-growth-amid-2020s-selfie-biometrics-boom-702031/">impressive year-end results for 2020</a>, when Onfido saw increased Annual Recurring Revenue by 82 percent and grew its workforce by 38 percent compared to the year before.</p>



<p>“Our strong year reflects the continued shift towards the critical adoption of digital environments where businesses are adapting to meet their users online,” explained <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-onfido-ceo-to-lead-next-growth-phase-for-selfie-biometrics-specialist-911111/">Onfido CEO Mike Tuchen</a>. “With $56bn lost to identity theft in 2020 alone, a fast, simple and secure online journey is imperative when it comes to building customer trust, which is why we are continuing to invest in our workforce, technology, research and development.”</p>



<p>The company’s update also highlighted a number of important business developments from 2021, including Onfido’s acquisition of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-acquires-biometrics-pioneer-eyn-reports-q3-growth-710261/">acoustic liveness pioneer EYN</a>, its launch of the new Face Authenticate solution, and the appointments of several experienced individuals to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-names-silicon-valley-vet-as-chief-marketing-officer-712021/">executive and board roles</a>.</p>



<p>Onfido’s momentum appears to be going strong into 2022, with the company having recently announced that its technology is now being used to verify individuals using India’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/indian-dating-site-uses-onfido-confirm-customer-identities-021503/">Jeevansathi dating platform</a>.</p>



<p>Further analysis of the ongoing ascent of selfie-based onboarding and authentication, meanwhile, can be found in the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/face-biometrics-privacy-and-finance-download-the-19th-annual-findbiometrics-year-in-review-report/">2021 FindBiometrics Year in Review Report</a>.</p>

<p>Art in a decentralized world.&nbsp;</p>



 The rise of NFTs.&nbsp; 



<p>NFTs are by far one of the hottest topics at the moment. In March 2021 artist Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, sold one of his artworks as NFT at the auction house Christies for 69 million USD. The sale made him one of the top three most valuable living artists. Less than a year later, the leading NFT marketplace OpenSea kicked off the year with a NFT trading volume of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-monthly-volumes-top-5b-as-nfts-continue-to-mainstream">more than </a>5 Billion USD in January 2022. This equals the volume of the whole of 2021. Ever since, it’s fair to say that NFTs are out of the niche. Is this the future of art? Maybe – but what’s for sure is that NFTs are here to stay.&nbsp;</p>



 What are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)?&nbsp; 



<p>NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens are non-interchangeable tokens stored on a blockchain or other form of distributed ledger. The tokens can represent any form or data, from a picture or video to a digital asset in a video game. Due to their unique non-interchangeable traits, NFTs are often compared to traditional collectibles, like playing cards or artworks – just with the difference of being fully digital.&nbsp;</p>



 How are NFTs different from cryptocurrencies?&nbsp; 



<p>Unlike NFTs, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">cryptocurrencies</a> are fungible, meaning that every unit is the same. Like with traditional FIAT currencies like EUR, USD and GBP, every monetary unit is equal and interchangeable. In practice, NFTs are usually purchased with cryptocurrencies, like Ether (ETH) or Solana (SOL). In other words, NFTs are the good you are buying, while crypto is the mean to pay for it.&nbsp;</p>



 Where can I buy NFTs, and how are they stored?&nbsp; 



<p>There are many dedicated NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea, Rarible or Nifty Gateway. In addition, some projects, such as Axie Infinity, NBA Top Shot or Sorare have their own marketplace and sometimes even their own cryptocurrency. In addition, many of the established crypto exchanges like Coinbase or Binance are expanding into NFT trading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some marketplaces also allow you to store NFTs, they are typically stored in a personal wallet. The most popular wallet for storing NFTs is MetaMask. After purchasing a NFT on a marketplace, the token can be transferred to your personal wallet for storage.&nbsp;</p>



 Notable NFT projects.&nbsp; 



<p>Even though the NFT trend is still fairly new, there is already thousands of projects out there. Here are a few projects worth watching.&nbsp;</p>



 



Project nameDescription<a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">Crypto Kitties</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect and breed unique kittens. One of the first NFT projects with significant traction.<br><a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks">Crypto Punks</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect unique punk-themed avatars. Popular as Twitter profile picture.<br><a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a><br>Collect unique and evolve ape-themed avatars. Popular as Twitter profile picture.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect and battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><a href="https://sorare.com/">Sorare</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect digital cards of football players. Over 200 officially licensed clubs.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://nbatopshot.com/">NBA Top Shot</a>&nbsp;<br>Collectible short video clips from the NBA basketball league.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924">Beeple</a>&nbsp;<br>In March 2021 artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, sold one of his artworks as NFT at the auction house Christies. The sale made him one of the top three most valuable living artists.<br>



 



 Fine art – a long history of money laundering.&nbsp; 



<p>Long before NFTs existed, fine art has been used as a store of value, and with that comes a long history of money laundering. Unlike with other assets, like stocks or gold, the value of an artwork is highly subjective to the viewer or owner. Popular paintings are often valued in the double-digit millions with the most famous artworks, like the <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6110563">Salvator Mundi by Leonardo da Vinci, being last sold for more than 450 million USD</a>. Therefore, artworks, mostly paintings, are perfect for storing, moving and exchanging large amounts of value in a very compact form. In consequence, paintings and other artworks have a long history of smuggling and money laundering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February 2022, the United States Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a “<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury_Study_WoA.pdf">Study of the Facilitation of Money Laundering and Terror Finance Through the Trade in Works of Art</a>”. The report showcases the risk of money laundering through art trade being bigger than ever.&nbsp;</p>



 Why NFTs are attractive for money laundering. 



<p>NFTs essentially are digital artworks and therefore have the same traits as conventional art. In addition, NFTs come with the benefit of being fully digital, making them much easier to trade compared to moving physical art. Like with cryptocurrencies, a NFT can be transferred from one wallet or owner to another within seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the trait that makes NFTs particularly attractive for money laundering purposes are the volatile prices. While the exchange rate of Bitcoin to EUR follows the market principles of supply and demand, the prices of NFTs are highly speculative. In practice, a NFT that was just bought for 1 EUR can be sold for 1 million EUR the next day. This makes NFTs attractive for laundering black money through legitimate transactions. </p>



<p>While blockchains allow to trace these transactions between wallets, without a KYC of the wallet holder, it’s easier than ever to anonymously transfer value. For these reasons and according to the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) the “<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury_Study_WoA.pdf">Emerging Digital Art Market</a>” presents an immense threat for potential money laundering and financial crime.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC in a decentralized world.&nbsp; 



<p>Like with crypto exchanges a few years ago, most NFT marketplaces are not requiring a KYC from their users. For the same reasons as for crypto, buying and trading NFTs on platforms without a KYC process can be <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">an immense risk for both users and platform operators</a> alike.&nbsp;</p>



 What regulation are NFTs falling under. 



<p>Most national regulators just caught up with regulating cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH). For example, the EU with the implementation of the AMLD 5 extended the coverage of their AML regulations to include cryptocurrencies. However, due to NFTs being cryptographic yet different because of their non-fungible traits, they are not necessarily covered in existing laws or often fall into grey zones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in September 2020, the European Commission presented a proposal for the regulation of cryptoassets, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593">Markets in Cryptoassets Regulation, or MiCA proposal</a>. As part of this proposal, the EU for the first-time defined criteria for classifying cryptoasset as a “digital representation of value or rights which may be transferred and stored electronically, using distributed ledger technology or similar technology”. This would extend the coverage to at least partially include NFTs. While the MiCA proposal is still just a proposal, it’s expected to come into effect soon as rising trading volumes are driving demand for clear taxation laws.&nbsp;</p>



 Why NFT marketplaces should implement KYC &amp; AML procedures. 



<p>With rising popularity and especially exploding trading volumes, it’s ultimately only a question of time until the regulators will extend their AML coverage to NFTs. In parallel, the same discussion is happening around <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a>. In addition, compliant platforms with proper KYC procedures would potentially boost mass adoption. In particular, institutional investors as well as brands require compliant solutions to stay away from money laundering themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, NFT marketplaces and platforms now have the chance to act &nbsp;sooner rather than later, and proactively add KYC procedures, before the AML regulations will enforce it.&nbsp;</p>

The news prompted intense scrutiny from mainstream media outlets and civil rights organizations; and while ID.me sought to quell any concerns <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/id-me-confirms-technology-partnerships-with-paravision-iproov-012708/">by being transparent</a> about its technology partners and how it leverages their technologies for identity verification, the Treasury Department – which oversees the IRS – soon signalled that it was reconsidering the use of ID.me’s platform.</p>



<p>In early February, the IRS indicated that it would <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/irs-abandons-biometric-login-plan-020807/">back away from facial recognition</a> for taxpayer verification, and search for an alternative, non-biometric identity verification option. Around the same time, ID.me announced that it was adding a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/id-me-expands-non-biometric-identity-verification-services-020904/">video chat identity verification option</a> to its platform, as a complement to selfie-based onboarding.</p>



<p>Now, it looks like that’s good enough for the IRS after all – at least for this year. This week the IRS officially announced that for tax filings in 2022, taxpayers will be able to use ID.me’s biometric identity verification services, or a non-biometric verification option through a live video chat. And according to a report from <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/595159-irs-allowing-taxpayers-to-opt-out-of-facial-recognition-technology">The Hill</a>, the virtual interview option will also be facilitated by ID.me.</p>



<p>That having been said, the IRS characterized this arrangement as a “short-term solution” in place for this year’s filing season, and indicated that it is working with the General Services Administration to establish a new ‘Login.Gov’ online filing system that it hopes to roll out after the 2022 filing season has ended.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the IRS says that “new requirements are in place” to ensure that any images uploaded by taxpayers who opt for the non-biometric option will be deleted, and the agency says that biometric data that has already been collected from taxpayers who previously created online accounts will be “permanently deleted over the course of the next few weeks.”</p>

We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1494393715678457857?s=20&amp;t=MLWkF2PVF0ENRyo0kZZvwQ">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “More uses of DID”, and discussed whether DID can identify other non-human entities, and how to expand the practical use of DID. The participants agreed that DID can identify real non-human entities, such as IoT devices, to provide a more convenient management solution for device administrators; DID can also identify virtual items in the virtual world to clarify the rights and interests of virtual items for holders allocation etc.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He shared the practical liquidity mining strategy, focusing on the importance and operation of liquidity pools.

Gloria said “By using blockchain technology and secure identity solutions built on blockchain, we can combat data breaches and place the control back in the hands of self-sovereign individuals.”   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>World Bank — 《Is the Self-Sovereign digital identity the future digital business registry?》</p><p>“In this digital age of instant access to information and socially distant transactions, unique digital identity is a fundamental requirement. Otherwise, how can we be sure we are interacting with whom we mean to? Unfortunately, we are far from where we need to be. For businesses, legal identity is obtained through registration with a country’s business registration authority. In that process, the business is “born,” and ideally, it should be assigned a unique identifier and business name that is meant to facilitate its authentication and interaction with the government and other stakeholders. This information is collected into business registries.”</p><p>As a digital “identity card”, DID can not only help users prove their identity through uniqueness, but also return data and privacy to users through blockchain technology, solving information leakage and advertising harassment caused by the centralization of the traditional Internet. Ontology has been working in the DID industry for several years, and has gradually reached cooperative relations with service providers in various industries and fields around the world. Through the comprehensive deployment of DID, global users will have a unique digital identity, which can not only protect and manage identity and privacy, but also log in to various dApps with one click, maintaining identity unity and data interoperability.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, the decentralized data exchange protocol unlocking data for AI, supports the launch of Data Whale’s ALGA datatoken wallet — a project financed through <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a>, Ocean’s community-curated grants program. In anticipation of Ocean Protocol’s upcoming releases — V4 and Data Farming, ALGA is a tool that allows for an intuitive, seamless DataFi experience.</p><p>ALGA: one-stop DeFi junction for data&nbsp;assets</p><p><a href="https://datatoken.app/">ALGA</a> is an application that offers users the opportunity to engage with the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> on a mobile interface. The overall goals are to facilitate more consumption volume on the Ocean Market, to generate positive network value through onboarding data curators and to accelerate the widespread adoption of OCEAN allowing for more Web3 enthusiasts and yield farmers to participate in an open data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>ALGA integrates with Ethereum and the Ocean Market via WalletConnect — the user can simply connect an existing Web3 wallet without entering private keys or creating a new wallet altogether. ALGA will also integrate with other EVM chains after V4 launch. After connecting, users can take full advantage of the ALGA wallet interface that combines functionalities and insights about datatokens in an intuitive way.</p><p>On the app home screen, users can add their favourite datatokens to a Watchlist, check out the assets with the highest liquidity (TVL) and see the latest Initial Data Offerings on the Ocean Market. The application also provides a detailed analysis screen for each datatoken, where users can analyze price history in different timeframes, total pool liquidity, dataset descriptions and publisher information.</p><p>Once a Web3 wallet is connected, ALGA unfolds its full potential. The application reads and analyzes on-chain wallet data and provides input on datatoken holdings priced in OCEAN, datatoken price changes, historic transactions and more. Users can swap datatokens against OCEAN or stake OCEAN on all datatoken liquidity pools available on Ethereum [gas and transaction fees&nbsp;apply].</p><p>Trent McConaghy, Founder of Ocean Protocol&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“Guided by the vision to bring DataFi to mobile phones, ALGA is showing the way for easier and more secure individual participation in an open data economy powered by Ocean. Our focus in 2022 is to ramp up the adoption of Ocean data exchange functionalities and ALGA is yet another important step in that direction.”</blockquote><p>Moritz Frings, Project Lead, Data Whale,&nbsp;added:</p><blockquote>“Ocean Protocol gave me the opportunity to become a part of their journey of kickstarting a Web3 Data Economy. Thanks to OceanDAO and community support, we were able to build ALGA, an application that allows users to track and analyze their datatoken holdings. Since the launch of Ocean Market, it was my dream to have a tool that will allow me to track all of my data assets in one spot. With ALGA, this dream became a reality and I trust the Ocean community will enjoy its features.”</blockquote><p>ALGA is available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realdatawhale.alga">Google Playstore</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/data-whale-alga-wallet/id1585860617">Apple App&nbsp;Store.</a></p><p>For more details, watch <a href="https://datawhale.ai/">Data Whale’s Ocean Data Market Tutorials and </a>visit the <a href="https://datatoken.app/">ALGA&nbsp;website.</a></p><p>For those trading at night, the application’s dark mode will come in&nbsp;handy.</p><p>As part of its future roadmap, ALGA functionalities will be expanded to other data markets and networks.</p> About ALGA <p>ALGA is the first mobile datatoken dApp for the Web3 Data Economy inspired by Ocean Protocol. ALGA is fully integrated with the Ocean Protocol Market and performs a multitude of functions, including swapping and staking&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> About Data&nbsp;Whale <p>Data Whale is a community-oriented project inspired by Ocean Protocol to help kickstart a Web3 data economy.

 Successful year supports IDnow’s journey towards becoming the European leader in identity verification and authentication 
<p>Munich, February 23rd, 2022, IDnow, a leading European Identity Proofing Platform, reports another record year, closing 2021 by organically doubling the number of transactions in its core business. The growth rate is fueled by strong momentum in new sales, increased use of the platform among its existing client base and is further supported by the successful integration of ARIADNEXT in France and identity Trust Management AG (“identity.TM”) in Germany.</p>
<p>The acceleration of advanced digital business models has led to a shift in demand from single-product identity verification towards comprehensive identity proofing platforms. IDnow’s acquisitions of ARIADNEXT and identity.TM in 2021 have allowed the Company to seamlessly meet this rising demand across Europe with one of the broadest sets of identity verification methods available in the market.</p>
<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO at IDnow, commented: “Our goal is to build the leading unified identity proofing platform that meets the multi-dimensional user needs of our customers, whilst meeting stringent and often complex regulatory demands. Through our successful M&amp;A ventures, the IDnow group is now positioned to offer best-in-class products and services that deliver a seamless user experience across an expansive range of geographies and verticals.”</p>
<p>The combined IDnow platform provides a holistic suite of products, catering to the advanced needs of its leading, international clients. In the past year, IDnow added a record number of new clients, including some of the fastest-growing European brands, such as eToro and Lydia. The IDnow platform is used by leading companies globally, with half of the top 20 banks in Europe as well as each of the top 4 relevant telecommunication operators in France and Germany relying on its services.</p>
<p>IDnow has made a series of senior hires in the past year to support the Company’s rapid growth, including Johannes Meerloo as COO, Doug Pollock as Director of Customer Success, Jamie Turner as Vice President People as well as Dr. Heinrich Grave as Senior Vice President Digital Identity. The Company has also opened offices in the UK as well as in the Middle East to cater to regional surges in demand.</p>
<p>“The identity verification and proofing space is experiencing tremendous growth as companies increasingly adopt digital-first strategies. Our automated verification product solutions have proven themselves to be the first choice for some of the biggest companies across Europe, which is a testament to the levels of fraud assurance we continuously offer our customers. Looking forward to the rest of the year, I am very excited about our position in the market. With our holistic identity proofing platform, strengthened team and additional regional locations, we’re in a unique position to offer enterprises exactly what they need from a single source,” says Andreas Bodczek. “I am looking forward to 2022 – a year in which we will continue to bring our three combined companies closer together and strive for increased market leadership as a unified force.”</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Authentication without passwords is the goal that many businesses have already set, but very few have delivered. Now, WebAuthN is one of the standards that we hear the most lately. So today we’ll have a critical assessment of WebAuthN. And we’ll see, is it ready to deliver its promise? And for that we have a special guest who is Olly Brough.</p>
<p>He’s Managing Director of EMEA at Trusona. Olly has built his career delivering best in class payments, anti-fraud, and identity solutions to leading retail, financial services and public sector clients working with a variety of high growth technology companies in Europe and overseas. Prior to joining Trusona, Olly led European sales and marketing functions of privately-owned technology businesses to successful exit including QAS; an identity and data quality business, Eiger Systems; a consumer payment collection platform, Cambridge Global Payments; a cross border bank payments service, and 41st Parameter; the online device intelligence platform.</p>
<p>Hello, Olly.</p>
<p>Olly Brough: Hello, Oscar. Good morning to you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Good morning. And welcome, let’s talk about data identity. But as always, I want to hear more about our guests. So please, Olly, tell us a bit more about yourself and how was your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Olly: Thank you, Oscar. So yeah, my name is Olly. I’m based here in the UK. My focus is, as you said, has been very much around growing technology companies across Europe. I think I somewhat stumbled into the world of identity. I first joined, over 25 years ago, a data verification business that was at the time flexed on helping organisations increase the integrity of their name and address data for old style mailing campaigns, just before the internet was a big thing.</p>
<p>But of course, that morphed into identity verification, because once you have names and addresses and date of birth, you can then start to verify identities. And that business was acquired by Experian, the big PLC. Then really through that, my experience sort of morphed into identity verification. And then I got into the whole area of online security, which is where I am now initially through 41st Parameter, but now focusing on Trusona.</p>
<p>And then finally I dipped into payments along the way. But then payments, as you know, is also very heavily associated with the world of online authentication because payments can’t happen unless they’ve been authenticated in the right way. So yeah, it’s been an interesting last 25 years – long may it continue.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, super interesting journey, touching several industries so you say that were very close to identity. And excellent, OK, so we are going to discuss about especially WebAuthN, if you can tell us first what is that?</p>
<p>Olly: Yeah. Well, first of all, I’ll give it a little bit of context. Trusona was established over five years ago in Arizona, with great backing from the likes of sort of Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins. If I’m honest, we always would have hoped that progress would have been quicker in those early years. But I think many people have the vision to remove passwords and other static authenticators like less OTPs and the like. But I think to a degree, the technology has been the constraining factor in terms of standards that are available to use to bring more consumers into using passwordless capabilities. That’s been there a little bit more in the workplace type environment, but perhaps been a limiting factor when trying to authenticate consumers.</p>
<p>So WebAuthN, the question you asked is, what is WebAuthN and why would you use it? Well, WebAuthN I think is the most exciting development that I’ve seen over the last four and a half years working with Trusona. And it is a standard that has been adopted by FIDO. OK, now, W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, created the standard. And FIDO, which stands for Fast Identity Online. And really FIDO is an alliance, an open industry association that’s mission is helping create standards to remove passwords from those secure interactions. OK? So they are bankrolled by the likes of Google, Apple, Microsoft, and all the usual suspects. And they have a common interest in helping to standardise on the internet so that we can better authenticate individuals and move away from passwords.</p>
<p>So in terms of explaining what WebAuthN is, then probably the best way to describe it is we’ve all now had that experience of being able to open an app and tap in the app to identify yourself, or at least most of us are familiar with that. I, for example, bank with StarlingBbank but you might have other services – where Starling bank, for example in the UK, forces you to use the app and therefore every time you want to authenticate or accept a card payment or move a payment, they will ask you to open your app and to tap in the app using face ID or your touch ID. And I think people now accept that if you have that app, then that is a really good experience for consumers.</p>
<p>The problem with that type of technology, which is stuff that Trusona has been helping people with, is if you do not have the app for the brand, so let’s say I’m trying to talk to my telco, and I don’t have the Vodafone app on my phone. Then Vodafone do not have the capability to ask me just to tap or look into the device to authenticate. Because that is only available if you have that relationship with a native mobile app, the My Vodafone app.</p>
<p>To put it into context, I’m trying to explain that problem and then that will explain why WebAuthN is a useful technology. The problem is if you take the telco industry, for example, then only about 18% of their customers have actually got around to downloading the app. So if you were posing a solution for telcos to authenticate their customers, then you’re proposing a solution that only addresses 18% of their customers, whilst the rest of the world, the other 82%, are still stuck with passwords and usernames and SMS OTPs and the like.</p>
<p>What WebAuthN has done is enabled that same tap in app experience but without the need to have the brand’s native mobile app. It effectively allows the likes of Vodafone to deliver the same experience, but through their mobile website, and using the Chrome or the Safari, or Microsoft Edge app that is installed on the device as the app, so that they do not have to establish that app-base relationship to have that tap and go experience of authentication.</p>
<p>So what WebAuthN really means is that when consumers pull their new phones out of the box, they already have the standard on their device. And there is no technology to be delivered to the customer to enable them to be able to cleanly authenticate to a brand, which means that now instead of 18% of people being able to do it, 100% of people can now have that same tap and go experience. Is that clear? There’s quite a bit of detail there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes. I think a good idea is the way you clarified. First of all, you start explaining that there are already nowadays, in the last year, they already have been companies’ services that offer their own proprietary own branded authenticator app, mobile app, which authenticate or which, as you said, the user experience is normally good, that works and is secure. And now, to make it more accessible to everybody, that kind of app is just in every browser, at least in the browser who are supporting WebAuthN. Correct?</p>
<p>Olly: That’s correct. Yeah. It is available to everybody out of the box on all new mobile devices. And increasingly, it’s available on desktop devices.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. It sounds super convenient. Of course, you don’t have to install an app. If it sounds so convenient, as you are describing it, why we don’t see this so much. Actually, I think once I try with GitHub, I try but I haven’t found, I haven’t heard many services that offer it. So is it really available now?</p>
<p>Olly: So first of all, let’s address the question as to whether it’s a technology that’s here to stay, or it might disappear in the next 12 to 24 months? The answer is it’s definitely here to stay. Today, about 85% of all smartphones in Western Europe have the capability already. OK? So I think that’s something that people don’t understand.</p>
<p>It is there. The reason there was a delay was that it took a little while for Apple and their iOS operating system to adopt the standard and that happened in September 2021. And now, as those updates have been updated to those Apple devices, there’s a very, very high penetration, it’s almost 100% of Apple mobile smartphone devices.</p>
<p>Coming back to your question about why haven’t you seen it out there? You will now increasingly, it’s being used by some of the core services that Apple and Google deliver themselves, things like Apple Pay and Google Pay and the like. But the challenge is, it’s really- until Apple came to the party back in September 2021, it’s been very difficult for people to deliver use cases. But now that it’s in place in the last year, we’re seeing an increasing incidence of projects using this type of technology. So it’s definitely here to stay.</p>
<p>The challenge is, you probably won’t realise that you’re using it, because the experience is very, very good. It is simply like just unlocking your smartphone device. And so you will be using it in instances that you have no awareness that this is WebAuthN, because why should you? You as a consumer, all you care about is being able to authenticate and get what you want.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So it means that it’s been already, let’s say for the last month, at least available on the services side, but not available because of Apple, Apple didn’t support it on their clients.</p>
<p>Olly: But now it’s in iOS 14 so it’s pretty much, unless you have a very old Apple device, you will have WebAuthN available on your device. As I say, I think the key point is it is being used, but people aren’t aware of it because you wouldn’t explain to the consumer, “Do you want to log on using WebAuthN?” They will say, “Do you want to use biometrics to log on?” And they’ll tap and that’ll be done, and they won’t think any more about it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. I think it’s a good time to hear about the use cases. So I’d like to hear which use cases are being used already.</p>
<p>Olly: So, where we’re seeing the most activity is really in two areas. And I’m talking about on the consumer side of things at the workforce level, then authenticator apps are pretty well-established as a mechanism to do second factor authentication. And you will now see on the workforce side, we’ve already got deployments whereby organisations are using WebAuthN instead of an authenticator app to passwordless the MFA into single sign-on environments like Okta, for example.</p>
<p>So that’s one area, the workforce environment where CISOs want to get rid of passwords, and they want MFA. And they don’t want to have to go around policing everybody to download and enrol to the authenticator app. They just want to move that overhead. So that’s one area.</p>
<p>On the consumer side, I’d say there are two areas of real interest to us. One is the customer services area, which has always been strong because people don’t realise the cost of passwords, pins and codes to customer services. Ultimately, if I can’t self-serve, then I will pick up the phone to customer services, which drives up costs. So it’s always, while security is important, really, the areas where good ROI is delivered is where there’s a real meaningful cost upon the business of passwords, usernames, pins and codes.</p>
<p>So for customer services, we are seeing a lot of interest in using this over chat discussions. If you have an open chat discussion, at some point, the brand will want to enable account servicing via chat. But they can’t do that, because it is very difficult to authenticate someone over a chat discussion. Whereas if you have the WebAuthN capability, you can literally just send a message that enables the customer to tap on the screen, look into the device, and they have authenticated themselves. And now they can move that chat journey into the account servicing level where I might want to change my address. And a lot of time chat discussions are limited to initial sort of high-level questions, but you always have to then pick up the phone if you want something more serious done. So that’s one area that we’re seeing quite good demand.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest is the replacement of SMS. So whilst this is not a true passwordless deployment, SMS is seen as a real pain for businesses. Why is that? Well, one, it costs money. So finance people don’t like it, that can be very, very expensive. Number two, it has a attritional impact and we’ve seen that with PSD2 and Strong Customer Authentication and payments across Europe. There are attrition rates associated with SMS of between 10% and 30%, OK? We’ve all had that experience where we tap a button and say, “Send me an SMS” and it doesn’t turn up and then you tap it again. And then you get two or three at the same time and then you enter the phone number, not the code. So all of that cost money or impacts conversion, which drives revenue.</p>
<p>And then finally, we know that SMS is not particularly secure, because it really is not a true possession factor. It’s the SIM card rather than the actual physical device, whereas WebAuthN strongly identifies the actual physical device. So for those out-and-out mobile login type experiences where there is a security requirement to have a second factor, then we see WebAuthN as being so easy to deploy.</p>
<p>So we’ve seen a lot of interest in the gambling sector at the moment for a very, very cutting edge with regards to customer experience. So instead of having to go through with those steps, the customer literally just taps on the screen, looks into their phone, and they’ve been strongly authenticated, there’s no need to remember anything or type anything. And they can get on with what they want to do, which might be placing a bet on the 2.15 at Haydock. So those are the use cases that we’re seeing early on.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks for sharing that. Very interesting, of course, you mentioned the workforce, the replacement of SMS which is widely used today still. And yeah, you have described why it’s not a good idea to keep using that. But there was also fun, quite interesting and I haven’t heard before is about the customer service using the chat. So yeah, definitely, it makes that kind of customer service via chat much more powerful.</p>
<p>Olly: Exactly. Because I saw a stat, I think it’s something like, I can’t remember what the numbers were and I’m going to be cautious not to misquote on this discussion. But I think generally speaking, we would now prefer to get something via chat than picking up the telephone, because you multitask, you can tap a message, “I need this, I need this, I need this.” And that, I think is a very powerful driver.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, the chat person says, “OK, you had to call anyway. So you had to make the one-hour queue and then call.”</p>
<p>Olly: Oh definitely. And all the time the customer satisfaction goes down and costs go up. It’s just this whole digital transformation agenda is primarily it should be about, how can we serve the customer best? And I think this addresses it. And then secondly, of course the finance people will want to know, well, how can we do it more cheaply? And the good news to the finance folk is that it can be done more cheaply, and we can make sure that customers are happier and they’re retained for longer and they spend more money with the organisation. So who wouldn’t want that?</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. So we’d like to hear now about the security. So how WebAuthN is secure, if you compare to other standards?</p>
<p>Olly: Yeah. OK. So let’s break that down. First of all, let’s break the security model down into simple terms. And really there are three factors that can be applied, there’s a possession factor, so something you have, there is a biometric, which is something you are, and then there’s knowledge, which is something you know. Now, if you compare WebAuthN to other standards, then let’s look at passwords, for example, passwords is a single factor, knowledge-based check. If I know it, I could pretend to be you, and I can clean out your account.</p>
<p>Now, on top of that, you might apply another standard to improve security, which we discussed earlier, which is OK, well, I’m now going to add on top of my knowledge-based factor, I’m going to add an SMS. SMS is often characterised as being a possession factor. And to a degree, you could argue it is because you need to be in possession of that SIM card, but then the message can be diverted or it can be phished in some way. And so really, SMS quickly becomes another knowledge factor. If I have that code, I can pretend to be you. And there are a number of ways in which that code could be diverted or moved to another party. So, if you look at the two-factor authentication using passwords and SMS, then if I know your password, and I can get your code, then I can pretend to be you and I’ve broken through that security model.</p>
<p>And what we see within customer services is even worse is knowledge-based authentication. So knowledge-based authentication is that experience of secret questions, Oscar, before I can change your address, could you tell me what month you were born? Again, anybody that has got the time and desire to want to break into your account, it’s not difficult information to obtain. And therefore, it is another knowledge factor that I can collect, and again, pretend to be you, OK? And there’s real challenges in customer services with knowledge-based authentication, not just because it’s weak, but it also takes about 34 seconds for every single call to go through, which is more money and more cost associated with trying to identify the customer.</p>
<p>So WebAuthN, factors WebAuthN uses, number one is possession. But it is not possession of a SIM card, it is possession of the physical hardware of your smartphone device. And therefore, if I change the SIM, or if I divert the message, the transaction will not be authenticated. Why? Because you physically have to have this piece of metal in your hand, using cryptography, it is strongly establishing the device and that cannot be transferred to anyone else. OK? So that’s the first thing.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is using the biometric on your device. So WebAuthN does not create a new biometric. It is using the biometric that you have set up to unlock your device probably about 100 times a day on the average person. The important thing about that is that that biometric is very secure, because it is not transferred over the internet, it is only ever retained on the device. And it is secondly, it’s something that you’re very familiar with using. So from a customer experience point of view, if I ask someone to unlock their device, then they know how to do it, because they’re very practiced at it, they do it every day, hundreds of times.</p>
<p>So the WebAuthN standard uses number one, very, very strong, immutable possession of the device that is much better than other standards, such as SMS. And then secondly, it layers on top of that, to get at that possession factor the biometric from the device. Really, it is a very, very strong standard compared to other alternatives. It’s not infallible. One of the key things that we always state is that if you’re using WebAuthN, then you should make sure that the customer is not sharing their device. So these days, if you use Touch ID within a banking app, they will put a disclaimer in there to say “If you share your device, please do not use Touch ID or face ID to authenticate transactions. You’re guarding against other people in your household using their fingerprint or their face ID to unlock your device and approve transactions.” So that’s one thing that you need to think about.</p>
<p>But then when you compare that wrinkle to the other wrinkles within the other alternatives, that is a very, very strong standard. And if you need to layer on top other additional security steps for high-risk transactions, then you can do that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Two strong factors you mentioned. First, the possession but a strong possession. Here, I would like to ask you something. So, it has to be the device and exactly the device that is registered. But if you change the SIM card that’s not valid, or you can change the SIM card?</p>
<p>Olly: You can change the SIM card.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Olly: It doesn’t matter. It is the physical piece of metal by itself. So there is a part of your device called the Secure Enclave, which is where cryptographic elements are stored, and the key is stored within that enclave, and that is resolved when the customer unlocks their device with biometrics to then establish possession of the device. Is this the device that was registered to Olly’s account?</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, thank you for clarifying that. And also the biometrics that can be used depend on the device, correct? Some devices have the fingerprint. So what are the options, fingerprint, face recognition?</p>
<p>Olly: It’s really whatever is available on the device. But I mean, these days, I’m an Android user but iOS devices are all face ID now I think. My device is older Android Moto device that uses touch ID, I think there is a face ID option as well. But it can use either – whatever is available on the phone device.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, I would like to also hear about how easy it is to use, as far as you have described seems to be from the end user perspective, pretty simple. But also, I’d like to know how is for the more technical who would need to deploy this or considering to deploy this? So what would you say – how easy is it to use and deploy?</p>
<p>Olly: You’re right, at a customer level. I mean, I think the way to think about this is the customer doesn’t need to understand how the technology works. The customer is simply prompted and asked, do they wish to enable biometrics to authenticate to the brand whether that’s Vodafone, Lloyds Bank, Klarna, whoever it might be, OK, you’re just asked, “Do you want to unlock your phone to authenticate this transaction?” So it’s very easy, and the customer uses it hundreds of times a day already.</p>
<p>Where the complexity exists is in the orchestration, really, because remember at the front end, it’s a standards-based technology. So it’s not our technology that’s running the frontend, it is Apple’s or Google’s technology. At the backend, there is a little bit more complexity in orchestrating the authentication. And that’s where the benefit of vendors like Trusona come in, because they have plenty of experience of deploying these types of solutions time and time again.</p>
<p>So what we need to do is, for example, first of all, make sure that you’ve got an appropriate enrolment journey so that you’ve established trust with that customer. And then once that’s done, our backend will communicate typically with the brand’s CRM or identity and access management platform to then send and receive messages when authentication events are presented or required.</p>
<p>The other thing to think about is that because you are dealing with multiple OSs, then there are different ways and different devices and different operating systems need to step through that authentication process. And indeed, some of the devices we talked about earlier will not yet be compliant so you need to be able to provide a soft landing for those rather than just say, “No, you can’t log in.” Being able to offer a migration path for those older devices to make sure that you’re offering the right authentication options so if they can’t use WebAuthN then maybe they need to stick with passwords and usernames until the time that they upgrade to that device. And then you can put the offer in place.</p>
<p>So it’s a combination of orchestration and I think good design and planning, and the detail that sits around that to make this all come together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. For instance, as you mentioned, for some type of devices, the service is not supported, you have the good user interface that tells you what are the other options available. One qualification question for you, Trusona is a piece of software that would be installed in the backend of the service provider, along with the CIAM, you mentioned, it’s not a managed service, correct? It’s software that is installed?</p>
<p>Olly: It’s software-as-a-service, we run all of our services on Amazon Web Services in different clouds for different regions. And we provide, all of the technology is served up through that cloud service. So there’s no need for the customer to establish their own cloud, or there’s no software that needs to be deployed locally by the brand.</p>
<p>So one of the questions that pops up when we explain that is, well, what about the personally identifiable information that you hold in your cloud? What about considerations around security and so forth? Well, the answer to that is we do not hold any personally identifiable information. Our service communicates with the identity and access management platform that will hold all of the biographic personally identifiable information. What we are using is, we hold in our cloud public keys that relate to the private key that sits on the device that is resolved. And we then use that as an identifier and we pass that between the two systems. So never at any point do we hold personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Of course, the biometric that’s being used to unlock the devices in the OS, we’d never see that, we just get a result code from the OS to say, whether that has been passed or failed. OK? So our cloud really, if anybody wanted to hack into it, and spent the time they’d be really disappointed by what they got. Because there would just be a bunch of public keys that are proprietary to our own system and are completely useless to any third party.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, great clarification about that. It’s a software-as-a-service, but you don’t hold any or store any personal data of the users.</p>
<p>Olly: Yeah, I think when people start thinking about identity and authentication, immediately, they think, “Oh, there’s going to be a data store somewhere of valuable data and that’s a risk to the business.” And I think that’s one of the things that FIDO and WebAuthN have really thought through in the backend. And vendors like ourselves, Trusona, have thought through in terms of the orchestration, how we pull that together. And that’s probably another real call out to FIDO and WebAuthN is – the security model and in that respect is very, very strong. They’re not creating another honeypot of information that can be hacked by the criminals.</p>
<p>Oscar: And you don’t need to be an expert to deploy WebAuthN on the backend side.</p>
<p>Olly: Yes. I mean, I think it’s the same as, do you need to be an expert to build an identity and access management platform? Well, yes, of course. And do you need to be an expert to build a WebAuthN based passwordless authentication service? And the answer is, of course, we built one. So anybody could do but it’s taken us five years to get it as good as it is today. And that’s a lot of results, a lot of time getting it right. So yeah, you do need to be an expert to do this well, and I think that’s where traditionally vendors in this marketplace, add value on that with Trusona, then we can really help with the leader in that space.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. I will have a final question for you. Olly, thanks a lot for bringing light about WebAuthN, it’s very, very interesting, very enlightening what we’re hearing. For all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Olly: So I would say we’re probably going to have different types of people listening to this podcast, but many will be identity experts, and potentially their costs sit within a cost centre somewhere within the business. That’s the reality. My one piece of advice would be understand the true costs of your authentication services. Because rather than being a cost centre, you can actually deliver strong return on investment back on improving authentication back to the marketing team, the customer services team, and to your finance director. And I can tell you finance people love it when money can be saved.</p>
<p>And so have a look at those hard costs. So for example, we talked about customer services, most of the organisation, large customer service operations that I talk to are- all of them are seeking to drive down the cost of service, but they don’t want to do it at the expense of customer satisfaction. And as we talked about earlier, one of the big obstacles to completing self-service is the authentication processes.</p>
<p>For example, something like on average about 11% of calls come into contact centres, because people can’t get what they want online. So if you could help them to get what they want, by removing these barriers, like SMS, OTP, and passwords and presenting something that’s much easier to them, then suddenly, you can start to drive down the call flow into the customer service team.</p>
<p>Secondly, have a look to see their existing process. If they’re using knowledge-based authentication, they’re probably spending upwards of a minute trying to identify the customer. And if you provided a service that enabled them to do it with just a touch of the smartphone, then that would save 40 seconds on every single call. So customer service is one area.</p>
<p>And the other area that we’ve talked about is SMS, go and ask, how much are we paying for these messages? What’s the total cost of that? And what would happen if we could take out 50% of that, and make the customer happier in the process? And then go and tell the salespeople that they will get more sales because customers will be enabled more easily to be able to complete and get what they want.</p>
<p>And so that’s where I would start is just do a cost analysis. But think beyond the fraud and identity team and go and ask customer services about the cost of knowledge-based authentication, customer services about how many calls come in that are diverted because people can’t log in. Go and get that. And then go and ask the finance director, how much do you pay every year on SMS? And are you interested in having a discussion as to how we could reduce that by 50%? I think they’d really like it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. Again, thanks a lot, Olly for all this. Please let us know how people can get in touch with you or follow the conversation with you.</p>
<p>Olly: Well, first of all, my email address is OB@trusona.com. If anybody wants to give me a call, I’m always happy to chat as well, that’s +44 7823 538 872. But as a good starting point is maybe pop on to our website <a href="https://www.trusona.com/">trusona.com</a> or if you’d like you can look me up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olly-brough-5821a38/">LinkedIn</a> and send me a LinkedIn message. It’s Olly, O-L-LY Brough, B-R-O-U-G-H. If you search that Trusona, I’ll pop up and drop me a message and we’d love to talk.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Again, thanks a lot Olly for joining us today and all the best.</p>

 Read about the key information on the Shyft DAO’s mission, structure, how to submit and vote for proposals, and more as Shyft kicks off this next era of its community! <p>2022 is already off to an exciting and productive start for the Shyft Network platform, team, and community. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-network-end-of-year-recap">Last year</a>, Shyft Network launched on mainnet and introduced key partnerships and products like Veriscope to the ecosystem. One of the first priorities for 2022 is the rollout of something critical to the future of the Shyft Network community and our goal towards total decentralization: the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>So why a DAO, and why now? From historical failures around data, privacy, and identity in Web2 and traditional finance to a rise in security and identity concerns in blockchain, there has never been a more critical time for Shyft Network to exist. The time for the community to take control is now; to expand Shyft Network’s ecosystem, create new trusted data solutions, like a sovereign identity system, and further empower each other to expand what Shyft Network can&nbsp;do.</p><p>It’s time to move closer to the goal of total decentralization and help launch the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Shyft Network is proud to share that after many months of planning and hard work, below is what lies ahead towards forming the DAO and some of the essential information you should know as the process kicks&nbsp;off.</p><p>The first <a href="https://forum.shyft.network/d/15-sip-1-shyft-dao-existence-proposal">proposal</a>, a yes or no vote on the instantiation of the DAO, is now live on the <a href="https://forum.shyft.network/">Shyft Network forum</a> and will move to Snapshot after five comments are posted — if you are a SHFT holder, you will be able to&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Read on to learn more about the Shyft DAO and how to participate. Thanks for being&nbsp;here!</p> What is the Mission of the Shyft&nbsp;DAO? <p>Shyft DAO aims to facilitate perpetual advancement of the Shyft protocol, to enable institutional blockchain adoption in compliance with local and global regulation without users’ sacrificing their data privacy or sovereignty.</p><p>The Shyft DAO will enable community governance over Shyft DAO assets by allowing community members to make proposals regarding the operation of the Shyft Network, as well as voting on proposals made by other community members, and participating in the deployment of various network economic systems such as the Shyft staking pool, AMM &amp; Yield Wrap&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>In addition, the Shyft DAO will facilitate community involvement in the implementation of strategic treasury management to facilitate Shyft protocol infrastructure expansion, upgrades, and ecosystem development in conjunction with the curation of strategic grant fundings and community involvement in the distribution of suitable economic benefits to the Shyft community.</p> What is the Structure of the Shyft&nbsp;DAO? <p>Version 1 of the Shyft DAO will consist of the six committees described below.</p><p>At launch, each committee will be populated with members of the decentralized federation of nodes. Their initial focus will be to document and share their mandate as well as build a plan to include new members outside of the Shyft Federation.</p> Treasury &amp; Economics Committee   Oversee treasury management and asset allocation.  Oversee financial analysis and strategies.  Oversee the design of Shyft Network’s economic policies.  Oversee financial audit and reporting.  Oversee treasury management and asset allocation.  Oversee financial analysis and strategies.  Oversee the design of Shyft Network’s economic policies.   Operations Committee   Set the goals, milestones, and channels within each DAO committee.  Create proposals for the formation of additional required committees, such as an R&amp;D committee.   Governance &amp; Oversight Committee   Maintain governance procedures via a Shyft DAO Charter (to be drafted by the Governance &amp; Oversight Committee)  Write and manage proposals (SIPs, DAO proposals, grant proposals, etc.) in close collaboration with the DAO members using the discussion forum.  Review, monitor, report, and provide DAO feedback.   Technology Committee   Strategic furtherance of Shyft Network’s technology.  Curation of technology development proposals.  Design of bug bounty programs.  Instantiation of Shyft Network’s developer community.   Ecosystem Business Development &amp; Partnership Committee   Identify and establish strategic partnerships that further expand Shyft Network’s use&nbsp;cases.  Outreach and liaison with 3rd party developers to encourage their development on Shyft&nbsp;Network.  Gather market intelligence and communicate market insights to the Technology Committee for strategic use case development.   Marketing and Community Committee   Develop various community-oriented initiatives, such as the Shyft Ambassador program.  Design various bounty programs in cooperation with the Technology Committee.  Organize community outreach, including updates; build and write reports, moderate and hold regular discussions.  Organize content, announcements, regular live AMAs, hackathons, blogs, and&nbsp;more.   What Tools Will Be Used in the Operation of the Shyft&nbsp;DAO?  1. Voting via&nbsp;Snapshot   The Shyft DAO will utilize Snapshot as a voting tool via a single voting system architecture. The first proposal the DAO will vote on is for the instantiation of the DAO itself. Voting will take place directly on the Snapshot portal (see below). As will be the case with all proposals, they will require five comments minimum on the forum before then going live on Snapshot for official&nbsp;voting.  <p>Below, see the necessary steps on how to vote for a proposal:</p><p>Step 1: Navigate to Shyft’s<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/shyftdao.eth"> Snapshot&nbsp;portal</a>.</p><p>Step 2: Click “join” on the Shyft DAO&nbsp;space.</p><p>Step 3: Connect with the wallet where you hold&nbsp;$SHFT.</p><p>Step 4: Sign in with the account you want to vote&nbsp;with.</p><p>Step 5: Select the active proposal to vote&nbsp;on.</p><p>Step 6: Browse through the proposal and see what options are available to cast a&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Step 7: Click on your preferred option then review and agree to the&nbsp;terms</p><p>Step 8: Confirm your vote by clicking on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Step 9: Sign the transaction with your account to complete the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Step 10: You have successfully voted!</p> 2. Multi-Sig Enactment (Shyft&nbsp;Safe)   This tool will be used to enact votes on the Shyft DAO. This will be deployed through two key sections:   1. Shyft DAO&nbsp;Treasury   The Shyft DAO Treasury will be managed by the Treasury and Economics Committee and deployed with instantiation of the Shyft DAO. The Treasury and Economics Committee will observe the aforementioned Shyft DAO charter to ensure full transparency regarding its actions. The committee will also be responsible for creating its own mandates aligned with this Shyft DAO&nbsp;charter.   2. Shyft DAO 7 Key&nbsp;Signers   Following voting on the substantiation of the Shyft DAO, the process will move forward with a vote to elect the seven key signers — two from Shyft Core, two from the Shyft Federation, and three from the Shyft Community. The first proposal will focus on the election of the three community key signers. A separate election will occur among the Shyft Federation and Shyft Core to elect the two key signers for those two sections.  The Treasury and Economics Committee will initially be composed of Shyft Community, Federation, and Core members. It will initially deploy via the DAO’s seven key signers, portfolio managers, financial analysts, and strategists. The expectations are that the committees will expand over time to fill its other various organizational roles.   3. Shyft&nbsp;Forum   The Shyft Forum acts as the primary communication platform for Shyft community members to discuss proposals — this is where you can find active proposals (in addition to on Snapshot), a forthcoming knowledge-based section, team support, community development information, and more. To access the Shyft Forum, click&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.shyft.network/">HERE</a>.   What’s Next <p>Following the close of Shyft Network’s <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/celebrate-the-lunar-new-year-win-a-fang-gang-nft-and-shft-603a892e56fd?source=user_profile---------3-------------------------------">latest community campaign</a>, there will be an AMA on Twitter Spaces to discuss feedback community matters and answer questions on the DAO formation and its proposal process. A portion of the AMA will be focused on discussing the proposal for electing the DAO’s seven key signers, primarily focusing on selecting its three community signers. The entire Shyft Core looks forward to sharing its excitement about the DAO, as well as answering any questions you may have on what’s&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>As always, feel free to reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>.</p><p>See you&nbsp;soon,</p><p>— Shyft&nbsp;Network</p>

<p>With concerns on the rise about privacy in the age of AI, <a href="https://tech5.ai/">TECH5</a> has laid out five “key principles” that guide the development of its biometric technology. The principles, which specifically govern its use of biometric data to train neural networks as well as the implementation of its technology, are as follows:</p>



  The use of consent-based depersonalized data for training of algorithms  Regular benchmarking  Development of inclusive technologies  Contribution to the development of standards and raising the level of expertise in the biometric market  Control over the use o technologies developed by TECH5 by only certified partners  



<p>In a statement, TECH5 said it was laying out these principles in “support of the global movement for protecting the biometric data of individuals”. The principles are applied to all of the biometric modalities in TECH5’s purview, including face, fingerprint, and iris recognition.</p>



<p>Rob Haslam, an identity industry veteran who was appointed as <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/former-hid-exec-is-tech5s-new-strategic-advisor-907071/">a strategic advisor</a> to the company in the summer of 2020, elaborated further, saying, “Today we are outlining our principles for using biometric data and technology development, hoping for such rules to be adopted by other companies involved in the design and development of biometric algorithms.”</p>



<p>A growing number of vendors in the biometrics industry have been calling for ethical standards to be applied to biometric technologies, either by regulators or by those within the industry itself. Rank One Computing, for example, announced a collaboration to that end with the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/rank-one-pushes-industry-led-code-conduct-ethical-use-facial-recognition-090901/">Security Industry Association</a> last September, and Oosto called for national ethical guidelines for biometric technologies <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-calls-for-national-ethical-guidelines-for-biometric-tech-501191/">in an open letter</a> earlier this year. </p>



<p>The issue is closely entwined with that of privacy, which emerged as a top concern for the biometrics industry at large in the latest <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/face-biometrics-privacy-and-finance-download-the-19th-annual-findbiometrics-year-in-review-report/">FindBiometrics Year in Review</a> survey results.</p>



<p>For its part, TECH5 takes a number of measures to ensure that it complies with its own governing principles, including regularly training and benchmarking its algorithms, contributing to industry associations like the Biometrics Institute and the European Association for Biometrics, and striving to ensure that its technologies highly accurate when used to match individuals across a range of demographics, among other efforts.</p>



<p>“In order to make sure that TECH5 technologies are used to serve inclusion in all aspects of people’s lives – from government services and programs to banking and healthcare – we carefully select partners for distribution of our technology components and intentionally invest in consent-based, high-quality date,” explained TECH CEO and co-founder Machiel van der Harst.</p>

 “Entering the shared mobility industry with WiBLE, in the field of car sharing, allows us to access a sector with great potential and increasing demand, as it represents an efficient mobility alternative.” – Javier Mira, CEO, FacePhi 



  



<p><a href="https://en.facephi.com/">FacePhi</a> is expanding into the car sharing market thanks to a new partnership with WiBLE, a Spanish car sharing service that lets customers rent a Kia Nira zero-emissions vehicle by the minute.</p>



<p>As with other car sharing services, WiBLE customers can access vehicles from WiBLE parking hubs. But the service’s partnership with FacePhi offers a compelling innovation, enabling customers to register and access a car through selfie-based authentication on their smartphones.</p>



<p>As FacePhi and WiBLE explained in a statement announcing the collaboration, all a given customer needs to do is to take photos of the front and back of an official identity document, and to upload a selfie photo. FacePhi’s biometric technology will match the selfie to the user’s ID, and will use liveness detection technology to ensure that the user really is present during the authentication process.</p>



<p>For WiBLE CEO Carlos Blanco, the collaboration represents a competitive edge thanks to its leveraging of innovative technology. “Technology is a fundamental lever for evolving the service and improving the experience of our clients,” he said, “which is why we must work with leading companies in their technological areas such as FacePhi.”</p>



<p>This particular application of biometric technology represents the latest instance of a long-anticipated trend. As far back as 2017, Fujitsu America was predicting that biometric authentication <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/car-sharing-biometric-adoption-fujitsu-011152/">would become the standard</a> means of accessing shared vehicles. The next couple of years saw it start to emerge in practice, with Brazil’s Turbi using <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/turbi-facetec-biometrics-car-access-503295/">FaceTec selfie biometrics</a> for car access and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/hyrecar-uses-mitek-technology-new-carsharing-app/">HyreCar turning to Mitek for selfie onboarding.</a></p>



<p>For FacePhi, the WiBLE partnership offers not only its first foray into the car sharing market, but the latest indication of its overall expansion beyond the financial services sector in which it built its business foundation. The company detailed other growth efforts, including air travel and smart city deployments, in its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-brings-record-revenue-2021-020705/">most recent business update</a>, covering the record growth FacePhi achieved over the past year.</p>



<p>“Entering the shared mobility industry with WiBLE, in the field of car sharing, allows us to access a sector with great potential and increasing demand, as it represents an efficient mobility alternative,” commented FacePhi CEO Javier Mira.</p>

<p>Seeking to further fuel its growth, <a href="https://truststamp.ai/">Trust Stamp</a> has made another important executive appointment, announcing biometrics specialist Prof. Reuben Farrugia as its new Malta Research Director.</p>



<p>In a statement, Trust Stamp hailed Prof. Farrugia as “an internationally recognized authority in biometrics with nearly two decades of experience in image processing and computer vision” technologies. Farrugia is an Associate Professor of Communications and Computer Engineering at the University of Malta. In 2013, he was appointed as the National Contact Point for the European Association of Biometrics, and the next year he served as the General Chair of the IEEE International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics.</p>



<p>“Trust Stamp has established a strong research-oriented science team with experts in artificial intelligence, cryptography, and biometrics, whose global backgrounds and diverse experience have driven innovation as the basis for the Company’s rapid success over the last six years,” explained Trust Stamp’s Chief Technology Officer, Scott Francis. “Reuben is a valuable addition to our team with exceptional insight and a highly developed skillset in the field of biometrics.”</p>



<p>Prof. Farrugia’s appointment comes shortly after the announcement that Josh Allen <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trust-stamp-appoints-new-ceo-malta-rwanda-subsidiaries-020801/">had been named CEO</a> of the company’s Trust Stamp Malta and Trust Stamp Rwanda subsidiaries. The Malta unit serves as the European hub of Trust Stamp’s R&amp;D efforts.</p>



<p>Both appointments have come in the wake of Trust Stamp’s uplisting from the OTCQX to the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-and-identity-specialist-trust-stamp-makes-nasdaq-debut/">Nasdaq stock exchange</a> near the start of this year, which CEO Gareth N. Genner described as an “important progression” for the company after “a record year indicative of [Trust Stamp’s] sustained positioning for company-wide growth”.</p>



<p>Trust Stamp has been making a name for itself with identity security technology including a cryptographic solution designed to turn identifying information into what Trust Stamp calls an “Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token”, as well face, palm, and fingerprint biometrics technologies. The company recently received funding from Malta Enterprise, the country’s economic development agency, to support its work on a QR code-based solution for accessing medical data.</p>

Few things compare to ETH Denver. It is impossible to fully capture the experience of the crypto community at a massive gathering like this, but these two choice talks provide a snapshot of the vibes and ethos of the 2022 conference. Kevin Owocki and Erik Voorhees join to synthesize the respective merits of individualism and collectivism, and Andrew Yang stepped up to give an impromptu call to action for the community to rally around productive goals. <p>We are scaling out the crypto vibes, and that was abundantly clear this week. Far larger than any previous ETH Denver, this conference truly felt like a Schelling point for folks changing the world via novel, elegant mechanisms. We just can’t wait for ETH Denver 2023.</p> <p>------ 📣 NOTIONAL FINANCE | DeFi's Leading Fixed Rate Yield <a href="https://bankless.cc/Notional">https://bankless.cc/Notional</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://podcast.banklesshq.com/">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:&nbsp;</p> <p>👀 POLYGON | LAYER &nbsp;2 DEFI <a href="https://bankless.cc/Polygon">https://bankless.cc/Polygon</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>❎ ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2 <a href="https://bankless.cc/Across">https://bankless.cc/Across</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦊 METAMASK | THE CRYPTO WALLET <a href="https://bankless.cc/metamask">https://bankless.cc/metamask</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>💳 LEDGER | THE CRYPTO LIFE CARD <a href="https://bankless.cc/Ledger">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🧙‍♂️ ALCHEMIX | SELF REPAYING LOANS <a href="https://bankless.cc/Alchemix">https://bankless.cc/Alchemix</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING <a href="https://bankless.cc/UniGrants">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro 12:01 Journey to ETH Denver 16:18 The Panels 22:37 Vibes</p> <p>34:00 Kevin Owocki &amp; Erik Voorhees 43:28 Pragmatism 50:57 Public Goods Funding</p> <p>1:00:00 Andrew Yang &amp; Crypto Alignment 1:06:31 Lobby3 1:13:53 &nbsp;Roadmaps &amp; Executive Orders 1:22:14 Action &amp; Optimism 1:27:45 Audience Questions</p> <p>------ Resources:</p> <p>Kevin on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/owocki?s=20&amp;t=O_vNoy9YMBatb8lIbf9ByA">https://twitter.com/owocki?s=20&amp;t=O_vNoy9YMBatb8lIbf9ByA</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Erik on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees?s=20&amp;t=O_vNoy9YMBatb8lIbf9ByA"> https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees?s=20&amp;t=O_vNoy9YMBatb8lIbf9ByA</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Andrew on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYang?s=20&amp;t=O_vNoy9YMBatb8lIbf9ByA">https://twitter.com/AndrewYang?s=20&amp;t=O_vNoy9YMBatb8lIbf9ByA</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lobby3: <a href="https://twitter.com/Lobby3D?s=20&amp;t=q417PS_HIJMGmpXqJYhPVg">https://twitter.com/Lobby3D?s=20&amp;t=q417PS_HIJMGmpXqJYhPVg</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Take the Green Pill: <a href="https://greenpill.party/">https://greenpill.party/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Decentralised Identity is changing the world, one bit at a time, and it won’t be long before it becomes a wave that will encompass all of us. This concept is gaining a lot of ground quickly because it enables every entity to own his or her identity and use it just the way one&nbsp;chooses.</p><p>In other words, it is an approach where every individual stores his or her Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and shares it with only those organisations that the individual chooses to. This is a revolutionary concept as it takes away data from centralised databases and authorities and empowers users to own and control their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Since Decentralisation is a relatively new concept, we have many organisations like Affinidi that are working to make this a reality. The umbrella organisation that provides the necessary support and guidelines is called the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF).</p> What is&nbsp;DIF? <p>DIF is an organisation involved in developing a new identity ecosystem. To this end, it strives to create the foundational components that would provide an open and standards-based ecosystem for people and organisations to leverage for app development and interoperability across platforms and&nbsp;devices.</p><p>DIF members play a role in developing the specification and emerging standards for protocols, components, and data formats that would facilitate the adoption of decentralised identities. Along with shaping the standards, these members also create the technical components and protocols to advance the common interests of everyone in the decentralised space.</p> Affinidi’s Role in&nbsp;DIF <p>At <a href="https://affinidi.com/">Affinidi</a>, we value our association with DIF. Our mission is to empower users to own and control their data and in the process, enjoy the highest possible levels of privacy and security.</p><p>Our association with DIF is a natural extension of what we do at Affinidi. To further our mission, we have been creating the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-can-you-do-with-affinidis-sdk-1966f4fef042">building blocks</a> for empowering individuals and organisations to control their verifiable data and through this data, unlock value across platforms and geographies.</p><p>As a member of DIF, we have been playing an important role in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/">educating audiences</a> about the importance of owning their data. We have also been working with other DIF members and the decentralised community at large to understand the existing gaps and expectations and to shape the standards accordingly.</p><p>In particular, Affinidi has been at the forefront in building many components such as the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-affinidis-digital-wallet-1c2a52b4d13f">Affinidi Wallet</a>, Schema Manager, <a href="https://build.affinidi.com/">Consent Manager</a>, and more that have enhanced the adoption of decentralised identity among communities and individuals.</p><p>In continuation of our efforts in this space, we will be participating in the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/difcon-f2f-virtual-3-tickets-162786327287">DifCon F2F Virtual Community Meeting</a> happening on the 24th of February&nbsp;2022.</p><p>If you are curious to know more about Affinidi’s role as a member of DIF and its contributions in this space, join our sessions on Consent Management and Schema Manager.

  <p>For large enterprise companies, boundaries around each team are crucial for maintaining systems that are owned by software engineers. This is accomplished by allowing individual teams to own their systems and expose them via APIs.</p>

<p>You also need to keep certain types of cross-cutting concerns centralized, like select security controls, logging, and routing. If you don’t, every API across different teams has to implement common controls like rate-limiting, logging, and authentication. This can lead to maintainability and consistency issues.</p>

<p>However, the <a href="https://engineering.salesforce.com/api-federation-growing-scalable-api-landscapes-a0f1f0dad506">API Federation</a> pattern keeps cross-cutting concerns located in one centralized lightweight API gateway. For example, by having a centralized place where rate-limiting is processed, and HTTP headers are returned for your company’s APIs, each API is kept consistent from the perspective of your clients.</p>

<p>The gateway also short-circuits requests that otherwise might use unnecessary resources. Protecting internal APIs and microservices from <a href="https://www.kentik.com/kentipedia/ddos-detection/">DDoS detection</a> can be added in one place, which safeguards backend services.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this article, you’ll learn how to build <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/microservices-architecture">.NET microservices</a> that are federated via another .NET API gateway. You’ll see how using an API gateway can protect internal services from the outside world by allowing the gateway to handle authentication using <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta’s</a> authentication services. These are easily integrated into our .NET microservice.</p>

 What Is API federation? 

<p>APIs are foundational to modern software development. They enable distributed systems to communicate with each other in a way that allows different teams to build their own systems autonomously.</p>

<p>Larger organizations need to be able to keep cross-cutting and security concerns at a higher-level abstraction so that individual API teams don’t need to worry about them.</p>

<p>API federation addresses this need by centralizing cross-cutting and security concerns into a gateway. All incoming API traffic can have security controls applied such as <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-mitigation/">DDoS protection</a>, <a href="https://avinetworks.com/glossary/ssl-termination/">SSL termination</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting">rate-limiting</a>, and will proxy those requests to internal services.</p>

<p>In this article, you’ll be using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/federated-identity">federated identity</a> approach. This enables authentication and authorization to be handled by one team or system (i.e., API gateway) so that other internal teams and APIs don’t have to worry about cross-cutting concerns.</p>

<p>Other architectural patterns like <a href="https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/#bff">Backends For Frontends</a> use this same approach of placing API gateways in front of other internal microservices for similar reasons.</p>

 Before you begin 

<p>To proceed through this tutorial, you’ll need the following tools installed:</p>

 
   <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker Desktop</a> 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio 2022 for Windows</a> 
   The latest version of the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download">.NET SDK</a> (This should be installed by Visual Studio.) 
   <a>Postman Desktop App</a> 
   A free <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer account</a> 
 

 Build .NET microservices 

<p>Let’s start building the foundation of your .NET projects and solutions.</p>

<p>First, navigate to an empty folder where you will start building your .NET solution and projects. Create a folder named <code>/src</code> and navigate to <code>/src</code> in a terminal.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll create two internal microservices and the API gateway. To do this, execute the following commands:</p>

 
   <code>dotnet new webapi -o Service1 --no-https -f net6.0</code> 
   <code>dotnet new webapi -o Service2 --no-https -f net6.0</code> 
   <code>dotnet new webapi -o ServiceGateway --no-https -f net6.0</code> 
 

<p>In order to build and link all the .NET projects together, you’ll need to create a new solution by running <code>dotnet new sln</code>.</p>

<p>To add all the projects to the new solution, run:</p>

 
   <code>dotnet sln src.sln add Service1/Service1.csproj</code> 
   <code>dotnet sln src.sln add Service2/Service2.csproj</code> 
   <code>dotnet sln src.sln add ServiceGateway/ServiceGateway.csproj</code> 
 

<p>To get the projects ready for the next steps, remove the <code>Controllers</code> folder and the <code>WeatherController.cs</code> file from all three projects.</p>

 Create a proxy gateway 

<p>The API gateway is a lightweight service that executes cross-cutting concern logic and then forwards the original request to the appropriate internal microservice API.</p>

<p>In your IDE, create a new file C# class named <code>ProxyExtensions</code> in the root of the  <code>ServiceGateway</code> project. This file will have a couple of extension methods to perform the logic needed to proxy HTTP requests to other microservices. Extension methods in C# are a great way to create reusable methods that are tucked away in their own file.</p>

<p>Replace its contents with the following:</p>

   <code>namespace ServiceGateway
{
  public static class ProxyExtensions
  {
    private static readonly int StreamCopyBufferSize = 81920;

    public static HttpRequestMessage CreateProxyHttpRequest(this HttpContext context, Uri uri)
    {
      var request = context.Request;

      var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage();
      var requestMethod = request.Method;
      if (!HttpMethods.IsGet(requestMethod) &amp;&amp;
          !HttpMethods.IsHead(requestMethod) &amp;&amp;
          !HttpMethods.IsDelete(requestMethod) &amp;&amp;
          !HttpMethods.IsTrace(requestMethod))
      {
        var streamContent = new StreamContent(request.Body);
        requestMessage.Content = streamContent;
      }

      // Copy the request headers
      foreach (var header in request.Headers)
      {
        if (!requestMessage.Headers.TryAddWithoutValidation(header.Key, header.Value.ToArray()) &amp;&amp; requestMessage.Content != null)
        {
          requestMessage.Content?.Headers.TryAddWithoutValidation(header.Key, header.Value.ToArray());
        }
      }

      requestMessage.Headers.Host = uri.Authority;
      requestMessage.RequestUri = uri;
      requestMessage.Method = new HttpMethod(request.Method);

      return requestMessage;
    }

    public static async Task CopyProxyHttpResponse(this HttpContext context, HttpResponseMessage responseMessage)
    {
      if (responseMessage == null)
      {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(responseMessage));
      }

      var response = context.Response;

      response.StatusCode = (int)responseMessage.StatusCode;
      foreach (var header in responseMessage.Headers)
      {
        response.Headers[header.Key] = header.Value.ToArray();
      }

      foreach (var header in responseMessage.Content.Headers)
      {
        response.Headers[header.Key] = header.Value.ToArray();
      }

      // SendAsync removes chunking from the response. This removes the header, so it doesn't expect a chunked response.
      response.Headers.Remove("transfer-encoding");

      using var responseStream = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();
      await responseStream.CopyToAsync(response.Body, StreamCopyBufferSize, context.RequestAborted);
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>These two methods allow your gateway to forward/proxy requests and responses to the original client transparently. This code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspLabs/blob/main/src/Proxy/src/ProxyAdvancedExtensions.cs">AspLabs GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: a hand-built .NET-base API gateway could be beneficial when you need full control of how your gateway behaves (i.e.,  if you’re building a really complex internal API gateway), don’t want dependencies on third-party services, or as a proof-of-concept. In production scenarios, you may want to use a product like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/?cdn=disable#overview">Azure API Management</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a> instead of a hand-built .NET application API gateway. These tools come with common cross-cutting tooling like routing, rate-limiting, static content caching, HTTP caching, SSL termination, etc., so you don’t have to code them by hand. Often, you can leverage infrastructure-as-code tools like <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/infrastructure-as-code">Terraform</a> to keep your API gateway easy to maintain and scalable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, replace the <code>ServiceGateway/Program.cs</code> file with the following (you’ll add more to this file later.):</p>

   <code>using ServiceGateway;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

var app = builder.Build();

// Expose the gateway via port "4300"
app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4300");

app.UseRouting();

// We're routing clients to internal microservices, which many times
// will have different public and internal URLs. Gateways can help to
// keep routing centralized as a cross-cutting and customer-focused concern.
app.MapGet("/warehouse", async context =&gt;
{
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();

    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri("http://localhost:4301/inventory"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});

app.MapGet("/sales/sku/{sku:required}", async context =&gt;
{
    var sku = context.Request.RouteValues["sku"];
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();
    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri($"http://localhost:4302/sku/{sku}"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Your gateway service will now accept two routes, and proxy the requests to the appropriate internal microservice.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to configure these two services. Replace <code>Service1/Program.cs</code> with the following:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4301");

app.UseRouting();

app.MapGet("/inventory", () =&gt; "Total inventory is 721 items");

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Then, replace <code>Service2/Program.cs</code> with:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4302");

app.UseRouting();

app.MapGet("/sku/{sku:required}", (string sku) =&gt; $"You're looking at SKU {sku}!");

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Both of these files make the services listen to traffic on a custom port so that all three microservices can run on your machine at the same time. These services return static content so that you can focus on the orchestration of the gateway and microservices.</p>

<p>Now, it’s time to try to run it. Open up three separate terminals (any terminal should work). Navigate to the root directory for each of the .NET projects you created and execute <code>dotnet run</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To test the API gateway, run the following request in Postman:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should see some HTTP headers and the HTTP body “You’re looking at SKU 1234!”</p>

<p>Here’s what the current topology looks like:</p>

<p></p>

 Add Okta auth to your API gateway 

<p>In the next steps, you’ll add authentication to your API gateway. By placing authentication in the gateway, any internal microservices or APIs can trust that requests coming from the gateway have already been authenticated.</p>

<p>Here, you’ll be using the API gateway to proxy requests for API access tokens to Okta behind the scenes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In these next steps, you’ll be utilizing your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta account</a>.</p>

<p>Once signed into <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a>, you’ll be at the home page/dashboard. Navigate to Applications on the left-hand menu, and click the Create App Integration button. Choose API Services, and create a name for your app.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take note of your Okta domain, <code>client_id</code>, and <code>client_secret</code> for later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll need to create a dummy security scope for your API integration. On the left-hand menu again, click on Security &gt; API. In the list of authorization servers, click the Edit button for the default server. Then, click on the Scopes tab and the Add Scope button. Make sure the Default Scope checkbox is selected, and choose any name for your scope.</p>

<p>Copy the Okta domain that’s displayed and add it to your <code>ServiceGateway/appsettings.json</code> file:</p>

   <code>  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "https://dev-1234.okta.com"
  }
</code>   

<p>Next, navigate to the <code>ServiceGateway</code> project folder in a terminal and run <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore</code>. This will install the Okta .NET library that will help your gateway to authenticate incoming requests.</p>

<p>Finally, copy the following code and replace <code>ServiceGateway/Program.cs</code> with it:</p>

   <code>using Okta.AspNetCore;
using ServiceGateway;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

// Configure authentication middleware
AddAuthMiddleware(builder);

var app = builder.Build();

app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4300");

// Federated Logging
app.Use(async (context, next) =&gt;
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Request for \"{context.Request.Path}\"");
    await next();
});

// Federated Rate-Limiting
app.Use(async (context, next) =&gt;
{
    context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Rate-Limit-Limit", "infinite");
    await next();
});

app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

// Using Okta to generate tokens by forwarding the request.
// To your clients, if you strip out Okta specific response headers,
// they would have no idea that Okta is being used as the identity
// provider!
app.MapPost("/token", async context =&gt;
{
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();

    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri($"{builder.Configuration["Okta:Domain"]}/oauth2/default/v1/token"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});


app.MapGet("/warehouse", async context =&gt;
{
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();

    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri("http://localhost:4301/inventory"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});

app.MapGet("/sales/sku/{sku:required}", async context =&gt;
{
    var sku = context.Request.RouteValues["sku"];
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();
    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri($"http://localhost:4302/sku/{sku}"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
}).RequireAuthorization();

app.Run();

void AddAuthMiddleware(WebApplicationBuilder builder)
{
    // This method is all it takes to use Okta to automatically test incoming
    // bearer tokens for authentication!
    builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
    {
        options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultSignInScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
    })
    .AddOktaWebApi(new OktaWebApiOptions()
    {
        OktaDomain = builder.Configuration["Okta:Domain"],
    });
    
    builder.Services.AddAuthorization();
}
</code>   

<p>Again, open up three separate terminals and navigate to the root directory for each of the .NET projects you created. Run all three services by executing <code>dotnet run</code> in each terminal.</p>

<p>You’ll have to provide a bearer token to the gateway service in order to access <code>/sales/sku/&lt;sku&gt;</code> but <code>/warehouse</code> will not require any authentication.</p>

<p>To get an access token to access <code>/sales/sku/&lt;sku&gt;</code>, you’ll need to execute the following request in Postman by using your own <code>client_id</code> and <code>client_secret</code> values:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should have a response with the <code>access_token</code> displayed. Copy the token and then issue the following request using Postman to replace the bearer token with your access token:</p>

<p></p>

<p>If implemented correctly, you should see a successful response!</p>

 Use Docker to run the solution 

<p>In Visual Studio, right-click each project and click on Add &gt; Docker Support. Then, choose Linux as the target OS. This will add a <code>Dockerfile</code> to each project that will be configured to build and run the .NET application with sensible defaults.</p>

<p>Right-click the <code>ServiceGateway</code> project and choose Add &gt; Container orchestration support. Choose Docker Compose and then Linux as the target OS. This step will add a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Replace the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file with the following:</p>

   <code>version: '3.4'

services:
  servicegateway:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}servicegateway
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ServiceGateway/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4300:80"
  service1:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}service1
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Service1/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4301:80"
  service2:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}service2
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Service2/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4302:80"
</code>   

<p>This will configure each project to become exposed at the ports you used earlier, except now Docker is responsible for exposing the proper ports.</p>

<p>In the <code>Program.cs</code> file for the three .NET projects you created, remove the <code>Urls</code> code that looks like:</p>

   <code>app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;");
</code>   

<p>In the <code>ServiceGateway</code> project’s <code>Program.cs</code> file, replace the two URLs for the internal microservice routes with <code>http://host.docker.internal:&lt;port&gt;</code> instead of <code>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>For example, the code for the external <code>/warehouse</code> route will now become the internal URL of <code>http://host.docker.internal:4301/inventory</code>.</p>

<p>At the top of Visual Studio 2022, there will be a new launch profile available called “Docker Compose.”</p>

<p>Use the same Postman request as earlier to fetch your token:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, using that token, you can make requests to the <code>/sales/sku/&lt;sku&gt;</code> path:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you can run all your microservices and the API gateway and test them.</p>

 What you learned about API federation in .NET 

<p>In this tutorial, you built the skeleton of the API gateway and two .NET microservices, which were all exposed on specific ports.</p>

<p>You also learned how to use <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/">Okta’s Client Credentials API token endpoint</a> to retrieve a server-to-server access token by using your API gateway as a proxy. With Okta’s <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-aspnet">Okta.AspNetCore</a> library, you then enabled your API gateway to process and validate incoming access tokens.</p>

<p>In the end, you had the entire suite of services running in one click by using Docker Compose.</p>

<p>You can check out the completed project at <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-dotnet-microservices">this Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>Il 2022 è un anno cruciale per l’avanzamento del PNRR, in cui la “messa a terra” degli indirizzi di policy diventa il tema principale. </p>



<p>Di fronte a questa sfida sarà fondamentale concentrare gli sforzi organizzativi e operativi di tutti, facendo leva su alcuni fondamentali punti di snodo del Piano: il rapporto con il mondo economico; il rapporto della PA centrale con gli enti locali; il rapporto con l’Europa.</p>



 Mercoledì 23 febbraio dalle ore 11:00 alle ore 13:00, evento in live streaming. 







 



<p>Il prossimo 23 febbraio, Danilo Cattaneo – Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert – interverrà al webinar organizzato dal CED – Centro Economia Digitale, prendendo parte alla tavola rotonda dal titolo “Next Generation Italia – EXECUTION”. L’evento si svolgerà presso la Luiss Business School e verrà trasmesso in streaming.</p>



<p>L’obiettivo dell’evento è analizzare le sfide che dovrà affrontare il Paese per concretizzare delle proposte operative utili all’implementazione del Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza approvato dal governo, il quale metterà a disposizione di Imprese e Pubblica Amministrazione i fondi necessari per effettuare una svolta fondamentale su temi quali: Transizione Digitale, Transizione Ecologica e Mezzogiorno.</p>



<p>L’apertura dei lavori è affidata al Chairman dell’evento: Rosario Cerra – Fondatore e Presidente del Centro Economia Digitale, dopo il quale prenderanno la parola:</p>



  Adelaide Mozzi – Team Leader Affari Economici, Commissione Europea, Rappr. in Italia;  Paolo Boccardelli – Comitato Scientifico CED, Direttore Luiss Business School;  Francesco Crespi – Direttore Ricerche CED, Professore Economia Università Roma Tre.

<p>Durante la Tavola Rotonda dal titolo “Next Generation Italia – EXECUTION”,oltre a Danilo Cattaneo – CEO di InfoCert, interverranno:</p>



  Andrea Falessi – Direttore Relazioni Esterne Open Fiber;  Filippo Maria Grasso – Direttore Relazioni Istituzionali Italia Leonardo;  Nicola Lanzetta – Amministratore Delegato Enel Italia;  Dario Pagani – Head of Digital &amp; Information Technology ENI;  Alessandro Picardi – Executive Vice President Chief Public Affairs Officer TIM.  



<p>Interverranno inoltre a seguire:</p>



  Andrea Montanino – Direttore Strategie Settoriali e Impatto CDP;  Roberta Lombardi – Assessore Transizione Ecologica e Trasformazione Digitale Regione Lazio;  Fabio Melilli – Presidente Commissione Bilancio, Tesoro e Programmazione Camera dei Deputati;  Anna Ascani – Sottosegretario di Stato Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico.  



<p>L’evento si concluderà alle 12:30 con l’intervento di Federico D’Incà – Ministro per i Rapporti con il Parlamento.</p>



<p>Modera Flavia Giacobbe – Direttore Formiche.net.</p>



<blockquote><p>“L’approvazione del PNRR sancisce non solo la disponibilità di ingenti risorse finanziare per il rilancio dell’economia, ma, soprattutto, un’occasione storica per realizzare un cambiamento strutturale fondato sulla capacità trasformativa dell’innovazione e della diffusione delle tecnologie digitali. Queste possono in particolare svolgere un ruolo cruciale per facilitare il passaggio da un modello produttivo basato sulla competitività di costo a uno basato sulla competitività tecnologica, che fa leva su investimenti continui in nuove tecnologie, attività di ricerca e innovazione. È questo secondo modello che deve diventare prevalente in Italia, poiché è quello in grado di fornire una spinta più forte e duratura alla dinamica della produttività e della crescita.”</p>Rosario Cerra – Fondatore e Presidente del Centro Economia Digitale</blockquote>

<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
<p>Andy Best is the CEO of the Civic Digital Network (CDN), a non-profit organization working to create national data infrastructure.</p>
<p>CDN’s mission is to give the public sector the tools to meet the challenges of the coming century. How do you enable responsible economic activity in the current digital era? What is the government’s proper role to facilitate, regulate and legislate to create the maximum social and economic public and private good.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p><br>
During this conversation, we discuss:<br>
</p>
 
 What are Intangible Assets, the Intangible Economy – and why leaders should care about them? 
 How do you approach Policy around Public Data Institutions, without making them too restrictive which can have negative impacts on private sector innovation? 
 Why Policy Makers must look at Intangible Assets (such as software and data) very differently than Tangible Assets (roads and bridges). 
 How to ensure the Right Controls are put in place for Public Data Utility programs? 
 Why taking a Use Case Lens in the deployment of Public Infrastructure programs is the only approach. 
 How Municipalities who adopt the right public data programs can increase the prosperity of their citizens. 
 Why Government should view standards as part of their regulatory frameworks. 
 
 
 
 
<p>And more!</p>
<p>Note that although this conversation is mostly framed around Canadian context, the key fundamental frameworks discussed are applicable across various democratic systems.</p>

			 The Truth &amp; Nonsense of Blockchain Interoperability 
 
<p>As we acquire more and more financial institutions as customers, a recurring question arises:&nbsp;Are Tokeny’s solutions interoperable/multichain/chain agnostic/magical?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is: “Yes, but…”&nbsp;In fact, if you’re a regular reader of our newsletter, you may recall that last May we talked about our&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/the-era-of-blockchain-interoperability-begins/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--j7MsdjfwUyCqjWUXnZP2xCM7LIgseefqpgewCIY9hBTjJiUx1s5Uj1MsOIT7ckyuI3GLo">partnership with Polygon</a>, a framework for building and connecting blockchain networks in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem. That marked the beginning of our cross-chain solutions. Since then, we have&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/enegra-migrates-digitized-equity-tokens-from-ethereum-to-polygon-blockchain?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--j7MsdjfwUyCqjWUXnZP2xCM7LIgseefqpgewCIY9hBTjJiUx1s5Uj1MsOIT7ckyuI3GLo">migrated $28 billion worth of tokenized equity</a>&nbsp;and other assets from Ethereum to Polygon.</p>
<p>So, what is the EVM ecosystem? In short,&nbsp;EVM-compatible blockchain networks share the same technology stack. It is like if EVM was a Nespresso coffee machine,&nbsp;the smart contracts are coded in the same programming language Solidity, much like the capsules for the Nespresso coffee machine, you could choose Starbucks or L’OR coffee based on your needs, but they are all compatible with the coffee machine. It enables very interesting features: for example,&nbsp;wallets can be switched from one network to another but with the same address. Now, Tokeny is even able to get the same smart contract address on different blockchains.&nbsp;However, the consensus mechanism and the participants can be totally different. These blockchain networks can be public or private.</p>
<p>Non-EVM-compatible blockchains&nbsp;such as Tezos and Solana, on the other hand, don’t share the same technology basis. Each of them is like a different coffee machine that takes different capsules, as they&nbsp;use different programming languages. E.g. SmartPy and LIGO for Tezos, and Rust C &amp; C++ for Solana.</p>
<p>In order to allow blockchains to “communicate” with each other, “bridges” were created.&nbsp;A bridge solution is a set of smart contracts that freeze tokens on one blockchain, then create their representation on another blockchain.&nbsp;For example, you can move tokenized assets from Ethereum to Polygon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many people have asked us how to&nbsp;make Corda, or other private networks, interoperable with EVM blockchains&nbsp;such as Polygon, in order to access its active ecosystem of users. It is possible, but these systems work totally different. Can you use a fax to send an email? Yes, but it is not done for this.&nbsp;An additional system or intermediary will need to be set up, and it becomes a potential point of failure, increasing risk.&nbsp;We saw this no later than last week with the hack of the Wormhole bridge connecting Solana and Ethereum, where $300m+ was stolen.</p>
<p>From day one at Tokeny, we chose to not build the blockchain network itself but to&nbsp;use public blockchains, with an active ecosystem of developers and users.&nbsp;On top of these resilient infrastructures, as they are decentralized,&nbsp;we are bringing compliance and control with a complete suite of business applications.</p>
<p>We want our customers to be able to choose which blockchain network suits their needs.&nbsp;For the moment, the EVM environment and especially the Polygon network is the best fit for tokenized securities. We migrated 2 more tokens last week, so the issuers and token holders are benefiting from a highly-efficient infrastructure. That’s what we call interoperability in early 2022.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, we <a href="https://twitter.com/jhipster/status/1466081146056450054">launched</a> the JHipster Community Survey. The goal was to get feedback from the community about the most useful features and components, things that are missing, and where we should focus our attention to make the project even better for everyone.</p>

<p>We got over 500 responses; thank you all for taking the time to contribute and share the survey with your community! Now let’s take a look at the results!</p>

 How do you use JHipster? 

<p>The first section of questions was dedicated to understanding the most common scenarios in which JHipster is used, and how exactly, so we can focus our efforts accordingly.</p>

<p>Which client-side frameworks do you use with JHipster?</p>

<p>The most commonly used framework in the JHipster community is Angular, with 68.3% of respondents making it their #1 choice. React is in second place with 35.3% votes, and the rest of the votes are distributed between Vue.js, Svelte, and using none:</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rzshsgnb54kdn71elk1n.png">
</a></p>

<p>What kind of applications do you create with JHipster?</p>

<p>It was very interesting to understand what kind of applications developers are building with JHipster. SPA/Monolith is a clear winner (78.3%), with Microservices being a close second (60.8%). Gateways and Server-only projects were equally popular:</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2yc37cvl4s8y636t18e5.png">
</a></p>

<p>Outside Java/Spring Boot, do you use other languages/frameworks supported by JHipster?</p>

<p>Many developers use JHipster for Java and Spring Boot projects, but do they use it for other platforms and frameworks? Yes; Node.js, Kotlin, and Flutter are quite popular, as well as such frameworks as Quarkus, Ionic, React Native, and Micronaut.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8knap4ilrmnjgnj6991j.png">
</a></p>

<p>What is one thing you love about JHipster?</p>

<p>This was an open question, where everyone could share what they like about JHipster in any form. Some of the most popular answers were the following:</p>

 
   Easy bootstrapping of web applications 
   Use of best practices and standards 
   Eliminating routine work and getting to production fast 
   Enabling unit and integration tests 
   Using latest technologies and open source stack 
   Flexibility and customizations out of the box 
   Continuous support and community 
 

<p>… and many other things.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for this great feedback!</p>

<p>What can be improved?</p>

<p>We also asked to identify one thing people hate about JHipster, so we can improve it. Many users said there is no such thing! :) Others pointed out that improving some of the documentation, the upgrade process, entities update, and adding more tutorials, in particular for various cloud platforms, would be great.</p>

<p>How would you rate the quality of generated code?</p>

<p>78.3% of users rated the quality of the code, generated by JHipster, as 8 out of 10 or higher!</p>

 JHipster’s Roadmap 

<p>Some of the most interesting and at the same time challenging questions to answer for each project are about the roadmap. Which features should we prioritize? What is missing? Are our current plans and assumptions right, or do our users feel differently? To get night into that, we asked our users several questions about the roadmap.</p>

<p>What features would you like to see in JHipster?</p>

<p>All of the options that we put up for voting - micro frontends, GraphQL support and GraalVM Native Image support, are highly anticipated by the community. Some of the features suggested by the community, were support for TypeScript, DynamoDB, Flyway, Redis and Vert.x, extended Neo4J support, and Python support, along with introducing app templates and entity-based application dashboards, and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vbbzqtsdla5zcdw7a5sf.png">
</a></p>

<p>If you could improve the getting started experience for JHipster, what would you change?</p>

<p>A few users suggested having a minimalistic version of Jhipster, which is already addressed with the recent announcement of <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-lite">JHipster Lite</a> — go and give it a try, if you haven’t yet!</p>

<p>Other suggestions were to have more project samples, a simple JDL sample (like “Book” and “Author”), outlining best practices for upgrading, creating sample projects with various integrations, and adding more short explainer videos and step-by-step tutorials for beginners.</p>

 JHipster User Profile 

<p>We also asked a few questions to better understand who our users are, and in what context they are using JHipster.</p>

<p>First, a few short facts:</p>

 
   Most of JHipster users define their programming level experience as “Experienced” (50.7%) or “Expert” (27.7%). Only 5% of them are beginners; 
   Most of them also learned about JHipster from a colleague or via GitHub; 
   For the majority of users (65%), JHipster is an integral part of their workflow; 
   42% of respondents’ companies approve using JHipster. 
 

<p>And a few more details about developers using JHipster.</p>

<p>Which programming languages do you regularly use?</p>

<p>Another question we asked was about programming languages. Almost all our respondents use Java (96.1%), which is not surprising since a lot of JHipster’s backend options are Java-based. JavaScript is also popular (61.9%), probably primarily for the front-end part. Python and Kotlin are next, which also corresponds to feature request data we’ve seen before. 9% of the users also chose C# and Golang:</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3pe5dy80yaqv8lnyuest.png">
</a></p>

<p>Have you ever made contributions to the project?</p>

<p>JHipster is lucky to have a very active and engaged community. Every third community member helped the project by providing feedback via <a href="https://github.com/jhipster">GitHub</a>, and every fourth created content about it, such as blog posts, event talks, etc. Other contributions, such as sending code PRs, contributing to docs, and helping other developers, are extremely valuable and improve the project for everyone.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sp0oethhqygt2c8z29pp.png">
</a></p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Thanks again to everyone for taking the time to provide this feedback. We will go through the suggestions with the core team, and will use the results to adjust the project plans.</p>

<p>Some of the most requested features are already on our roadmap, with ongoing work happening and bounties on them — feel to contribute or share your thoughts in corresponding GitHub tickets!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Are you bothered by the ubiquitous dichotomy between delivering to urgent demand and delivering to a strategy for your organization’s IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management)? The one good news on that is that you are not alone. But there is more good news: You can get both, without unreasonable extra effort and without endlessly delaying any delivery. It is work and it will require some investment in time and maybe in money. But it works and it is an already proven approach.<br><br></p>
<p>Not every practice qualifies for “best” practice<br><br>The magic word in that is “best practices”. Best practices in the sense of the word. Unfortunately, a lot of what is sold as best practice is indeed an established practice, but by far no best practice (anymore). It might have been a best practice once in the past, or at least a proven practice. “Proven” and related terms are the alarm signals in that. What has been great for the last 10 years does not always qualify for the best practice when evolving your IAM (or other areas of your business) into the future.<br>A real best practice must have a proven element, as in practice. But it must also deliver to the future demands. A best practice thus must contain a significant degree of flexibility, to adapt to changes, such as new themes and technologies emerging in IAM.</p>
<p><br>Identity Fabrics: Proven &amp; adaptive<br><br>Over the past years, KuppingerCole Analysts has developed and publicized the concept of Identity Fabrics. Identity Fabrics are not a fixed architecture, but a framework and guideline that describes a modern, future-proof, and adaptive IAM, but also the path towards it.<br>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The KuppingerCole Analysts Identity Fabrics provides a framework for both architecting a modern, future-proof IAM and for the gradual modernization of the legacy IAM.</p>
<p><br>This approach delivers what a best practice must include:<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a proven approach that has been incorporated by several companies already<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a proven approach that influences the work of several providers of IAM solutions already<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is adaptive because the set of capabilities, the definition of the services, and the tools in use are adaptive and can evolve with changing requirements<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It thus also is future-proof, because it isn’t static<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It also is future-proof because it focuses on modernization towards an IAM that covers all types of identities, all types of services, and delivers to the needs of businesses building digital services<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It focuses on modern architectures and strong support for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)<br>In the work we have done in research and advisories over the past years, since the introduction of the Identity Fabrics model, the model has proven to deliver to both concrete challenges around delivering to current demand or IAM modernization, and to building a vision, strategy, blueprint, and roadmap for the future IAM.</p>
<p><br>Identity Fabrics: Some insights<br><br>Without explaining all the details of Identity Fabrics, where we already have published a Leadership Compass, a Leadership Brief on utilizing the concept on the journey towards IDaaS, a Leadership Brief introducing the concept, multiple whitepapers, and many blogs and videos, there are some aspects that deserve being highlighted in the context of this blog post.<br>One is that Identity Fabrics go beyond traditional IAM in supporting an inside-out and an outside-in approach on IAM. The inside-out IAM is what most solutions support: They manage accounts and entitlements in target systems, or they, e.g., sit in front of applications and do the authentication. The outside-in approach is different: IAM serves requests of applications and digital services at runtime, as a backend service, via APIs. This paradigm shift is not entirely new, but gaining attention and momentum in the digital age.<br>Another important element in the concept of Identity Fabrics is the support for migration from legacy IAM to a modern solution at the pace of the customer. Identity Fabrics can integrate with legacy IAM solutions. Moreover, existing IAM solutions can even form a part of the Identity Fabric as tools delivering services and capabilities needed, if the IAM technology in use is sufficiently modern.<br>This “sufficiently modern” involves support for deployment in as-a-service models and strong support for IAM as well as modern, modular architecture.</p>
<p><br>Vision, Strategy, Blueprint, Roadmap<br><br>We are aware from many discussions that the IAM teams in organizations are concerned that they fear not to being able to master the effort and time needed for developing their own IAM vision, strategy, blueprint, and roadmap. Our practice has proven the opposite: It can work, and it can be done with a very reasonable effort, and within a reasonable time.<br>The advantage of the Identity Fabrics model is that it provides a mature framework and thus orientation for deriving a specific version that suits the state, the current, and the future requirements of organizations, as well as providing the link to the existing IAM infrastructure.<br>The main effort is in two related areas:<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Requirements analysis<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scoping &amp; prioritization<br>The advisory team at KuppingerCole Analysts has developed efficient methodologies for identifying the high-level requirements, defining the scope, and prioritizing the various capabilities and thus the services and tools required to deliver these. Within a few weeks and a couple of workshops, the vision for the future IAM, the customer-specific incarnation of the Identity Fabric including a high-level architectural blueprint, and a rough roadmap are set.<br>Like every strategy, blueprint, and roadmap, this is not carved in stone, but a living model that evolves with future trends and requirements. It can be easily adapted because the framework for itself remains consistent. Adding services, replacing tools, serving additional capabilities: All can be done within the Identity Fabrics framework.<br>The time (and money) spent on vision, strategy, blueprint, and roadmap following the Identity Fabrics framework are well-spent. To bring up an old analogy here: No one ever would start building a house without a plan. So, why build your future IAM without a plan, by just adding some tools here or there?</p>
<p><br>Deliver &amp; evolve: Balancing short-term demand with strategy<br><br>The other aspect that concerns organizations is the need to deliver to current, pressing demand, while executing a strategy. This dichotomy is not always easy to solve. However, having a strategy building on the Identity Fabrics paradigm also includes aspects such as strong API support, a modern architecture, and support for as-a-service delivery models. The Identity Fabric also provides a straightforward approach of mapping requirements to capabilities, services, and tools, and thus to identify overlaps to existing or planned technologies.<br>Thus, short-term requirements can be checked regarding their compatibility with the strategy and might become an element of the Identity Fabric. On the other hand, massive overlaps with existing components can also be easily identified, to avoid redundancy.<br>There also might be scenarios where some short-term solution stands in contrast to the requirements within the future Identity Fabric. If there is no alternative solution (in most cases, there is) that fits the strategy, such solutions should be defined and treated as tactical, with a limited life span and a defined migration strategy.</p>
<p><br>The legacy aspect: Embrace, extend &amp; replace<br><br>Finally, there is the legacy. Most large organizations have some level of legacy IAM in place. In many organizations, these also serve complex legacy IT such as mainframe or SAP environments. The effort for a rip &amp; replace approach in many cases is unreasonable. While the Identity Fabric is open to moving to modern solutions that support the legacy IT, it also is legitimate to use legacy IAM components as intermediaries to the legacy IT.<br>In the end, this is just a matter of economics and, to a certain extent, of pragmatism and prioritization. The economic aspect is about comparing the cost for licenses and operations of the legacy IAM with the cost of migrating it to more modern solutions. It can be more efficient to just keep the legacy IAM in the as-is-state and gradually move legacy IT to the Identity Fabric, or just retire legacy IT.<br>The aspect of pragmatism and prioritization applies to everything in the journey towards a modern Identity Fabric. You never will be able to do everything in parallel. Prioritization is key. This also holds true when it comes to the discussion about further utilizing some elements of legacy IAM: Sometimes, it is better to focus on adding new capabilities, while postponing migration. This just needs to be discussed, evaluated, and decided.</p>
<p><br>Modernize your IAM. Now.<br><br>The Identity Fabrics model helps in the journey from the legacy IAM to a modern, future-proof IAM. It has a lot of flexibility in planning and doing that journey. However, with the need to support more identities and services, and with the shift from an inside-out only approach on IAM to supporting both inside-out and outside-in approaches, there is a mandate to modernize your IAM. That journey must start now.<br><br>Don’t miss attending EIC 2022. You will benefit from plenty of sessions around the big theme of Identity Fabrics.<br><br></p>

Garner A Double Discount With&nbsp;GEM!<p>Introduction: Introducing GEMpay, A Blockchain Based Simple Payment&nbsp;Service!</p><p>The main issue that GEMpay aims to resolve surrounding payment services is eliminating the countless amounts of brokerages and contracts that are needed to issue a payment settlement for businesses. This can become tedious and often costly for the producer. Many preexisting contract structures that are created for convenience and risk structure of financial institutions often accompany high commission burdens to small business owners and simultaneously, franchise owners and consumers bear the economic trickle down burden from this financial model. It is evident that, from a global standpoint, small businesses have garnered more financial burden than they can take on, especially during the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>An Outline Of The Preexisting Payment&nbsp;Paradigm<p>Do Big Tech Platforms Make Life Better Or Is This A Subjective Claim?</p>Bearing The Burden Of Processing Costs With Big&nbsp;Tech<p>Did you know that, as of August 2021, big tech fees were 2–3 times higher than standard credit card companies. This is unacceptable as it creates an immense financial burden on small businesses. A 2–3 times higher fee exacerbates the already preexisting financial problems that small business owners face in 2022, and it must be stopped. The deposits are huge, but where are the financial benefits for small business owners and their loyal consumers?</p>The Great Balance Trend In&nbsp;Korea<p>Starbucks, an unregulated entity, spent 180 billion won as of 2020 from customers at their own will! While fintech companies are required to invest 100% of their customers money into safe assets by trusting them with an external agency, Starbucks is not subject to any restrictions or regulations. It can be pointed out that while Starbucks enjoys the benefits of a regulatory vacuum, it is increasingly passive in social contributions. (Reporter Lee Hyun-seung, Chosun&nbsp;Biz)</p><p>The Great Features Of GEMpay: What We&nbsp;Provide</p>THE GEMpay Service&nbsp;Flow<p>We want users to receive a discount from the GEMpay issuer (online and offline stores that issue points through the GEMpay Issuer Center). Through the asset management service (Defi, Cefi, point-secured loan) provided by GEMpay, users will directly determine the discount rate and risk for the deposit and receive additional discounts. So it is “double discount if you have GEM, GEMpay.” Our aim is to significantly increase the scope so that users can safely use their points, which are their assets. AERGO GEM used through GEMpay will guarantee 1:1 value with Korean Won during the payment process. It would be suitable for use as a payment method as there is no risk of fluctuations in&nbsp;value.</p><p>In addition, going beyond a simple payment method, we plan to allow users to directly determine the discount rate and risk by selecting an asset management service for deposits (AERGO GEM charged in GEMpay) according to the risk level of each product. Just as we are trying to guarantee AERGO GEM at a 1:1 value with KRW, we want to solve the rug pull risk for asset management services using a stable token&nbsp;method.</p><p>Making It Possible: We Aim To Make It Possible For The Issuer To Issue Points Simply And Transparently</p><p>We plan to allow the issuer (online or offline stores that issued points that issued points through the GEMpay issuer center) to directly determine the payment discount rate as the subject of the point of issuance without being dependent on a giant platform. The web-based GEMpay Admin (GEMpay Issuer Center) aims to eliminate the risk of SI performance by making it easy to issue points and easily request settlement.</p><p>🎯The GEMpay&nbsp;Roadmap</p>The GEMpay&nbsp;Roadmap<p>We plan to launch the beta version in the second quarter of 2022, starting with the opening of the pre-registration landing page beginning in March. Subsequently, in the third quarter, we plan to officially launch the GEMpay app and plan to provide a service for managing point assets with DeFi. With the goal of linking CeFi services and developing point collateral products by the end of the year, we are running to create a win-win service for both small business owners and consumers!</p> 💎If You Have GEM, You Garner A Double Discount With&nbsp;GEMpay!  💻March PoC And Advance Reservations Open  📍The GEMpay Two Line&nbsp;Summary   Point deposits are also&nbsp;assets!  GEMpay aims to create a smart and safe asset utilization plan, which allows for small business owners to easily issue, manage and settlement points directly without being dependent on large platforms.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-great-double-discount-with-gem-of-gempay-d6baa2899d0d">The Great Double Discount: With GEM Of GEMpay</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Danilo Cattaneo – CEO di InfoCert, Marco Ramilli – CEO di Yoroi e Giuseppe Tusa – Product Marketing Manager di InfoCert, alterneranno i loro interventi durante il webinar promosso congiuntamente da InfoCert e Yoroi, moderato da Arturo Di Corinto.</p>



<p>Martedì 22 Febbraio 2022 dalle ore 17:00 alle ore 18:00<br>(evento soggetto a iscrizione)</p>



<p>Di fronte alla nuova ondata di cyberattacchi, la cui efficacia è legata molto spesso alla capacità di ingannare gli utenti, inducendoli a cliccare su allegati o link all’apparenza innocui ma con conseguenze potenzialmente drammatiche, la sicurezza della PEC risulta a rischio.</p>



<p>La posta elettronica è il primo vettore di attacco per la diffusione di malware, ransomware, phishing, spam, ecc., con l’aumento repentino dello Smart Working, è stata registrata un’ulteriore esplosione dei cyber attacchi via mail che hanno superato il 94% del totale.</p>



<p>Già nel 2020, complice la crisi pandemica, l’incremento degli attacchi cyber a livello globale è stato pari al 12% rispetto all’anno precedente, nei quattro anni precedenti il trend di crescita si è mantenuto pressoché costante, facendo segnare un aumento degli attacchi gravi del 66% rispetto al 2017 (fonte Clusit).</p>



<p>La Posta Elettronica Certificata è diventata uno strumento irrinunciabile nella quotidianità, sia per i cittadini che per professionisti ed imprese, nel percepito degli utenti è uno strumento sicuro, e per tali motivi un canale sempre più appetibile per gli attacchi informatici.</p>



<p>Ma quale evoluzione avrà la PEC nell’immediato futuro? Come fare a renderla più sicura rispetto agli attacchi di phishing?</p>



<p>Danilo Cattaneo e Giuseppe Tusa per InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, e Marco Ramilli per Yoroi, società attiva nello sviluppo di sistemi integrati di difesa cibernetica, risponderanno a queste domande nel webinar in programma Martedì 22 Febbraio 2022 dalle ore 17:00 alle ore 18:00.</p>

<p>You can’t get much better than Spotify –&nbsp;some would even argue that it’s the patron saint of music, streaming here to rescue us all. The freemium business model has allowed users from across the world to access its extensive catalogue of songs and podcasts by simply registering their details. But is it as simple as we all think? Or is there a much bigger cost at hand?</p>



<p>Corporations that offer something for free always want something in return. As the most used audio streaming service in existence, boasting 356 million users, they have a staggering amount of data at their disposal.</p>



 But why does Spotify collect data? 



<p>We’re not saying that the type of data Spotify collects is bad. For years, companies of all sizes have followed our digital footprints! It’s something that we’ve all become used to. Brands like this use data to outline our behaviour patterns and target us with advertisements. However, it’s crucial that you understand the information platforms like this utilise.</p>



<p>But before we get started, it’s important to understand why Spotify collects data. As a business, they want to “provide, personalize, and improve your experience with the Spotify Service.”</p>



 The 12 slices of Spotify data 



<p>Brands as big as Spotify have a duty to be transparent with their customers when it comes to data. To achieve this and align with legislation across the world, Spotify allows its users to download it. If users choose to do this, they will find that it is split up into 12 key areas.</p>



 Playlist 
 Streaming History (audio, video, and podcasts) 
 Your Library 
 Search Queries 
 Follow 
 Payments 
 User Data 
 Family Plan 
 Inferences 
 Voice Input 
 Podcast Interactivity 
 Spotify for Artists 



<p>Spotify uses your behavioural data to make your experience with the app as personalised as possible. On Spotify’s <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/privacy">privacy policy</a>, they say they use your data for personalisation, troubleshooting, developing new features, marketing, research and other legal reasons.</p>



 How does Spotify use this data? 



<p>Remember when we mentioned that big corporations like Spotify always want something in return? Meet Spotify Advertising. If you’re a non-premium member of the app, you will be far too familiar with this. Using the data collected above, Spotify offers brands the ability to advertise to target users with their marketing campaigns. While this is nothing new in the world of advertising, it’s important to be aware of how they do this.</p>



<p>Similarly, to other platforms like Facebook, advertisers can reach people based on their age, gender, and location. Spotify works with advertising partners to share data and work out your interests and preferences. They can show advertising based on your current mood and activity, just by the genre and type of music you are listening to. For example, the selection of advertising that you see when relaxing to your romance playlist will differ from the playlist that you are working out to.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Spotify Wrapped is an example of how a company can conduct in-depth surveillance of our personal behavior over a long period of time and package it as a fun feature that we want to share with others. <a href="https://t.co/lY3yZwDl48">https://t.co/lY3yZwDl48</a></p>— CNN (@CNN) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1466659357832228869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2021</a></blockquote> 



 How can I stop my data being tracked on Spotify? 



<p>Like with many applications today, hidden in the settings of the platform you can limit this. To access these, users need to log in through the desktop app and account page. These are some of the settings that users can switch off:</p>



 Scrolling down to advanced settings, you can block “all cookies for this installation of the Spotify desktop app” and choose whether your playlists are made public or private. 
 Through your account page you can change the setting for “Tailored ads” where you can switch off highly targeted advertising. 
 Through these settings, you can turn off “Facebook data”. We highly suggest this as this stops any data that has been shared from Facebook. 
 You can view and remove what other apps have access to your Spotify account, and we’d recommend going through this, so you have no unwanted access from external sources. 
 Take back control of your data and download the <a href="https://revoke.onelink.me/OBid/746add1">Revoke</a> app today and ensure that you know who has your personal data! 



<p>Over the last few years, Spotify has truly taken on a life of its own. From Spotify Wrapped outing you for listening to Taylor Swift way more than you’d ever admit to it becoming the feature that brings your entire Tinder profile together.</p>

 Highlights <p>This week saw lots of work around Ontology technical developments, as work continues on preparing Ontology chain’s EVM. Good progress is being made to ensure the launch happens in quarter 1 of this year. As always, the community has been active across a number of platforms, discussing the progress of Ontology and looking at what the future of Web3 could look&nbsp;like.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have launched Ontology’s EVM TestNet. Developers are welcome to test it out. Related documents can be found at the <a href="https://docs.ont.io/">Ontology Developer Center</a>.  We have completed the development survey and testing on the improvement of the ONT and ONG decimals.  We are 95% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.  We are 85% done with the truebit challenge design&nbsp;survey.  We are 53% done with the Rollup VM&nbsp;design.   Product Development   ONTO hosted various online activities such as the NFT lottery campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/win-your-first-nft-puzzle-onto-joins-samurai-for-a-2-000-nft-lottery-8716315bdd43">Samurai</a>、<a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-and-haku-swap-team-up-for-a-4-000-liquidity-mining-campaign-278ada1e1d3">Haku Swap</a>、<a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-and-spartan-protocol-team-up-for-a-staking-campaign-with-3-000-up-for-grabs-d0fd13a44eed">Spartan Protocol</a> and <a href="https://gleam.io/cGg2x/onto-teams-up-with-move-network-for-1500-movd-giveaway">Move Network</a>. Participating with ONTO will earn rewards such as NFTs. Follow the <a href="https://t.me/ONTOAnnouncement">@ONTO Wallet Official Announcement</a> in Telegram for more&nbsp;details!   On-Chain Activity   125 total dApps on MainNet as of February 14th,&nbsp;2022.  6,893,839 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 3,564 from last&nbsp;week.  17,060,139 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 25,031 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1471563278023217152?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “Does Ontology realize interoperability?”. Ontology Harbingers shared the current progress of Ontology EVM. At present, Ontology has NativeVM, NeoVM and WasmVM, which can provide support for applications built on these three virtual machines. Most applications for Web3 are developed on Ethereum. The integration of the EVM will greatly improve the interoperability of Ontology, thereby providing the blockchain infrastructure and DID for both Web2 and Web3 applications. Ontology EVM will be officially launched on the mainnet soon, stay&nbsp;tuned.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He shared the progress of the Valentine’s Day special event: more than 150 community members submitted three-line love letters, which will be officially delivered by Ontology to the recipients designated by the participants.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Coin Rivet, a well-known blockchain media outlet, published an article “<a href="https://coinrivet.com/web3-will-transform-the-internet-we-know-today-says-ontology-founder/">Web3 will transform the internet we know today, says Ontology founder</a>”. Ontology’s founder Li Jun said “Web3 refers to the next era of the internet, a decentralised online ecosystem built upon blockchain, where data is collectively stored. Therefore, to become a Web3 application infrastructure, Ontology not only needs to provide high-quality DID and data solutions, but also needs to achieve high interoperability. We are looking forward to launching our EVM as it will increase cross-chain interoperability, which is key for Web3, and will expand our DID solutions across the ecosystem.”   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>The World Economic Forum — <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/web3-transform-the-internet?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social_scheduler&amp;utm_term=Internet+Governance&amp;utm_content=07/02/2022+05:00">Web3: The hype and how it can transform the&nbsp;internet</a></p><p>“The current internet, Web 2.0, relies on systems and servers owned largely by big corporations, raising concerns over system vulnerability and control. When Meta’s associated platforms suffered a global outage in early October — exacerbated by the centralization of its servers — there were calls to adopt Web3 and its decentralized architecture.”</p><p>In Web3, network interaction and data storage will rely on the decentralized network formed by blockchain, and DID technology will allow users to independently manage their own identity and data. At the same time, technical interconnection and interoperability will also become a key step to open up all systems of Web3 and allow data to flow throughout the entire network and value chain. In this process, Ontology will play the role of infrastructure provider, providing the best DID and data solutions for Web3, and providing the decentralized platform required for application construction.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

   You’ve probably heard of Elasticsearch or the Elastic Stack. The project started as a search engine based on Lucene, an open-source search engine library built by Shay Banon to index his wife’s cooking recipes. Since its early days, Elasticsearch has come a long way and has evolved into the Elastic Stack, a great suite for taking data from any source, in order to search, analyze, and visualize it

  <p>You’ve probably heard of Elasticsearch or the Elastic Stack. The project started as a search engine based on <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>, an open-source search engine library built by Shay Banon to index his wife’s cooking recipes. Since its early days, Elasticsearch has come a long way and has evolved into the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">Elastic Stack</a>, a great suite for taking data from any source, in order to search, analyze, and visualize it in near real-time.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch is a distributed document store; data is serialized as JSON documents and stored in a distributed way across cluster nodes. The inverted index is a data structure that lists every unique word that appears in any document, and also lists the documents in which each word appears. This enables fast full-text searches, a feature not supported or only partially supported by database engines. The index is a collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields. In turn, each field can be indexed in an optimal data structure; for example, an inverted index for text fields, but a BKD tree for a numeric field.</p>

<p>How can be Elasticsearch integrated into a Spring Boot application? What are the options for adding Elasticsearch to a Java app? This post will give you a quick introduction to Elasticsearch integration options.</p>

 Elasticsearch integration options for Spring Boot 

<p>For Java applications including Spring Boot applications, Elasticsearch provides the following <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html">clients</a> for integration:</p>

 
   
    <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/current/index.html">Java Transport Client</a>: Deprecated in Elasticsearch 7.0.0. Provides a client object to execute all operations asynchronously, accepting a listener or returning a future.</p>
   
   
    <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/7.15/index.html">Java REST Client</a>: Composed of the Low Level REST Client and the High Level REST Client. The Low Level Client provides load balancing, failover, persistent connections, and request/response trace logging. The High Level Client works on top of the Low Level Client and is the replacement for the <code>TransportClient</code>. It depends on the Elasticsearch core and provides synchronous and asynchronous APIs.</p>
   
   
    <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/index.html">Java API Client</a>: The new client library, independent of Elasticsearch core, provides strongly typed requests and responses, blocking and asynchronous versions for all APIs, fluent builders and functional patterns, as well as jackson and JSON-b support.</p>
   
 

 Hello Spring Data Elasticsearch! 

<p>Spring Data Elasticsearch is another integration option that adds the Spring repository abstraction at the search layer, providing access and search functionality for domain objects stored in Elasticsearch. Operations are sent through a client connected to the Elasticsearch node. With Spring Data, the High Level REST Client is the default client, although Elasticsearch documentation states that it’s been deprecated in favor of the Java API Client since version 7.15. The Java API Client is not listed as a supported client yet. In the meantime, the Java Transport Client is still supported in Spring Data, but the general recommendation is to use the High Level Client.</p>

<p>Instead of calling the Elasticsearch APIs directly, the repository and REST template abstractions provide a simplified interface for document operations, encapsulating API request/response processing, and exposing a query interface that has multiple implementations for different levels of query complexity. Through the starter dependency, it can also handle client autoconfiguration and automatic document index mapping for simple use cases.</p>

<p>Besides the high-level REST client support, Spring Data provides the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/#elasticsearch.clients.reactive">Reactive Client</a>, a non-official driver based on WebClient, with calls operated directly on the Reactive Stack. The Reactive Client also depends on the Elasticsearch core, as it is designed for handling Elasticsearch request/response types.</p>

 Build an application with Spring Data Elasticsearch 

<p>JHipster provides the Elasticsearch option to add search capabilities on top of your database. The integration is based on Spring Data Elasticsearch repositories, so let’s generate a reactive blog application to explore what the generator provides. The blog application built in this tutorial is based on the JHipster sample <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples/blob/main/reactive-ms.jdl">reactive-ms.jdl</a>, but adding Maven, MongoDB (Elasticsearch integration only works with SQL databases and MongoDB), Bootstrap pagination, Okta authentication, and Kibana for index mapping inspection.</p>

<p>JHipster has a <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/#local-installation-with-npm-recommended-for-normal-users">quick setup</a> you can follow to set up your environment. For installing Node.js, I like <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md">NVM (Node Version Manager)</a></p>

   <code>wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 14.18.3
</code>   

<p>Install JHipster with the following line:</p>
   <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster@7.6.0
</code>   

<p>Verify the JHipster version with the following line:</p>

   <code>jhipster --version
</code>   
   <code>INFO! Using JHipster version installed globally
7.6.0
</code>   

<p>Once your environment is ready, create a <code>spring-data-elasticsearch</code> folder for the project, fetch the application JDL from the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-data-elasticsearch-example">GitHub repository</a>, and generate the application with JHipster:</p>

   <code>mkdir spring-data-elasticsearch
cd spring-data-elasticsearch
https -d raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadev/okta-spring-data-elasticsearch-example/main/blog-reactive-ms.jdl
jhipster jdl blog-reactive-ms.jdl
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Then, change the Redirect URIs to:</p>
   <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc,http://localhost:8081/login/oauth2/code/oidc,http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc
</code>   
<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080,http://localhost:8081,http://localhost:8761</code> for the Logout Redirect URIs.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct (see above, below are the default values) redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The JHipster Registry is also a Spring Cloud Config server, and by default, it is configured with the profiles <code>dev</code> and <code>native</code>, which means the configuration will be provided from the location <code>docker-compose/central-server-config</code>. Update <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code> with the OIDC settings to be shared with all microservices. Set the values from the <code>.okta.env</code> file the Okta CLI created. To avoid copy/paste errors, you can do it from the command line:</p>

   <code>source .okta.env
echo \"
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: $SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: $SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID
            client-secret: $SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET\" &gt;&gt; docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml
</code>   

<p>For the experiment in this tutorial, configure the Kibana interface for Elasticsearch, which will allow visualizations of the Elasticsearch data.</p>

<p>Edit <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> and add the Kibana service like this:</p>

   <code>services:
  ...  
  blog-kibana:
     image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.15.2
     ports:
       - 5601:5601
     environment:
       ELASTICSEARCH_URL: http://blog-elasticsearch:9200
       ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS: '["http://blog-elasticsearch:9200"]'
</code>   
<p>NOTE: The Kibana version must match the version of Elasticsearch that’s used by the <code>blog-elasticsearch</code> image.</p>

<p>Also add the following additional configuration to the <code>blog-elasticsearch</code> service, to expose the ports to the local host for sending APIs requests:</p>

   <code>services:
  blog-elasticsearch:
    ...
    ports:
      - 9200:9200
</code>   

<p>Remove the Keycloak service at the bottom, as Okta will be used as the identity provider (IdP).</p>

<p>Create each application’s container image:</p>

   <code>cd blog
./mvnw -DskipTests -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
</code>   

   <code>cd gateway
./mvnw -DskipTests -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
</code>   

<p>Run all your images with Docker Compose:</p>

   <code>cd ../docker-compose
docker compose up
</code>   

<p>Access the JHipster Registry at <code>http://localhost:8761</code> and sign in with your Okta credentials. When you see all services up and green, go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and sign in with your Okta account.</p>

<p></p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: There is a potential issue observed for the blog service. As <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints.kubernetes-probes">Kubernetes probes</a> are enabled by default, the blog application might change its state to <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code> during start up and Eureka might discard the following heartbeats with state <code>UP</code>. In this case, disable Kubernetes probes in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> with the following environment variable:</p>

   <code>services:
  blog:
    image: blog
    environment:
      ...
      - MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINT_HEALTH_PROBES_ENABLED=false
</code>   

<p>Restart your microservices stack using Ctrl+C and run <code>docker compose up</code> again.</p>

 Inspecting Elasticsearch index mapping 

<p>During startup, Spring Data Elasticsearch will create the index for the entities annotated with <code>@Document</code>, deriving the mappings from the entity’s annotations. But for the properties, if the field type is not specified, it will default to FieldType.Auto. This means that no mapping entry is written for the property and that Elasticsearch will add a mapping entry dynamically when the first data for this property is stored.</p>

<p>As our Kibana interface was configured in Docker Compose, before creating any entities, let’s inspect the index mappings that were automatically created for the <code>blog</code> microservice. Go to <code>http://localhost:5601</code>, the Kibana dashboard. On the top left menu, go to Management &gt; Stack Management &gt; Index Management &gt; Indices tab. Besides the <code>user</code> index, an index per entity should be listed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Choose for example the <code>tag</code> index. Before persisting any instance, the Mappings tab will look like the following:</p>

   <code>{
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "_class": {
          "type": "keyword",
          "index": false,
          "doc_values": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>As you can see, properties are not mapped yet.</p>

<p>Go back to the application, and in the top-right menu go to Entities &gt; Tag and create some <code>Tag</code> entities. Then create some <code>Blog</code> and <code>Post</code> entities as well. You’ll see that a search box is present on the entity list page. Go ahead and test the search functionality. The results page will return the matches with pagination.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go back to Kibana, and display the <code>Tag</code> mappings after persistence:</p>

   <code>{
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "_class": {
          "type": "keyword",
          "index": false,
          "doc_values": false
        },
        "id": {
          "type": "text",
          "fields": {
            "keyword": {
              "type": "keyword",
              "ignore_above": 256
            }
          }
        },
        "name": {
          "type": "text",
          "fields": {
            "keyword": {
              "type": "keyword",
              "ignore_above": 256
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now the <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> properties have been dynamically mapped with multi-field mapping. For example, the <code>name</code> field is defined with type <code>text</code>, for full-text searches, and it defines a <code>name.keyword</code> subfield for aggregations and sorting:</p>

   <code>"name": {
  "type": "text",
  "fields": {
    "keyword": {
      "type": "keyword",
      "ignore_above": 256
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>It is often useful to index the same field in different ways for different purposes. Text fields are searchable by default, but by default are not available for aggregations, sorting, unless multi-field mapping is in place. There is another option for enabling sorting for text fields, which is the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/text.html#fielddata-mapping-param"><code>fielddata</code> mapping parameter</a>. This option will not be covered in our tutorial, as it is discouraged in the Elasticsearch documentation, because of high memory consumption.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch exposes several APIs, and the Index APIs allow managing individual indices, index settings, aliases, mappings, and index templates. Although Kibana is a user-friendly front-end, you can also query the index mappings through the Index APIs, with an HTTPie command like the following:</p>

   <code>http :9200/tag/_mapping
</code>   

<p>The output should look the same as the mapping visualized in Kibana:</p>

 Key components in reactive Spring Data Elasticsearch 

<p>As mentioned before, the <code>blog</code> application is reactive, and that’s because the JDL file had <code>reactive true</code> in its <code>gateway</code> and <code>blog</code> application configurations.</p>

<p>This config also tells JHipster to include the Elasticsearch dependencies in the <code>blog</code> microservice. JHipster generates the web layer with the entity resource class, and it optionally generates the service class too. Two of the key components that enable the Elasticsearch reactive integration are the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchClient</code> and the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchOperations</code>. A client is required to connect to an Elasticsearch cluster or node, and <code>*Operations</code> is the interface for the execution of CRUD and query commands. The third component is the entity <code>ReactiveElasticsearchRepository</code>, which can provide domain-specific search methods.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When using the starter dependency, <code>ReactiveElasticsearchRestClientAutoConfiguration</code> configures the reactive Elasticsearch client from the Spring Elasticsearch properties. <code>ElasticsearchDataAutoConfiguration</code> is the root configuration class that triggers the reactive search template initialization. Let’s briefly describe each of the mentioned components.</p>

 The reactive client 

<p>The <code>ReactiveElasticsearchClient</code> is based on Spring’s WebClient and calls are directly operated on the reactive stack. The reactive client sends and receives high-level request and response objects. In this example, the reactive client is initialized from <code>spring.elasticsearch.*</code> properties. You can verify the Elasticsearch endpoints are set in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file for the <code>blog</code> service.</p>

   <code>blog:
  image: blog
  environment:
    ...
    - SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_URIS=http://blog-elasticsearch:9200
    ...
</code>   

 The operations abstraction 

<p><code>ReactiveElasticsearchOperations</code> is the gateway for executing high-level commands against an Elasticsearch cluster using the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchClient</code>.
The <code>ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate</code> is the default implementation of <code>ReactiveElasticsearchOperations</code>. Some high-level operations are <code>save</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>delete</code> and <code>search</code>, which accept the Spring Data Query types as parameters.</p>

 The entity search repository 

<p>The entity search repository enables the document CRUD and search operations in the application. The search repository extends <code>ReactiveElasticsearchRepository</code>, the persistence technology-specific abstraction, that builds on the core repository support utilizing operations provided through the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate</code> executed by the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchClient</code>. JHipster generates a search repository for the entities specified in the <code>search</code> option in the JDL. In the example, all entities are set to be searchable in Elasticsearch:</p>

   <code>application {
  config {
    baseName blog
    reactive true
    ...
    searchEngine elasticsearch
  }
  ...
  search * with elasticsearch
}
</code>   

<p>When the entity in the JDL definition requires the Elasticsearch engine, and also pagination, the entity search repository is generated with pagination and sorting options. For example, the generated <code>TagSearchRepository</code> adds a custom <code>search()</code> method that assembles a native search query and passes it to the <code>ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate</code>:</p>

   <code>public interface TagSearchRepository extends ReactiveElasticsearchRepository&lt;Tag, String&gt;, TagSearchRepositoryInternal {}

interface TagSearchRepositoryInternal {
    Flux&lt;Tag&gt; search(String query, Pageable pageable);
}

class TagSearchRepositoryInternalImpl implements TagSearchRepositoryInternal {

    private final ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate reactiveElasticsearchTemplate;

    TagSearchRepositoryInternalImpl(ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate reactiveElasticsearchTemplate) {
        this.reactiveElasticsearchTemplate = reactiveElasticsearchTemplate;
    }

    @Override
    public Flux&lt;Tag&gt; search(String query, Pageable pageable) {
        List&lt;FieldSortBuilder&gt; builders = new SortToFieldSortBuilderConverter().convert(pageable.getSort());

        NativeSearchQueryBuilder queryBuilder = new NativeSearchQueryBuilder()
            .withQuery(queryStringQuery(query))
            .withPageable(PageRequest.of(pageable.getPageNumber(), pageable.getPageSize()));

        builders
            .stream()
            .forEach(builder -&gt; {
                queryBuilder.withSort(builder);
            });

        NativeSearchQuery nativeSearchQuery = queryBuilder.build();
        return reactiveElasticsearchTemplate.search(nativeSearchQuery, Tag.class).map(SearchHit::getContent);
    }
}
</code>   

 Learn more about Elasticsearch, Spring Boot, and JHipster 

<p>JHipster helps to simplify the setup of Spring Boot applications or microservices with search capabilities. I hope you enjoyed this quick introduction to Elasticsearch integration options, and could taste the advantages of the Spring Data repository abstraction for encapsulating some basic Elasticsearch operations. Remember to check the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/#preface.versions">compatibility matrix</a> to match the right Spring Data Elasticsearch dependency for your Elasticsearch version.</p>

<p>The Identity Theft Resource Center has released their 2021 data breach report, with one of their key findings being that the number of data compromises hit an all-time high. <br></p><p>The ITRC is a non-profit dedicated to supporting the victims of cybercrime including individuals, businesses, and governments. In January, they released their 16th Annual Data Breach Report, which sheds light on the persistent, ever-growing threat of cybercrime. Users, enterprises, and organizations all stand to suffer in the wake of a data breach, and this past year’s numbers indicate that threat is not subsiding anytime soon. Here are some takeaway statistics from the report: </p>  The overall number of data compromises (1,862) is up 68% from 2020’s total number  2021’s total number of compromises beat out the previous all-time high of 1,506 in 2017  293,927,708 individuals were affected in total  83% of all compromises involved sensitive user information like social security numbers   <p>According to the data, 2021 was a banner year for cybercriminals, with a significant shift occurring in how stolen data was being used. In an introductory letter to the report, President &amp; CEO Eva C. Velasquez said this: “We may very well look back at 2021 as the milestone year when we officially moved from the era of identity theft to an era of identity fraud. That is to say, the time when cybercriminals shifted from mass data accumulation (identity theft) to mass data misuse (identity fraud). Fueling most identity fraud-related crimes was consumer information stolen from businesses in data breaches.” </p><p>Velasquez went on to say that “[...] consumer information was often the means to the end of attacking businesses through stolen credentials – logins and passwords.”</p><p>In short, not only are users at significant risk when their sensitive information is stolen, but businesses are, too. Data breaches are a lose-lose for every party involved, and as long as companies collect and store passwords, this problem will continue to grow. NuID’s authentication solution can help you <a href="https://nuid.io/solution.html">stop storing passwords</a>, so you don’t become part of a statistic in next year’s breach report. </p><p>You can read the entire ITRC 2021 Annual Data Breach Report by downloading it <a href="https://notified.idtheftcenter.org/s/">here</a>. You can learn more about NuID’s efforts to eliminate data breaches at <a href="https://nuid.io/">our site</a>, in our <a href="https://nuid.io/pdf/nuid-white-paper.pdf">White Paper</a>, and through our blog where we cover everything from <a href="https://blog.nuid.io/google-plaintext/">data breach news</a> to explaining a <a href="https://blog.nuid.io/passwords-privacy-identity/">nu model of identity</a>.</p>

				 <p>By <a href="mailto:trevor@indicio.tech">Trevor Butterworth</a></p>
<p>The Trust over IP Foundation has just published a&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">long document </a>describing a set of design principles “to inform, guide, and constrain the design of… decentralized digital trust infrastructure.”<br></p>
<p>We’re not convinced that “constraint” is the right theoretical approach for an emerging technology, especially one that is being deployed in different sectors for different use cases. To underscore this, we want to address a particular constraint implied by ToIP’s design concepts that is likely to be fatal to any deployment.</p>
<p>This follows from the design concept of “transitive trust,” which can be summarized by the deduction that If A trusts B and B trusts C, then A can trust C.</p>
<p>In other words, if a Verifier trusts an Issuer, it should logically trust a Holder bearing a digital credential that is verified as being from that Issuer. This is how passports work.</p>
<p>To scale this “trust triangle” for ecosystems where there are many, many issuers of digital credentials, ToIP proposes that the triangle must become a “governance trust diamond,” where a governance authority rules on which Issuers can be trusted by Verifiers.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>This sounds reasonable and straightforward; someone, inevitably, is going to set the rules for an ecosystem and we need to acknowledge that someone in the architecture. How could any verifier know all the possible issuers of a particular kind of credential (say a lab test result) in anything but a very small network? Wouldn’t the simplest way be to ping a trust registry or a rules engine under the control of a governance authority to get that information?</p>
<p>Yes and no. </p>
<p>Yes, because all ecosystems are going to need governance; no, because governance handled through a centralized trust registry or rules engine will, at best, be inefficient, and at worst, be unworkable.
</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>If it doesn’t work offline, it doesn’t work. The fundamental problem with a centralized trust registry is that it’s dependent on real-time calling and this makes the whole system dependent on being able to make those calls. What happens when the connection goes down — or the Internet connection is weak or intermittent? You can’t have a trusted ecosystem that is only capable of delivering trust some of the time.</p>
<p>There is, however, a simple solution to this fatal system error—decentralize the governance so that the trust registry rules are cached locally, in the software for issuers, holders, and verifiers.&nbsp;This means these rules will work offline. We call this “machine-readable governance.” Instead of calling the trust registry to verify in real time, governance authorities publish their rules in files that can be quickly uploaded and propagated across participants in a network. This has the added benefit of making verification quicker as there is no need to check in with an intermediary.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>Think of machine-readable governance as a “smart” trust registry — it makes the governance authority portable. </p>
<p>There’s also another significant benefit to using machine-readable governance: it allows for more complex governance interactions such as “A trusts B and B trusts C, but A only trusts C for some purposes or in some contexts.” A machine-readable governance file makes these “if this, then that” governance rules easy to implement without any sharing of private information with a trust registry.
</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>Diamond of Trust or Ring of Power? We understand that in any ecosystem for verification and data sharing, there needs to be a governance function—where people get to enact governance as to who can participate and how. But it’s not clear that it is wise to encode this function in a third-party entity that functions as the sole source of truth for the entire network. What if some participants want to reject some or all the governance—should they be excluded from the ecosystem?</p>
<p>Another advantage in avoiding a single centralized trust registry model is that it allows multiple governance authorities to coordinate governance rules in hierarchical ways, such as national rules superseding state or local rules. These multiple “opinions” are all available to verifiers who can then choose which combination is important as they evaluate presented credentials. The buck stops at the verifier, and nuanced interpretation is possible. This makes an ecosystem capable of mapping to the governance requirements that exist in the real world.</p>
<p>The phone home problem. A centralized trust registry also raises the problem inherent to any centralized exchange: It knows your business—who’s verifying whom, and who’s using which credentials where. This kind of surveillance runs counter to the spirit of decentralized and self-sovereign identity—especially when you combine it with the next point:</p>
<p>For whom the Trust Registry tolls. A centralized trust registry opens the door to monopolistic business practices and rent seeking. If you allow a third party to erect a toll booth, it will charge a toll. Great for the third party, not so great for everyone using the road. Unsurprisingly, when third-party trust registries and rules engines are created in the real world, this is what happens.</p>
<p>Where sovereign authorities must be in control. In our experience, national governments and global enterprises want to be in control of the things they are supposed to control and are held accountable for. That’s why they prefer machine-readable governance to governance by third parties.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, we recommend ToIP add the concept of machine-readable governance to its design principles and to explore the many ways it can be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A machine-readable governance reference implementation 
<p>For those interested in machine-readable governance, Indicio will shortly make a reference implementation available through the Linux Foundation Public Health’s open source <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea Project</a> for digital health credentials.<br></p>
<p>On March 17, Cardea will then run a second “Interop-a-thon” for companies using Hyperledger Aries Agents to practice implementation in interoperable environments.</p>

A problem crypto actually&nbsp;solves <p>At a time when everyone and their mother has an NFT project, it’s refreshing that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html">the NYTimes is covering a compelling real world use case</a> (via&nbsp;/rcb):</p><blockquote>There are plenty of crypto exchanges, NFT trading platforms and video games that involve buying and selling crypto tokens. But so far, not many crypto projects have had what I’d call “normie utility” — solving problems that exist for people outside the crypto world, that aren’t primarily about buying or selling digital assets and that would be impossible to solve with normal, non-crypto technology.</blockquote><blockquote>Recently, though, I discovered one that&nbsp;does.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s called&nbsp;Helium.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>On a basic level, Helium is a decentralized wireless network for “internet of things” devices, powered by cryptocurrency.</blockquote><p>The key point here is that Helium might have never gotten off the ground without the incentive structure and community building qualities that crypto and tokenomics provides. Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html">the NYTimes’ Kevin Roose&nbsp;again</a>:</p><blockquote>Does it solve a non-crypto problem? Yes. There are millions of connected devices in the world, and connecting these devices to the Helium network is significantly cheaper than buying a cellular data plan for each device. Because of the hot spots’ long range, Helium’s network can also reach places that typical Wi-Fi and cellular networks&nbsp;don’t.</blockquote><blockquote>Is it useful for something other than speculation? Also yes. The Helium network itself has value, and although hot spot owners can (and do) profit when the price of $HNT rises, the main way they’re making money is by adding new hot spots, not by day-trading $HNT tokens on a crypto exchange.</blockquote><blockquote>Could Helium have worked without crypto technology? Not really. The company tried the non-crypto approach, and it nearly went bankrupt. But adding tokens to the mix solved what technologists call the “cold start problem” — the fact that attracting the first users to a new network is often hard, because the network isn’t very valuable&nbsp;yet.</blockquote><p>The concept of crypto and blockchain has been with us for over ten years now, and with all of the media attention the last few years, it’s easy to forget how nascent the space is. The market needed structure. It needed liquidity. It needed economic heft. It needed social and cultural&nbsp;buy-in.</p><p>All of that creates fertile ground for actually useful use cases. Today, projects like Filecoin are teasing concepts around decentralized file storage (aptly named the Interplanetary File System). Solana’s super speedy and scalable blockchain enables the next generation of decentralized applications.</p><p>Many of these projects might have never gotten off the ground if not for crypto’s unique financing model and built-in network incentives.</p><p>The other thing we&nbsp;need?</p><p>New frameworks and standards for identity in a decentralized world.</p><p>Your mom’s NFT project is just part of the&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html">Maybe There’s a Use for Crypto After&nbsp;All</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/133856/onlyfans-launches-verified-nft-profile-pictures">OnlyFans launches verified NFT profile&nbsp;pictures</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/news-explainers/why-some-see-web-30-as-the-future-of-the-internet/52704A70-3918-4EF8-AE02-DAD6D23727A9">Why Some See Web 3.0 as the Future of the&nbsp;Internet</a>  <a href="https://future.a16z.com/go-to-market-in-web3">Go-to-Market in Web3: New Mindsets, Tactics, Metrics |&nbsp;Future</a>  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/02/future-internet-blockchain-investment-banking/621480/">The Internet Is Just Investment Banking&nbsp;Now</a>   2.

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/15/2385399/0/en/Freddie-Mac-Announces-First-Automated-Assessment-of-Direct-Deposit-Income.html">Freddie Mac announced</a> that its Loan Product Advisor® <a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">asset and income modeler (AIM)</a> has been enhanced to provide clients with automated income assessment using consumer-permissioned, direct deposit account data from trusted third-party service providers like Finicity, a Mastercard company. AIM for income using direct deposits increases the confidence in income calculations of certain income types when there is enough direct deposit history sourced from trusted third-party service providers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services (MVS)</a> is approved for this submission through AIM providing direct deposit transaction data to fuel this innovative, data-driven approach. It identifies income streams used for mortgage qualification, delivering accurate risk assessment results.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Assets, income and employment verifications are vital to mortgage lenders looking to verify borrowers’ finances. However, between unreliable results, miscommunications and good old-fashioned paper-chases, verifying assets, employment and income can be cumbersome. MVS helps borrowers get faster approvals with fewer conditions upfront, allowing them to close and get into their homes faster. MVS can help lenders: </p>
 
 More easily assess borrower capacity/automates income calculations. 
 Reduce frustrations caused by paper submissions and reasking for documentation to verify assets, income and employment. 
 Remove subjectivity and manual errors in processing and underwriting. 
 Lower risk and probability of fraudulent activity. 
 Increase referrals. 
 
<p>“We are excited to see a single report for the digital verification of employment, income and assets through Freddie Mac’s direct deposit enhancement within their AIM solution,” said Andy Sheehan, Mastercard EVP of Open Banking Business. “Utilizing consumer-permissioned data and a single source of verification can help mitigate risk for lenders, create an improved consumer experience and ultimately increase overall financial inclusion by helping borrowers realize the dream of owning a home.”</p>
 Efficient Assessment 
<p>AIM leverages consumer-permissioned data from third-party service providers like Finicity, to automate the manual processes of assessing borrower assets and income.&nbsp; MVS improves the success rates for identifying income and employment using data from income transactions. It can also increase the assessed income amount by providing data for a more accurate gross-up calculation.</p>
<p>“Adding Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services is the next step in the evolution of AIM,” said Christina Randolph, Director, Strategic Technology Partnership at Freddie Mac. “Our partnership with Finicity has helped better identify pay deposits data to our AIM capability, using accurate and verifiable data that meet our underwriting standards. This means more opportunities for cost savings for lenders. It does all this while delivering a vastly improved lending experience to borrowers.”</p>
 How It Works 
<p>Once Freddie Mac releases this offering, lenders using Loan Product Advisor v5 0.06 or higher can use it without needing to be accepted into a controlled release program. Once turned on by Freddie Mac, a lender can automatically start using the direct deposit data generated through Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services through a single report. Lenders can use this report by simply contacting Freddie Mac and connecting to Finicity. The report includes 24 months of direct deposit transactional history and also includes Finicity-identified income streams.</p>
<p>The report generated through MVS has two sections; the top section includes credits/debits for asset assessment defaults to 61 days (but can be customized up to 24 months depending on the from date), and the bottom section is up to 24 months of income stream credit transactions only. </p>
<p>As an added bonus, the reduced cost of implementing MVS is reflected directly in the balance sheet. On average, up to 12 days can be cut off the processing time for each loan. The hours formerly spent by loan officers chasing down borrower documents are invested in higher-return work activities such as marketing and sales to drive additional loans.</p>
<p>MVS is available via direct integration, SimpleNexus, ICE Technology and Finicity Reports today. Want to elevate your efficiency while enhancing the customer lending journey? <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage">Get started today</a>.</p>

 What We’re Doing in 2022, and&nbsp;Why Ocean 2022&nbsp;Summary 1. Introduction <p>2021 was a banner year for <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean</a>: we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2021-6875bc1f804f">enhanced</a> on our datatoken-based technology foundation, witnessed an amazing builder ecosystem emerge with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1484164194127814657">hundreds of projects</a>&nbsp;, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-01-31-ocean-protocol-gaia-x">secured tenders</a> for <a href="https://gaia-x.eu/">Gaia-X Federation Services</a> (via BigchainDB), and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2021-06-15-ocean-awarded-world-economic-forum-technology-pioneer">won the WEF Technology Pioneer&nbsp;award</a>.</p><p>2022 promises to be even better! Here’s what’s&nbsp;coming.</p>  Data-exchange products: deliver Ocean V4 including <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">Data NFTs</a> and solving rug pulls; deliver on Gaia-X tenders; and an explosion of ecosystem products.  Staking products: Data Farming, H2O stable asset, and&nbsp;veOCEAN.  OceanDAO: Broadening OceanDAO’s scope to include a treasury with yield-generating activities.  Ecosystem Funding: a refined path for teams to get early-stage grants, then scale up with grants or investment. Introduces Ocean Ventures and Ocean Shipyard&nbsp;(redux).  <p>The sections that follow elaborate on each of&nbsp;these.</p> 2. Data-exchange products <p>These are products that drive Ocean’s data-exchange functionality: smart contracts, middleware (JS &amp; Py drivers, metadata cache, etc), and frontends using it like Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> 2.1 Ocean&nbsp;V4 <p>Ocean V4 is coming in Q1 2022. Here are the key features.</p>  Solve rug pulls. In Ocean V3, a publisher would get all initial datatokens; malicious publishers could then rug pull. For V4, the publisher gets no initial datatokens. Instead, when someone adds OCEAN liquidity to a datatoken pool, a special one-sided staking bot mints enough datatokens into the pool to keep price constant. Similarly, when OCEAN liquidity is removed, the bot burns datatokens. Since the publisher is not a whale at the outset, they have nothing to rug pull (!). This mechanic also eliminates slippage when adding/removing OCEAN liquidity.  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">Data NFTs</a>. We NFT-ize base IP to enable transfer of the base IP itself, to support &gt;1 revenue streams on the base IP, to accumulate value to the base IP before monetization, and to leverage the recent growth of tooling in the NFT ecosystem. ERC20 datatokens remain as before: licenses to use the base&nbsp;IP.  Help community monetize. Now, 3rd party marketplaces can earn fees on from swapping, staking, and consuming (versus V3 just consuming), and have more control over fee rates (vs V3 hardcoded). V4 also includes architecture for &gt;1 datatoken type, for more flexible fees, pay-as-you-go Compute-to-Data, and&nbsp;more.  <p>Ocean V4 will include tooling to help migrate data assets and pools from Ocean V3. Ocean V4 will initially get deployed to all the same EVM chains as V3: Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Moonriver, Energy Web Chain. After that, we plan to deploy to more EVM chains over&nbsp;time.</p> 2.2 Gaia-X Federation Services <p><a href="https://gaia-x.eu/">Gaia-X</a> is a European-wide data-sharing initiative backed by Germany, France and other nations, with more than 300 member companies in <a href="https://www.gaia-x.eu/who-we-are/association">its association</a>.</p><p>BigchainDB <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-01-31-ocean-protocol-gaia-x">won three key tenders</a> for Gaia-X Federation Services: Federated Catalog, Data Contract Service, Logging Service. The tender activities are in Q1 and Q2&nbsp;2022.</p><p>There will be Gaia-X activity beyond these tenders throughout 2022. Building on heavy engagements in 2021 and earlier, Ocean Protocol Foundation, <a href="https://www.delta-dao.com/">deltaDAO</a>, <a href="https://www.smartcontrol.ro/">smartcontrol</a>, <a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a> and other teams in the Ocean community will continue to support Gaia-X AISBL and Gaia-X spokes towards achieving their missions.</p><p>The Ocean core team working on data-exchange products will start 2022 with delivering Ocean V4 and Gaia-X tenders, followed by rapid iterations to steadily improve the offering. Then, it will select what to build next based on learnings and promise of traction. In parallel, other Ocean core teams work on Data Farming, DAOs, and funding; other sections have&nbsp;details.</p> 2.3 Ecosystem data-exchange products <p>Coming into 2022, several Ocean ecosystem teams are working on products / technologies that drive Ocean data-exchange functionality. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Mobile data wallets. Think Ocean Market on a mobile app, with built-in wallet functionality treating datatokens as first-class citizens. <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/realdatawhale">Datawhale’s</a> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/DataTokenApp">ALGA wallet</a> launches in Feb 2022. Others are coming&nbsp;too.  Enhancing Ocean Compute-to-Data. Several teams are adding unique functionalities within <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Ocean C2D</a>. These include: mPowered is building <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/first-class-integration-with-parameters-to-c2d-in-ocean-market/1421">more flexible parameters for C2D</a> in Ocean Market, Riddle &amp; Code’s <a href="https://medium.com/@TeamOcean/ocean-protocol-partners-with-riddle-code-efs-and-eloop-to-launch-drive-stake-a5400050f5b1">Drive &amp; Stake</a> has trusted execution environments running inside C2D, and the <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/lynx-building-privacy-preserving-data-infrastructure-for-biometric-wearable-data/1391">LYNX platform maintains brain data&nbsp;privacy</a>.  Federated Analytics &amp; Learning. This enables doing analytics and AI model-building across multiple data silos at once, while remaining decentralized. It leverages C2D too. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-and-raven-protocol-to-add-federated-learning-to-ocean-market-via-compute-to-data-f0314575d3c8#:~:text=Raven%20Protocol%20is%20developing%20a,training%20of%20deep%20neural%20networks.">Raven Protocol</a> and <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/round-14-feltoken-federated-learning-token/1390/4">FELToken</a> are each collaborating with the Ocean core team to make this&nbsp;happen.  Better curation in Ocean Market. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-will-introduce-ratings-reviews-thanks-to-utus-trust-infrastructure-b8a63c37c9d9">UTU is working on bringing social signals</a> to Ocean Market. And, <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/comments-rating-integration/1403">this OceanDAO project</a> is working on decentralized comments &amp; rating for Ocean&nbsp;Market.  #DataFi dapps. Several teams are shipping and continually improving their data-for-DeFi dapps, including <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1491736009390067714">DataX Protocol</a> with <a href="https://www.datapolis.city/">datapolis</a> (and more), and <a href="https://www.datalatte.com/">DataLatte</a> for passive income on staked&nbsp;data.  <p>This is just a sampling. <a href="https://www.oceanpearl.io">Ocean Pearl</a> lists many more excellent data-exchange related projects. Given so many new ones in 2021, we can anticipate more yet for 2022. 💯 for Ocean’s ecosystem:)</p> 3. Staking <p>It’s clear that the Ocean community is highly interested in staking. So far, the core team has supported this via <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">staking in datatoken pools</a>, and planned <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data Farming</a> incentives. Beyond that, DEXes and other places offer other places to stake Ocean, as <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/where-to-stake-your-ocean-12faf60c93fa">this article</a> describes.</p><p>In 2022, the core team and collaborators will bring more staking options to the Ocean community, as follows, released in this&nbsp;order.</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/stable-asset-h2o-backed-by-ocean-is-launched-by-new-order-together-with-reflexer-labs-91d3a29efb21">H2O stable asset</a>. Users can bond OCEAN to earn yield. H2O is a fork of RAI stable asset, built by <a href="https://www.neworder.network/">New Order</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://reflexer.finance/">Reflexer Labs</a>. We expect H2O-datatoken pools to become the standard.  Ocean Data Farming. The intent of the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/where-to-stake-your-ocean-12faf60c93fa">Data Farming announcement</a> remains the same. It rewards — with generous APY — stakers in datatoken pools with high data consume volume. We’re more excited than ever by the promise of Data Farming to drive Ocean&nbsp;usage.  veOCEAN. Adding “ve” will incentivize OCEAN holders to lock up their tokens for greater Data Farming rewards, governance power, and more. veOCEAN will leverage <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-gauges.html">Curve</a> “<a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html">ve</a>” contracts, which <a href="https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512">Balancer</a> <a href="https://stakedaohq.medium.com/introducing-liquid-lockers-vesdt-5febcf169170">and</a> <a href="https://gov.ribbon.finance/t/rgp-9-ribbonomics/486">the</a> broader DeFi ecosystem are adopting. The contracts also include <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-gauges.html">Curve gauges</a>, which we will use to automate Data&nbsp;Farming.  <p>These will all be accessible via an OceanDAO sub-app called OceanFarm, that has quick paths to H2O&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Here’s a rough schedule. H2O is coming in Q1 2022; then Data Farming. Optimistically, veOCEAN will ship in Q2, otherwise in&nbsp;Q3.</p> 4. OceanDAO <p>OceanDAO is currently grants DAO, with monthly batch grants (cohorts of funding). For 2022, we will be expanding the scope of OceanDAO as&nbsp;follows.</p>  OceanDAO will get a treasury. The treasury will get some initial funds from the treasury of Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF), and also leverage some of the 51% supply. OceanDAO will grow the treasury via active yield-generating activities, such as LPing into OCEAN pairs, using <a href="https://www.defipulse.com/defi-list">modern yield-farming tools</a>, and learning best practices from <a href="https://twitter.com/koeppelmann/status/1481218557535006721?s=21">GnosisDAO</a> and&nbsp;others.  OceanDAO will include tools for DAO-based decision-making.  OceanDAO will complement its status-quo batch grants (for seed stage) with rolling grants (for scale-up&nbsp;stage).  We’ll likely implement this via a 1hive garden, which has functionality for treasury, DAO-based decision making (including arbitration), and rolling grants (Conviction Voting). Then, this would be a sub-app of OceanDAO likely called OceanGarden. Schedule-wise, the initial version of OceanGarden will ship the same time as&nbsp;veOCEAN.   5. Ecosystem Funding <p>For 2022, we introduce a refined path for teams to get early-stage grants, then scale up with grants or investment.</p> 5.1 History, Learnings, Opportunities <p>Here’s a brief history of funding in the Ocean ecosystem, things we learned along the way, and some problems / opportunities seen.</p>  Shipyard first launched in fall 2020 as an core-team-curated grants program in fall 2020. OceanDAO was launched in Dec 2020 as community-curated batch grants. As OceanDAO scaled, the core team paused Shipyard in spring 2021. Now, we see that core-team curation and community curation are complementary, each with their own&nbsp;merits.  Throughout 2021, we identified several teams with potential for work of strategic importance to Ocean ecosystem. For some, we created contracts with milestones. Teams have been steadily delivering on these. While these “product contracts” were never an official program, they have been highly useful. How do we make it more official?  2021 has seen many Ocean ecosystem teams become steadily more effective, and grow. How do we catalyze teams to become investable? And, how can we help the Ocean community invest in&nbsp;them?  The Ocean core team has long recognized the value of venture investment. It’s complementary to other&nbsp;funding.  OceanDAO’s community-curated batch grants have low barrier to entry. New teams that deliver and engage the community tend to get more grants, and scale up. However, the “batch” nature means scaled-up teams might not get a grant in a round, which could lead to painful layoffs despite effective delivery. What if scaled-up teams had access to rolling grants? This would also be complementary.  <p>5.2 Holistic Approach for Funding &amp; Investment</p><p>These learnings and questions have led us to create a big-picture view of (a) How project teams can grow their projects, with a well-specified journey from getting early-stage grants, then scaling up with grants or investments, and (b) How individuals investors and OPF can invest in Ocean ecosystem projects. Here’s that&nbsp;view.</p>Project teams follow a journey from seed-stage grants, to scale-up grants, to investment (top row to bottom&nbsp;row).<p>Teams follow the journey from seed-stage grants, to scale-up grants, to investment (top row to bottom row). New teams start in the top right, in seed-stage grants from OceanDAO (top-down curation doesn’t scale well for the long-tail of seed stage). As the team delivers, it can graduate to rolling grants (community — center middle) or Shipyard (strategic — center right). Once a team becomes investable, then it can get investment from community (bottom middle) or from Ocean Ventures (bottom&nbsp;right).</p><p>Note that there are tracks for both bottom-up and top-down curation (left and right columns).</p><p>This big-picture view includes the following new components:</p>  Shipyard. Grants curated by Ocean core team, often with milestones. It draws on learnings from the previous Shipyard program, and organic product contracts. More information coming&nbsp;soon:)  Ocean Ventures. Investment curated by Ocean core team. More information coming&nbsp;soon:)  Rolling grants. This will be part of OceanDAO (section 4.1), likely using <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475">Conviction Voting</a>, as done by <a href="https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0xb25f0ee2d26461e2b5b3d3ddafe197a0da677b98">Giveth</a> and <a href="https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0x1fc7e8d8e4bbbef77a4d035aec189373b52125a8">Token Engineering Commons</a>.  Invest in for-profit tokens means that projects that can be investable, should get investable. This includes for-profit projects (token or company) and public-utility or DAO projects (token, maybe non-profit attached). Projects can create tokens with a DAO attached by <a href="https://gardens.1hive.org/">launching a 1Hive Garden</a>. At some point, there will likely be (fair) constraints on how long a project may get grants if the project can be investable.   6. Conclusion <p>In summary, here’s what Ocean 2022 holds: (a) Ocean V4, Gaia-X, and an explosion of ecosystem products, (b) H2O, Data Farming, and veOCEAN staking, (c ) OceanDAO with active treasury management, and (d) a refined path for teams to progress from early-stage grants through to investment.</p> 7. Appendix: DAOification of&nbsp;OPF <p>Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF) has had several sub-teams for years. For 2022, we have made each team more independent as Lighthouses. Each lighthouse has its own well-defined scope of activities (“API” ) and budget, which helps each team to go&nbsp;faster.</p><p>The lighthouses are:</p>  Danube Lighthouse. Data-exchange products (section 2) including backend, frontend, and Gaia-X related. Business development activities. Shipyard grants (some section 5). Led by Razvan&nbsp;Olteanu.  Nile Lighthouse. Staking including veOCEAN and Data Farming (section 3). OceanDAO including treasury management, batch grants, rolling grants (section 4, some section 5). Led by Trent McConaghy.  Niagara Lighthouse. Marketing and communications. Led by Monica&nbsp;Botez.  Yukon Lighthouse. Administration. Ocean Ventures (details in section 5).

 Physical asset NFTs: sell wonderful, beautiful, valuable physical things as NFTs on OpenSea, Origin or Venly&nbsp;today <p>The Original Mood Ring sells as an NFT for $65k with Mattereum — not just an image of the ring, but the solid gold item&nbsp;iteself.</p><p>Josh Reynolds is the inventor of the mood ring. The 1970s mood ring was <a href="https://www.theoriginalmoodring.io/">the original Quantified Self device</a>. It was an analogue biosensor that show stress as color. The Mood Ring (and the knock offs) became iconic symbols of a general wish for more self awareness in American&nbsp;culture.</p>The Original Mood Ring sold for&nbsp;$65k<p>Josh recently sold an NFT for $65,000 on the Venly exchange. The NFT is not an ordinary NFT of a picture of a mood ring. Rather, it’s a <a href="https://rwanft.io/">Real World Asset NFT</a> which makes you the owner of the physical solid gold mood ring, an authenticated 1970s original.</p><p>That raises three questions.</p>  How do you know what you are buying is&nbsp;genuine?  How do you get the physical asset if you are the NFT&nbsp;owner?  What happens if something goes&nbsp;wrong?  <p>Mattereum answers these questions for our clients with a groundbreaking legal-technical method to enable them to issue NFTs backed by real world assets. We call these “Real World Asset NFTs”, a category that includes intellectual property licensing and, coming very soon, real&nbsp;estate.</p><p>Here is a sample of a Mattereum Asset Passport for a half million year old stone hand axe, which was sold on&nbsp;<a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4aD73411CeC7D05c2EA1a17B4597E76/2">OpenSea</a>.</p><p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.tvg.handaxe.ach.berg.220/">Mattereum Asset Passport: Acheulian Hand Axe</a></p><p>Real estate is the world’s largest asset category. Mattereum spent several years designing bombproof legal-technical integrations to effect the legal transfer of property ownership using a single NFT transaction. Any asset can be loaded into a Mattereum NFT, given a little time and legal&nbsp;work.</p><p>So far we have done <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/47824387705324153400210554042155132922682187088261737780213014300224093421569">gold bullion</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x860849e249a208b38bd078eeb80c0a0b18436417/11">collectibles</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/0">fine art</a>, and <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/1">antiques</a>.

It is the future of commerce. Nearly everything that we buy and sell is plagued by four&nbsp;risks:</p>  How do we know we are buying the right thing? Will the shoes fit? Is the house we want to buy quiet at night or do the neighbors party? Does it work with what I own&nbsp;already?  How do we know we aren’t being ripped off? <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kirimasters/2020/07/30/bezos-admits-to-serious-issues-for-retail-brands-in-antitrust-inquiry-what-will-change/">Even Amazon</a> and the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/billionaire-spends-35m-to-investigate-400k-wine-fraud/">highest level wine collectors</a> have these problems.  What about the environmental, social, and governance impacts of our purchases? Nobody wants enslaved children making their phones or clothing, yet both mineral mining and the garment trade have huge problems with child labour globally.  What if we get stuck with this thing we have bought? We want rid of it, but it’s too expensive to throw in the landfill, and too inconvenient to sell on&nbsp;eBay.  <p>Mattereum’s methodology answers all of these questions. That’s why Mattereum is the future of dcommerce.</p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1e65ad4fb60844925ed95dec8460d8de807b2bc4/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1e65ad4fb60844925ed95dec8460d8de807b2bc4/0</a><p>Mattereum is now accepting new projects.

 Da oggi è possibile acquistare i prodotti e servizi di InfoCert legati alla conservazione accedendo al marketplace dedicato alla PA messo a disposizione da AgID. La pubblica amministrazione ha infatti a disposizione da gennaio 2022 una piattaforma dedicata che offre prodotti e servizi di conservazione di più alto livello sicurezza, InfoCert è fra i primi provider di servizi legati alla conservazione ad aver ottenuto l’accreditamento. 



<p>Un nuovo ed importante passo è stato compiuto per la Pubblica Amministrazione verso la semplificazione delle procedure da mettere in atto al fine di rispettare i dettami del CAD; il Decreto Semplificazione (D.L. 76/2020), convertito con Legge n. 120/2020, ha apportato infatti numerose modifiche al Codice dell’amministrazione digitale (CAD), tra cui alcune relative al nuovo <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/regolamento_sui_criteri_di_conservazione.pdf">regolamento sui criteri per la fornitura dei servizi di conservazione dei documenti informatici</a>.</p>



<p>L’istituzione da parte di AgID di un marketplace dedicato all’acquisto dei prodotti e servizi legati alla conservazione, diventa di fatto un importante strumento a disposizione degli enti pubblici: esso permette a coloro che vi accederanno di potersi più facilmente orientare nel vasto mercato di servizi legati alla conservazione, con il valore aggiunto di poter accedere ad una piattaforma garantita dall’Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale, avendo la possibilità di reperire quindi servizi di maggior qualità e garanzia.</p>



<p>Il marketplace non rappresenta un elenco o un albo dei conservatori, ma costituisce una vetrina dove le pubbliche amministrazioni possono individuare più agevolmente i fornitori di servizi di conservazione a norma dei documenti informatici e avviare la successiva fase di contrattualizzazione.</p>



<p>La conservazione dei documenti informatici per conto delle pubbliche amministrazioni da parte di soggetti esterni deve uniformarsi – nel rispetto della disciplina europea – alle Linee guida sulla formazione, gestione e conservazione dei documenti informatici nonché al sopradetto regolamento, adottati entrambi dall’Agenzia per l’Italia digitale (AgID), che segnano il superamento del precedente meccanismo di accreditamento dei conservatori. In particolare, l’articolo 34, comma 1-bis del Codice dell’Amministrazione Digitale, prevede che le pubbliche amministrazioni possano procedere alla conservazione dei documenti informatici o all’interno della propria struttura organizzativa, oppure affidandola ad altri soggetti, pubblici o privati che possiedono i requisiti di qualità, di sicurezza e organizzazione.</p>



<p>InfoCert dal 2014 è tra le prime aziende italiane accreditate dall’Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale (AgID) come Conservatore, requisito normativo necessario per erogare servizi di Conservazione Digitale a norma per la Pubblica Amministrazione, il suo approdo al Marketplace di AgID fa sì che una gamma di prodotti e servizi di valore, siano sempre più a disposizione degli enti pubblici, i quali potranno usufruire in maniera intuitiva e veloce, di servizi ad alto valore tecnologico, con un conseguente vantaggio in termini di risparmio dei costi e aumento delle performance.</p>



<p>Per approfondire alcuni dettagli in materia di conservazione digitale a norma, rimandiamo alla lettura dell’articolo: <a href="https://www.infocert.it/che-cose-la-conservazione-digitale/">https://www.infocert.it/che-cose-la-conservazione-digitale/</a></p>



<p>Dalla 1° gennaio 2022 inoltre, hanno piena applicabilità anche le&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/linee_guida_sul_documento_informatico.pdf">Linee Guida sulla formazione, gestione e conservazione dei</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/linee_guida_sul_documento_informatico_.pdf">documenti informatici</a>.</p>

        <p>UNISOT joins The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway at the European Commission’s Early Adopters Program as the SSI technology provider.</p>
<p>The European Commission has launched an Early Adopter Program to support public sector institutions in EEA countries in testing out use cases on EBSI. UNISOT is piloting a triple accounting solution which relies on Self-Sovereign Identity principles. EBSI is the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure, a pan European permissioned public ledger based on public standards and open governments model. UNISOT is a partner on this project and is providing the technical solution for Self-Sovereign Identity compatible with the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF).</p>
<p>The European Commission’s Early Adopter Program is an initiative comprised of EU and EEA member states eager to become pioneers in implementing EBSI use cases (Self-Sovereign Identity, Document Traceability, Diplomas and Trusted Data Sharing). In this, second wave of pilots, many European countries and organizations are onboarding onto the EBSI test platform, including The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (Finanstilsynet), which in collaboration with UNISOT is piloting a use case related to triple accounting based on the EBSIs Document Traceability and Self-Sovereign Identity use cases. This aims to ensure legal compliance in accordance with eIDAS 2.0 directive.</p>
<p>The project has entrusted UNISOT to provide the participating entities with a full SSI technology platform, including an end-user wallet (UNISOT ID), which will also have Verifiable Credential issuing features and credential verification tools for relying parties. This is an uncommon model in the SSI space which foresees the wallet software being used only as a holding agent and for purposes of providing access to one’s data. The UNISOT wallet will integrate the full life cycle of a Verifiable Credential, from issuance and storage to verification as this is in line with the use case to enable document cross-signing between multiple parties.</p>
<p>Through collaboration amongst all entities, UNISOT aims to integrate its product suite with EBSI and become a fully compatible SSI solutions provider in the Scandinavian region. Through this pilot UNISOT aims to achieve compliance with EBSI guidelines and provide the market with a compliant wallet solution which passes EBSI conformance testing.</p>

<p>“As the world is increasingly interconnected, everyone shares the responsibility of securing cyberspace” – Newton Lee</p>



<p>With increasing cybercrime, single sign-on (SSO) solutions are no longer the best defense in preventing data breaches. SSO solutions rely on restricting data rather than protecting it, and since login credentials are the key focus of cybercriminals, it is no surprise&nbsp; that almost <a href="https://www.isdecisions.com/single-sign-on-active-directory-security-issues/">81%</a> of data breaches are caused by credential misuse. To overcome SSO shortcomings, it’s necessary to deploy multi-factor authentication to protect sensitive data.&nbsp;</p>



 What is Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security system that requires users to prove their identity in multiple ways before accessing user accounts, VPN, or shared resources. MFA is a core component of identity access management policy and relies on more than just a single piece of evidence. With MFA, each piece&nbsp; of evidence that the user possesses is different:&nbsp; something they have, something they know, and something they are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Small to midsize businesses are increasingly implementing MFA policies, and Gartner predicts that by the end of 2022, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-a-passwordless-approach-to-improve-security/">60%</a> of large and global enterprises and 90% of midsize enterprises will implement a complete passwordless approach.&nbsp;</p>



 How Does Multi-Factor Authentication Work? 



<p>MFA is easy-to-use and adds a powerful extra layer of protection by&nbsp; requesting verification information after a user inputs their login credentials. This additional information can include one-time passwords (OTPs), <a href="https://imageware.io/resource/biometric-authentication-access/">biometric authentication</a>, or authentication via an application.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Based on the type of authentication, MFA is be categorized into three main types:</p>



  Knowledge factor: Requires answering a personal security question. Knowledge factor authentication usually contains passwords, PINs, and OTPs.&nbsp;  Possession factor: Requires access to specific items, such as an ID badge, token key, or a SIM card.&nbsp;  



  Inherence factor: Requires biometric authentication, such as fingerprint, iris, retina, voice, or hand geometry.  



 4 Benefits of Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>MFA plays an important role in information security by protecting data against hackers and potential breaches. MFA benefits include</p>



 1. Multiple Layers of Security 



<p>MFA provides more layers of security than those offered by two-factor authentication. These additional layers ensure that the customers logging in are who they claim to be. For example, in the case of data theft, hackers may steal one piece of information but with MFA they will be unable to authenticate themselves without the additional required information.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Easy Deployment 



<p>Because MFA is easy to use and non-invasive in nature, it doesn’t affect the rest of an organization’s virtual space. Its innate user experience is one&nbsp; of the reasons why users choose MFA.</p>



 3. Regulatory Compliance 



<p>Implementing MFA can help organizations remain in compliance with necessary regulations. The PCI DSS (payment card industry data security standards) requires that MFA be deployed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing data. Even if application updates result in unintended consequences, MFA will ensure the system remains secure.&nbsp;</p>



 4. SSO Compliance 



<p>An industry-compliant MFA comes with an SSO solution. Using a secondary identification with SSO confirms user identities and reduces the risk of data breaches due to password theft.&nbsp;</p>



 Examples of Risk-based Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Organizations can use&nbsp; different MFA types for their employees, customers, and users, with some organizations bypassing the MFA for low-risk scenarios while requiring stronger authentication in high-risk environments. For example:</p>



  A bank may allow customers to simply log in with their credentials but require additional authentication methods, such as biometric authentication, before completing a transaction.&nbsp;  An organization may need a higher level of assurance that an employee is someone they claim to be when accessing certain areas of the organization, such as a server room, compared to lower risk areas such as a coffee shop, cafeteria, or conference rooms.  A retailer may set up MFA for vendors who log in from a non-company-owned device to ensure that the person logging in&nbsp; is not a hacker who is trying to gain access with a stolen password or PIN.&nbsp;  



<p>Risk-based MFA is adaptive and strengthens security only when warranted, ensuring these security measures can evolve over time.&nbsp;</p>

Is D.C. taking crypto seriously? Congressman Tom Emmer shares the latest from the ongoings in Washington. Minnesota Representative Emmer is a 4th term member of the House of Representatives. He sits on the House Financial Services Committee and is a dedicated crypto advocate. Many of us have preconceived notions that the majority of the government is anti-crypto. Representative Emmer explains why this isn’t entirely true. We also unpack what’s at stake here. What happens if we get crypto policy wrong? How do we defeat the super-shadowy-legislators? Should we follow in China’s Digital Yuan footsteps? <p>Lastly, Representative Emmers shares that Bankless—yes—Bankless is having an impact in Washington!

  <p>Fauna is a transactional database that is delivered to your application as a secure cloud API. Fauna hosts your database and then allows your application to make calls against it. Typically, to secure such an API, you would establish a relationship between your users and the database in your code. This would mean signing in your users using your authentication provider, in this case, Okta. Then you would need to convert that user to an authorized user to connect to your API.</p>

<p>Fauna cuts out the intermediary by directly accepting Okta as an authentication provider, thus securing your application and your database using your Okta login alone.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a new Okta application, a new authorization server for that application, and a Fauna database. You will secure the Fauna database with OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication.</p>

<p>Table of Contents</p>

   <a>Create a Fauna database</a>

   <a>Run your React + FaunaDB application</a> 
   <a>Learn more about FaunaDB and React</a> 
 

 Create an OpenID Connect application and authorization server 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the issuer and client ID as you will need them in your application.</p>

<p>Once you have created the application you will need to set up a custom authorization server. FaunaDB will provide the appropriate audience to supply with your access token. However, Okta will not allow you to change the audience on the default authorization server.</p>

<p>Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your favorite browser. Log in and navigate to Security &gt; API. Select Add Authorization Server and give it a meaningful name and description. You can set your audience to anything (it cannot be left blank), but you will need to change this after setting up your FaunaDB database.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click on Access Policies &gt; Add Policy. Name it “Default” and give it a description.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Press Create Policy  and then click Add Rule. Name the rule “Default Rule” and make sure  Authorization Code is selected in the Grant Type section. You can leave the rest of the rule as it is, but I encourage you to review these settings should you need to change them in the future.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, return to the Settings tab and open the Metadata URI link. You will need the <code>jwks_uri</code> and <code>issuer</code> values from this page.</p>

<p>You can now create your Fauna database but leave the Okta Admin Console open as you will need to change the audience in your authorization server after setting up the Fauna database.</p>

 Create a Fauna database 

<p>Next, head over to <a href="https://fauna.com/">Fauna</a> and sign up for a new account. After you’ve registered and authenticated, click on Create Database and name your database “Products”. Select the Classic Region Group for this tutorial. Click on the Use demo data checkbox and click Create. Fauna will automatically build a new database for you with data collections for customers, managers, orders, products, and stores. You can click on any of these collections to see the same data behind them.</p>

<p>Now you will need to add a new role to the database. Fauna requires that you assign a custom role to your provider. Under the Security tab, navigate to Roles. Click New Role. Name your role “User” and add the <code>products</code> collection to it. Give this role Read access. Click Save to save the changes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you will want to list Okta as a registered provider for this database. Select the Providers tab and select New Access Provider. Name the new provider “Okta” and add the details for your Issuer and JSON Web Key Secret URI that you retrieved from Okta earlier. Add the <code>User</code> role to the provider and click Save. Now Fauna will accept the token from Okta and treat the user as though they are part of the <code>User</code> role, giving that user access to read the product’s collection.</p>

<p>Finally, under the Providers tab click the settings wheel next to Okta. Copy the audience URL from here and return to your Okta Admin Console. Under your authorization server click Edit and replace the placeholder audience value with the one you copied from Fauna.</p>

 Create a React app with FaunaDB 

<p>Now that Okta and Fauna are set up to work with each other it’s time to create your site that will make use of both. Start by using the task runner <code>npx create-react-app products</code> to scaffold a new React application. Once the task runner has completed, type in <code>cd products</code> to navigate in to your new project.</p>

<p>For this project, you will need to install a few packages from npm. First, you will want to include the packages to make securing your application with Okta quick and easy.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@6.0.0 @okta/okta-react@6.4.2
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need the FaunaDB JavaScript driver to make calls against your database.</p>

   <code>npm i faunadb@4.5.2
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to include <code>react-router-dom</code>.</p>

   <code>npm i react-router-dom@5.3.0
</code>   

<p>Now you can set up a <code>.env</code> file with your environment variables. Create a file named <code>.env</code> in the root of your application. Open the file and add the following code to it.</p>

 <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE=
REACT_APP_OKTA_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_ID={yourAuthorizationServerId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
</code> 

<p>Next, add a new file to your <code>src</code> directory called <code>AppWithRouterAccess.jsx</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Route, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

import Home from './Pages/Home';

const AppWithRouterAccess = () =&gt; {
  const issuer = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE + '/oauth2/' +
    process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_ID;
  const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
  const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + '/callback';

  const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
    issuer: issuer,
    clientId: clientId,
    redirectUri: redirect,
  });

  const history = useHistory();

  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
    history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
  };

  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home}/&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
};

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

<p>This file sets up your Okta authentication and wraps your routes with the <code>&lt;Security&gt;</code> node. This will provide access to the <code>oktaAuth</code> object in those routes.</p>

<p>You will need to add it to your stock <code>App.js</code> file to make this file work. Open <code>src/App.js</code> and replace the code there with the following.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import AppWithRouterAccess from './AppWithRouterAccess';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;AppWithRouterAccess/&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>Along with using the <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code>, this file also imports Bootstrap, which you will use for styling.</p>

   <code>npm i react-bootstrap@2.1.2 bootstrap@5.1.3
</code>   

<p>Add the pages and components that will bring your application to life. Then add two new folders to your <code>src</code> directory; <code>Components</code> and <code>Pages</code>. In the <code>Pages</code> directory, add a file called <code>Home.jsx</code> and put the following code in it.</p>

   <code>import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Container } from 'react-bootstrap';
import faunadb from 'faunadb';

import { withOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

import Header from '../Components/Header';
import Products from '../Components/Products';

export default withOktaAuth(

      this.state = {
        products: undefined,
        pendingProducts: false,
      };
    }

    async getProducts(accessToken, cb) {
      this.setState({
        pendingProducts: true,
      });

      const client = new faunadb.Client({
        domain: 'db.fauna.com',
        secret: accessToken,
        scheme: 'https',
      });
      const q = faunadb.query;

      const {Documents, Collection} = q;

      client
        .query(
          q.Map(
            q.Paginate(Documents(Collection('products'))),
            q.Lambda((x) =&gt; q.Get(x))
          )
        )
        .then((result) =&gt; {
          cb(null, result);
        })
        .catch((err) =&gt; {
          cb(err, null);
        });
    }

    handleResult = (err, result) =&gt; {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      } else {
        this.setState({
          products: result.data,
          pendingProducts: false,
        });
      }
    };

    componentDidMount = () =&gt; {
      if (
        this.props.authState?.isAuthenticated &amp;&amp;
        !this.state.pendingProducts &amp;&amp;
        !this.state.products
      ) {
        this.getProducts(
          this.props.authState.accessToken.accessToken,
          this.handleResult
        );
      }
    };

    render() {
      return (
        &lt;Container&gt;
          &lt;Header
            authState={this.props.authState}
            oktaAuth={this.props.oktaAuth}

          &lt;Products
            authState={this.props.authState}

        &lt;/Container&gt;
      );
    }
  }
);
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you chose US or EU for your database’s region, the domain will need to be <code>db.us.fauna.com</code> or <code>db.eu.fauna.com</code>.</p>

<p>Your application will only have one page. Depending on the state of the application, you will display different messages to the user. If the user isn’t logged in, present them with a message telling them such and a login button. When the user clicks the login button, Okta takes care of the authentication process, and signs in the user. You can access information about the user’s state using <code>this.props.authState</code>.</p>

<p>If the user is logged in but the data hasn’t loaded from Fauna, you can display a simple loading message. Once the data is received then you can present the products to the user. This will happen in the <code>Products</code> component that you will write shortly. To retrieve the data from Fauna, you need to import the <code>faunadb</code> library and provide it with the <code>accessToken</code> from Okta.</p>

<p>Next, in your <code>Components</code> folder add a file named <code>Header.jsx</code>. Add the following code for it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Navbar, Nav, Form, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'

const Header = ({authState, oktaAuth}) =&gt; {

  if (authState?.isPending) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  }

  const button = authState?.isAuthenticated ?
    &lt;Button variant='secondary' onClick={() =&gt; {
      oktaAuth.signOut('/');
    }}&gt;Logout&lt;/Button&gt; :
    &lt;Button variant='secondary' onClick={() =&gt; {
      oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect()
    }}&gt;Login&lt;/Button&gt;

  return (
    &lt;Navbar bg='light' expand='lg'&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Brand href='/'&gt;Products with FaunaDB&lt;/Navbar.Brand&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Toggle aria-controls='basic-navbar-nav'/&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Collapse id='basic-navbar-nav'&gt;
        &lt;Nav className='mr-auto'&gt;
        &lt;/Nav&gt;
        &lt;Form className='d-flex'&gt;
          {button}
        &lt;/Form&gt;
      &lt;/Navbar.Collapse&gt;
    &lt;/Navbar&gt;
  );
};

export default Header;

 Learn more about FaunaDB and React 

<p>This is just the beginning of what you can do with FaunaDB and custom providers. The best part is you don’t have to move away from Okta to properly secure your application. You can now manage access and authorization levels to your database from Okta rather than on the FaunaDB side. And using the libraries provided by Fauna and Okta, it’s fast and easy to set up a secure web application with a FaunaDB backend.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-faunadb-react-example">@oktadev/okta-faunadb-react-example</a> repository.</p>

<p>From an industry-leading solution to the Travel Rule to a truly frictionless customer experience, this is what CCOs and CEOs should know about our FATF Travel Rule solution — and why you should use&nbsp;it.</p><p>To comply, or not to comply? That is the question for many VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) in blockchain and crypto. Uncertainty and apprehension are not entirely surprising given the current regulatory landscape, where implementation of the FATF’s guidance on VASPs has been overly nebulous. We know that for many, compliance is considered an unnecessary cost and confusing path to navigate, where FUD exists around PPI (Protected Personal Information) and data security, decentralization, and interoperability. We’re here to change&nbsp;that.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-core-team-open-sources-veriscope-makes-travel-rule-compliance-open-free-and-adb4a8b6945e">Shyft Network Core Team Open Sources Veriscope, Makes Travel Rule Compliance Open, Free, and…</a></p><p>Enter Veriscope, Shyft Network’s Travel Rule solution: a decentralized discovery and coordination infrastructure and P2P data transmission network, allowing VASPs to remain compliant, preserve data integrity and sovereignty and enable a truly frictionless customer experience. We focus deeply on global interoperability with participation from large VASPs across several jurisdictions. To date, leading <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf">exchanges</a> globally like <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/%E2%80%8Bbinance-deploys-shyft-networks-veriscope-to-support-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-421499824684902555">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/17/bitmex-deribit-tap-shyft-network-for-fatf-travel-rule-solution/">Bitmex</a>, Bitfinex, Deribit, and <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/tether-begins-testing-and-integration-of-veriscope-shyft-networks-solution-to-the-travel-rule-55af3e800fd8">Tether</a> have already announced their participation and collaboration with Veriscope.</p><p>We know that when navigating the compliance space — whether you’re an exchange, custodian or CCO (Chief Compliance Officer) — you will have questions about how different solutions work and what your options are. Below, we’ve highlighted some of the key advantages of Veriscope, which we believe truly separates us from the pack of other Travel Rule solutions in the&nbsp;market.</p> 1. How frictionless is the Veriscope customer experience? <p>Very. While other Travel Rule solutions might ask their customers for VASP details (name, address, VASP code, etc.) Veriscope doesn’t. When using our solution, you don’t need to collect beneficiary VASP details, including VASP codes. Veriscope offers automated and accurate detection of beneficiary VASP details directly from the beneficiary’s wallet address — so you don’t have to. Imagine, from your customers point of view, there will be no change to how they transact&nbsp;today.</p> 2. Is Veriscope a safe and secure solution? <p>Security of customer information and trust are paramount to Veriscope. We offer a VASP-to-VASP transfer of customer PII, and there is never any storing of customer PII by Veriscope. Customer PII doesn’t even relay or route through our servers; it is a completely P2P solution. You can also trust our secure technology to prevent data mining of your customer PII through an explicit and unique customer consent mechanism.</p> 3. How can we trust the VASPs who use Veriscope? <p>Good question! Veriscope utilizes VASP due diligence information to internationally recognized standards, with an option to seek a third-party verification from major global law firm DLA Piper. We also offer you the capability to select counterparty VASPs based on jurisdiction, license, and/or due-diligence status. This is the only solution to offer this capability to meet FATF guidelines and protect your customer&nbsp;PII.</p> 4. Is Veriscope a popular solution? <p>We’re already in advanced stages with the majority of transaction flow for the global VASP market — and the numbers don’t lie: VASPs responsible for over 60% of global transaction flow are already evaluating or integrating Veriscope. Significant large-scale VASP development input since inception means you can expect unparalleled support and industry alignment from our&nbsp;product.</p> 5. Is Veriscope committed to open technology and decentralization? <p>Absolutely. Veriscope is a future-proof, completely open technology. Decentralization is on our radar as a priority to prepare for next-generation VASPs, such as DeFi. And yes, we’re already speaking with DeFi providers about participation in Veriscope because our technology is perfectly aligned. Regarding openness, Veriscope is built by VASPs, for VASPs. Our open architecture allows for co-development by VASPs to continuously improve our solution.</p> 6. Does Veriscope require expensive fees — and a lot of&nbsp;them? <p>Our blockchain-based architecture enables consistently low transaction fees. We have zero set-up fees, zero minimum charges, and zero ongoing licensing fees. You only pay per-transaction network fees with a native token, where you can control the&nbsp;fee.</p> 7. Does Veriscope work with other Travel Rule protocols? Is it interoperable? <p>Yes, and yes. Veriscope is integrating with other Travel Rule protocols to enable the broadest VASP network reach. Watch for our announcements as these come online in the coming weeks! Veriscope can also integrate with third-party service providers such as blockchain analytics firms to provide an all-in-one solution. It’s a one-stop-shop for VASPs — from big to&nbsp;small.</p> 8. Is Veriscope able to look back at past transactions? Can you protect against the “Sunrise&nbsp;Issue?” <p>We’re proud to be the only Travel Rule solution protecting against the Sunrise Issue. No other solution can provide this. We permit a historic transaction lookback on any transaction involving a VASP broadcast to Veriscope before the date of integration. Additionally, transaction broadcasts are immutable records on-chain, providing an open, permanent audit&nbsp;trail.</p><p>If Veriscope sounds like the solution for you and you’d like to learn more, and receive integration guidance, <a href="https://veriscope.network/">contact us&nbsp;now.</a></p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems.

				 <p>Some ideas or concepts are by nature perfect. Look at the wheel, over thousands of years it has remained the same. Humans are natural storytellers and are wired to think in terms of stories. When we hear stories we can’t help but imagine ourselves being inside them. Like the wheel, it has always been this way. It’s not often that things stay the same in the technology ecosystem. This video was shot eight years ago, and it’s still just as relevant in 2022.</p>
<p>In this short video I discuss Requirements vs. Stories and the role they play in the ops and application environment. Sometimes, frustrating discussions can take place around the concept of requirements. There are many players on the contract bringing about different requirements. Everyone wants to understand the deep requirements, but putting them front and centre can create a problem. Players are constantly looking to put a check in the numerous requirement boxes once they’ve been met. The trouble in this comes when you have a mass amount of data to break down. In the ops and application space, there can be a lot going on and far too many moving pieces to meet just the requirements. We don’t instinctively think in terms of requirements. They are there, and they are important, but it is the operational story that matters.</p>
<p>It’s all about the stories.</p>

<p>Dock has a mission to enable organizations and individuals to create and share verifiable data. For organizations that want the ability to issue and share verifiable credentials in a mobile application, we’ve developed our mobile SDK.</p><p>SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package, facilitating the creation of applications. Dock’s SDK will allow organizations to:</p>  Build their own mobile applications on Dock’s network  Integrate Dock’s functionality into their own applications  Have full control over the creation, issuance, and verification of verifiable credentials  <p>We understand many SMEs and large organizations want to offer storage and functionality of digital credentials in their applications but don’t have the resources to make this happen. In a quest to help organizations offer verifiable credentials, the complete source code for Dock’s SDK is available to install from <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk">GitHub</a>, which will allow organizations to embed an identity wallet into their own, existing React Native apps that can be deployed rapidly. </p><p>Helping the Development Team</p><p>Helping reduce the time and cost of building an API from scratch, while having full control over creating and managing API keys and more, Dock’s SDK is the ideal starting point to incorporate verifiable credentials and decentralized identity.</p><p>Enabling digital credentials to be stored in a mobile wallet can take months of development, meaning more money and time being spent from the already scarce resources of a developer's time. Users will have access to support throughout the years should any bugs and errors arise giving back time to the development team to focus on other projects. </p><p>Installation</p><p>Dock’s SDK is available for installation via NPM or Yarn. Once the package has been installed, users can import the SDK like any ES6/CJS module.

Find tutorials on how to install and set up <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-tutorials">Dock’s SDK here</a>. </p><p>Add Dock’s Functionality to your Website</p><p>Dock also offers an API as a complete solution for creating, managing, and presenting verifiable credentials, allowing users to issue, verify, and revoke credentials, manage decentralized identities and interact with the Dock blockchain. For organizations wanting to add verifiable credentials and decentralized identities to their website functionality, Dock’s API is easy to integrate.<br><br>For organizations who don’t have the ability or resources to integrate with an API, we’ve created Dock Certs. Verifiable credentials and decentralized identities can be created, issued, and verified in a few simple clicks.

  <p>AngularJS 1.0 was released in October 2010. At the time, it was considered one of the most revolutionary and popular web frameworks ever to see the light of day. Developers loved it, and created many apps with it. However, as a pioneer in the JS framework space, AngularJS had some growing pains and significant issues. The team went back to the drawing board for a major breaking release with Angular 2. It took two years to develop and influenced many devs to hop onto other frameworks in the meantime.</p>

<p>Today, five years after Angular 2 was released, we just call it “Angular”, and its version numbers have far less meaning. Five years is a long time for a modern JS web framework to live and thrive. If you look at the number of Stack Overflow questions, you’ll see that users struggle with React far more than Angular.</p>



 


<p>I kid, I kid. 😅</p>

<p>I don’t think Stack Overflow tags indicate that developers have a hard time with the framework; I think they indicate a thriving community. The more people use technology, the more they submit questions for it.</p>

<p><a href="https://hotframeworks.com/">hotframeworks.com</a> lists a score that combines GitHub stars with Stack Overflow tags and says the top six web frameworks are as follows (at the time of this writing):</p>

 
   React 
   ASP.NET MVC 
   Angular 
   Ruby on Rails 
   AngularJS 
   Vue.js 
 

<p>Angular is still very popular among developers. If you’re developing an Angular app today, you probably need a way to authenticate your users. That’s where OpenID Connect (OIDC) can help you. OIDC is a layer on top of OAuth 2.0 that provides identity.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to add OIDC authentication with Auth0 to a new Angular app in just a few steps.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   A favorite text editor or IDE. I recommend <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, but I know many JavaScript developers prefer <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. 
   <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> v14+ and npm installed.

<p>If you would rather follow along by watching a video, check out the screencast below from <a href="https://youtu.be/YiR7XFgsD8w">the OktaDev YouTube channel</a>.</p>

 
            
         

 Create an Angular app 

<p>First, you’ll need to create a new Angular app with routing enabled. Install the Angular CLI globally, then create an app.</p>

   <code>npm i -g @angular/cli@13
ng new auth0-demo --routing
</code>   

<p>You’ll be prompted to select your favorite stylesheet format. The selection you make doesn’t matter for this example since we’re focused on functionality rather than updating visuals.</p>

 Add Auth with OpenID Connect 

<p>To add authentication with Auth0, you’ll first need a <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">free Auth0 account</a>. Install the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli#installation">Auth0 CLI</a> and run <code>auth0 login</code> to register your account. Then, run <code>auth0 apps create</code>. Use the name <code>auth0-demo</code> and specify a description of your choosing. Select Single Page Web Application and use <code>http://localhost:4200/home</code> for the Callback URL. Specify <code>http://localhost:4200</code> for the rest of the URLs. We’re using 4200 as the port here because that’s the default for local Angular development.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can also use the Auth0 Console to create an OIDC app:</p>

   
     <a href="https://auth0.com/auth/login">Log in</a> to Auth0 or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">create an account</a> if you don’t have one. Go to Applications &gt; Create Application. 
     Choose Single Page Web Applications as the application type and click Create. 
     Click Angular, then the Settings tab. 
     Add <code>http://localhost:4200/home</code> as an Allowed Callback URL and <code>http://localhost:4200</code> as a Logout URL. 
     Specify <code>http://localhost:4200</code> as an Allowed Origin and click Save Changes at the bottom. 
   
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have a new Angular app and Auth0 OIDC set up, you can use <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#angular--auth0">OktaDev Schematics</a> to add OAuth 2.0 and OIDC support to your Angular app. Be sure to execute this command in the folder for the app itself (<code>auth0-demo</code>) adjacent to <code>package.json</code>.</p>

   <code>ng add @oktadev/schematics --auth0
</code>   

<p>The Auth0 CLI will prompt you for an issuer URL and client ID, which were displayed when setting up the app in Auth0. If you used the CLI, it would have shown the issuer URL right above the client ID.</p>

   <code>=== dev-0ua1y-go.us.auth0.com application created

  CLIENT ID            TJgZxGnlSkqUe6JfMFSipZcFsbpl6LS2
</code>   

<p>This process will perform the following steps for you:</p>

 
   Install the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular">Auth0 Angular SDK</a>. 
   Add <code>src/app/auth-routing.module.ts</code> with your OIDC configuration and initialization logic. 
   Configure an <code>AuthHttpInterceptor</code> that adds an <code>Authorization</code> header with an access token to outbound requests. 
   Create a <code>HomeComponent</code> and configure it with authentication logic. 
   Update unit tests for <code>AppComponent</code> and <code>HomeComponent</code> to mock Auth0. 
 

<p>To see all the changes it makes to your files, see <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-angular-example/pull/1/files">this pull request on GitHub</a>. If you’re interested in learning more about Schematics, I recommend reading my <a>Use Angular Schematics to Simplify Your Life</a> tutorial.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Want to use Okta for your identity provider? That’s possible too! See <a>Use the Okta CLI to Quickly Build Secure Angular Apps</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

 Test your Angular authentication flow 

<p>Run <code>ng serve</code> in your app, and you should see a login button at <code>http://localhost:4200/home</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Login button and sign in with one of the configured users for your Auth0 application. Because this is just a demo, you probably haven’t done that - more likely, you should sign up as a new user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After login, you’ll be redirected back to your app, and you’ll see a Logout button displayed in the bottom left corner.</p>

<p></p>

 Display the authenticated user’s name 

<p>To display the authenticated user’s name, you can use the <code>user$</code> observable on the <code>AuthService</code> instance.</p>

<p>Modify <code>src/app/home/home.component.html</code> to display a welcome message to the user.</p>

   <code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="(auth.isAuthenticated$ | async) === false" (click)="login()" id="login"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;div *ngIf="auth.user$ | async as user"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Welcome, {{user?.name}}!&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated$ | async" (click)="logout()" id="logout"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Refresh your app, and you should see your name displayed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If everything works—congrats!</p>

<p>Introduction: Isolationism: AERGO’s Solution: The Utilization Of Merkle&nbsp;Bridge</p>The Great Connection<p>Blockchain isolationism is a focal problem that the totality of the cryptocurrency space faces; multi-chain technology enables universal interconnectivity between different projects. Although the usage of digital assets and different blockchains are increasing at a rapid rate, isolationism is still the predominant “law” of blockchains. The exchange of information has become stuck in a “blockchain stagnation” because of the lack of interconnectivity between ecosystems. For example, since Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own isolated ecosystems, consensus model and transaction methods, the smooth transference of information and communication is all but impossible to achieve in an immediate fashion. This creates a problem of convenience and efficiency.</p><p>The Merkle Bridge: The Creator Of Convenience</p>Merkle Bridge: The Technology Of Interoperability<p>The Merkle Bridge has solved a simple yet imperative function for the expansion of blockchain: that function being interoperability. The Merkle Bridge is a technology that interconnects heterogenous blockchains together. In essence, the technology is designed to enable the exchange of assets and information between inherently different blockchains or platforms; Ethereum to AERGO being an example as such. This is a major stepping stone of interconnectivity between AERGO and the collective totality of ERC-20 tokens and Ethereum&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For more details, please refer to the follow article&nbsp;below:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-merkle-bridge-what-else-is-needed-for-nft-c5170502da3a">Aergo Merkle Bridge: What else is needed for NFT?</a></p><p>The Great Relationship: GEMpay, A Blockchain Based Simple Payment Service And The Merkle&nbsp;Bridge</p>Merkle Bridge: Bridging The&nbsp;Gap<p>GEMpay works with different scalable economies; it is imperative to understand that GEMpay is a simple and easy to utilize blockchain service payment system. The more users that pay with AERGO Gem, the more discounts they receive as well; this is the cornerstone of economic self-interest and practicality. All GEMpay users must first top-up their AERGO Gem to use their points. AERGO Gem has the same value as the KRW, and you will receive an appropriate discount or profit in this functional rewards paradigm built within the GEMpay system based on your participation in the ecosystem. AERGO Gem natively supports swaps through the AERGO token. In addition, plans are put into place to support to enable swaps to Ethereum through the Merkle Bridge, which will enable swaps with various ERC-20&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>For those who’re unfamiliar with Ethereum, ERC-20 is the token standard within the Ethereum ecosystem; every Ethereum based token is an ERC-20 token. In essence, this compatibility with AERGO through the utilization of the Merkle Bridge will enable easy and seamless access for ERC-20 holders to utilize the service platform with Ethereum based tokens of their own choosing.</p><p>📊 Token Price&nbsp;Indexes</p><p>We would like to request for the patience of those who wish to utilize GEMpay. Discussions with various companies are ongoing to conduct a sufficient POC to create an appropriate index for AERGO Gem prices. It is not easy to create a reliable index in the current cryptocurrency token environment. Whether it is a centralized exchange or a decentralized exchange, since the price value in the virtual currency market depends entirely on the liquidity pool of the active wallet, it is a structure in which the exchange party must bear the risk of the index. This is because it is an environment in which anyone can attack the price whenever they want. Our plan is to open the GEMpay service according to the timeline set forth, starting with the POC and pre-booking openings in March and until the second quarter of&nbsp;2022.</p><p>If You Have Gem, You Garner A Double Discount With&nbsp;GEMpay:</p><p>March POC And Advance Reservations Are&nbsp;Open:</p><p>📍 The Three Line&nbsp;Summary</p>  The Merkle Bridge is a technology that enables interoperability between heterogenous blockchains.  GEMpay works with different economies of&nbsp;scale.  Discussions are underway with various companies to conduct POC to create an appropriate index for AERGO&nbsp;Gem.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/merkle-bridge-the-causality-that-connects-gempay-with-ethereum-and-erc20s-4d8bfc3c57b5">Merkle Bridge: The Causality That Connects GEMpay With Ethereum And ERC20's</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The debate over which type of database is superior – the traditional relational (SQL) or modern document (NoSQL) ones – has continued since the NoSQL concept itself emerged around 2009. Back then, a popular opinion was that relational databases with their rigid data schemas and very limited horizontal scalability were already on the way out and alternative schema-less database architectures with their flexibility, ease of use, and seemingly limitless scalability were just the right tool for modern, highly distributed, cloud-native applications.</p>
<p>Alas, the enthusiasm of those early years turned up to be overly optimistic – over a decade later both SQL and NoSQL solutions are going strong without a clear winner. Personally, I have always been on the fence with regard to this argument – I firmly believe that the original dichotomy is largely artificial, caused by technology limitations that have long been resolved, and, last but not least, is completely meaningless from the business perspective.</p>
<p>In a sense, this reminds me of a similar situation with Big Data. Do you remember when you had to invest in a complex and mind-bogglingly expensive hardware and software platform to be able to manage a few terabytes of data? Nowadays, the only thing you need is a credit card and a public cloud account. The very notion of Big Data has almost completely disappeared already – from a modern business perspective, it’s just “data”.</p>
<p>The same considerations apply to the SQL vs NoSQL debate: as long as your corporate data is available, consistent, and reasonably protected from misuse, your applications meet certain performance criteria and can be quickly adapted to changing business requirements, and your IT costs remain within the budget, the LOB people couldn’t care less about the name of your favorite database. Unfortunately, under the hood, the situation is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>For people working in cybersecurity, one of the daily mantras is “Complexity is the worst enemy of security.” This is true for every kind of IT infrastructure, but perhaps nowhere can making an early mistake lead to catastrophic consequences than in data(base) management. Sure, having a selection of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/">over a dozen specialized database engines</a> to choose from for your new project might sound like a great idea at first. Yet, sooner or later, you will inevitably stumble upon an unexpected limitation and face a difficult decision: should you refactor your application to support a different, more suitable engine, or should you add another one into the mix: for example, to solve a scalability challenge or simply (ha-ha!) to be able to run business analytics on live data?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, modern database vendors think about these challenges all the time and constantly work to address them for their customers, preferably in advance. And, even less surprisingly, these developments lead to a convergence of SQL and NoSQL databases towards a universal multi-model data management platform.</p>
<p>Take MongoDB, the <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/">most popular NoSQL</a> database platform. Over the years it has become such a de facto standard for NoSQL that other document database engines like Amazon DocumentDB and Azure Cosmos DB implement MongoDB APIs to allow existing apps and tools to connect to their services instead. Developers that rely on this compatibility layer get more flexibility in choosing a more suitable (better scalable, more integrated, or simply less expensive) alternative to MongoDB. The downside of this approach, of course, is that not all functions of the original are implemented, and the degree of compatibility can vary a lot across different projects. An even bigger challenge, however, is making NoSQL instances available to 3rd party tools that expect relational data – the most common use case being business analytics. Connecting existing BI tools to MongoDB is possible but requires additional infrastructure to set up and operate and most often does not provide access to real-time data, resulting in analysis of stale data.</p>
<p>Well, the more interesting is the latest news from Oracle – the database vendor known for not one but two of the most popular database engines in the world. The company just announced its own alternative for MongoDB, aptly named <a href="https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/autonomous-json-database/">Oracle Database API for MongoDB</a>. But wait, you’re probably saying, isn’t Oracle Database a relational database? How can it possibly emulate the capabilities of a document database like MongoDB?</p>
<p>Although its origins are firmly in the RDBMS camp, over the years Oracle Database has evolved into a multi-model data management platform, with native support for JSON data model available since 2014. Many customers have been using Oracle for their NoSQL projects for years, but now, with the new compatibility API, this functionality can be transparently available to any existing MongoDB-compatible application without any changes to its code. The announced API is compatible with MongoDB 4.2 and offers support for transactions and load-balanced connections. According to Oracle, the only thing developers need to change in their app is the database connection string.</p>
<p>But wait, you’re probably asking again: how exactly is it different from other compatibility APIs mentioned above? Well, this is where the most interesting things begin… As a proper multi-model database, Oracle Autonomous Database can transparently convert document collections to relational data structures and vice versa. This means that it is possible to import an existing MongoDB database into Oracle, continue running your existing app without any modifications, and get all the benefits of SQL-based business analytics on live data. The opposite is possible, too: you can expose existing relational data as MongoDB collections – for example, to make analytics reports available back in the original app with no effort.</p>
<p>The security and compliance benefits of this approach are also worth mentioning. Since all data previously spread across disparate data sources can now reside within a single database instance, it is no longer exposed to various threats and risks during the ETL process. On the contrary, all the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev70965/oracle-database-security-assessment/">enterprise-grade security features</a> of the Oracle Autonomous Database ensure consistent protection and compliance without the need to configure or tune them manually. Oracle’s MongoDB API is also backed by Oracle’s native user and role management, simplifying overall access management and governance.</p>
<p>So, where’s the catch? Well, the only one I can think of is that at the moment, the MongoDB API is only available as a part of Oracle Cloud. There are no technical limitations that would prevent it from working on-prem as well, but the company is naturally planning to use this capability to further promote its cloud services. However, considering that Oracle’s solution claims to overcome several key technical limitations of both the original MongoDB Atlas service and their competitors’ alternatives while remaining more economical to use, migrating your NoSQL workloads to Oracle Cloud might not be such an unthinkable idea at all… In fact, it could be just what developers tired of moving data from one database to another and dealing with complex manual processes are looking for.</p>

<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
<p>Antti Kettunen is a digital identity and digital trust expert and advisor. He designs ecosystem solutions, actively participates in standards and industry groups (e.g. CEN, Trust over IP, Mobey), and helps customers deliver value in their digital identity projects. He also writes and speaks about digital identity and the ongoing paradigm shift in his blog Identifinity. Antti is also one of the co-founders and advocates of the FindyNet cooperative, a digital identity network for Finland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 During this conversation, we discuss: 
 
 
 
 The current digital landscape in the Nordics, the maturity of e-Government and digital registries, and the trust that citizens of these countries have towards their governments. 
 
 
 How does the private sector in the Nordics look at self-sovereign identity? Where do they see the benefits? How do they look at the onramp from their existing federated authentication models? 
 
 
 Knowing where my organization fits inside my value chain and why knowing this will help me understand how to both benefit, contribute and thrive within an ecosystem-centric system. 
 
 
 How to decide whether or not to participate in the governance of an ecosystem? 
 
 
 The problems with API-centered architectures and the benefits gained from adopting data-centric architectures. 
 
 
 Why focusing too much on the Verifiable Credential Trust Triangle isn’t sufficient as the only tool to help with the adoption of SSI ecosystems. 
 
 
 An update on the EU Wallet and some thoughts on how it can spur SSI adoption, while looking at the risks of it possibly impeding private sector adoption. 
 
 
 
 
<p>And more!</p>

 Spherity joins the Global Battery Alliance to support the development of the GBA Battery&nbsp;Passport <p>Spherity, one of Europe’s leading providers of decentralized, digital identity technology, has become a member of the Global Battery Alliance (GBA). The GBA is a public-private collaboration platform founded in 2017 at the World Economic Forum to align interests of the stakeholders operating in the battery industry. The goal of the GBA is to establish a circular and sustainable battery value chain by 2030. Spherity was recognized by the group in respect of its efforts in the field of developing and innovating identity technologies around the concept of the Digital Product Passport.</p>Spherity joins the Global Battery Alliance to support the development of the GBA Battery Passport.<p>The Paris Agreement of the United Nations defined the goal to decrease global warming by 2°C and to build a fairer and more sustainable society. To implement it the European Union has ratified the European Green Deal, which is defining several activities.</p><p>As one of the activities to reach a circular economy, the European Commission has proposed the “new EU Battery Regulation” which mandates a Digital Product Passport for batteries (short battery passport) above 2 kWh capacity from January 2026. The battery passport shall carry all relevant information of a battery that makes it longer lasting, reusable or recyclable. In the GBA, the battery industry is coming together to find an industry-wide solution to comply with this regulation.</p><p>Being one of the pioneers developing solutions for the Digital Product Passport, Spherity is working closely with policy makers and international companies to conceptualise a globally acceptable technology. Spherity is engaged in the track &amp; trace working group of the GBA to develop a battery passport that embraces standardization, interoperability, inclusivity, privacy, and an affordable cost structure.</p><p>“Spherity’s GBA membership is yet another move towards the company’s strong commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in general and towards enabling the circular economy with digital product passports in particular.” says Susanne Guth-Orlowski, Chief Innovation &amp; Solutions Officer of Spherity.</p><p>About the Global Battery&nbsp;Alliance</p><p>The Global Battery Alliance (GBA) is a public-private collaboration platform founded in 2017 at the World Economic Forum to help establish a sustainable battery value chain by 2030. The GBA brings together leading businesses along the entire battery value chain, international organizations, NGOs, academics and multiple governments to align collectively in a pre-competitive, multi-stakeholder manner to drive systemic change. All its activities follow <a href="https://www.globalbattery.org/media/publications/gba-10-guiding-principles.pdf">Ten Guiding Principles</a> in an effort to realize the <a href="https://www.globalbattery.org/media/publications/WEF_A_Vision_for_a_Sustainable_Battery_Value_Chain_in_2030_Report.pdf">GBA 2030 Vision</a> across three dimensions: establishing a circular battery value chain that is a major driver to achieve the Paris Agreement targets; transforming the economy in the value chain, creating new jobs and economic value; and safeguarding human rights and economic development in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

<p>In business banking, 2022 is all about the fintech sector. In the past, huge strides have been made in digital banking and fintech services for individual customers’ needs. Apps, customer service chat, and 24/7 transaction times have all revolutionized the banking experience for the customer. While some of these services have benefited business and commercial banking, banks and financial services could do more.</p>



<p>Business banking specialists provide small and medium business owners a great deal of services and opportunities with a <a href="https://getpenta.com/en/business-account/open-an-account/">business bank account</a>, to get entrepreneurial ventures off the ground and help established businesses flourish. This year is going to see a lot more innovation in these areas from them and others.</p>



<p>Below are some of the biggest business banking trends set to take off in 2022. Take these predictions as both things to get excited about and to prepare yourself for. It’s going to be a big year for business owners.</p>



 Super apps 



<p>2021 saw the release of<a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/107787/paypal-venmo-banking-super-mobile-app-payments/?internal-link-blist"> PayPal’s ‘super app’</a> and banks and financial services would have done well to pay attention. PayPal’s app combined a huge breadth of services for consumers, integrating shopping, investing, mobile payments, crypto services, and more all into one app.</p>



<p>For business banking, the super app’s potentialities are even more exciting. Business banking services are consistently updating their apps, taking advantage of what <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/regulatory-risks-fintechs/">fintechs</a> offer to create the ultimate app from which any entrepreneur can handle all their financial responsibilities.</p>



 Sustainable banking 



<p>The reality of climate change is finally arriving in the business sector. It is easier now than ever for companies to measure their carbon footprints and achieve<a href="https://getpenta.com/en/blog/penta-is-carbon-neutral/"> carbon neutrality</a> or offset their pollutive output by funding sustainable organizations.</p>



<p>The expectation is growing in the business banking sector. We are now seeing the demand from business owners to align themselves with financial services, which align themselves with sustainable models, and actively participate in the fight against a rising climate. Fintech has shown itself to be a suitably disruptive sector regarding sustainability in finance. This is especially important in banking, an industry historically fraught with fossil fuel funding. As the consumer demand for a sustainable world grows and green tech start-ups dominate the market, business banking services will race to meet these demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Artificial intelligence 



<p>The list of AI’s capabilities in finance today would require a much lengthier post than this—and its future capabilities are limitless. Already, AI has helped banks and financial services with improving security and fraud detection while streamlining various services for consumers, but 2022 promises more exciting developments.</p>



<p>AI and business banking are ideal pairing. Businesses need from their financial services intelligent interfaces, smart chatbots handling the bulk of inquiries, and powerful machine learning tools to gather important data about how entrepreneurs run their businesses. Be prepared to see developments in all these areas this year.</p>



 Open banking APIs 



<p>Despite controversial claims to<a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/11/open-bankings-failure/#:~:text=Speaking%20to%20MPs%20at%20a,has%20not%20been%20a%20success%E2%80%9D.&amp;text=One%20of%20the%20heroes%20of,incentivise%20consumers%20to%20switch%20accounts."> its lack of success</a>, open banking is here to stay, and it’s likely to expand in 2022. The exciting prospect stands to increase consumers’ data portability and make data sharing easier without the interference of institutional banks. While this has been met with some skepticism over data protection and safety, the recent executive order in the US to<a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/118023/white-house-tells-cfpb-to-hit-the-accelerator-on-bank-data-share-rules/?internal-link-embd"> implement data sharing provisions</a> demonstrates that these concerns are being met, and the trend is gaining traction.</p>



<p>APIs that allow easy communication for business owners will make open banking a huge time saver in business banking. Through these platforms, entrepreneurs with business banking accounts in an open banking landscape can expect to reach more clients and manage many complex transactions with ease.</p>



<p>Staying ahead of the trends in business banking means knowing what to expect and allowing yourself the opportunity to learn about it before everyone else. Big things are happening in fintech in 2022 and many of them will directly benefit business banking.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, the decentralized data exchange protocol that unlocks data for AI, is excited to announce the launch of DataX Protocol, a project financed through <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a>, Ocean’s community-curated grants&nbsp;program.</p><p><a href="https://datax.fi">DataX Protocol</a> has an ambitious lineup of innovative DeFi tooling for datasets in the roadmap. Its goal is to build DataFi infrastructure to help onboard masses to the data economy and also boost Ocean Protocol’s footprint by building innovative tooling around datatokens.</p> DataX: DeFi Tooling for Data&nbsp;Dapps <p>DataX Protocol is building an open and decentralized financial layer on datasets. It aims to create complementary infrastructure around Ocean Protocol’s datatokens that will boost new integrations into the Ocean ecosystem. The DataX Protocol at the onset will enable any developer or dapp to use its libraries and tooling to build and create multi-token trading and staking infrastructure.</p><p>DataX tooling promises to increase metrics in the Ocean ecosystem like number of dapps being built, daily active users, total value locked, and trading volume of datasets.</p><p>Ultimately, DataX Protocol aims to make data liquid and a dominant asset&nbsp;class.</p> <a href="https://datapolis.city">Datapolis DApp</a> <p>To further the adoption of the data economy, DataX Protocol is launching the concept of Data Nation — a template for the states and countries who treat their data as an important asset and engage in creating a data economy for their citizens.</p><p>To implement this template and to make the prospect of staking and investing in datatokens for the masses interesting, DataX is also building a white-label platform named Datapolis. Datapolis is a virtual sovereign city state that prides itself as the world’s first Data Nation. It is also a showcase of DataX features.</p><p>Datapolis shows how an ideal real-world scenario could be for sharing data, trading datasets, or earning from data. Datapolis is built around the core principles of decentralization and democracy where citizens have a say via voting, economic activities like trading and staking, or help grow the DataX Community and earn incentives.</p><p>Trent McConaghy, Founder, Ocean Protocol, commented:</p><blockquote>Ocean was built with the aim to level the playing field around data &amp; AI, so that everyone can be a participant in the new Data Economy. DataX Protocol strengthens the Ocean ecosystem by catalyzing data as assets and the communities that form around data&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><p>Manan Patel, Founder, DataX Protocol&nbsp;added:</p><blockquote>DataX Protocol will play a leading role not only in furthering the growth of the Ocean ecosystem but also in establishing data as a dominant asset class at the global level. DataFi holds the key to solving global issues from data privacy and data ownership to income inequality and even poverty. This launch of the DataX Protocol is a major step in that direction.</blockquote><p>The Datapolis platform will be launched in February 2022, with trading and staking datasets. In the long run, Datapolis will add more features to the roost, like data farming, data insurances, data&nbsp;loans.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a new Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality data. Ocean’s intuitive marketplace technology allows data to be published, discovered, and consumed in a secure, privacy-preserving manner. By giving power back to data owners, Ocean resolves the tradeoff between using private data and its public exposure.</p><p>About DataX&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>DataX Protocol is a DeFi protocol building an innovative open financial infrastructure on datasets. DataX brings DeFi to data, and is a gateway to unlock DataFi for the masses. DataX is creating money markets specially suited for datasets and related services with a goal to make data truly liquid assets and a dominant asset&nbsp;class.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-announces-the-launch-of-datax-an-oceandao-grantee-4ff6c4f665b4">Ocean Protocol announces the launch of DataX, an OceanDAO grantee</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Why you should care about dependency injection 

 Dependency injection is a tried and proven design pattern for producing code that is testable, readable, and reusable. This is achieved by creating (or increasing) a separation of concerns, where each class has a dedicated area of responsibility.

   Why you should care about dependency injection 

<p>Dependency injection is a tried and proven design pattern for producing code that is testable, readable, and reusable. This is achieved by creating (or increasing) a separation of concerns, where each class has a dedicated area of responsibility.</p>

<p>Dependency injection is just one design pattern used to achieve inversion of control in which the calling code, or client, has no knowledge of the inner workings of the dependency, also called the service. The calling code only needs to know the interface of the dependency so it can call the dependency correctly. In dependency injection, the service is injected into the client class or function where it is used.</p>

<p>This makes it easier to test code by mocking—or stubbing—the service code for predictable results that the client can operate on. For example, if your service calls a database and returns an entity, you can mock this code to always return the entity and eliminate concerns such as the entity not being found, the connection to the database being unavailable, or other issues that may arise in the service. You can test the client code as though the service will always perform in a specific way, thus making the client code easier to write.</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET Framework</a> days, there were two major libraries used for supporting dependency injection; Ninject and Unity. Both libraries gave years of admirable service to developers and applications. Ninject was generally more popular because it was a little more feature-rich, with the ability  to detect circular dependencies; Unity, however, was more performant. There were other libraries as well such as <code>Castle.Windsor</code> and <code>Autofac</code>. Each of these had its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>While many of these libraries did extend support into .NET Core, these days the de facto way of achieving inversion of control is Microsoft’s implementation of dependency injection in .NET Core and beyond.</p>

<p>In this article, you will learn to use the default implementation of dependency injection that comes with .NET 5. You will see how to register services with different service lifetimes and understand the differences between those service lifetimes. You will also learn how to inject services into controllers, which is the most common usage of services in ASP.Net Core, and how to inject services into middleware. And I will show you how to write services so that they can be injected.</p>

<p>The example application will consist of a single page with three pieces of information; your application’s name with randomized upper and lower case letters, the number of requests made to the server, and a list of users from your Okta account. Each of these three pieces of information will be obtained from its respective service. Each service will have a different service lifetime.</p>

 Prerequisites 

 
   Basic knowledge of .NET 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5</a> 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Your favorite IDE (I’ll be using Visual Studio 2022)</a> 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">An Okta account</a> 
 

<p>If you wish to download the code immediately you can do that <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-dependencyinjection-dotnet-example">on my GitHub repository</a>.</p>

 Set up Okta for the SDK 

<p>Open your Okta admin console and navigate to the Tokens tab on the API page. Click on Create Token and give it a meaningful name. You will be shown the API key. Make note of this as you will need it in your application.</p>

 Create your ASP.NET Core application 

<p>If you are using Visual Studio 2022 you can follow the instructions below.</p>

<p>First, open Visual Studio and then click Create Project. In the Create a new project pane select <code>ASP.Net Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)</code> as your template.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Next and under Configure your new project and name it <code>OktaDependencyInjection</code> and press Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Under additional info make sure you have <code>.NET 5.0</code> selected as your framework. You can leave the other options as the default.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Create and give Visual Studio a moment to scaffold your project.</p>

 Install dependencies 

<p>For this project, you will only need one package from NuGet—the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Okta.Sdk/">Okta SDK</a>. This package will help facilitate communication between your application and your Okta admin server using the API token you created earlier.</p>

   <code>Install-Package Okta.Sdk -Version 5.3.2
</code>   

 Set up your application settings 

<p>The first thing to do is select your settings. The only configuration needed is for Okta; in more advanced applications you may need more settings. First, you are going to modify the <code>appsettings</code> files that were created when Visual Studio scaffolded your application. Next, you provide a class to mimic the structure of that configuration. Finally, you will bind the configuration section to the class you created.</p>

 Add configuration to your appsettings 

<p>Next, you will want to set up your <code>appsettings</code> configuration files. Visual Studio should have added 2 files, <code>appsettings.json</code> and <code>appsettings.Development.json</code>. In my GitHub repository, I check in <code>appsettings.json</code> with the structure from <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and no values. You can copy this convention if you want.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "",
    "Token": ""
  }
}
</code> 

<p>The code in <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> is not optional, however. This code contains the values required to run your application.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "",
    "Token": ""
  }
}
</code> 

 Add a class for your Okta configuration 

<p>Add a folder called <code>Settings</code> to the root of your project. In that folder add a class called <code>OktaConfiguration</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Settings
{
    public class OktaConfiguration
    {
        public string Domain { get; set; }
        public string Token { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>As mentioned before, this class mimics the structure of your <code>Okta</code> configuration section in your <code>appsettings</code> files. It’s possible to customize the configuration for more advanced binding but that isn’t necessary here.</p>

<p>The last step is to bind the configuration section to your class. You will do that when you start to work in your <code>Startup.cs</code> file.</p>

 Create your view and model 

<p>Next, you want to create the view that your users will see. In this application, you are only displaying one page to the user so this work is pretty light.</p>

 Add your view model 

<p>In the <code>Models</code> folder create a new file called <code>HomeModel.cs</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>using Okta.Sdk;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Models
{
    public class HomeModel
    {
        public string ApplicationName { get; set; }

        public List&lt;User&gt; Users { get; set; }

        public int NumberOfHits { get; set; }

        public HomeModel() { }

        public HomeModel(string applicationName, List&lt;User&gt; users, int numberOfHits)
        {
            ApplicationName = applicationName;  
            Users = users;
            NumberOfHits = numberOfHits;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This model will contain the application name and a list of users associated with your Okta account. It will also have the number of times that a request has been made against your website since the last time the application was started.</p>

 Edit the home view 

<p>Open the file <code>Views/Home/Index.cshtml</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

 <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

@model OktaDependencyInjection.Models.HomeModel


&lt;h3&gt;@Model.ApplicationName&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A Small Demonstration of &lt;b&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;.NET 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of Hits Since Last Startup: @Model.NumberOfHits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Written by &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
    Secured with &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My Current List of Users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table class="table table-bordered"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Username&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    @foreach (var user in Model.Users)
    {
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@user.Profile.Email&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@user.Status&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    }
&lt;/table&gt;
</code> 

<p>This view is going to display your application name (with randomized upper and lower case numbers) and a list of your current users in Okta using the <code>HomeModel</code> you just created.</p>

 Update your layout 

<p>Finally, you will want to update your <code>Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> view. This step isn’t strictly necessary but if you want your page to match mine you will need to update it.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

</code>   

 Setting up the dependency injection 

<p>This is the last piece of code you can write before you start to focus on the dependency injection. Now, to populate your model and keep track of the number of hits, you will need to set up some middleware and services.</p>

 Write your services 

<p>First, you want to write the services. As mentioned above, the client needs access to an interface so it knows what to call on the service, even though it doesn’t know about the implementation. Since C# gives us access to interfaces, you can separate your services into interfaces and concrete implementations. Later you will bind the implementation to the interface to make it available for clients.</p>

<p>Start by creating a folder called <code>Services</code> in your project and add a folder called <code>Interfaces</code> to the <code>Services</code> folder.</p>

<p>Add an interface called <code>INumberOfHitsService</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services.Interfaces
{
    public interface INumberOfHitsService
    {
        public int NumberOfHits { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The interface will just have an integer called <code>NumberOfHits</code> that exposes the getter and setter. This will enable the middleware to set the value and enable the controller to access it.</p>

<p>In the <code>Services</code> folder add a file called <code>NumberOfHitsService</code> with the implementation in it.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services
{
    public class NumberOfHitsService : Interfaces.INumberOfHitsService
    {
        public int NumberOfHits { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add an interface in the same folder called <code>IOktaService</code>. Add in the code below.</p>

   <code>using Okta.Sdk;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services.Interfaces
{
    public interface IOktaService
    {
        Task&lt;List&lt;User&gt;&gt; GetUsersAsync();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This interface defines a method for <code>GetUsersAsync</code> whose implementation will reach out to your Okta server using the Okta SDK.</p>

<p>Add the implementation by adding a file called <code>OktaService</code> to the <code>Services</code> folder with the following code.</p>

   <code>using OktaDependencyInjection.Settings;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;
using Okta.Sdk;
using Okta.Sdk.Configuration;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services
{
    public class OktaService : Interfaces.IOktaService
    {
        private OktaClient _client;

        public OktaService(IOptions&lt;OktaConfiguration&gt; options)
        {
            _client = new OktaClient(new OktaClientConfiguration()
            {
                OktaDomain = options.Value.Domain,
                Token = options.Value.Token
            });
        }

        public async Task&lt;List&lt;User&gt;&gt; GetUsersAsync()
        {
            var users = await _client.Users.ToListAsync();
            return users.Select(r =&gt; r as User).ToList();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you are using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-5.0">options pattern</a> which, like dependency injection, helps with the separation of concerns. The <code>options</code> object contains the configuration items from your <code>appsettings</code> file. It uses these values to create an <code>OktaClient</code>, which can then be called to get the users from your Okta account.</p>

<p>The last service to add is the <code>RandomUpperAndLowerService</code>. Start by adding the <code>IRandomUpperAndLowerService.cs</code> file to the <code>Services/Interfaces</code> folder with the code below.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services.Interfaces
{
    public interface IRandomUpperAndLowerService
    {
        string RandomizeString(string input);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now add its implementation to the <code>Services</code> folder. Call this file <code>RandomUpperAndLowerService.cs</code> and add the code below to it.</p>

   <code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Services
{
    public class RandomUpperAndLowerService : Interfaces.IRandomUpperAndLowerService
    {
        public string RandomizeString(string input)
        {
            List&lt;char&gt; chars = new();
            var rand = new Random();

            foreach (var c in input.ToCharArray())
            {
                var next = rand.Next(0, 2);
                chars.Add(next == 0 ? char.ToUpper(c) : char.ToLower(c));
            }

            return new string(chars.ToArray());
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Although it’s a silly function, this class will take a string and randomize if the text should be uppercase or lowercase. It will <code>pRodUCe STriNgS lIkE THiS</code>.</p>

 Register your services 

<p>It’s time to register your services so that you can use them in your application. Start by opening <code>Startup.cs</code> and replacing the code with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddControllersWithViews();

            services.Configure&lt;Settings.OktaConfiguration&gt;(Configuration.GetSection("Okta"));

            services.AddTransient&lt;Services.Interfaces.IRandomUpperAndLowerService, Services.RandomUpperAndLowerService&gt;();
            services.AddSingleton&lt;Services.Interfaces.INumberOfHitsService, Services.NumberOfHitsService&gt;();
            services.AddScoped&lt;Services.Interfaces.IOktaService, Services.OktaService&gt;();
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
                // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
                app.UseHsts();
            }

                endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>By default <code>Startup.cs</code> has 2 methods: a constructor (with a service injected into it!) and a property for <code>Configuration</code>.</p>

<p>The first question you may have is “Who injected IConfiguration into this class?” That work is handled by the boilerplate in <code>Program.cs</code>. Many developers never touch or look at this file. This is the application that calls <code>CreateDefaultBuilder</code>, which make <code>IHostEnvironment</code>, <code>IConfiguration</code>, and <code>IWebHostEnvironment</code> available to the <code>Startup</code> class. <code>ConfigureWebHostDefaults</code> will configure the <code>IHostBuilder</code> with the defaults for hosting a web application, including configuring the startup file to use.</p>

<p>The two methods in <code>Startup.cs</code> can cause some confusion.</p>

<p>Initially, <code>ConfigureServices</code> is called by the runtime, typically when the application first starts. This method will add services to the app container. The boilerplate code calls the extension method <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>. Under the hood, there is nothing special about this code. You can follow it <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/d40eea990edd1ac7205a983cbe4d13a71fd4ad68/src/Mvc/Mvc/src/MvcServiceCollectionExtensions.cs#L186">in the Asp.NET Core source code</a>.  You’ll see that, eventually, this adds several services related to rendering and displaying views, binding models and attributes to controllers, and controlling many other operations found in a web application. For example, you can follow the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/d40eea990edd1ac7205a983cbe4d13a71fd4ad68/src/Mvc/Mvc.DataAnnotations/src/DependencyInjection/MvcDataAnnotationsMvcCoreBuilderExtensions.cs#L76">data annotations code</a> to find a line of code that reads <code>services.TryAddSingleton&lt;IValidationAttributeAdapterProvider, ValidationAttributeAdapterProvider&gt;();</code>. This line looks remarkably similar to the code where you will add your services.</p>

<p>Next, you can configure your simple configuration. Set up the Okta section.</p>

   <code>services.Configure&lt;Settings.OktaConfiguration&gt;(Configuration.GetSection("Okta"));
</code>   

<p>This is the magic that will make your <code>OktaConfiguration</code> available in the options pattern you learned about above.</p>

<p>Finally, you have to register your three services. Each of these services has been registered with a different <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#service-lifetimes">service lifetime</a>.</p>

<p>First, you register the <code>RandomUpperAndLowerService</code> using the <code>AddTransient</code> extension method.</p>

   <code>services.AddTransient&lt;Services.Interfaces.IRandomUpperAndLowerService, Services.RandomUpperAndLowerService&gt;();
</code>   

<p>Transient services are created every time they are requested from the service container. These are recommended for lightweight, stateless services. At the end of each request, any transient services will be disposed of. In this example, the <code>RandomUpperAndLowerService</code> is stateless and lightweight, so transient is a lifetime for it.</p>

<p>Next, you registered the <code>NumberOfHitsService</code> as a singleton.</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton&lt;Services.Interfaces.INumberOfHitsService, Services.NumberOfHitsService&gt;();
</code>   

<p>Singletons are created the first time they are requested. They are disposed of when the application is shut down. This means that the same instance of <code>NumberOfHitsService</code> will be available on every request. This is why you can store the number of hits in this class and have it keep count as long as your application continues to run. If you add a service as a singleton you must ensure that it is thread-safe. Also, singletons are more susceptible to memory leaks since  they are only disposed of when the application is closed.</p>

<p>The <code>OktaService</code>is the final service you’ll register for. It is added as a <code>Scoped</code> service.</p>

   <code>services.AddScoped&lt;Services.Interfaces.IOktaService, Services.OktaService&gt;();
</code>   

<p>A scoped service will be created when it’s requested and will be disposed of after each request is completed. This is common when using services like external APIs or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/entity-framework">Entity Framework</a>. The same instance of the <code>OktaService</code> will be used for each request to the server. For example, if you queried information about each user by creating a <code>GetUser</code> method in the <code>OktaService</code> and called it for every year, you would still only use one instance of the <code>OktaService</code>. Once the response is sent to the client, the service is disposed of and is not recreated until a new request for the service is received.</p>

<p><code>Configure</code> is used to configure your HTTP request pipeline. Essentially, each request will be impacted by the <code>Use*</code> statement in this pipeline. This code is boilerplate except for the line <code>app.UseMiddleware&lt;Middleware.HitTracker&gt;();</code>. At this moment, it will appear as aa compiler error for you, but you will fix that shortly. This is an extension method that configures your application to use custom middleware called <code>HitTracker</code>. You can write that next.</p>

 Using your services in middleware 

<p>Add a new folder called <code>Middleware</code> to your project. In it, add a file called <code>HitTracker.cs</code> and add the following middleware code.</p>

   <code>using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

using OktaDependencyInjection.Services.Interfaces;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Middleware
{
    public class HitTracker
    {
        private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
        private readonly INumberOfHitsService _numberOfHitsService;

        public HitTracker(RequestDelegate next, INumberOfHitsService numberOfHitsService)
        {
            _next = next;
            _numberOfHitsService = numberOfHitsService;
        }

        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
        {
            _numberOfHitsService.NumberOfHits += 1;
            await _next(context);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Middleware is code that executes in your request pipeline. For example, authorizing a user is middleware. Before any controller code is called, your application will attempt to authorize the user and if that fails, it will handle an unauthorized user as instructed. If the user is unauthorized, there is no need to tie up resources calling controller code.</p>

<p>In Asp.NET Core, a middleware class is required to contain a public constructor with a parameter of type <code>RequestDelegate</code> and a public Method called <code>Invoke</code> or <code>InvokeASync</code>. This must return a task and accept a first parameter type of <code>HttpContext</code>.</p>

<p>Inject services from your service container into this by injecting them into the controller,  unless they are scoped dependencies. Middleware is constructed at app startup and has an application lifetime, which makes it a singleton. Scope validation dictates that you cannot inject a scoped dependency into a singleton, because it may unintentionally make the singleton not thread-safe. If you need to inject a scoped dependency like the <code>OktaService</code> you’ll need to inject it into the <code>Invoke</code> or <code>InvokeAsync</code> method, whichever you were using.</p>

<p>You are free to inject the <code>NumberOfHitsService</code> here because you can inject a singleton into a singleton. And because the <code>NumberOfHitsService</code> is a singleton, as long as your application doesn’t close, this code will keep track of the number of requests against the application since it began running. After updating the number of hits it will then call <code>_next</code>, which indicates to the app that it should run the next piece of middleware.</p>

 Using your services in controllers 

<p>The last step is to set up your <code>HomeController</code>. You will need to inject all of your services into this class to build the model for your home page.</p>

<p>Replace the code in <code>Controllers/HomeController.cs</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

using OktaDependencyInjection.Models;

using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

using OktaDependencyInjection.Services.Interfaces;

namespace OktaDependencyInjection.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; _logger;
        private readonly INumberOfHitsService _numberOfHitsService;
        private readonly IOktaService _oktaService;
        private readonly IRandomUpperAndLowerService _randomUpperAndLowerService;

        public HomeController(
            ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; logger,
            INumberOfHitsService numberOfHitsService,
            IOktaService oktaService,
            IRandomUpperAndLowerService randomUpperAndLowerService)
        {
            _logger = logger;
            _numberOfHitsService = numberOfHitsService;
            _oktaService = oktaService;
            _randomUpperAndLowerService = randomUpperAndLowerService;
        }

        public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; IndexAsync()
        {
            var users = await _oktaService.GetUsersAsync();
            var hits = _numberOfHitsService.NumberOfHits;

            var appName = _randomUpperAndLowerService.RandomizeString("dependency injection with okta");

            HomeModel model = new HomeModel(appName, users, hits);

            return View(model);
        }

        public IActionResult Privacy()
        {
            return View();
        }

        [ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
        public IActionResult Error()
        {
            return View(new ErrorViewModel { RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>ILogger</code> is boilerplate for all controller code. The other services are injected through the constructor like the middleware you set up. Controllers can accept singleton, transient, and scoped services. The first thing to do is grab a list of users from your <code>OktaService</code>. Next, get the <code>NumberOfHits</code> from the <code>NumberOfHitsService</code>. Finally, randomize a string for the title of your application. Return this in a model and let your view code handle the presentation.</p>

 Test your application 

<p>Start your application and you should see your homepage.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you can see, the first time you visit the page you are presented with a wacky-looking title, a banner telling you that there has been one hit so far, and a list of users. In my case, I only have one user in my Okta account so it’s just me. Refresh this page five or six times.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you can see that the number of hits counter is up to six and the uppercase and lowercase letters on the title of the application are randomized differently. Success! All your services are set up correctly and working as intended.</p>

<p>From baby boomers to Gen Z, each successive generation is more comfortable with using technology tools to manage every aspect of their daily lives. Gen Z (born 1997-2012) only knows a world that’s almost completely digital. It’s no surprise then, to find out that Mastercard’s <a href="https://openbanking.mastercard.com/the-rise-of-open-banking">Rise of Open Banking</a> study showed that they were the most willing and eager to adopt cutting-edge fintech apps and services before older generations. Given that millennials have recently <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/">surpassed baby boomers</a> as the most populous generation in the U.S. and Canada, sensitivity to their financial needs and desires is critical for fintech developers and entrepreneurs, as well as banking sector incumbents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked about why you would use technology to manage finances, convenience is the top driver. The desire to try something new is motivation responsible for the biggest gap between younger and older generations. A full 28% of Gen Z and 33% of millennial consumers selected to try something new as the reason for using technology to manage finances. This compared to 21% of Gen X and 12% of boomers using technology because they wanted to try something new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gen Z and millenials are also far more responsive to social pressure from their peers to adopt new technologies. Twenty-two percent of Gen Z consumers and 21% of millenials react to social pressure by adopting technology to manage finances, while only 8% of Gen X and 4% of boomers feel compelled to do the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having been born into a digital world, digital natives are unafraid to try a new payment app or digital lending service, just because it’s better than anything else available. They’re accustomed to the fast pace of technological development, and the accelerated life cycle of digital tools. Thirty percent of Gen Z and 34% of millennials have little hesitation to jump on board with newer, better offerings, as opposed to 23% of Gen X and 17% of boomers.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Next-Gen Use Cases Built to Serve Younger Generations 
<p>One of the newest, fastest-growing use cases powered by open banking is <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/september/mastercard-reinvents-installments-to-give-consumers-more-payment-choices-wherever-they-shop/">Buy Now, Pay Later</a>. BNPL is essentially a riff on layaway payment plans, where consumers gradually paid off a piece of merchandise before taking it home. BNPL apps and services allow users to have the merchandise right away, but split payments up over a short period of time, in many cases at zero percent interest. BNPL usage grew <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/buy-now-pay-later-gen-z-millennials/">an astounding 81.2%</a> from 2020 to 2021, with nearly 75% of BNPL users in the Gen Z and millennial cohort. They’re far more willing to adopt these new fintech tools, while Gen X and baby boomers trust a branded card over new digital innovations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some BNPL lenders are using open banking and consumer-permissioned data points to look beyond FICO scores to <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/buy-now-pay-later-redefines-credit-worthiness/">qualify borrowers</a>. This benefits consumers who have thin credit files, who can now establish a history of borrowing and repaying, without the traditional FICO barrier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young consumers are also loving the new wave of gamified digital banking experiences that open banking can enable. For a generation raised on video games, this is a natural fit. Gamification has been hugely successful in <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/103616/banks-millennials-gen-z-personalization-loyalty-fintech-gamification/">education, health and fitness</a>, and is steadily growing in the <a href="https://financesonline.com/gamification-statistics/">finance sector</a>. Through challenges where the user can compete against others, themselves, or even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/how-gamification-can-help-you-meet-financial-goals/">build a virtual world</a> to entice smart financial moves, next-gen apps and services are catering to the tastes, desires and motivations of younger consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that most of their daily lives take place on a mobile screen, it’s not surprising that Gen Z and millennials are far more likely to connect their bank accounts for digital payments. Recurring transactions like gym and streaming memberships, digital wallet top-ups, and even retail purchases are all use cases that young consumers are readily adopting to make direct digital payments.</p>
 Digital Banking Isn’t Trending, It’s the Future 
<p>Digital natives are driving innovation in the finance sector. A full <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/millennials-personal-finance/">78% of millennials</a> use mobile banking, and one-fourth of millennials now have their primary checking accounts in digital-only banks. Open banking platforms can empower these consumers to benefit from their data through a wide variety of third-party financial apps and services. These apps and services utilize that data to offer them the new money experiences they want in their financial lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As consumers adopt and demand more personalized digital tools to save time and money, and look to improve their financial outlook, our partners can leverage open banking solutions to drive stronger customer engagement and loyalty. Consumers should be at the center of the data experience, helping them feel more connected and in control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity’s Global Open Banking Platform is democratizing access to data, providing consumers with greater access to credit, payment choices, and convenient digital banking experiences. With their growing purchase power, this is what Gen Z and Millennial generations expect and demand, moving into the next evolution of financial apps and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs already maintains validator nodes in support of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/our-recent-upgrade-to-our-sovrin-network-validator-node-in-australia-supports-the-decentralized-identity-community/">Sovrin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/anonyome-labs-joins-the-indicio-mainnet/">Indicio</a>&nbsp;networks. Recently we increased our contribution to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials by becoming a founding member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>&nbsp;production network. With more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bosch.com/stories/self-sovereign-identities/">companies leveraging SSI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.egovernment.ch/en/umsetzung/schwerpunktplan/elektronische-identitat/">governments beginning to implement them</a>, large-scale public adoption of these technologies appears to be around the corner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is particularly interested in new economic models for SSI technologies and infrastructures that can amplify adoption by end-users, businesses, and governments. Economic incentives provide a way for validators to be rewarded for running the network and for issuers of verifiable credentials to be rewarded for issuing credentials. The adoption of these new economic models in turn increases the amount of SSI credentials in circulation, making it increasingly easier, more efficient, and more secure for organizations to get trusted data from the consenting identity subject. These financial incentives are a clear driver for transition from centralized and federated identity systems to an SSI ecosystem.</p>



 What are verifiable credentials? 



<p></p>



<p>In short, they are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically. Their use cases include checking the validity of travel visas, healthcare certificates, airline tickets, credit score checks and credentials for opening a bank account. Three parties take place in the verifiable credential workflow: the&nbsp;issuer&nbsp;digitally signs a document and sends it to the&nbsp;holder&nbsp;which can then present their credential (to W3C specifications) to a&nbsp;verifier.&nbsp;A verifier checks presented credentials and verifies the contained authority, validity, and tamper-proof characteristics of the credential. If validity conditions are met and the presented credential contains the required claims, the holder is granted access to an associated resource or service.</p>



 Why do we need tokens for SSI? 



<p></p>



<p>Currently the main method of paying for verifiable credentials is through conventional payment networks. This has several drawbacks as mentioned in Sovrin’s&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf#Sovrin-Whitepaper-v5b.indd%3ABut%20today%2C%20the%20only%20option%20for%20paying%20for%20verifiable%20credentials%20is%20conventional%20payment%20networks%3A132">whitepaper</a>, where:</p>



  markets are restricted to only the highest value credentials  current issuers are at risk of data breaches  credentials are not privacy respecting.&nbsp;<br>  



<p>Since third-party identification issuers (such as credit bureaus) charge a fee to verify a user’s identity, it can be assumed that paying for credentials will remain a fundamental element of SSI. Tokens act as a solution to this problem, with&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/sovrin-foundation-launches-test-token-for-decentralized-identity-network/">Sovrin having already designed and tested tokens for their network (but not put them into production).</a></p>



 <a href="https://www.cheqd.io/ssi-self-sovereign-identity-explained">What is cheqd?</a> 



<p></p>



<p>cheqd’s network is bult on the Cosmos blockchain with a dedicated token for payment which enables new business models for verifiers, holders and issuers. In these business models, verifiable credentials are exchanged in a trusted, reusable, safer, and cheaper way — alongside a customizable fee.&nbsp;</p>



 How cheqd uses tokenomics&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>cheqd employs concepts of tokenomics on top of governance which sets it apart from the Sovrin network. With any of the three participants – holders, validators, and issuers – capable of receiving tokens as an incentive, it promotes participation and accountability, which will facilitate a greater adoption of the technology and SSI as a whole. This allows users to reclaim their privacy, and organizations to build their reputation and reduce the potential for fraudulent credentials. The value of $CHEQ depends on&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/cheqds-tokenomics-for-ssi-explained-part-2-c4ecfc32b813">several factors</a>&nbsp;including overall cryptocurrency market health, cheqd protocol resilience and the real-world implementation of use cases by SSI vendors.</p>



 cheqd’s choice of SDK 



<p></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.sovrin.org/hyperledger-welcomes-project-indy-77e8b2c62dcf">2017 Sovrin open sourced their codebase to Hyperledger Indy</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/">Indicio builds upon to provide its services and network</a>. Hyperledger Indy is a collection of tools, libraries and further components for digital identities rooted on blockchains. It’s important to note that tokens are not natively supported; in fact Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director of the Hyperledger Project, mentioned in an interview that “<a href="https://www.eweek.com/cloud/hyperledger-blockchain-project-is-not-about-bitcoin/">you’ll never see a Hyperledger coin</a>” and “by not pushing a currency, we avoid so many political challenges of having to maintain a globally consistent currency.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>cheqd’s network is built on the&nbsp;<a href="https://tendermint.com/sdk/">Cosmos SDK</a>&nbsp;which has&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/advanced-concepts/building-on-cosmos">several benefits</a>. They include Cosmos’s identity capabilities, easily customizable token behavior, on-ledger voting for governance frameworks and smart contract functionality. cheqd’s&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/master/intro/why-app-specific.html">application-specific blockchain</a>&nbsp;implementation addresses the shortcomings of smart contracts by building a full-node client, a light-client, and all the necessary interfaces (CLI, REST, etc.) to interact with the nodes. These reasons make Cosmos a viable solution as an SDK since the added benefits that tokenomics bring allows cheqd to develop a network for SSI applications.&nbsp;</p>



 cheqd DID method 



<p></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are cryptographically proven, verifiable and decentralized digital identities. DIDs are designed to be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers and certificate authorities. A DID can refer to any subject, entity, organization, thing, data model or abstract entity as specified by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-controllers">DID controller</a>. Where DIDs come into play is their ability to be stored on the blockchain as a public verifiable data registry. These immutable records can be queried for the authenticity/validity of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/gentle-introduction-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credential</a>&nbsp;to see who issued without consulting the issuer.<br></p>



<p>cheqd has&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-cheqd-did-method">proposed</a>&nbsp;that it will build on Hyperledger Indy DID method, renaming&nbsp;<a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/transactions.html#nym">NYM</a>&nbsp;transactions to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> transactions and removing&nbsp;roles&nbsp;to move from a&nbsp;public-permissioned&nbsp;network to&nbsp;public-permissionless.</p>



 The Anonyome validator configuration 



<p></p>



<p>Because of the potential advantages of having a token as part of the decentralized identity network, Anonyome Labs has configured and brought online its own&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.cheqd.io/validator/cheqdvaloper1djh8syeug9ylw7v8ca6jvq3s59klzmm4fm949w">validator</a>. We use Amazon Web Services to deploy our validator, however the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/docs/setup-and-configure">cheqd-noded software can be run by other hosting providers or even locally</a>.</p>



<p>To successfully become part of the cheqd production network and have an operational validator, we:</p>



  set up an AWS elastic cloud (EC2) instance running Ubuntu 20.04  configured a virtual private cloud (VPC) using security groups at the network interface level to act as a firewall  enabled automatic backups via AMI policies  created custom SNS topic to Slack notifications for outlier detection within CloudWatch Metrics.  



 AWS elastic cloud (EC2) 



<p></p>



<p>To run the cheqd validator installation we currently use a t3.small EC2 with the Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. The storage is split across two EBS volumes: a 10GB EBS volume for the operating system and cheqd software and another 150GB EBS for the cheqd home directory containing the increasingly large data directory which stores the ledger.</p>



<p>Both disks are encrypted, and the 150 GB volume is mounted within the operating system and set as the home directory for the cheqd user account.</p>



 Virtual private cloud (VPC) 



<p></p>



<p>The VPC security groups are configured to whitelist inbound and outbound traffic, only allowing specific access to SSH, RPC and HTTP/HTTPS ports from pre-determined IP addresses. Deliberately specifying which traffic the validator allows/expects reduces the potential for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. An elastic-IP connects to the EC2 instance which grants the validator a static IP.</p>



 AMI backup policies 



<p></p>



<p>To ensure swift recovery from any outages, attacks or node misconfigurations, an EBS-backed AMI policy has been put in place to make daily and monthly backups. These backups create live snapshots of the system such that when the validator must be restored, it resumes from the snapshot’s instance state. This aims to minimize downtime on the network and the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/tokenomics/slashing-explained">slashing penalties</a>&nbsp;that incur. When restoring from an AMI, the validator only needs to catch up from its latest block height and match that of the networks rather than a new validator which would have to catch up from the beginning, potentially saving days of downtime.&nbsp;</p>



 SNS topic to Slack notifications 



<p></p>



<p>Enabling telemetry via Slack notifications allows for real-time error handling and informative reporting on the status and health of our validator. This minimizes the risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the node through notifying problem-specific alerts which can be acted on immediately.</p>



<p>Some of the triggers our system looks out for are:</p>



  abnormally high resource usage (CPU, RAM, NetIO)  unusual cheqd network statistics (no validators on the network)  security alerts (unauthorized access)  general instance status metrics.  



 Future plans 



<p></p>



<p>With new technologies come new challenges and by nature many learnings and improvements are discovered. While we have our&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.cheqd.io/validator/cheqdvaloper1djh8syeug9ylw7v8ca6jvq3s59klzmm4fm949w">node</a>&nbsp;actively validating, there are several improvements that we are making to our system architecture to tighten security and reduce the risk of downtime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upgrading the network to a multi-node&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html#setting-up-a-validator">sentry-validator architecture&nbsp;</a>allows for stronger protection from DOS attacks and other threats which can be mitigated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/honey-pot">honeypots</a>. Although more complex than a single validator instance, the benefit of reduced downtime in the case of an attack ensures a lower risk of slashing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to reduce the risk of lost or stolen tokens earned through validating, we aim to use a cold-wallet backup solution. The implementation will include further steps to tighten security, such as multi-factor authentication, hardware cold-wallets and internal auditing, which in turn minimizes the attack vector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other future considerations may include securing validator keys using a&nbsp;<a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/hardware-security-modules">HSM</a>&nbsp;or other implementations which secure the&nbsp;<a href="https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519</a>&nbsp;keys used by&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html#validator-keys">Tendermint Core</a>. These improvements and alterations to the validator are first performed on our Testnet node before they are applied to the Mainnet. Since Testnet tokens have no actual value, they can be used to develop, test, and deploy security changes without having the risks associated with making changes on the Mainnet validator.</p>

<p>DeFi , KYC and Crypto – A mighty triumvirate? Learn more about KYC in a decentralized world.</p>



 DeFi, the next big thing in crypto?&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">DeFi or decentralized finance</a> is one of the hottest buzzwords in fintech and crypto right now. Together with NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) it’s dominating the news since 2021. But what is the noise all about, and why is the criticism from the regulators so loud?&nbsp;</p>



 What is DeFi?&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralized finance means financial services or instruments which are not managed by a central company or authority, but rather operated on a form of blockchain or DLT. Essentially, DeFi allows users to directly interact with a product or service without any intermediaries. By being open, borderless and permissionless, DeFi wants to democratize financial services and make them accessible for everybody in this world.&nbsp;</p>



 Limitless potential: The future of finance.&nbsp; 



<p>DeFi means much more than just <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">cryptocurrencies</a> and payments. It is expected that DeFi will replicate all forms of assets, financial instruments and contracts that exist in traditional finance today. Furthermore, the advanced technologies are creating the opportunity for entirely new financial services and products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The risk: When AML meets anonymity.&nbsp; 



<p>In the beginnings of crypto, many of the early crypto exchanges did not require a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC check</a>. Not without reason, crypto had and for some parts still has a negative stigma around money laundering and cyberfraud. What’s more convenient than an anonymized and fully digital cryptocurrency with little to no AML monitoring?&nbsp;</p>



 Is DeFi the new wild west?&nbsp; 



<p>The unregulated times of crypto are long gone, at least for central providers. Following the rising popularity and increasing mass adoption, the financial authorities caught up and included crypto into existing laws. Some countries even created new rules, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/crypto-license-guide/">crypto custody license in Germany</a>. However, through the rise of DeFi, the industry is on the best way of turning back into the wild west.</p>



 How is DeFi different from other crypto services?&nbsp; 



<p>The straight answer is: control. While the offered services might be the same at first sight, there is a huge difference in governance. While a crypto exchange like Coinbase or Bitpanda is operated by a company with a legal entity, decentral exchanges, like Uniswap, are not controlled by a central company or entity. In consequence, there is no single entity to be governed or sued.&nbsp;</p>



 How unregulated DeFi puts the image of crypto at risk.&nbsp; 



<p>Open, borderless, permissionless – for the same reasons DeFi offers limitless opportunities, it brings along the same amount of risk of money laundering and fraud. In our traditional financial systems, central institutions and governing authorities were created to prevent fraud and ultimately create trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e6e7d9d6-7778-4286-ba6f-e5831fcbc538">Regulators are struggling</a> to comprehend and process DeFi applications without institutions or intermediaries. In consequence, the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) published a <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html">new guidance for virtual asset service providers (VASP)</a> with a new focus on DeFi. In their guidance, the FATF is essentially recommending its members to crack down on DeFi without a KYC check and proper AML monitoring.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC does not mean centralization.&nbsp; 



<p>Critics say that any form of KYC would transform a DeFi application into a centralized service. However, that is not necessarily true, as the KYC check does not need to be performed by a central entity. Instead, DeFi protocols could create the mechanisms to allow trusted third parties, like identity providers, to perform the KYC and verify the holder of a crypto wallet. Based on the successful identity verification and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML screening</a>, a wallet address could be whitelisted. This way a DeFi protocol could remain decentralized, but the trust and security would increase tremendously.&nbsp;</p>



 DeFi is global, but regulation is local.&nbsp; 



<p>One of the key benefits of DeFi is it being borderless and accessible to everybody on the internet. At the same time, traditional finance is centralized and financial and AML regulations highly local. To onboard and service customers from all around the world, you not only need partners that can handle a large variety of identity documents, but also comply with the respective country-specific AML regulations.&nbsp;</p>



 How KYC could boost DeFi mass adoption.&nbsp; 



<p>Corporate users and institutional investors require compliant solutions in order to comply with their own regulation. For example, big players like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/07/28/uniswap-says-its-talking-with-paypal-robinhood-and-more-in-deleted-video/">PayPal and Robinhood are asking Uniswap</a>, the largest decentralized exchange, as well as OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, to implement mandatory KYC checks before they can integrate the services. Therefore, complying with KYC and AML regulation would open up DeFi to new user groups and hence boost mass adoption.&nbsp;</p>



 The light side: DeFi plus KYC &amp; AML.&nbsp; 



<p>Ultimately, the discussion about KYC or not, will split DeFi into a light and a dark side. It’s now upon DeFi protocols and their developers to decide on which side they want to play. Those who intend to join the light side should look into implementing KYC checks into their protocols, before the regulators will crack down on DeFi for good.&nbsp;Furthermore, a lot is happening in the area of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nft-non-fungible-tokens-new-art-money-laundering/">NFTs and anti-money laundering</a>.</p>

It is true that people in the decentralized field are increasingly interested in DAOs, but the development of DAOs still faces difficulties. Ontology community members believed that implanting DID in DAOs can eliminate “centralization” based on digital assets to a certain extent. DID can encourage DAO members to become more active, and balanced decision-making between the development team and ordinary&nbsp;members.  The Ontology Chinese Community <a href="https://twitter.com/ontologycn/status/1485878035580854273?s=21">Twitter</a> was live to track more information and progress of Ontology. Through this Twitter, community members can learn about Ontology’s global dynamics in real&nbsp;time.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Ontology published the <a href="https://twitter.com/ontologynetwork/status/1487975370552791040?s=21">DAO 101</a> series on twitter, discussing a key point in DAO governance: What kind of incentives should be set up? Ontology proposed the following solution: Set up a DID with a reputation scoring system for each DAO member. When you enter a DAO, you need to first register/own a DID and submit certain verifications (authorization through encryption to protect privacy), such as on-chain/off-chain assets, whether you have similar experience or capabilities, and so on. After verification, you will be given an initial value and mark to help you better participate in&nbsp;DAO.  Ontology cooperates with the famous media <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1489844335205965828?s=20&amp;t=5KziQ6PiyZB8JI7wNwJI8A">Blockster</a>, users can now keep up-to-date with Ontology news via the Blockster platform. Based on the Blockster platform, Ontology will further expand its influence to reach more potential partners.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Infosecurity — <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/identity-theft-will-get-worse?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Identity Theft Will Get&nbsp;Worse</a></p><p>“To address fraud in 2022, organizations will need to enhance their approach to identity verification. That includes securing the enrollment process and taking a multi-layered approach to verifying and authenticating identity throughout the customer lifecycle. From enrollment to payment, managing change events to ongoing KYC and compliance. ”</p><p>For the above requirements, Ontology’s DID and data solutions provide reliable technology. ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the W3C commendations for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, using blockchain and cryptographic technology, that can quickly identify and connect people, data, and services. It is decentralized, self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, and easy to use, enabling users to fully control their own data and identities. At present, Ontology’s DID and data solutions can be seamlessly integrated into many platforms and applications, and have served many enterprises and platforms. In the future, Ontology will continue to expand global industry-wide partnerships to protect the digital identity and data of Web3 and the Metaverse.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 <p>The platforms collectively made over an estimated $263 million across Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether in illicit proceeds during their lifetimes.&nbsp;</p> 
 The seizures come as investigators from the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/13637797">seek the detainment</a> of six members of an unnamed hacking group for illegally circulating “means of payment”. However, the link to the seized sites has not yet been confirmed.

This enables eligibility in upcoming Funding Rounds.

Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>4. Veteran&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $35,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 5 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>Above are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects by projects in OceanDAO. The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  24,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  12,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  134,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>A total of 200k OCEAN is available.</p><p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to Ocean Protocol there are earmarked Core Tech Initiatives that are being continuously expanded upon. You can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Round-15-Tech-Earmarks">view them inside our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech Working Group discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p><p>Unleash Data&nbsp;Category</p><p>In Round 13 we have revised the Unleash Data Category to have the same rules as the rest of the Funding Categories. They can qualify again for funding up to 35,000 OCEAN conditional that Unleash Data projects:</p>  “Unleash data” has actually always had a broad intent, towards driving Data Consume Volume. It is intended for projects like: becoming a data broker to get data owners’ data into Ocean Market, networking / “hitting the phones” to increase consumption on Ocean Market, integrating Filecoin &amp; publishing data on Ocean Market, etc. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#3-unleash-data">Here are further examples</a>. It was never meant to be solely for constructing / maintaining a small number of datasets.  Whatever is proposed should be high value-add to the Ocean ecosystem.  Example of poor value-add: requesting a lot of OCEAN to construct / maintain a small number of datasets to sell with expectation of profit. We expect and encourage OceanDAO voters to downvote such proposals.  <p>Burning becomes Recycling</p><p>Starting Round 13, any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the Treasury.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">For intuition on how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>You can find all the steps&nbsp;below:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  Any remaining funds inside an Earmark, are then moved towards [General&nbsp;Grants]  [New &amp; Core Tech] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Categories].

<p>It’s no longer safe to use only a secured network or to just put your systems behind a firewall. Cybercriminals are constantly searching for loopholes in digital processes where personal — especially healthcare — information is available. When it comes to healthcare information, the vulnerabilities outnumber the safety measures that have been implemented. The cost of healthcare fraud is $68 billion USD every year, which is about 3% of the nation’s entire healthcare spending! Hackers can extort millions from a single data breach, which makes service providers easy targets. Healthcare providers store highly confidential and private patient data, which cannot be protected using passwords alone.</p>



<p>A crucial sore spot that has put healthcare services on the radar of e-criminals is the use of outdated technology in hospitals and other medical institutions. This archaic technology provides a broader surface for cyber attacks. The software that is most widely used has almost no security layers at all. One example that illustrates the magnitude of loss is the over 5 million health records that were breached in August 2021 alone across just 38 incidents. Weak IT networks at medical facilities open doors for all kinds of cyber threats, including malware, viruses, and ransomware attacks.</p>



<a href="https://imageware.io/resource/healthcare/"></a>



<p>Though the lack of advanced security solutions is a major deficiency in healthcare risk management systems today, there are some big challenges faced in other areas of healthcare, too. For example, administrative staff at hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with mismanaged online information, such as health and insurance records and staff information.</p>



<p>Switching to <a href="https://imageware.io/resource/healthcare/">digital identity</a> is no longer a choice – it’s a necessity – especially when the e-healthcare sector is currently undergoing such a highly volatile phase with constant pressure to deliver fast and high-quality services. However, 99% of attacks can be prevented by using biometric multi-factor authentication. To ensure safe and effective patient care, healthcare technology professionals must work towards incorporating these reliable security tools to create a zero-trust security approach.</p>



<p>Biometrics plays an increasingly important role in reducing identity fraud and protecting healthcare data by establishing highly secure, controlled access to medical records. Replace usernames and passwords with Imageware’s biometric MFA, a seamless and more secure way to access your systems. Let Imageware help protect your organization before the end-to-end <a href="https://imageware.io/resource/healthcare/">Biometric Identity Management for Healthcare</a>. </p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thank you for joining. Today, we’ll have now a conversation with an entrepreneur in the tech industry that is not directly connected in the identity industry, but they are very innovative company and the CEO has a very interesting story to tell us.</p>
<p>So let’s welcome Aran Khanna. He has been labelled many things. A thought leader, an innovator and at times, a troublemaker. Now, in his search to give technological control back to the developers and business leaders, he has added cloud management entrepreneur to that list, as being the co-founder and CEO of Archera, a company that helps organisations find cloud solutions that fit their companies.</p>
<p>Hello, Aran.</p>
<p>Aran Khanna: Hi, Oscar. Thanks so much for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome to the show. Let’s talk about digital identity. But of course, first of all, we want to hear your story, a bit of your journey, how, since the beginning of your career, you end up in this world of – you tell us about your company, and also about identity, please tell us.</p>
<p>Aran: I can tell the short version here, I don’t want to bore you guys with a 30-minute background. But in short, I was born and raised in Seattle, I’ve really grown up all my life around technology. Both my folks worked at Amazon and Microsoft in the early days. And my first foray into technology was actually working at, funnily enough full circle, at the cloud provider that was soon to become Azure, it was called something different back then. But essentially started in that world. Really, from there, I started to get really interested in digital privacy as myself and all of my friends at college and high school were migrating all of our communications, all of our financial activity on to platforms like Facebook, Venmo, Twitter, etc., Instagram, right?</p>
<p>And I started to think a little bit about particularly the data leakage that was coming out of that sort of migration of really society, and started my journey as a privacy researcher in college working with the former FTC CTO Latanya Sweeney on a number of projects, including one very well-known one that actually got me fired from Facebook for revealing some pretty invasive defaults that they had in their platform around location sharing.</p>
<p>From there, I actually went into machine learning research, there was very interesting story behind that, but really started working on fundamental deep learning research, and actually then got pulled right back into the cloud world when AWS acquired that team that was working on to become their internal deep learning team. We launched a number of products at Amazon. And I started again, to start seeing this disconnect between platform users and the platforms themselves and the rules they were putting forward, similarly to what I was looking at in the privacy space, but really around financials in the cloud space.</p>
<p>And that’s when I spun off and started this company Archera to help customers, just like I did in the privacy space and the social media space, understand data leakage, and how platform incentives were not aligned with them, and how they had to orient their behavior to correct against that, trying to apply that sort of thinking into the B2B space with businesses who are migrating to the clouds, and trying to parse the incredible complexity of pricing and the different offering types on the cloud service provider platforms.</p>
<p>So in a nutshell, that’s sort of the arc of the journey. There’s obviously a lot more detail in there. But really, I’ve touched identity and access management and identity and privacy more broadly, both on the consumer side and the business side throughout that journey. So excited to chat more about that with you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, thank you. And definitely your company, Archera, sounds very interesting. As you said, also, that the case of data there in cloud platforms that are becoming, well inevitably, most of cases, most services require some level of cloud. And also something that I was also checking your website about finding the right model, so you can save money on that is interesting. Sometimes it feels like, in my own case, I feel that the cloud providers make it difficult to find how to save money just by using the elements on the cloud. And also about yourself, I went actually to search just put Aran Khanna on using DuckDuckGo. And first of all, I think you’re the most famous if not the only Aran Khanna I have found.</p>
<p>Aran: I think I might be the only one – so the least and the most famous one.</p>
<p>Oscar: If not the only one, the most famous for sure, all the top 10 entries are about you. And yeah, a few of them talk about your Facebook story. So tell us a bit more about that.</p>
<p>Aran: That’s a real fun one. So actually, at that time, I was in college in 2015 at Harvard, and studying computer science. I had actually not started doing my privacy research yet. This was one of the things that catalysed that world of research and projects that I did, but I was learning how to develop web applications and extensions at the time. And what was interesting is all of my friends at Harvard had migrated to using Facebook Messenger on their mobile devices largely – this was 2015.</p>
<p>What was interesting about the product was every time one person would send a message to another person, the default behaviour of the application, you have to go into the settings deep and turn this off – was that it would attach your location to that message. And this wouldn’t matter if you’re in a one-on-one chat with friends, or a massive group chat with 200 people in a class, and you’re constantly texting back and forth, your location was actually being leaked and revealed.</p>
<p>And what I started to think about was, “Hey, wouldn’t it be in the user’s best interest to understand that this default is on. And it’s not just one-off location data points being shared, there’s so much information given the volume of chat that’s happening here, that you can actually build an incredibly detailed picture of someone’s historical locations, their future locations, given their routine, and really come up with some fairly invasive data if you aggregated this.</p>
<p>So that was sort of my hypothesis. And I thought this was something that users would be really happy to know about, Facebook would be really happy if I actually kind of built something that helped people understand this data leakage, and then showed them where the knobs were to control it if they thought it was a problem.</p>
<p>So I went ahead, move fast and break things, and built this Chrome extension and wrote a blog post alongside it. The Chrome extension was called Marauder’s Map, you know, just like in Harry Potter, if you’ve read the books, there was a map where Harry and other folks would actually use it to track people’s live locations around the castle. And very similarly, people say Harvard looks like Hogwarts a little bit, I was able to build a little prototype where I could actually stalk my friends around Harvard campus using this Chrome extension.</p>
<p>So I wrote up that story, released the extension. And really, the point was to educate users, educate what I thought were the customers of the Facebook platform on this very interesting design decision, this product decision that might be affecting them and something they may want to turn off. So I thought this was a great thing for Facebook users, for Facebook as a company, I released it. And at the same time, I actually had an internship lined up at Facebook on a completely different team, on newsfeed ranking, which funnily enough became the source of a whole another set of controversies years later, with respect to echo chambers and digital amplification and misinformation.</p>
<p>But what happened was right before I was supposed to join Facebook, right before I was supposed to start my internship, the VP of Engineering and the Head of HR called me up and said, “Hey, by releasing that extension, you didn’t act in our best interest as a company, so we’re going to let you go.” And this was the Friday before I was supposed to start my internship, I had a place already booked in California and paid for and it was quite a rug pull.</p>
<p>And I think that whole journey really taught me a few key things. I think, first and foremost, it taught me a lot about Facebook’s culture, and that they do not see the people who are using the platform, you and me, as users or customers. They view us as cattle, that is more likely to be happy when the wool is pulled over our eyes versus transparency about how the platform operates being given to us.</p>
<p>And the other thing I realised was that this is a pervasive problem, that is not just a Facebook issue. If we have more and more of our lives moving online to these sorts of platforms, often the incentives of the users are misaligned with growth incentives, and the incentives of the platform, which are really not just to suck all the data out of users, but also to reveal that data publicly in a way that benefits their growth in some advantageous manner.</p>
<p>So that was one of the things that I think it really launched me into looking more deeply at these privacy issues throughout the tech industry. And then really focusing a few years of my life doing research there and additional projects, just like the Marauder’s Map Project with companies like Venmo to reveal all of the issues around the transparency with which these platforms operate, particularly with respect to customer data.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s a very interesting story. I’m sure you learned a lot about that. And it’s interesting that as you explained that, so the user, if the user was curious enough or observant enough, would see the location just in front of his or her eyes, correct?</p>
<p>Aran: Correct. You just have to click on the message and the exact location it was sent from was attached. So all you really needed was a piece of paper and a pencil to go and do this by hand. I just happen to do it programmatically and release an application to help customers do this. So they could make the decision for themselves, whether or not this was something that should be left on or turned off.</p>
<p>Oscar: You also mentioned the example of Venmo. I know you have shown also in some of your blog post Venmo is, I think not so familiar here at least in Finland, I think it’s an app for splitting the bills, right? When you buy something together with your friends?</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, it’s more generally like peer-to-peer payment. The way that they really came at it was it was a mobile-first peer-to-peer payment solution that had a very big social component to it. And I believe the company thought the social component was a big part of their growth. So what they did was that by default, when you sign up for Venmo, and you know, if your friend wants to pay you back for a meal, you have to sign up for Venmo. All transactions that you put into the system, become default public and actually show up on a global news feed.</p>
<p>And the thinking and I saw a number of talks from folks at the company including their Chief Growth Officer saying the thinking behind this was, the more people who share the more people see them sharing and the more the company grows. So even if it wasn’t in the user’s best interest to share all of their financial transactions with friends. And I did a very similar project where I went back, added up all of those transactions and built a map to show things like who’s your best friend, who are you going on dates with, what clubs are you a part of, etc. But the user, basically, it may not be in their best interest to share all this stuff publicly. But by default, they make it very difficult to turn off, and it helps the business grow.</p>
<p>So that was another instantiation of the same problem. And I think it’s intertwined with identity moving to the net, in that era, right, in the 2010s, people started to use their real names on the internet. And now that identity was tied to these things in such a tight way, you could really get fairly clear signal about specific individuals from all of this public data that these platforms were in a sense, forcing them to reveal by hiding defaults and controls behind different layers of friction.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, for instance, the case of Facebook, that map you created, it was in 2015, now we are 2022 so a few years forward, so how – today, if you still continue with social media for a bit while, social media platforms are doing better in data privacy?</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, I think the target has shifted a little bit. I think the major things that happen were things like GDPR, between 2015 and now, and honestly, I don’t think it was very effective. I think from a privacy standpoint, the most effective thing has been increased scrutiny, and increased public awareness of these issues. And hopefully, my projects and other journalists writing on this actually did something to catalyse that.</p>
<p>But what I’m seeing now, and what I’m most concerned about now is actually, even if the data on people is not being publicly revealed to the world, for the purposes of growth, or inadvertently through features like location sharing in Messenger, what I’m really concerned about is how that data that’s now been collected even internally in a secure database is being used with things like machine learning algorithms to actually manipulate people at a much broader scale.</p>
<p>So I think the ball has shifted a little bit on where my concern is. I don’t think the privacy issue is necessarily completely solved or rectified. But I think it’s not the most pressing issue of the day, because there are other issues that are downstream from that, that are also causing large, inordinate impact and likely have to be addressed before we even go back and address the privacy issue. And that kind of brings me to why I even started researching machine learning in the first place coming out of 2015.</p>
<p>Oscar: So that was one of your drivers to go deeper into machine learning.</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, I think after seeing the amount of data just being leaked, it was very clear how much data was being collected. And the natural consequence of that data collection to me was OK, I know who you are, I know all this data associated with you. And I have a cohort of folks who look like you, can I not build models and experimentation to do things that are basically not in your best interest as a user?</p>
<p>I think it’s a very similar sort of thought process I went through on the privacy side, which is how are these platforms going to use these technologies in ways that are not aligned with customers or their users. And how do I help users actually navigate that? Educate them about it, so they can make informed decisions on what they use and how things are used against them.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how social media platforms currently handle more broadly, identity management?</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, that’s a very interesting topic, because I think it varies broadly between platforms, right? Working on Venmo, I think the places with the highest fidelity kind of identity mapping are, by necessity, these social cross financial platforms where you need KYC AML, to actually enter into the gates, you need to upload your ID to be a member of Square Cash or Venmo. So from that perspective, I think there’s sort of a bifurcation where you have these strongly enforced identity social platforms, largely correlated with some regulatory requirement.</p>
<p>And then you have these much more weakly enforced platforms, things like Twitter, and Instagram, and Facebook, where you see even today, huge issues with identity, with bots, with harassment. And I think that it’s not a one brush that you can paint the whole space with. There’s a lot of nuance there. And I think identity plays a different role in different places around the social ecosystem today that is really dependent on what the goal of that underlying social platform is and sort of what regulatory regime it operates under.</p>
<p>Oscar: And if go a bit broader, not only on social media platform, but any company that has users, many tech companies, how do you think from your perspective, of course, you have your own company, you might have an idea how the companies do on that side, but other companies who have services/applications are handling the identity management?</p>
<p>Aran: I think there’s a few questions in there, right. One is how are these companies, these technology companies, many of which we serve, we serve social media companies, B2B companies, kind of all over the space of technology, how do they handle internal identity and access management for their engineers, for their employees? And then how do they handle user data and identity for their customers?</p>
<p>Again, I think the customers piece is something that varies a lot more, because it’s a function of trying to have minimum friction, while meeting regulatory requirements at the space, the FinTechs that we work with obviously have much, much tighter regulations around their customer data, where it can be stored, the keys that manage it, so heavy usage of KMS and other services within the cloud providers that assist with that sort of process.</p>
<p>And on the other side, what’s heartening is seeing a lot of the internal practices around engineering teams, regardless of what the company is doing standardised with respect to identity and access management So we see lots of folks using internal SSO providers now, I think that’s the majority of our customers, whether or not they’re in the B2B or B2C space, we see widespread usage of KMS, and other custodial encryption services that help encrypt data at rest. And I think in flight as well, though, a lot of cloud providers have done a really good job of, by default, encrypting data in flight within their networks.</p>
<p>And I think what we’re seeing as well is with a lot more focus, particularly in the B2B space, on things like SOC 2 Compliance and ISO Compliance in Europe, a much more standard operating model for engineering teams with respect to when passwords are rotated, who has access to what, you know, are people all sharing the same account, the login, the stuff. A lot of that gets hammered out with these broader certification schemes.</p>
<p>So I think in the enterprise space, specifically with how customers‘ data is being managed, there’s variance, but internally with respect to how identity is being enforced, within organisations, for the internal teams, we’re seeing a lot more standardisation. And I think that’s very heartening. It’s showing a much greater level of maturity entering into the space. And obviously, that raises the bar for everyone in terms of security.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, as you know, many service providers – mixing the topic with the social media, again – many use social media authentication, what’s your opinion on that, the use of that and how, for the ones who use it, what could you say are good practices?</p>
<p>Aran: I think that’s a mixed topic again, because frankly, from my perspective, I view login with Facebook and login with Google, even though they’re both technically social logins for consumers, as very, very different. And I think it really goes back to the motivations behind those specific products.</p>
<p>I look at the motivations behind the login with Google product, it’s really around things like making sure that these users who are already Gmail users are being safe with password management on the internet. It’s very much a function of doing good for the community of users by giving them a tool to sort of authenticate and log in globally without having to deal with passwords, which are sort of a mess. So if you secure your Google account, which most folks do, becomes really easy downstream to log in and use best practices. So I actually view that as a net positive.</p>
<p>When I go to the other side with Facebook’s login, which came a little bit later, for their single sign-on solution, it’s useful. And I think it accomplishes many of the same things. And especially for parts of the world where Facebook is the internet, like the developing world, it’s kind of the only option you have. But in terms of the data that it extracts from customers, it becomes much more invasive.</p>
<p>So it really becomes a function of yes, the customers ultimately have the choice and you should give them the choice as the platform. But do you have a point of view as a business when you’re offering this? And is your customer base one that is going to, for example, if you have both individuals and business customers, you’re probably not going to have a login with Facebook, you might actually have a login with Google because that handles G Suite and the enterprise side as well as the consumer side.</p>
<p>So again, there’s a nuance there. But I think in terms of best practices, selecting one of those providers is really a function of what is your customer base? Who are they? Where do they live? And then do you have any strong views as a business on where you expose their data?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think it’s an interesting distinction. You mentioned, Google, yeah, tends to be more oriented to business because there is a Google Suite, for instance, that doesn’t exist in the Facebook world. Yeah. So to your view is Facebook, it’s much more invasive as this identity provider point of view.</p>
<p>Aran: It’s purely extractive in terms of why they created that, right? They don’t have a business to business service on the backend, that they’re actually serving and building this as a legitimate solution for.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, because they are in a position of power. In many cases that’s, as you mentioned, some places it’s just the only way to have this log in.</p>
<p>Aran: It’s a way to get Facebook pixel out into the world, essentially, they just want more pixels on more sites so they can track you on more parts of the internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And what if one business has decided, OK, we’re going to use anyway log in with Google, log in with Facebook, log in with LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, LinkedIn and GitHub I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Oscar: So what do you say in terms of making that more robust as an authentication to safeguard the data, what do you say are important things for the service provider who is adding that functionality and sign in with Google or sign in with GitHub, what would you say?</p>
<p>Aran: It’s difficult, right? Because when you do that, you assume that you’re pinging the API on the GitHub side or the Facebook side or the Google side. They’ve done all the heavy lifting for you. They done the 2FA, they’ve really gone in and made sure that the person who is giving you the token, is the person they say they are.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that you are outsourcing that trust. Now obviously, from a development standpoint, that’s exactly what you want to do. You don’t want your engineers going and building this thing that’s been built 500 times, you just want to use someone else’s sort of version of this where customers already have credentials and already have a process set up.</p>
<p>That being said, if you’re the service provider, I think it’s incumbent on you to think about what is the level of security I need here? Facebook, for example, is never going to kind of enforce 2FA in a strong, strong way for their customers, because they want people logging in and looking at the site. I think GitHub on the other hand, especially like for corporate GitHubs or G Suite on the other hand, for corporate accounts, they do have the ability to enforce that centrally. And you know, if you need even stronger access controls, getting something like an Okta with SSO is a consideration.</p>
<p>But again, I think it’s really a function of what is the level of security that your customers are requiring from you. And do you choose a platform that matches that? And we’ll give them those downstream controls and that you can trust to actually maintain that contract.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And on your case, I was checking also the Archera website. So you offer on this type of social media, you offer Google and Microsoft, correct.</p>
<p>Aran: Google, Microsoft and yeah, Okta more broadly, which is powering the whole thing. And it’s really just because we serve enterprises, right, big and small, we need to be where those enterprise admin accounts are set up, be it in G Suite, be it in Office 365, in Active Directory, or be it in Okta.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So based on the customer that the enterprise already use.</p>
<p>Aran: Correct.</p>
<p>Oscar: For all business leaders listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Aran: Hmm, the one actionable idea. I think one thing that has been surprising to me when I go in and audit platforms, including our own, or those of our customers for security and identity and access management best practices that I constantly see is the fact that the defaults, and the policies often don’t change from kind of the first setup to whenever I go and look at the thing, even if it’s three years, five years, N years down the line.</p>
<p>So having a review every quarter of particularly our identity and access management policies internally and for customers and being thoughtful about the goals of those policies, being thoughtful about setting them, having a cross functional team talk about it, at least once a quarter, because things change really quickly in this world, frankly. It’s something that I think is really important for leaders to go and do and build a cadence around.</p>
<p>And often, you know, if you’re doing SOC 2, or ISO, whatever, you’re going to have to do this anyways, there is some sort of cadence that is built into getting that certification. But building that muscle, regardless, I think is going to be very important going forward for business leaders.</p>
<p>Oscar: And normally what kind of position in the company normally takes care of that?</p>
<p>Aran: It depends on the scale. I’ve seen dedicated CISOs, Chief Information Security Officers, in less mature companies, sometimes the CIO, the Chief Information Officer, and even less mature companies, sometimes it’s the CTO and team of SRE or developers underneath them. But in general, it’s someone on the engineering side, who has deep knowledge of the architecture of the infrastructure, and likely deep knowledge of the cloud provider that the core infrastructure is being run on.</p>
<p>Because nowadays, and we see this in a lot of our customers, to really get in and fix a lot of issues or update a lot of issues, when you find them, you need to have that deep understanding of the offerings of the cloud provider, and how to actually orient and change those without impacting the application in a negative way. Or on the flip side, something we see a lot is impacting the costs in a very negative way by turning on things like detailed logging, when it might not be necessary and blowing up the amount of ingress or egress that you have from certain systems.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. Well, thanks a lot, Aran for this very interesting conversation, I definitely like all the work you have done, not only talking about your story, of course, the story you had with Facebook, and also other cases when social media and other providers didn’t take privacy seriously. So thank you for that, for sharing that story. Please let us know how people would like to get in touch with you.</p>

Also, browse through this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">blog post</a> or watch this video to see how you can build a driver’s license use-case with these&nbsp;SDKs.</p> An Introduction to Affinidi’s SDK <p>Affinidi’s SDK enables you to issue Verifiable Credentials (VCs), register accounts, collect and validate information, verify VCs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This SDK consists of six packages, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Core  Browser  Expo  Issuer-kit  React-native  VC-data  <p>Let’s now look through each of these packages and what they&nbsp;do.</p> sdk/core <p>The core folder contains the @affinidi/wallet-core-sdk and it implements the common logic for account registration and management, credential issuance and verification, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>The sdk/core package is a comprehensive kit that enables you to issue, share, and revoke VCs. It also provides for the ancillary tasks associated with them such as the generation of API keys, DID anchoring, validating holder response, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>The entry point for this package is a method called CommonNetworkMember. By default, this will use Affinidi’s staging environment, though you can initialize it with specific service endpoints.</p> Generate API&nbsp;keys <p>It creates apiKey and apiKeyHash values after you register your entity at Affinidi’s stack environment, which can be staging, production, or dev. They are both request headers. apiKey is used when calling SDK methods and apiKeyHash is used for making <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api">API&nbsp;calls</a></p> const options = {  env: ‘staging’,  apiKey: ‘YOUR API KEY’ (or accessApiKey: ‘YOUR API KEY HASH VALUE’)  }  Access Through an Interface <p>You can call/access the wallet through any platform.</p> const { AffinidiWallet } = require(‘@affinidi/wallet-{PLATFORM}-sdk’) // where platform is one of ‘browser’, ‘expo’, ‘node’, ‘react-native’ <p>Accordingly, you will use the sdk/browser, sdk/expo, and sdk/react-native packages respectively.</p> Create a&nbsp;DID <p>A DID is a type of unique identifier (URI) that enables entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Creating a DID is easy with our tech stack as you’ll just have to make the below&nbsp;calls.</p> const wallet = await AffinidiWallet.createWallet(options, password)  const { did, encryptedSeed } = wallet <p>Here, encryptedSeed is a random auto-generated value that’s used as an input for private key generation. It is stored as an encrypted value in the protected vault and is never exposed to the public. It always remains in its encrypted form as a property to the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>However, you need this value to access or open a&nbsp;wallet.</p> const wallet = AffinidiWallet.openWalletByEncryptedSeed(options, encryptedSeed, password) <p>To get the DID, make the below&nbsp;call.</p> const wallet = AffinidiWallet.openWalletByEncryptedSeed(options, password, encryptedSeed)  const did = wallet.did <p>You can also sign up for the Affinidi cloud wallet using an existing DID or&nbsp;keys.</p> const { did, encryptedSeed } = await AffinidiWallet.createWallet(options, password)  const keyParams = { encryptedSeed, password }  const email = ‘example@affinity-project.org’  const userPassword = ‘Password123’  const options = { env: ‘dev’ }  const messageParameters = { message: ‘Welcome to Affinity, here is your OTP: {{CODE}}’ } // (optional)  const token = await AffinidiWallet.initiateSignUpByEmail(options, email, userPassword, messageParameters)  const confirmationCode = ‘123456’  const wallet = await AffinidiWallet.completeSignUp(options, token, confirmationCode, keyParams)  Sign a DID&nbsp;Document <p>Here is an image that shows the relationship between a DID, DID subject/controller, and a DID document.</p><p>A DID Document must be digitally signed for authentication.</p><p>This signature is verified using a set of parameters. For example, in a public key cryptography, a public key can be used to verify a digital signature, provided the signer has the associated private&nbsp;key.</p><p>The sdk/core package makes this signing easy, as you can use the following method.</p> const signedDidDocument = await wallet.signDidDocument(didDocument)  Change the Username and&nbsp;Password <p>Users have to be logged in to change the password and the method to call&nbsp;is,</p> await wallet.changePassword(oldPassword, newPassword) <p>If they are not logged in or have forgotten their password, the password recovery method&nbsp;is,</p> const token = await AffinidiWallet.initiateForgotPassword(options, login, messageParameters) <p>To change the username, the user requires a new phone number or email&nbsp;address.</p> const token = await wallet.initiateChangeEmail(newEmail) <p>or</p> const token = await wallet.initiateChangePhone(newPhone) <p>newEmail or newPhone — email address or phone number to be later used to log into&nbsp;cognito</p><p>The challenge for verification can be done via this&nbsp;method.</p> await wallet.completeChangeEmailOrPhone(options, token, confirmationCode) <p>Finally, to sign out the current user,&nbsp;call</p> await wallet.logOut()  Generate a Verifiable Presentation <p>You can generate a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable presentation</a> with the below&nbsp;call.</p> const { isValid, did, challenge, suppliedPresentation } = await verifier.verifyPresentation(vp)  Request and Verify a Verifiable Presentation <p>The verifier can request the holder to provide a verifiable presentation containing one or more VCs required for verification.</p><p>Use the below method to request for a verifiable presentation that meets the w3c specification structure.</p> const jwtOptions = { audienceDid, expiresAt, nonce, callbackUrl }  const presentationChallenge = await verifier.generatePresentationChallenge(  credentialRequirements,  issuerDid,  jwtOptions,  ) <p>To verify the presentation, use</p> const { isValid, did, challenge, suppliedPresentation } = await verifier.verifyPresentation(vp) <p>If the verification is valid, it returns {did, nonce}&nbsp;, else it returns isValid:&nbsp;false.</p> Validating the Holder&nbsp;Response <p>This package has the methods to validate response tokens and verify the signature.</p> const { isValid, did, nonce, selectedCredentials } = await issuer.verifyCredentialOfferResponseToken(  credentialOfferResponseToken,  credentialOfferRequestToken, <p>If the verification is not valid, this method will return isValid:&nbsp;false</p><p>On the other hand, if the response is valid, it returns issuer, nonce, selectedCredentials.</p><p>Thus, these are some things you can do with the sdk/core&nbsp;package.</p> sdk/browser, sdk/expo, and sdk/react-native <p>This package contains the @affinidi/wallet-[PLATFORM]-sdk package that extends the wallet-core-sdk logic with client specific implementations for crypto operations. Specifically, this package implements the logic to communicate with the encrypted data vault for VC storage, given that crypto operations can be platform dependent.</p><p>To install this package,run the below&nbsp;command.</p> npm i — save @affinidi/wallet-[PLATFORM]-sdk  sdk/issuer-kit <p>This package contains the @affinidi/issuer-kit and encompasses a framework for launching microservices to connect to external data providers &amp; issue&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>This library spins up a VC producing server based on configurations defined by the Application, including any key functions required to build the VCs and external connections required to collect and validate data before issuance.</p><p>The Issuer Kit defines an extensible protocol for VC issuance, regardless of the source of the data.

  <p>Elasticsearch is a search engine that can be integrated into any of your tech stacks using its REST APIs and its wide selection of libraries.</p>

<p>By installing and integrating Elasticsearch into your system, you can add a search engine to your website, add autocomplete functionalities, use its machine learning functionalities to perform analysis on your data and provide better results for your users, and much more.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to integrate Elasticsearch into a Laravel blog. You’ll also add authentication to your blog using Okta and allow authenticated users to create new blog posts.</p>

 What is Elasticsearch? 

<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co">Elasticsearch</a> allows you to index your data and perform searches quickly and efficiently. It also allows you to better understand your data, and to track your query load times using tools like <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana/">Kibana</a>, a visualization dashboard for your data .</p>

<p>If you have an e-commerce website, it’s important to add a search engine that will allow your users to search through thousands of products, including multiple fields like titles, descriptions, and categories in the search. Elasticsearch is a versatile search engine that not only makes the process easy for you, but also indexes and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-caching-deep-dive-boosting-query-speed-one-cache-at-a-time">caches</a> data to provide a faster and more optimized response to your queries.</p>

 Integrate Elasticsearch with Laravel 

<p>In this section, you’ll create a blog with <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> that shows posts for unauthenticated users and allows users authenticated with <a href="https://developer.okta.com">Okta</a> to add posts. Then you’ll integrate Elasticsearch, adding search functionality to the blog.</p>

<p>You can find the code for this tutorial in <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-php-laravel-elasticsearch-example">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

 Prerequisites 

<p>Before you start with this tutorial, you’ll need <a href="https://www.php.net">PHP</a> version 7.3 or higher. If you’re running Windows, you’ll also need to enable the use of the SQLite3 extension by adding a DLL to the system <code>PATH</code>, following the directions in the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/sqlite3.installation.php">SQLite3 installation guide</a>. You also need to have <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">Composer</a> installed.</p>

<p>To use Elasticsearch, you need to have it installed and running on your machine. You can follow the installation steps in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html">this guide from Elastic</a>, and then <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/starting-elasticsearch.html">learn the basics here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a fresh PHP installation, or haven’t worked with Laravel before, you might need to install some extensions, such as <code>php-dom</code>, <code>php-zip</code>, and <code>php-curl</code>. For more detail on how to install any of these extensions, you can follow <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-laravel-setup-6c1fd98c2670">this guide on how to install the PHP extensions necessary for Laravel</a>. Please note that the linked guide uses PHP version 7.3—if you’re using PHP version 7.4, be sure to replace <code>7.3</code> in the commands with <code>7.4</code>.</p>

 Creating your project 

<p>In your terminal, run the following command to create a Laravel 8 project:</p>

   <code>composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-es '^8'
</code>   

<p>Navigate to the directory of the newly created project:</p>

   <code>cd laravel-es
</code>   

 Build your database 

<p>To manage the blog data, you’ll need a database. To keep this tutorial simple, you’ll be using <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. Run the following command to create the database:</p>

   <code>touch database/db.sqlite
</code>   

<p>Then change the database configuration in <code>.env</code>:</p>

   <code>DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/laravel-es/database/db.sqlite
</code>   

<p>For <code>DB_DATABASE</code>, make sure you set the absolute path to the SQLite database you just created.</p>

<p>Now you’ll prepare the migrations to create the tables in the database.</p>

<p>By default, Laravel comes with a migration for the <code>users</code> table, which you can find in <code>database/migrations</code>. The file name should be <code>2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php</code>. Open the file and change the content of the <code>up</code> method:</p>

   <code>Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table-&gt;bigIncrements('id');
    $table-&gt;string('email')-&gt;unique();
    $table-&gt;string('name');
    $table-&gt;text('token');
    $table-&gt;timestamps();
});
</code>   

<p>This change will allow you to integrate with Okta later. Because the authentication will be done through Okta, all you have to do is store the user’s token, though you can also store other details, like name and email, for easy access to user details.</p>

<p>You also need a <code>posts</code> table. Run the following command to create a migration for it:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:migration create_posts_table
</code>   

<p>This will create a new file in <code>database/migrations</code>, starting with a timestamp and ending with <code>create_posts_table.php</code>. Open the file and replace the content of the <code>up</code> method with the following:</p>

   <code>Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table-&gt;id();
    $table-&gt;string('title');
    $table-&gt;longText('content');
    $table-&gt;foreignId('user_id')-&gt;constrained('users')-&gt;cascadeOnUpdate()-&gt;cascadeOnDelete();
    $table-&gt;timestamps();
});
</code>   

<p>This will create a posts table that has the fields <code>id</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>content</code>, and <code>user_id</code>. These are the essential fields for a blog post, but you can add other fields if you wish.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create the tables in the database:</p>

   <code>php artisan migrate
</code>   

 Create your models 

<p>Next, you need to create models that you’ll use to interact with the tables in the database.</p>

<p>By default, Laravel has the <code>User</code> model created for you in <code>app/Models</code>. However, because you modified the migration file earlier, you also need to modify the model.</p>

<p>Open <code>app/Models/User.php</code> and change the content of the <code>User</code> class:</p>

   <code>protected $fillable = [
    'email', 'name', 'token'
];

protected $hidden = [
    'token'
];
</code>   

<p>This will change the <code>fillable</code> fields to <code>email</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>token</code>, and will keep the token private by adding it to the <code>hidden</code> array.</p>

<p>Let’s now create the <code>Post</code> model. Create the file <code>app/Models/Post.php</code> and add the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'title', 'content', 'user_id'
    ];
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>Post</code> model has the fillable fields of <code>title</code>, <code>content</code>, and <code>user_id</code>.</p>

 Create a home page for your blog 

<p>. Nearly all blogs begin with a website of some sort. You’ll start by creating a home page to display all the posts that have been added to the blog.</p>

<p>Create the controller to handle incoming requests using this command:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:controller BlogController
</code>   

<p>This will create the file <code>app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php</code>. Open it and import the class <code>Post</code> at the beginning of the file:</p>

   <code>use App\Models\Post;
</code>   

<p>Then add the following method inside the <code>BlogController</code> class:</p>

   <code>public function home (Request $request) {
    $posts = Post::all();

    return view('home', ['posts' =&gt; $posts]);
}
</code>   

<p>This retrieves the posts and sends them to the <code>home</code> view.</p>

<p>Now create the file <code>resources/views/home.blade.php</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>@extends('layout')

@section('content')
    @forelse ($posts as $post)
      &lt;div class="card mt-3"&gt;
        &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
          &lt;h5 class="card-title"&gt;{{ $post-&gt;title }}&lt;/h5&gt;
          &lt;span class="small"&gt;{{ $post-&gt;summary }}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;
            {!! $post-&gt;content !!}
          &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    @empty
      &lt;div class="card mt-3"&gt;
        &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
          There are no posts available
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    @endforelse
@endsection
</code>   

<p>This code will show the posts, if there are any, viewed as cards. Notice that this extends another view, called <code>layout</code>, which you’ll create now.</p>

<p>Make the file <code>resources/views/layout.blade.php</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge"&gt;

  &lt;link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;
  @stack('scripts')
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"&gt;
    &lt;div class="container-fluid"&gt;
      &lt;a class="navbar-brand" href="/"&gt;Laravel Blog&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav"&gt;
        &lt;ul class="navbar-nav me-auto"&gt;
          &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
            @guest
              &lt;a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#"&gt;Sign In&lt;/a&gt;
            @endguest
            @auth
              &lt;a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#"&gt;Add Post&lt;/a&gt;
            @endauth
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        @auth
          &lt;span&gt;{{ Auth::user()-&gt;name }}&lt;/span&gt;
        @endauth
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;div class="container mt-4"&gt;
    @yield('content')
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" 
    integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>This eliminates repeated code by creating a layout view that other views can extend. For ease of styling, you’re using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> to create your layout.</p>

<p>All pages will have a navigation bar. When the user is not authenticated, they’ll see a sign-in link. Otherwise, they’ll see a link to add a post.</p>

<p>The last step to creating your home page is registering the new route. Open <code>routes/web.php</code> and replace the current <code>/</code> route with the following:</p>

   <code>Route::get('/', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'home']);
</code>   

<p>Let’s test it out now. In your terminal, run the server with the following command:</p>

   <code>php artisan serve
</code>   

<p>This will run your server, typically on <code>localhost:8000</code>. Open it in your browser, and you’ll see that there are currently no posts on your website.</p>

<p></p>

 Add authentication with Okta 

<p>You’re going to add user authentication to your website using <a href="https://developer.okta.com">Okta</a>.</p>

 Set up Okta 

<p>If you don’t already have an Okta account, go ahead and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">create one</a>—otherwise, just log in. From the sidebar, click Applications, then Applications in the sub-menu. After that, click on Create App Integration.</p>

<p>In the pop-up, select OIDC - OpenID Connect and Web Application, then click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, on the page that opens, you’ll enter details about the new integration. In the first section, you need to enter the app’s name. For Grant Type, choose Client Credentials, and for Sign-in redirect URIs, enter http://localhost:8000/login/redirect. Later, this is where you’ll handle the authentication.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the bottom of the form, under Assignments, choose Allow everyone in your organization to access. This allows any user in your Okta organization to log in to the blog.</p>

<p>Once you’re done, click on Save. You’ll be redirected to the page of the app you just created. On that page, you can see Client ID and Client Secret keys. Copy them and add them as new keys in <code>.env</code>:</p>

   <code>OKTA_BASE_URL=
OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=
OKTA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/login/redirect
</code>   

<p>The last thing you need is your organization’s Okta base URL, which can be found by going to Security, then API. It’ll be in the table under Issuer URI. You only need the authority, not the full path.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Okta is now ready to be used for authentication!</p>

 Add authentication in Laravel 

<p>Back in Laravel, you’ll add the authentication with Okta by using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/socialite">Socialite</a>. Socialite allows you to add social logins, as well as OAuth providers like Okta, to your Laravel app.</p>

<p>Install the package for authentication with Okta using Socialite:</p>

   <code>composer require laravel/socialite socialiteproviders/okta
</code>   

<p>After installing the package, you need to add Okta in the <code>config/services.php</code> so that Socialite can find and use its keys:</p>

   <code>'okta' =&gt; [    
        'base_url' =&gt; env('OKTA_BASE_URL'),
        'client_id' =&gt; env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'),  
        'client_secret' =&gt; env('OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET'),  
        'redirect' =&gt; env('OKTA_REDIRECT_URI'),
        'auth_server_id' =&gt; env('OKTA_SERVER_ID')
      ],
</code>   

<p>You also need to configure Socialite’s listener to listen to the <code>SocialiteWasCalled</code> event to use Okta. In <code>app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php</code> add the event in the <code>$listen</code> array inside the <code>EventServiceProvider</code> class:</p>

   <code>$listen = [
  ...,
  \SocialiteProviders\Manager\SocialiteWasCalled::class =&gt; [
              \SocialiteProviders\Okta\OktaExtendSocialite::class.'@handle',
        ],
]
</code>   

<p>You can now use Socialite to authenticate with Okta.
Start by first importing the <code>Socialite</code> facade at the beginning of <code>app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php</code>:</p>

   <code>use Laravel\Socialite\Facades\Socialite;
</code>   

<p>Then add a new method in the <code>BlogController</code> class:</p>

   <code>public function redirectToLogin () {
    return Socialite::driver('okta')-&gt;redirect();
}
</code>   

<p>When the user clicks the Sign In link in the navigation bar, they’ll be taken into the <code>login</code> page in your Laravel blog, which is handled by <code>redirectToLogin</code>. On the <code>login</code> page, Socialite will make use of the keys you added to <code>.env</code> to redirect users to Okta’s authentication page.</p>

<p>Add the route to this <code>login</code> route in <code>routes/web.php</code>:</p>

   <code>Route::get('/login', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'redirectToLogin'])-&gt;name('login');
</code>   

<p>Change the URL of the Sign In link in <code>resources/views/layout.blade.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="{{ route('login') }}"&gt;Sign In&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now when you open the home page again and click the Sign In link in the navigation bar, you’ll be taken to Okta’s authentication screen.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Before you can test the authentication, you need to add the redirect route that will handle the response of the successful authentication.</p>

<p>In <code>app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php</code>, add the necessary import at the beginning of the file for <code>Auth</code>, which you’ll be using for authentication:</p>

   <code>use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use App\Models\User;
</code>   

<p>Then, add the following method inside the <code>BlogController</code> class:</p>

   <code>public function handleLogin () {
    $oktaUser = Socialite::driver('okta')-&gt;user();

    $user = User::where('email', $oktaUser-&gt;email)-&gt;first();

    if (!$user) {
        $user = User::create([
            'email' =&gt; $oktaUser-&gt;email,
            'name'  =&gt; $oktaUser-&gt;name,
            'token' =&gt; $oktaUser-&gt;token,
        ]);
    } else {
        $user-&gt;token = $oktaUser-&gt;token;
        $user-&gt;save();
    }

    try {
        Auth::login($user);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        return redirect()-&gt;route('login');
    }

    return redirect('/');
}
</code>   

<p>This tells Socialite to retrieve the Okta user, then checks if the user’s email address is in the database. If it is, the <code>token</code> field is changed to reflect the user’s token. If it isn’t, a new user is created, and the <code>token</code> field updates with their information. The user is then authenticated on your Laravel blog using <code>Auth::login</code> and is redirected to the home page.</p>

<p>Next, add the route in <code>routes/web.php</code>:</p>

   <code>Route::get('/login/redirect', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'handleLogin']);
</code>   

<p>You can now test the authentication. Fill out the Okta form with your name and password.</p>

<p>After logging in, you’ll be redirected to the home page, and you’ll see that the link in the navigation bar has changed to Add Post. You’ll also see your name on the right side of the navigation bar.</p>

<p></p>

 Add your post page 

<p>Now that users can log in, you’ll need to add a page where authenticated users can create new blog posts.</p>

<p>Create the file <code>resources/views/post-form.blade.php</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>@extends('layout')

@section('content')
    &lt;form method="POST" action="#"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;New Post&lt;/h1&gt;
      @csrf
      &lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
        &lt;label for="title" class="form-label"&gt;Title&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" id="title" name="title"&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
        &lt;label for="content" class="form-label"&gt;Content&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;textarea id="content" name="content"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
@endsection

@push('scripts')
  &lt;script src="https://cdn.tiny.cloud/1/no-api-key/tinymce/5/tinymce.min.js" referrerpolicy="origin"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    tinymce.init({
      selector: '#content'
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
@endpush
</code>   

<p>This will create the new post form, with a textbox to add the title and a <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/">tinyMCE</a> rich text editor to add the content.</p>

<p>Add the new route in <code>routes/web.php</code>:</p>

   <code>Route::get('/post/new', function () {
    return view('post-form');
})-&gt;name('post.new.form')-&gt;middleware('auth');
</code>   

<p>Change the URL of the Add Post link in the navigation bar in <code>resources/views/layout.blade.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="{{ route('post.new.form') }}"&gt;Add Post&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>If you go to the home page and click on Add Post, you’ll be taken to the form you just created.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To add the form POST request handler route, add the following to <code>app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php</code>:</p>

   <code>public function savePost (Request $request) {
    //save post
    $user = Auth::user();

    $post = new Post([
        'title' =&gt; $request-&gt;get('title'),
        'content' =&gt; $request-&gt;get('content'),
        'user_id' =&gt; $user-&gt;id
    ]);
    $post-&gt;save();

    return redirect('/');
}
</code>   

<p>This will save the new post and redirect you back to the home page.</p>

<p>Add the new route in <code>routes/web.php</code>:</p>

   <code>Route::post('/post/new', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'savePost'])-&gt;name('post.new')-&gt;middleware('auth');
</code>   

<p>Change the value for the <code>action</code> attribute of the form in <code>post-form.blade.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;form method="POST"  action="{{ route('post.new') }}"&gt;
</code>   

<p>Open the page with the Add Post form again, enter a title and body content, then submit the form. You’ll be redirected to the home page, which will now display the post you added.</p>

 Add search functionality 

<p>The last part of this project is adding a search bar and integrating it with Elasticsearch to index data and fetch results.</p>

<p>You’ll need to install the <code>laravel-elasticsearch</code> package, which wraps Elasticsearch’s PHP package so it can be used easily in Laravel:</p>

   <code>composer require cviebrock/laravel-elasticsearch
</code>   

<p>Add configurations to connect to the Elasticsearch server on your machine.</p>

<p>In <code>.env</code> add the following new keys:</p>

   <code>ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=127.0.0.1
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200
ELASTICSEARCH_SCHEME=http
ELASTICSEARCH_USER=
ELASTICSEARCH_PASS=
</code>   

<p>These are the default configuration values for Elasticsearch configurations, and will set the host, port, and scheme, as well as user and password, if you choose to configure them.</p>

<p>Use the following command to create a command in Laravel that will allow you to easily index the data:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:command IndexPosts
</code>   

<p>Then open <code>app/Console/Commands/IndexPosts.php</code> and change <code>$signature</code>:</p>

   <code>protected $signature = 'index:posts';
</code>   

<p>Add <code>use</code> statements before the <code>IndexPost</code> class:</p>

   <code>use App\Models\Post;
use Elasticsearch;
</code>   

<p>And change the content of <code>handle</code>:</p>

   <code>$posts = Post::all();

foreach ($posts as $post) {
    try {
        Elasticsearch::index([
            'id' =&gt; $post-&gt;id,
            'index' =&gt; 'posts',
            'body' =&gt; [
                'title' =&gt; $post-&gt;title,
                'content' =&gt; $post-&gt;content
            ]
        ]);
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        $this-&gt;info($e-&gt;getMessage());
    }
}

$this-&gt;info("Posts were successfully indexed");
</code>   

<p>This will loop through the posts on the blog, then index the data in Elasticsearch. All posts will be indexed under the <code>posts</code> index, and the body will include the title and content of the post. This means that both the <code>title</code> and <code>content</code> fields are searchable.</p>

<p>In your console, run the following command:</p>

   <code>php artisan index:posts
</code>   

<p>You should see a message that posts were successfully indexed.</p>

<p>Finally, you’ll add a search bar to the home page so users can search the posts. In <code>resources/views/home.blade.php</code>, add the following before the <code>@forelse</code> loop:</p>

   <code>&lt;form method="GET" action="/"&gt;
  @csrf
  &lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
    &lt;input type="search" class="form-control" id="q" name="q" value={{ request()-&gt;get('q', '') }}&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code>   

<p>Then, in <code>app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php</code>, change the <code>home</code> method to the following:</p>

   <code>public function home (Request $request) {
    $q = $request-&gt;get('q');
    if ($q) {
        $response = Elasticsearch::search([
            'index' =&gt; 'posts',
            'body'  =&gt; [
                'query' =&gt; [
                    'multi_match' =&gt; [
                        'query' =&gt; $q,
                        'fields' =&gt; [
                            'title',
                            'content'
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]);

        $postIds = array_column($response['hits']['hits'], '_id');
        $posts = Post::query()-&gt;findMany($postIds);
    } else {
        $posts = Post::all();
    }

    return view('home', ['posts' =&gt; $posts]);
}
</code>   

<p>This change will retrieve the search term from the parameter <code>q</code>. If it’s found, the search is run using Elasticsearch’s <code>search</code> method. This method receives an array that accepts the <code>index</code> key for the name of the index to search through. It also accepts the <code>body</code> key, which holds the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html">Elasticsearch query</a>. In the query, you can use the <code>multi_match</code> option to search multiple fields; in this example our fields are <code>title</code> and <code>content</code>.</p>

<p>The post IDs are retrieved from the response, and the associated post models are sent to the <code>home</code> view.</p>

<p>Remember to add the <code>use</code> statement at the beginning of the file to use <code>Elasticsearch</code>:</p>

   <code>use Elasticsearch;
</code>   

<p>Opening the home page now, you’ll see a search bar. If you enter a search term, the results will show posts with the term you entered in their title or content.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">first article</a> in this three-part series explored unenclosability as an essential property of non-corruptible communication channels. We suggest heading there, if you haven’t already, before reading this article.</p><p>This piece explores what becomes possible in a world of unenclosable carriers. Which is not an easy thing exactly, because really what becomes possible in such a world is an explosion of innovations, the evolution of entirely new social patterns that are beyond what we can predict through the lens of existing ideas. Just as it’s hard to speculate on the kinds of biological organisms that will thrive a million years from now, we can’t really guess at what social organisms will be most useful in the next 10 or 20 years once no holds are barred.</p><p>Still, if we can’t fully paint a picture, maybe we can at least offer a palette sufficient to inspire a sense of what’s possible. As we do, we’ll find out that the prospect of a world built on unenclosable carriers (Holochain or otherwise) isn’t just exciting; it’s completely necessary for people and planet to thrive in the coming generations. Maybe that’s a bold claim, because it amounts to saying that an unenclosable carrier system is a key ingredient in, well, saving the world. And yet it’s what our analysis indicates, so we’d be amiss if we didn’t state the matter clearly and directly. If the boldness of the claim intrigues you to read on, all the better. </p><p>We offer the palette by considering well-known, far-reaching challenges in four domains: food production, energy production, money systems, and planetary stewardship. Within each, we look at how the challenges may actually be symptoms of broken or outdated underlying architectures – patterns of carrier enclosure that were created for good reasons but have actually painted us into a corner such that there’s no way out except to shift the architectures themselves. We then consider a number of alternatives, either experiments already underway or ones we can easily imagine, that gesture in the direction of what’s possible in a world of unenclosable carriers.</p><p>Alright, let’s dive in.</p> 1. Restoring the Quality of Our Food  The problem: <p>The nutritional content per calorie of the modern diet has declined significantly over the last 100 years, thanks to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/05/16/723693839/its-not-just-salt-sugar-fat-study-finds-ultra-processed-foods-drive-weight-gain">predominance of ultra-processed food</a>, the <a href="https://directorsblog.nih.gov/tag/low-quality-carbohydrates/">filling of many mass-produced products with simple carbohydrates and non-nutritional fillers</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15637215/">changes in varieties of crops grown to increase yields</a>, and a decline in the quality of fresh food as a result of soil depletion [<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soil-depletion-and-nutrition-loss/">1</a>] [<a href="https://soils.wisc.edu/facstaff/barak/poster_gallery/minneapolis2000a/">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/may/15/foodanddrink.shopping3">3</a>] and possibly even <a href="https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511">increased carbon in the atmosphere</a>.</p> But what if… <p>…these problems are actually symptoms of structural issues with the very mechanisms by which food is created, sold, and distributed? What if the soil is depleted and the food is overprocessed because of enclosed-carrier dynamics that have created <a href="https://www.tharawat-magazine.com/facts/top-ten-agribusiness-companies/#gs.xknwd5">big-ag</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-companies-control-the-food-industry-2016-9">big-food</a> giants who control much of the market — and whose incentives are directly misaligned with our nutritional needs?</p><p>Independent family farming used to be much more common [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/16/the-decline-of-the-small-american-family-farm-in-one-chart/">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2018-04-04/family-farms-pushed-to-get-big-or-go-bust">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.salon.com/2015/02/10/what_nobody_told_me_about_small_farming_i_cant_make_a_living/">3</a>] [<a href="https://www.t-g.com/story/2646155.html">4</a>] [<a href="https://www.thedailystar.com/news/local_news/number-of-family-farms-continues-to-decline/article_7b3c5532-e02e-5e07-8c62-5881899f616c.html">5</a>]. But increased centralization throughout the food markets have <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/08/small-farms-big-business-family-farms-struggle-against-industrial-agriculture/">made it more difficult for farmers to survive</a> without growing big. “Get big or get out,” said Earl Butz, Richard Nixon’s Secretary of Agriculture <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/04/usa.obituaries">said in 1973</a>. Today, it’s the largest growers — or at least the ones that subscribe to the big-ag programs for seed, feed, fertilizer, and distribution — that enjoy reliable access to the financing needed to compete at scale. And garnering space at grocery chains, even at the more principled ones such as Whole Foods, often <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/getting-your-product-on-shelves-at-whole-foods-just-got-harder-1518085801">requires 6-figure slotting fees</a> and the ability to produce at massive scale.</p><p>Want to ‘buy local’? Good luck: you’re limited to what’s available during the growing season in your area, and you’ll pay <a href="https://www.fdrsinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JFDR_49.1_4_Curtis.pdf">more than at the supermarket</a> because local growers generally can’t come close to matching mass-produced pricing. Want to go organic? Studies suggest that the herbicides known as glyphosates — which Monsanto markets as Roundup, and which the World Health Organization has concluded is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)70134-8/fulltext">“probably carcinogenic to humans”</a> — make their way <a href="https://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/glyphosate02.html">into water supplies</a> and even <a href="https://www.producer.com/2019/01/glyphosate-residues-snare-organics/">organic crops</a>.</p>Shelves at supermarket chains display the products that most serve the interests of the industry’s major stakeholders, and those products are filled with ingredients that do the same.<p>Our access to food is controlled by centralized market players that we don’t get to choose. Mega-corporations like Kraft &amp; Nestle control companies up and down the whole supply chain. Shelves at supermarket chains display the products that most serve the interests of the industry’s major stakeholders, and those products are filled with ingredients that do the same. Farmers are paid simply for pounds of yield, so they understandably favor the cheapest way to achieve high outputs, without regard to the nutritional content of the food or the harmful effects of chemical herbicides or fertilizers.</p><p>And regulators and legislators, many of whom are former big-ag executives or at least receive campaign funding from them, naturally favor centralized interests over those of independent growers.</p><p>Food quality inevitably declines as profit-driven companies race to the bottom in a quest for ever-cheaper sources and ingredients, with governments incentivized to cheer them on.</p> An alternative future is possible. <p>The explosion of labels and certifications like “organic/bio”, “fair trade”, “free-range”, “hormone-free”, “cage-free”, and so on point to the info-age demand for more visibility into the flows and processes that define our food production. A newer generation of certifications focus on “<a href="https://www.scsglobalservices.com/services/sustainably-grown-certification">sustainable</a>” growing practices and even “<a href="https://regenorganic.org/">regenerative</a>” ones, meaning they restore the health of ecosystems that have been degraded through industrial farming or other industry.</p><p>Labels may be only partial indicators — organic food can still come from depleted soil, for example — but at least they move the industry in the right direction. And they point to an opportunity to create massively greater accountability in our food supply chains, incentivizing producers through market dynamics to do right by the consumers.</p><p>Yet supply-chain transparency and consumer information really only works at scale in the case of carrier unenclosability. Without it, certifications themselves can easily become stale or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/organic-milk-may-not-be-organic-2017-5">corrupt</a>. The ability to create a new certification standard needs to be like creating a new turn of phrase in a language: anyone can do it, and the expression spreads if it’s useful, rather than being subject to centralized (government or corporate) oversight over what takes hold. This way, any community can invent, evolve, and enforce the kind of quality assurance that it needs.</p><p>One promising example is the <a href="https://justoneorganics.com/pages/mission-arc-4">Just One Organics Living Economy System </a>(JOOLES), which plans to incentivize regenerative, high-nutrition growing practices by creating a feedback loop directly within the economics of food production. Growers who maintain high soil standards (as verified by spectroscopic analyses of the nutritional content of their produce) gain access to valuable contracts for their grade-B produce known as ‘seconds’ as well as interest-free credit lines that they can use to increase their growing capacity.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>Today, even as healthier growing practices become theoretically more profitable as a result of rising consumer demand, many farmers remain entrenched in low-nutrition, high-chemical growing practices because they lack access to the funding required to shift their operations. It’s the biggest agriculture companies that have access to the cheapest funding, and they make that funding available only to growers who buy the company’s products, sell the company their outputs, or both. Low-quality, high-yield agriculture remains dominant, at least in part, because existing powers have an incentive to perpetuate their already-profitable practices, despite their destructive impacts and growing consumer appetites for something different.</p><p>Projects like JOOLES have the potential to flip that script by linking quality-oriented producers directly with funding from quality-oriented consumers. And doing so using a framework like Holochain ensures that, while money can flow to companies who create value for consumers, no one will be able to concentrate power by virtue of saying who can or cannot transact or collaborate. In a world of unenclosable carriers, consumers will be empowered to continually invent new structures to incentivize the nutrition they actually want, free from the enclosures of entrenched interests that seek to extract short-term profits.</p> 2. Solving the Energy Crisis  The problem: <p>Humans are using the planet’s energy stores faster than they can replenish. This appears to be a function of our reliance on cheap, finite stores of fossil fuel to power an ever-hungrier array of industry, combined with the difficulty of bringing online alternative energy solutions in a cost-effective way. Despite massive sums spent on research and development over many years, we remain drastically ill-equipped to meet energy demands in the coming post-fossil-fuel era.</p> But what if… <p>…this problem is actually a symptom of a centralized energy economy in which entrenched powers have strong incentives to keep us reliant on how we harvest and distribute energy today rather than scale up viable alternatives?</p><p>Consider, for example, how the utility monopolies have used their influence to protect themselves against competition from renewables. They have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/climate/rooftop-solar-panels-tax-credits-utility-companies-lobbying.html?_r=0">worked to curtail production of solar power in homes</a> by lobbying to eliminate tax breaks for solar installations. When ‘net-metering’ legislation has been introduced to require that utility companies pay consumers for surplus power produced at home, energy companies have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/utility-companies-lobbying-campaigns-solar-2017-7">lobbied against it</a> and successfully eliminated it in several U.S states, in some cases doing so explicitly on the grounds that solar proliferation could hurt their profits. Even U.S. government agencies have moved to protect the fossil fuel industry from competition by alternative energy sources, pursuing policies to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/energy-environment/wind-power-base-load.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fdiane-cardwell&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=collection">discourage utility companies from investing in renewables</a>.</p>The utility monopolies have used their influence to protect themselves against competition from renewables.<p>Or consider how oil-industry power brokers in both the private and public sector <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F#Oil_companies">worked to undermine the development and adoption of early electric cars</a> in the early 2000s in the United States, including through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation">disinformation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>, because electric vehicles threatened oil company profits.</p><p>These kinds of counterproductive scenarios, commonplace as they may be, are not necessary. They are consequences of how the flow of electricity is enclosed by centralized power brokers as it moves across the world. There may have been good reasons to allow for those enclosures at the time, such as reliability and scalability, but when building on unenclosable systems like Holochain, it’s actually possible to have it both ways: clean-energy projects that have the resources for large-scale impact and are immune to corruption by proprietary business interests.</p> An alternative future is possible. <p>There is actually an abundance of innovative energy solutions in existence today, and there is promising research into new solutions for tomorrow. The challenge is circumventing the destructive grip the leading energy corporations have on the market that keeps innovations from proliferating. If communities of consumers, researchers, property owners, and entrepreneurs were able to collaborate and transact with true freedom, we could rapidly evolve new approaches to our energy problems.</p><p>Here are just a few kinds of solutions waiting to spread their wings in an unenclosable system:</p><p>A. Self-owned, self-generated power: the production of power on one’s own property, for one’s own use. One recent study found that residential solar production alone <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70901.pdf">could supply around a quarter of the United States’</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_of_the_United_States#Electricity_consumption">total energy needs</a>. Add in the rest of usable rooftop space nationwide and <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65298.pdf">you get to 39%</a>, while California, where it’s especially sunny, could produce 74% of its power just through solar on existing rooftops.</p><p>B. Peer-produced power and micro-exchanges: the sharing of self-generated power across peer networks, with payments made through unenclosable currencies from those who net-consume power to those who net-provide power. Imagine if everyone were simply buying and selling electricity to one another – harvested from sun, wind, and rivers – &nbsp;with absolutely no centralized entity brokering or extracting value from those transactions. This ‘Internet of Energy’ is what <a href="https://redgrid.io/">Redgrid</a>, <a href="https://holo.host/project/redgrid/">powered by Holochain</a>, aims to create.</p><p>C. Smart grids: comprehensive restructuring of power grids to increase efficiency and decrease fuel usage, required infrastructure, and pollution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid#Load_adjustment/Load_balancing">Smart grids</a> involve different components (such as appliances, meters, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_conditioner">power conditioners</a>) ‘talking’ to each other and taking actions that reduce or balance system loads across time. For example, a smart grid might cause air conditioners at neighboring buildings to ‘take turns’ cycling on and off, thereby reducing spikes in overall usage and, in turn, reducing the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_demand">peak power</a> that the grid needs to be built to provide. Today, energy companies have incentives to suppress smart-grid technology since it threatens their current business models, but in a world of unenclosable carriers and open energy exchanges, micro-markets could emerge where small players compete to establish healthier patterns of energy use.</p><p>D. Novel developments in energy production. In a climate of unfettered research and development, resources could also flow to a variety of promising energy research frontiers (beyond wind and solar) that make sense to pursue but are today disregarded as fringe by centralized economic channels. Waves, tides, geothermal sources, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hawaii-first-to-harness-deep-ocean-temperatures-for-power/">deep ocean water</a>, and even <a href="https://medium.com/predict/no-longer-30-years-away-two-new-major-fusion-breakthroughs-bcb65106a013">fusion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion">cold fusion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy">zero-point energy</a>, and <a href="https://topmagneticgenerator.com/mit-experiments-with-overunity/">over-unity devices</a> have yielded promising discoveries which have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_encumbrance_of_large_automotive_NiMH_batteries">shelved or blocked</a> within today’s centralized energy climate. With peer-production and smart grids in place, it could become economically feasible to create a ready evaluation path and an open market for every garage inventor’s creative energy solutions.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>The very idea that energy production needs to be centralized is actually fairly new. During the early industrial age 150 or 200 years ago, you didn’t need to plug into a centralized, monopoly-owned grid to run your factory; you just needed a river to turn your belts. Even steam engines that ran trains and turned heavy equipment could run on wood harvested and renewed within the local forest.</p><p>As foreign as it may sound today, decentralized power production was once the norm and could easily be again, sending centralized facilities the way of industrial-age relics like broadcast TV service, print-newspaper conglomerates, and the U.S. Postal Service. This is especially true now because we have technologies not just for producing large amounts of energy locally, but also for efficiently distributing and transacting for it across peer-to-peer networks. Add in the possibility of major funding sources being directed to mainly support, rather than suppress, the scaling of clean energy solutions, and we have a whole new ball game when it comes to powering humanity for centuries to come.</p><p>Of course, all of this would require a complete dismantling of the current enclosures around our energy systems. Existing patterns perpetuate because existing incentive structures perpetuate them. The future of energy production, like the future of nutrition, must be underpinned by the ability for groups to spin up new patterns of coordination at will.</p><p>And spinning up new patterns at will, it turns out, requires unenclosability not just in our communication systems but also our transacting systems. So let’s turn next to money.</p> 3.

This forces the issuance of more money each year than the previous (and thus more debt) in order to keep up with interest and avoid collapse due to foreclosures, defaults, and bankruptcies. Through compounding interest, this debt grows exponentially, ever widening the gap between money owed and the money supply available to repay it. The debt is owed by individuals, corporations, and governments who rely on borrowed money in order to invest in homes, infrastructure, and so on — all of whom then need to earn even more each year as interest compounds. The economy is literally forced to grow, or collapse.	</p><p>If this doesn’t already <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-wall-street-ponzi-scheme-called-fractional-reserve-banking/11600">sound a lot like a Ponzi scheme</a>, consider it from the angle of the bankers: as they issue money through loans, the debt owed to them on that money compounds, so in order for borrowers to repay the debts on the money issued last year, bankers need to issue even more money as debt this year. Just like in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi Scheme</a>, this cycle continues and builds exponentially until it reaches its limits of growth, at which point it collapses. </p> An alternative future is possible. <p>We may have so taken for granted that our currency is issued by central authorities and used to manipulate commerce that it’s hard to imagine alternatives taking hold at any kind of scale. And we previously explored how blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, despite their rhetoric, are actually enclosable and are ultimately subject to the same pitfalls of centralized power as corporations and governments. But if we toss out all of our assumptions, we can actually imagine currency taking on entirely new forms. Here are two.</p><p>A. Mutual credit.<br>In a mutual credit system, currency is issued not by a central authority, but by participants granting each other credit according to mutually agreed-upon rules. Money is issued when someone spends into the negative, thus borrowing against the system, while others keep positive balances by receiving revenue before they spend. Since every transaction involves offsetting positive and negative balance adjustments, the currency supply is net-zero, meaning that the sum of all the outstanding positive and negative balances in the system is always zero, just like on a balance sheet.</p>In a mutual credit system, the currency supply is net-zero, meaning that the sum of all the outstanding positive and negative balances in the system is always zero.<p>The rules for who can draw credit vary among mutual credit systems, but one favored approach is to allow only established producers of value to borrow money. In <a href="https://files.holo.host/2017/11/Holo-Currency-White-Paper_2017-11-28.pdf">HoloFuel</a>, for example — the currency system of the <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo hosting network</a>, which is powered by Holochain — users who have demonstrated past capacity to provide hosting power receive lines of credit backed by their future hosting. Thus, not only are “loans” backed by actual value being created, but the very size of the active currency supply — the sum total of the positive balances (which is the inverse of the sum total of debt) — is grounded in the actual size, the actual supply and demand, of the hosting economy.</p><p>Similarly, JOOLES, which we mentioned earlier in this article, is a mutual-credit currency backed by the production of food, with the money supply growing or shrinking proportionally to the supply and demand for produce.</p><p>With the currency supply grounded in the economic output it represents – and with no debt created beyond what’s issued directly for value-creators – there’s no ‘economy’ that needs to keep growing just to feed itself. And with currency issued directly by the value producers, no one can extract value just by virtue of having a monopoly on money issuance. A mutual-credit currency based on an unenclosable carrier such as Holochain is truly peer-to-peer, completely free of any centralized components.</p><p>A bonus benefit of mutual credit is that it may bypass the challenges that many cryptocurrencies face with regard to securities laws (which are themselves a form of carrier enclosure). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in particular has a penchant for shutting down blockchain-based projects that issue speculative tokens, but because mutual credit is issued only in the moments when value is actually exchanged, it is not a future-based investment and, as such, may be difficult to classify as a security.</p><p>B. Triple-bottom-line currencies.<br>Triple-bottom-line currencies are another way of optimizing currency, and thereby the economy, for wide collective benefit. You may have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line#People,_the_social_equity_bottom_line">triple-bottom-line (TBL) accounting</a>, which some companies use to evaluate their performance on the basis of not only profit but also people, which is the well-being of everyone impacted by the business, and planet, which is the business’s impact on the natural environment. (Profit, people, and planet are sometimes known as the three ‘P’s.) TBL accounting is an attempt to account for, or ‘internalize’, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externalities</a> of transactions, which is to say the costs (or benefits) of doing business that are not reflected in revenues. It’s a noble idea, but it’s impossible to accurately account for a transaction’s externalities, given all the hidden and chain reactions that take place in the complex systems of human dynamics and planetary ecosystems.</p><p>Another way of stating this problem is that any company’s internal assessment of their external effects is skewed by the company’s limited perspective (which is a kind of enclosure in its own right) even if it has the best intentions.</p><p>In an unenclosable financial system, however, there’s a way around the problem: incorporating external feedback loops into the currency itself, based on input from people who are in a position, from vantage points outside the company, to assess its external impacts. This way, instead of expecting companies to care about people and planet and also do impossible accounting, a TBL currency enables a much simpler thing, which is to allow a company’s reputation for doing good or harm to impact its overall cost of doing business.</p><p>This approach is actually similar to what we know today as credit ratings, which are essentially reputation currencies that act in conjunction with today’s money systems to affect the cost and availability of money. But credit ratings factor in only your payment history, which corresponds to just one of the P’s: your ability to earn money (profit) and, in turn, reliably make profit for the bankers who lend you money. A ‘triple credit rating’, which could drive a ‘triple-bottom-line currency’, would also factor in your effects on people and planet. One possible approach could be:</p><p>(i) Your people rating affects your interest rates, in order to make it more attractive for you to borrow money if you’re deemed to affect people positively through your commerce, and less attractive if you’re not.</p><p>(ii) Your planet rating affects your transaction fees, with the idea being that polluters and extractors pay a tax to the system to offset the environmental costs borne by everyone. If you have a reputation for positively impacting the planet, you could actually incur a negative tax, which means you’re essentially being paid to transact by the system, in reflection of the good you externalize.</p><p>(iii) Your profit rating affects your credit limits, similar to existing credit ratings, with the idea being that your likelihood to pay back funds ought to remain a central factor in how much you can borrow.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>Today, business is driven by the short-term imperative of financial profit and staying ahead of ever-compounding debt. Of course such an extractive system is driving a pattern of cancerously consuming the planet’s natural resources in the almighty name of Economic Growth. Of course we’re burning cheap but limited energy stores instead of building renewable infrastructure. And of course we’re farming in ways that maximize pounds of yield over soil health and more sustainable growing practices.</p><p>One mechanism by which today’s debt-driven economy has such a troubling effect is through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money">time cost of money</a>, which means that a dollar now is worth more than a dollar later. With debt everywhere, compounding interest is everywhere, so carrying a negative balance is expensive, while carrying a positive balance can be lucrative. The time cost of money incentivizes everyone to liquidate physical assets for cash as soon as possible. A tree is worth more dead than alive, goes one saying.</p><p>In other words: no matter what business asset you own — a forest, a website, a factory — you have an incentive to convert that asset into numbers on a balance sheet as quickly as possible, even if it could produce more cash on a longer timeline. The more cash you can get now, the more you can put that cash to work in high-return financial instruments. Plus, if you’re like most business owners, you’re paying interest on the loans you took to capitalize your business — as well as on your personal debt (home, cars, college, and so on) — and cash could help pay off those costly loans.</p><p>It’s no wonder that long-term sustainability (of a business model or a planet) is such a low priority for most businesses. Extracting more fossil fuel, catching more fish, and selling more plastic is not just profitable but compoundingly profitable, even if we are completely outstripping the carrying capacity of our ecosystem.</p>Extracting more fossil fuel, catching more fish, and selling more plastic is not just profitable but compoundingly profitable, even if we are completely outstripping the carrying capacity of our ecosystem.<p>Speaking of which: the fact that it’s even possible to outstrip the carrying capacity of our ecosystem is, in part, a function of our currency supply being disconnected from the limits of the physical systems upon which the economy operates. Reconnecting these two phenomena is actually imperative for having a sustainable economy: if we don’t, we have no guardrails against outstripping the planet’s capacity to regenerate itself.</p><p>Mutual credit systems have a particularly seamless ability to connect to the carrying capacity of an economy, since the creation of currency can be strictly a function of spending into the negative by those who have demonstrated the ability to produce actual value, and the currency is backed by their future production of that value. Such a system also shifts the power away from the bankers who derive influence from their ability to create and charge for the money supply, allocating power instead to the value-creators themselves (those who are actually able to provide for people’s needs). Add in a triple-credit rating system and you bring greater good into the equation as well.</p><p>Imagine if the most powerful individuals on the planet were those who demonstrated the capacity to create the most benefit, rather than those who can extract the most resources.</p><p>It’s a good thing that we can imagine such a scenario, because this is exactly what it will take to tackle perhaps the most intractable problem we’re facing today.</p> 4. Saving the Planet  The problem: <p>There are, of course, many human-caused problems related to our natural ecosystem. We are currently causing the sixth major extinction event in biological history, we are polluting the oceans and atmosphere beyond what may be reversible, and we are rapidly outstripping the carrying capacity of our ecosystem.</p><p>For the purpose of illustration, let’s narrow things down and focus on the destruction of the rainforests, which are clearly disappearing at a rate faster than they can renew [<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation/">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/11/18/20970604/amazon-rainforest-2019-brazil-burning-deforestation-bolsonaro">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/world/americas/amazon-rainforest.html">3</a>]. Reasons appear to include narrow-minded policies in many tropical nations that are out of touch with the importance of rainforests to our planet’s health, along with the desirability of rainforest land for industrial farming and oil exploration.</p>Rainforests are disappearing at a rate faster than they can renew. But what if… <p>… these are actually symptoms of a deeper cause: that our enclosable systems have led us to account for the value of rainforests in short-term and shallow ways, making it inevitable that their stewards would choose to liquidate them now versus reap their benefits over time?</p><p>What is the true value of an acre of rainforest? It may be difficult to place a number, but any true-value calculation would have to account for the myriad ways the forest contributes to the greater ecosystem (and the economy) by continuing to exist: the carbon storage that keeps the planet from overheating, the oxygen supply that keeps us breathing, the rare tropical hardwoods which might be harvested sustainably over time, the utility of plants as food and medicine, the biodiversity that took billions of years to evolve and helps sustain food chains worldwide.</p><p>But try comparing the value of a thousand chairs or ten thousand gallons of milk this year to the value of keeping a million tons of carbon out of the atmosphere over the next 100 years, or to the survival of a certain salamander species that could keeping eating bugs and being food for birds for millions of years. That’s a challenging task in any case, but it’s completely impossible when our financial systems account for only the most shallow and short-term benefits: X dollars for the lumber, Y dollars for the drilling rights, and Z dollars for agricultural leases.</p><p>Which means there’s (at least) two issues at play here, if we break things down. One is the oppressive time cost of money: it’s better to get $10M now than $20M over the next 20 years. The other is that financial accounting is an inadequate representation of wealth in a complex system. Without proper accounting for externalities, it’s inevitable that we continue to eat the world for profit, unsustainably extracting natural resources for their cash value.</p> An alternative future is possible. <p>We’ve already looked at mutual credit and triple-bottom-line currencies as ways to foster sustainability and positive feedback loops at the level of currency design. Both would help bring incentives more in line with rainforest preservation. Now we look at an approach one layer up: the ways that assets are owned and shared.</p><p>Sharing economies.<br>Is it necessary for us to outright own as much as we currently do? Is it beneficial?</p><p>For example: How many hours of use per year does the average suburban lawnmower see? Maybe an hour a week for part of the year? That means they sit idle more than 99.7% of the time… yet it’s typical to have one in every household, causing all manner of negative externalities through their manufacturing, raw materials, waste, and (often) indoor storage space. Conventional accounting celebrates the manufacturing, sale, and maintenance of all these lawnmowers as positive numbers in “the economy”, but there’s a bigger picture badly missed by that perspective. Can you imagine the massive net benefit if neighborhoods could easily coordinate their use of lawnmowers through a shared-ownership, shared-use system built on unenclosable carriers?</p><p>Expanding outward, cars also seem ripe for this kind of exploration, as do, say, many kitchens and laundry spaces. Maybe someday even land might not need to be individually owned, but rather commonly owned and privately leased. This is the basis of Georgist economics, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Georgism</a>, which also imagines that lease-holders could reap benefits from improving the land and be taxed for extracting resources from the land.</p><p>But we don’t need to go full Georgist to imagine hybrid systems – ‘sharing economies’ – that would retain basic property ownership but still lead to more efficient use of resources. One version is a kind of <a href="http://artbrock.com/blog/new-kind-commons-land-weaving-society">land-weaving society</a> in which owners permit the use of their property for a variety of beneficial purposes, using reputation and certification to authorize access. If I have a permaculture certification, for example, I might be invited to farm your land, perhaps for a fee or a share of yield, or maybe because it benefits you in other ways, like soil improvement or social rewards. Other certifications might permit me to sustainably harvest wood, gather food or medicinal herbs, hunt, or graze your livestock. “No Trespassing” signs could be replaced by technologically enabled “Enter Here” checkpoints, with RFID or smartphone-based tracking – and with micropayments transferring automatically in cryptocurrencies as agreed upon.</p>“No Trespassing” signs could be replaced by technologically enabled “Enter Here” checkpoints.<p>For a land-weaving type of approach to remain effective at any kind of scale, it would be critical that the systems for granting and tracking access — and for tracking reputations and certifications — be guaranteed to always remain fully decentralized, which means being built on an unenclosable carrier framework like Holochain.</p> The implications are game-changing. <p>What’s typical today is that only those who own or fully rent a piece of land can make much use of it. But this tight coupling of ownership and stewardship makes holding natural resources unlucrative as compared to liquidating them, due to the costs of ownership and the time cost of money. But we can begin to imagine how, if we decouple ownership from stewardship, the balance could tip such that growing the capacity of the land is more beneficial to the landowner than depleting it.</p><p>The closest analog we have today to what something like this might look like might be national parks, but these exist mainly as nature preserves reliant on government subsidies (and a bit of tourism revenue). As a result, they are subject to all the complications of centralized power, including <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/07/who-wants-disposable-plastic-water-bottles-in-national-parks/399113/">lobbying</a>, politically motivated <a href="https://www.npca.org/articles/2029-how-is-the-partial-government-shutdown-affecting-national-parks">government shutdowns</a>, and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/trump-bears-ears.html">declassification from protected status</a> by unilateral action.</p><p>In order to truly tip the balance such that stewarding a rainforest on an ongoing basis is more advantageous than destroying it for cash, multiple land uses need to be allowed to occur: not solely ecotourism, or harvesting edibles, or gathering medicinals or wood, but all of these and more, all gated through the appropriate membranes of access such as certifications, reputation systems, and fee structures.</p><p>And because each of these land uses are complex in their own right, it might not be one enterprise operating all of them, but various enterprises doing work within their zones of core competency, choreographing their operations with one another to maximize efficiency. For instance, the group permitted to harvest lumber might mark the trees they plan to cut down with three months’ notice, so that the gatherers could prioritize harvesting food, herbs, and other materials from those trees in particular. The type of coordination this requires is what makes unenclosable carriers so important: to whatever extent the coordination is channeled through central points of control, the system will corrupt over time, with power and money flowing to those who control the means of coordination.</p>There might be various enterprises doing work within their zones of core competency, choreographing their operations with one another to maximize efficiency.<p>Growing What’s Ours<br>Extrapolating from the idea of sharing economies, we might begin to completely reimagine what it means to solve for scarcity in general. As the naturalist Paul Krafel has pointed out in his enlightening (if productionally spartan) short film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuBMpc_3S04">The Upward Spiral</a>, there are basically two responses when faced with limited resources: one is to compete to maximize your own personal gain at the expense of others’, and the other is to act and interact in patterns that expand the amount of usable resources for everyone (including yourself).</p><p>We call the first strategy ‘get mine’, and we call the second ‘grow ours’. And what’s fascinating is that if you look across natural history, it’s ‘grow ours’ that evolution selects for over time, contrary to what we might infer from the ‘survival of the fittest’ narrative dominant within our cultural understanding of evolution (and in nature documentaries). Natural selection might actually be better understood as ‘<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Nature-Deliberate-Encounters-Visible/dp/189013242X">survival of the fit</a>’, as in “those whose characteristics are most fit for their environs are most likely to survive”. And a great way of being highly fit to one’s environs is to treat existing resources regeneratively, using the ones that exist to produce even more valuable resources.</p><p>Plants are great as this. They combine the abundant resources of sunlight, air, and water and produce all the carbon-sugars that comprise our planetary food chain. And look at how well that works out for them: they have literally spread to most of the surface area on earth, and they make up a vast majority of biomass on the planet. Carnivorous mammals, which need to employ more ‘get mine’ than plants to compete for limited food, are far more rare. But even they typically take only what they need, and not more than can be renewed, from their surroundings and from prey populations.</p>Plants combine the abundant resources of sunlight, air, and water and produce all the carbon-sugars that comprise our planetary food chain.<p>Growing ours is a good strategy in part because most of the resources we need to survive are actually renewable, meaning there’s an infinite supply if we treat them regeneratively. When we’re only competing against one another for how quickly we can extract those resources and short-term-profit from them, we outstrip the carrying capacity of the incredible engine of life that is our sun-fueled natural ecosystem, and the engine stops. On the other hand, when we take on a posture of enhancing the regenerative behaviors of ecosystems, the engine thrives, and so does humanity.</p><p>It’s not that ‘get mine’ is not useful in the right context and scale; individual agents within a market often need to compete for shares of a pie. But that’s precisely why it’s so critical that, at a collective level, we have feedback loops that check and balance our overall consumption, or else we’re just like a yeast colony that overconsumes its environment and causes its own demise. We must have systems that track our impact and make it visible, facilitate and reward the sharing of resources, and incentivize working together to leave the pie at least as big as we found it. And these systems must be built on unenclosable carriers or they will get hijacked again and again for the benefit of only a few, and the story plays out once more – different cast maybe, but same outcome.</p> A ‘Holocene Explosion’ of Social Organisms <p>Starting 541 million years ago, a remarkable thing happened: a period of just 20 million years gave birth to most of the biological diversity that exists today. It’s known as the Cambrian Explosion, and it was catalyzed by the information carrier known as DNA.</p><p>Here at the beginning of the 21st century, we are standing at the outset of a similar explosion, only this time, it’s social organisms, not biological ones, that are emerging. And it’s social DNA, not biological DNA, that is powering it. </p><p>Just as biological organisms are more than the sum of their cellular parts, with the whole living on as the cells die and are replaced, social organisms (or social patterns) are forms of collective coordination that live on beyond the participation of particular individuals. Corporations and governments are the most familiar examples, having dominated the human systems landscape for centuries, with religious groups, tribes, and all kinds of community structures also in the mix along the way.</p><p>Early challenges to that dominance began decades ago with experiments in more participatory ownership (such as different kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative">cooperatives</a>) and more participatory governance (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy">liquid democracies</a>), but it’s really the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web2</a>’ era of user-generated content, with its social networks and online marketplaces, that kicked the explosion into higher (second?) gear.</p><p>Now, ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a>’ organisms like decentralized marketplaces and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) use blockchain-based smart contracts to eliminate the need for corporate or government intermediaries entirely. Even though these new organisms end up giving power to new intermediaries (as we discussed in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Part 1 of this series</a>), they are still shaking the snow globe and enabling us to at least imagine a world without centralized power.</p><p>The aim of this article has been to hint at such a world. Mutual credit, peer energy exchanges, sharing economies… these are examples of the kinds of social organisms that might emerge in an era of truly peer-to-peer communication and collaboration, built on a system of unenclosable carriers. But there are so many more unknowns than knowns about this new era. When any two or two billion people can invent new ways of interacting, unfettered by anyone moderating their behavior without their permission, the DNA of social organisms evolves with unprecedented speed. New ideas are encoded and tried, with the most fit being refined, combined, iterated, and propagated.</p><p>It’s an explosion of new social organisms like we’ve never seen before, a complete reimagining of how humans interact and organize. We call it the Holocene Explosion, named for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene">current geological epoch</a>, and it begins now.</p><p>Let’s tune in to one more thought experiment that might (barely) hint at the scope of something like this. Imagine you’re the CEO of a huge multinational corporation, and it’s your job to keep a pulse on the whole organization and to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues as they arise. Today, you get the information you need periodically in dense reports containing financial statements and other long-form statistics. The report has taken time to compile from all the different departments and field locations, so by the time you receive it it’s not very current. Plus it takes you time to read it, digest it into a mental model, and hopefully draw some kind of useful conclusions about the complex system the data represents.</p><p>But let’s say that this is the future, and you get your information very differently. What you’re looking at is not a 400-page report, but rather a nature scene depicted on a screen — maybe an aquarium of fish, a bit like the old screensavers. Each type of fish represents some part of the massive, complex system you’re managing, while the fishes’ behavior — like how fast or high they’re swimming, or how coordinated a school’s movements — represents some metric, interpreted and compiled by the sort of advanced intelligence that’s already available today.</p>What you’re looking at is not a 400-page report, but rather a nature scene depicted on a screen — maybe an aquarium of fish, a bit like the old screensavers.<p>What works so well about this scenario is not just that the data is delivered in real time, but also that it’s delivered in a format that is consistent with how the human perceptual system is designed to operate. You have on the wall in your office not paragraphs, charts, and graphs, but a simulated ecosystem acting as the real-time health monitor of a complex system, displayed in such a way that you can take in large amounts of information at a glance, millions of simultaneous data points even, by observing patterns among the fish or their environs: the rippling seaweed, the blooming algae, the bubbles, the water’s cloudiness, the current, the light. When something seems ‘off’, you open up an interface on your computer, click on the item of interest, and drill in for more information.</p><p>Imagine how effective you would be at taking the pulse of a system and adapting to it under these conditions.</p><p>Now imagine that it’s not just the CEO who has access to this monitor, but actually everyone in the company as well, in corners of their screens or on the walls in their departments, maybe with their views adapted according to what’s most relevant for their work. Now instead of only a few executives being responsible for managing everything, the whole is holding the whole. Everyone can see the system they’re impacting, feel a direct relationship to it, and problem-solve for its optimal health. Can you imagine how the spirit of ‘grow ours’ could spread across an organization if all the people who were actually doing the work to bring about change could see the effect of their activities on the system?</p><p>Now consider applying these kinds of feedback mechanisms to all manner of global conditions: intercontinental trade, harmony among peoples, and, yes, the health of rainforests, oceans, and the atmosphere. How much faster might we solve humanity’s most intractable problems if we were all seeing the impact of our collective action in real time? If we were problem-solving not through marching-in-the-streets social activism that tries to compel power brokers to act against their own economic interests, but rather by tapping into humankind’s collective creativity to invent new social and economic patterns that incentivize everyone to grow the whole?</p><p>What we’re talking about here is a quantum leap in coordinative capacity that doesn’t actually require a vast leap in technological capacity, at least not in the ‘high-tech’ sense. It’s more like the arising of language than advancements in nuclear fusion or space travel. Sure, there’s complexity in building an unenclosable framework for decentralized software applications, but the leap is mainly about arranging building blocks into new, more eloquent, more sustainable forms.</p><p>The fundamental technology needed, therefore, is a coordinative technology, one that facilitates the mashing up and remixing of components quickly and with as few barriers as possible. We need an efficient, tamper-proof, and resilient carrier for social DNA.</p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unleashing-the-power-of-unenclosable-carriers-and-how-holochain-can-help/">next and final article in this series</a>, we look at how Holochain is designed to be just such a technology.</p><p><br></p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">first</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">second</a> articles in this series explored the nature of unenclosable carriers and their potential to underpin an unprecedented explosion of human creativity and social flourishing. We suggest starting there if you haven’t already.</p><p>This final installment delves into the unenclosable carrier Holochain specifically, including what makes it unenclosable and how it can be used.</p><p>(One thing this article doesn’t provide is much of a comparison between Holochain and blockchain technology; we wrote <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">another piece</a> to serve that purpose.)</p><p>Let’s get right to it.</p> What Holochain Is <p>Holochain is an open-source, unenclosable framework that enables hosting of peer-to-peer applications without any centralized or consensus-based infrastructure. It provides a way of ensuring the integrity and accuracy of data in a network while also enabling every user to host and represent their own data. Rather than having actions validated and information verified by centralized entities (as in internet apps) or <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/blockchain-blind-spots-1904d490218d">global consensus mechanisms</a> (as in blockchain apps) — both of which are enclosable and result in power imbalances (see <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Part 1</a>) — actions and data within Holochain apps are validated entirely peer-to-peer.</p>  By “framework”, we mean a database for storing, organizing, and finding data that is spread across many computers, so that no one has to hold a lot of data. In Holochain apps there can be data that remains local to one’s own computer, on what’s called a Source Chain, and there can be data that is shared across many computers, on what’s called a Distributed Hash Table (DHT).  By “peer-to-peer applications”, we mean a version of decentralized applications (dApps) that are hosted entirely by the participants in the app, rather than by a central company. (Holochain applications are sometimes called hApps.) There are no limits to the kinds of apps that might be built on Holochain, other than that they have to involve two or more parties communicating or transacting. Apps for social networking, currency systems, ride-sharing, travel booking, buying and selling, team coordination, collective decision-making, chat, weather, and news applications are all possible. Most ways that you currently interact digitally with people or businesses, as well as many ways you might imagine doing so, can be built on Holochain and can probably be enhanced by unenclosability.  By “data integrity”, we mean the assurance that data cannot be tampered with once it has been created, including by anyone storing data about themselves on their own Source Chain. For example, if you have 100 currency units and you spend 50, it has integrity for you to represent to the network that you have 50 units remaining; it would not have integrity for you to be able to represent that you still have 100. Similarly, it would not have integrity if you could display a 5-star user rating when the average of your ratings is actually 3 stars. Holochain provides a way of cryptographically ensuring that if you misrepresent any data, such as your account balance or reputation score, it will be obvious, and your communication or transaction will be flagged and rejected by the peer-based validation mechanisms.  <p>Each Holochain app is a collaborative platform within which users host themselves and also provide just a little extra computing power and storage so that extra copies of data are always online and agreements are mutually validated and enforced.</p> What Makes Holochain Unenclosable <p>Holochain is agent-centric. Holochain enables individual choice over just about everything, including which applications and networks to participate in, your identity and address within those networks, and what information you expose to other participants. And you always store and own your own data, taking it with you as you move between applications, which is not possible with internet search engines, social networks, or shopping sites — or even blockchain apps.</p><p>Holochain enables direct interaction. With Holochain, you act truly peer-to-peer, free from intermediaries except those you freely choose. You and your actions write directly to the ledger of events, and you share only share with the network what you have agreed to share according to the terms of whichever apps you have freely chosen to participate in. You represent yourself, rather than being subject to representation by central authorities like legislators, miners, stakers, or even internet service providers.</p><p>Direct interaction also means that Holochain functions on any network. It can operate through the internet (TCP/IP) but doesn’t require it; apps can just as easily operate on mesh networks or even local area networks, Bluetooth networks, or any other means of communicating data among peers. Even when offline from the larger network of app users, a subgroup of connected peers can run the app with full functionality among themselves (since everyone hosts a copy of the core application code) and synchronize their changes with the network later.</p><p>Holochain enables groups of any size, whether 2 people or 2 billion people, to operate on a shared set of agreements. Most blockchains have problems at the low end, requiring hundreds if not thousands of players before there is enough of a distributed consensus mechanism to prevent attacks by a majority of nodes. And so far, blockchain-based dApps (decentralized applications) haven’t demonstrated much of an ability to scale beyond <a href="https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings">a few thousand active users</a>, suggesting they may have problems at the high end too. For a carrier to be unenclosable, it’s important that any number of people can interact and mutually enforce the integrity of the space they’re participating in.</p><p>Holochain is free to use. Since all users host themselves on Holochain, there is no need for costly central hosting infrastructure as there is in web apps, nor any need to pay tax-like ‘gas’ fees to miners or stakers to run the network as there is in blockchain apps. Each peer carries a bit of extra load to store and validate a portion of the information that’s distributed to the group. Any fees that occur in Holochain apps are chosen and mutually enforced by those freely participating within a given app space, with no revenues skimmed by the network.</p><p>(Holochain is not to be confused with Holo, which is an optional, peer-to-peer hosting framework that enables users who are not hosting themselves to access Holochain apps through a web browser.)</p>Virtually all of today’s web and blockchain apps could be improved in some way by shifting to unenclosability and peer-to-peer infrastructure. What You Can Do with It <p>In <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2</a>, we imagined how applications built on an unenclosable carrier like Holochain could have game-changing effects on our food supply, energy infrastructure, financial systems, and natural ecosystems. But virtually all of today’s web and blockchain apps could be improved in some way by shifting to unenclosability and peer-to-peer infrastructure.</p><p>Consider:</p>  An agent-centric social network, intrinsically proofed against centralized surveillance and the selling of data to advertisers, with content-ranking algorithms that serve the common good – or your own individual preferences – not the interests of an enclosing corporation.  A self-hosted community chat, similar to WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, where freedom-of-speech policies can be implemented by the communities themselves according to mutually-agreed rulesets, not imposed by a centrally controlled software company that is subject to all sorts of economic and political pressures.  A self-hosted team chat, similar to Slack, that doesn’t share your data with a corporate entity, works asynchronously and can be used offline, and operates without infrastructure costs. (<a href="https://elemental-chat.holo.host/">Elemental Chat</a> is currently live as a proof-of-concept.)  A rideshare system, similar to Uber and Lyft, that eliminates most of the hosting costs and corporate overhead that is currently paid by riders and drivers. Rideshare networks could even be owned collectively by drivers, with relatively small fees paid to a software provider that could serve hundreds or thousands of driver collectives. Rides could become more affordable even as drivers are paid more. And bonus: rider locations would never be visible to a corporate entity.  A knowledge base like Wikipedia that is collectively held by the people who use it.  A media-sharing platform like Spotify or YouTube that could reinvent revenue-sharing models from the ground up, without the layers of royalties paid to ‘distributors’. For example, what if subscribers of a given artist actually participated in hosting music for others to stream, with those gains being partly retained by the artists and partly cycled back to the fans as rewards in some form or other?  A document-editing system similar to Google Docs that is truly private, not vulnerable to observation by anyone who might gain (or already have) access to Google’s centralized databases.  A system for peer-reviewing scientific articles that could replace expensive scholarly journals while promoting more diversity of thought.  A tamper-proof election system: an immutable, crypto-signed voting system in which any voter is able to verify that their vote was accurately included.  <p>Or imagine (or build upon!) these more innovative possibilities:</p>  A location-sharing app (like a <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Weasley_Clock">Weasley clock</a>, for Harry Potter fans), where your information is shared only with family and friends you choose, not exposed to companies or governments.  A medical data repository where you are in charge of your data and can grant access to providers – and to trusted family members – so that they are able to provide information in cases of emergency.  A neutral layer for sense-making that sits atop the web, enabling people to associate into networks and then comment on, share, and discuss the information they find online.  A simplified supply-chain system: Cross-organizational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources,_events,_agents_(accounting_model)">REA accounting</a> where digitally signed payments become the accounting entry for both parties in their ledger history. An immutable, easily-auditable, self-populating accounting framework that streamlines compliance with contracts and regulations.  <p>(By the way, in case you’re wondering whether blockchain technology could support some of the same ideas: probably not most of them, due to its <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">limitations around speed and cost of storage</a>.)</p><p>And building on Holochain doesn’t mean sacrificing profitability. You can't make money by controlling data, but there are lots of other ways of earning a profit. In fact, most Web-2.0 revenue models still work for Holochain apps, including:<br>- ‘Software as a subscription’ (Saas), with or without a free trial<br>- ‘Freemium’ in which a free version remains functional while subscribers get upgraded features<br>- Service fees, like on Airbnb or Uber<br>- Fees for hosting data, like on Dropbox or Gmail<br>- Sponsorships from service providers relevant to the audience<br>- Promoted listings by item sellers or service providers, like on Amazon and eBay<br>- Donations, like on Wikipedia</p><p>The only Web-2.0 model that doesn’t work, really, is the one that many people today find the most distasteful: surveillance-driven advertising, in which a company collects personal information or tracks user activity, then uses that information to either sell targeted advertising on its platform or straight-up sell the data to advertisers.</p><p>So, what’s different about a Holochain-based social network versus Facebook or Instagram isn’t that the Holochain version is more philanthropic; it’s (1) the choice that people have in how to interact with one another and with the application, (2) the ownership and authorship that people retain over their own data, and (3) the decreased infrastructural costs because the load of running the software and hosting the data is spread across the user base.</p><p>Of course, for people that do want to create hApps just for the common good and not for profit, Holochain makes that easier because the infrastructure costs are so low. Maybe you want to set up a reputation-enabled child-care directory because you want easier, safer access to reliable babysitters and nannies in your neighborhood, not because you want to make money. You can do that without needing to configure, manage, or pay for servers, plus Holochain’s developer tools simplify app development (more on those in a bit). Then if your application happens to become a big success, it can scale on Holochain without adding cost, and you could choose to adopt a business model at that time.</p> Why All of This Matters (a Recap) <p>Today, a single person’s message can reach billions of people in seconds. This phenomenon, which would have been unfathomable to prehistoric humans, exists thanks to a progression of carrier technologies that have emerged over thousands of years, including written records, the printing press, sound amplification and recording, radio, television, film and, more recently, the internet, email, and social media. These developments have unleashed tremendous human coordination, but, as a side effect, we have surrendered covert power to those who control the carriers, enabling them to decide what gets transmitted and how we interact with each other.</p><p>Our mainstream monetary systems are examples of carrier enclosure, too, since they empower governments and financial institutions to say what counts as legitimate currency and trade, as well as to make fiscal policies that affect the behavior of our currencies. Blockchain technology commendably turns over the job of legitimizing transactions to a ‘decentralized’ consensus network, but it still converges to the same side effect, simply replacing governments and corporations with people who control computing power and cryptotokens. A system that is unenclosable is not just decentralized; it cannot ever be centralized.</p><p>Over the centuries, the power and wealth differentials have become so extreme that instead of a level economic playing field we have a steep mountainside that most people aren’t able to climb. (We explored some of these imbalances and their consequences in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2 of this series</a>.) When disproportionately powerful people (understandably) act in their own interest, it often comes at the expense of the greater good. This is why many of humanity’s greatest challenges — rainforest destruction, pollution and climate instability, food supply degradation, the looming energy crisis, and so on — won’t be solved at the levels of policy or diplomacy, but only by shifting the underlying architectures that determine how wealth and power are allocated and how people are incentivized to act.</p><p>The good news is that such a shift is technologically possible in ways it hasn’t been before. Suddenly, at the outset of the 2020s and for the first time in history, we are now able to build communication and transaction systems that let us have it both ways: capacity for massive scale and freedom from the power distortions of enclosability. What is available, and what we must undertake, is a proliferation of new forms of social organizing so expansive that it deserves to be named analogously to the Cambrian Explosion of new biological organisms. We call it the Holocene Explosion, after the current geological epoch.</p><p>Designed as a carrier for this Explosion, Holochain preserves individual sovereignty by giving all agents the power to represent themselves in all interactions, and to voluntarily enter (or not) into spaces where mutually agreed-upon rules are mutually enforced. If someone comes to have broader influence than someone else, it’s not because of carrier control, but because that person has gained capabilities according to rules voluntarily opted-into by the people participating in that app space. If anyone doesn’t like the rules of a given space, they are free to leave and join or start another, and since they own their data, they can take it with them.</p> Holochain is the spark. You are the flame. <p>It’s come time to close out this series, and we’ve considered a number of ways of doing so. What haven’t we said, we asked ourselves, that still ought to be said?</p><p>We considered getting into how scalable Holochain apps are – how easily they can accommodate millions or billions of users because everyone shares in the work of writing and storing data. Or how fast they are – how they enable virtually-real-time interaction. These are actually key reasons, beyond unenclosability, that Holochain may be more suitable than blockchain for real-world collaborative applications. But we covered these topics in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">Holochain-blockchain comparison</a> we published recently, so you can go there if you want to learn more about them.</p><p>We also considered talking about how a truly unenclosable, peer-to-peer future implies a truly peer-to-peer internet, completely replacing the existing one. But this seems like a story for another time.</p><p>We have said – but it's probably worth reiterating – that we can only speculate about what new social forms will emerge through the Holocene Explosion (see <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2</a>). We’ve also said, or at least implied, that Holochain’s architects don’t claim to fully know how it will be used in the future: the idea in designing it was not to build a whole bunch of new social patterns, but rather to build a framework for new social patterns. This means that the list of possible Holochain apps we shared earlier is truly partial; it’s likely that the most profound and transformative uses for the framework will only emerge over time. (Even within the apps we listed earlier, the most transformative features are TBD: novel incentive systems, governance systems, currency designs, and so on, yet to be invented.)</p><p>We have also said that what makes Holochain so suitable for rapid evolution is its unenclosable nature: Holochain is peer-to-peer, agent-centric, free to use, and able to operate on any transport protocol (even without the existing internet). From <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Part 1 of this series</a>: “With free association and forkability in place, an evolutionary phenomenon emerges: the spaces themselves, each with their own patterns and protocols, enter into a process of natural selection. The ones that solve problems better or serve people better will gain greater adoption, while the ones that don’t do as good a job will die off.”</p><p>If there’s one more aspect of Holochain worth mentioning, it might be how Holochain the project (distinct from Holochain the framework) is building an ecosystem to foster experimentation and iteration. Creating a truly optimized evolutionary space isn’t just a matter of building the right core technology; it’s a matter of making that technology as easy to utilize as possible. To that end, Holochain the project is creating:</p>  Dev tools: A suite of developer tools designed to make it easy to build with Holochain, including a “RAD” (Rapid Application Development) suite that streamlines common functions into essentially drag-and-drop actions.  A DevHub: a Holochain application that functions like a decentralized Github for sharing developer resources: modules, applications, and user-interface components. Developers can draw from these resources to mash up new apps from existing elements, and to collaborate on and review code.  A hApp Store: a Holochain application where people can browse or search for Holochain apps, complete with end-user ratings and reviews.  <p>Lowering the barrier to development increases Holochain’s composability, which means how easy it is to mix and match elements – with one another, as well as with whatever outside elements that the technology needs to interact with. Composability also encompasses cost-efficiency of new application development and making updates to existing software.</p><p>(Fixing a bug or making an update is a particular challenge in blockchain-based dApps, where the smart contracts are immutable once live – and already have assets connected to them! It’s notoriously nerve-wracking for blockchain devs to push to mainnet because there’s no way to revise live code the way there is in centralized apps.)</p><p>The lower the cost and risk of change, the more participation in creating change, and the faster the change. And rapid change is what we need to keep up with the pace of change in the world, and to address the problems we’re facing on the timeline we need to address them.</p> A Complex Technology for a Complex World <p>In one sense, Holochain is quite a simple piece of software: it’s a lightweight framework that allows people to create and share data in a way that ensures accuracy without relying on concentrated power-brokers. It’s not an application layer in and of itself, and it’s highly neutral as to the kinds of applications that are built with it. And it’s unburdened by many of the complications of web2 (where data is subject to centralized control, surveillance, censorship, and points of failure) or early web3 (where global consensus mechanisms and massive data replication result in high computing costs and slow processing).</p><p>In another sense, though, Holochain is highly complex: there’s actually a lot of technology that goes into ensuring data integrity without centralized components. This is partly because Holochain is a networking system, and any networking system has to deal with many ‘states’ of data (across many computers) by either updating them all together or otherwise integrating them with one another. But it’s also because Holochain doesn’t force the network into a universally shared state (which would result in enclosure points) but rather enables massive simultaneity of perspectives. Everyone in a Holochain application space represents their own record, yet all the records remain tamper-proof. If that sounds like a complex challenge, you’re on the right track. It’s no wonder Holochain has only recently become ready for prime time, after years of work.</p><p>And yet, nothing less complex would map to the problem space Holochain is designed to address. Global challenges are interrelated and multi-faceted in their causes and effects, so they require interrelated and multi-faceted solutions. You can’t solve the energy crisis, pollution, deforestation, or hunger with centralized systems – or, as it turns out, with blockchain tokenization – any more than you can fix a meadow with a hammer. Matters have gotten out of hand precisely because we have been force-fitting living systems through power-entrenching enclosure points for centuries.</p><p>What is required is a radical, widespread shift away from extractive economics and toward regenerative economics, yet the power imbalances we’ve created over time perpetuate the cycle of extractive power. This is why we maintain that Holochain or something like it is a necessary foundation for saving the world.</p><p>The technological capacity to have built Holochain, and now Holochain itself, have come along not a moment too soon. Now we just need to put it to work.</p>

<p>All communication relies on one or more carriers. At the most basic level, when you’re speaking to a group of people in a room, the air is the carrier for the sound waves moving through it. You pass air through your vocal chords and shape your mouth in funny ways, and a bunch of compression waves emerge and fill the room with information that others then decode. No one can just grab the words out of the air to stop them from reaching someone else. The carrier is unenclosable.</p><p>For the sake of contrast, let’s say your boss puts out a suggestion box, in order to give you and your fellow employees the opportunity to make a difference in the workplace. Sounds nice, right? And yet, the box is enclosed; there’s no way to see how many suggestions have been made, or which ones have been discarded before even reaching the people who could implement them. The system includes a filtering mechanism that allocates some degree of control to whoever is in charge of the box. And isn’t the suggestion box system designed, in part, to enable that layer of control? If they didn’t want the ability to filter, they might have just invited suggestions openly during a meeting with everyone present.</p> A Brief History of Communication <p>Before modern technology, or really before the development of written language, communication was generally transmitted by unenclosable carrier. Oral traditions were the norm in prehistoric times, and they are preserved today in indigenous cultures around the world — cultures we often respect for their ways of reaching alignment quickly, resolving tensions directly, and treating their members with honor. (Consider our postmodern fascination with the talking stick and council of elders.) This social wisdom is surely related to the unenclosable medium of communication they used.</p><p>The point at which direct oral communication reaches its limits is the point at which it becomes important to communicate at scale, across distance or time. Want to rally a crowd? You’ll need amplification. Want to coordinate troops in the field? You’ll need some form of written communication. Want to operate a nation or empire? You’ll need carriers of all different sorts: messengers, letters, telegraphs, whatever.</p><p>And yet, all of the carriers we have successfully used to extend the reach of communication have also introduced more potential for enclosure, which in turn has led to power imbalances. Writing gave rise to the literate class, the clerical class, who by virtue of privilege or position suddenly had outsize power, with access to libraries and information and the ability to make deals or even laws that others couldn’t understand without the help of the literate. The printing press gave rise to the editors, publishers, and booksellers who determined which books were published or promoted. Broadcast media gave rise to the media empires who could then influence what was broadcast. The ability to control the carrier results in the ability to control the message.</p> Covert and Overt Control <p>What’s actually true about oral cultures is not that control over messaging is impossible, but rather that the available control mechanisms are more overt. You can stop someone from speaking up around a fire if you physically attack them or try to shout over them. But then everyone knows you’re doing that, which means that your actions are subject to whatever social feedback mechanisms exist to temper abuses of power. So, really, what carrier enclosure gives rise to is covert power. The manager filtering the suggestion box; the allocation of FM bandwidth to someone over someone else; the private understandings between interest groups and politicians.</p>Really, what carrier enclosure gives rise to is covert power. Awash in Enclosable Carriers <p>As the speed and scale of communication has increased, so have the layers of enclosable carriers on which our communication relies. In newsprint and on television, it’s the advertisers, as well as executives who are bound to the interests of boards and shareholders, who exert (largely unseen) control over the content we receive. Our phone lines are subject to a variety of costs, controls, and oversights that we don’t have much of a choice about. Even getting on a plane (or flying one’s own) to a distant land — which is another way to communicate across distances — is highly constrained by licenses, airspaces, borders, passports, airport fees, and so on.</p><p>And of course we have the internet, which has given us a taste of radical participation and democratized access to information, but whose filters on access and information have begun to cause increasing alarm. There are centralized entities controlling the allocation of web addresses, domain names, and root servers. ISPs have the ability to block access to the internet altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and the like decide what content is inappropriate, and, perhaps more importantly, what content appears in your feeds. Amazon determines which products you can use the convenience of its site to buy, as well as which to promote. And, of course, Google steers you to some web sites over others, according to its secret algorithms.</p><p>Our ability to coordinate activity at scale has never been greater, but that coordination is also subject to centralized control and corruption like never before — and really to an unknown degree, because it is largely covert. Do we have any way of knowing the extent of Russian influence on recent U.S. elections? We don’t. We also don’t know the degree to which our ‘real’ news is adulterated and filtered, which is part of what makes fake news such an intractable problem: when all news is vulnerable to corruption to some degree, it’s hard to tell the difference between legitimate and falsified sources.</p><p>If we want to move into an era of intelligent, mutually beneficial, worldwide coordination, we will have to address the problem of communication enclosures. But first, a word about money.</p> The Enclosability of Money <p>Monetary systems are special cases when it comes to enclosability and covert control. We all have the capacity to produce value, but we have allowed our exchange of value to be mediated through money, which we’re not allowed to produce. (If we do, it’s called counterfeiting.) The few who are allowed to issue money use that privilege to constrain our participation in the marketplace.</p><p>In principle, a financial transaction could be as simple as two people exchanging value through a direct agreement, but in our world of enclosable carriers, transactions are controlled by many third parties that we don’t get to choose.</p><p>By way of example, let’s look at transacting through PayPal, which claims to offer peer-to-peer payments to ‘anyone with an email address’. But if you want to pay your friend for something, you’re subject to many layers of control you cannot opt out of:</p>  You must connect to the internet via a semi-monopoly of telcos/ISPs.  The connection must supply an IP address, which is under the control of ICANN, the international body that delegates ranges of addresses to specific licensees of their choosing.  You need to establish an HTTPS connection, which requires certificates issued by a root authority.  Your email must be routed to and stored on an email server, which is typically not under your control.  The email address uses a domain name, which is subject to central control via ICANN, domain registrars, root servers, and nameservers.  You must go through the PayPal app or website, which is under their corporate control (as well as all the aforementioned domain handlers and routers).  Your PayPal account must be active and in good standing, at their discretion.  You transact in a currency, whether dollars, euros, or yen, that is fundamentally out of your control. Governments can freeze accounts, limit international transactions, and garnish wages, not to mention influence the money supply in ways that affect what your currency is worth.  You use a central payment source, such as a bank or credit card, that can reverse transactions, charge fees, block access, and close accounts.  <p>Does that sound like peers interacting directly with each other? Or does it sound like a bunch of people got invited to your party who you’d have preferred to leave out of the mix?</p> But What About My Favorite Blockchain Project? <p>And so we come to the blockchain and, more broadly, the whole decentralization movement. If you’re a participant in this ecosystem, you might be thinking that blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications, at least the ‘best’ ones, are precisely the antidote to the problem of carrier enclosability.</p><p>It’s true that blockchain applications have, in many cases at least, offered an exciting means of collaborating outside the reach of outsized government and corporate middlemen. But how unenclosable are they really? Blockchain protocols all rely on some mechanism of global consensus to determine which transactions are considered legitimate enough to be added to the shared record. This means that many nodes – computers on a given network – must agree with one another before officially adopting any information, then storing it as a global state, meaning that all nodes hold all the same data. It’s an understandable approach: replicating data globally might seem like the only way to coordinate at scale without being subject to centralized authority or being susceptible to data-tampering.</p><p>One problem with this approach, though, is that global consensus mechanisms turn out to be a form of carrier enclosure, since they necessarily give power to some people over others to determine the legitimacy of transactions. Ordinary users like you and me do not write directly to the blockchain, nor do we participate in the consensus mechanism that results in data being written to the blockchain. We defer to miners and stakers do those things on our behalf, and in doing so we turn over our authority to them to say what’s written to the record.</p><p>What’s more, not all miners and stakers have equal power. In proof-of-work (PoW) protocols, those who own more computing resources have more say. In proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, which have become more popular in recent years, those who put up more money as betting stakes have more say. The more computing resources or the more betting stakes you own, the more money you make, which earns you the ability to buy more of those things. Thus, both protocols have a rich-get-richer effect and converge toward greater and greater consolidation of wealth and power over time.</p><p>Even more carrier enclosure has resulted from blockchain’s attempts to solve its efficiency problems. It turns out that achieving global consensus and managing global state require a tremendous amount of processing power and storage capacity, resulting in wait times and fees for every transaction, as well as <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">posing an obstacle to blockchain’s ability to scale to the needs of real-world challenges</a>. Blockchains and blockchain-related projects have tried to address these issues in various ways: so-called ‘layer-1’ solutions attempt to increase the efficiency of global consensus, generally by concentrating authority to some nodes more than others in determining the global state (EOS has 21 ‘block producers’, Cardano has ‘slot leaders’ and ‘pool representatives’, and TRON has 27 ‘super representatives’), while ‘layer-2’ solutions perform computations or store data off-chain on more centralized networks or more concentrated ‘side chains’, then periodically merge records into the blockchain. Both layer-1 and layer-2 solutions channel control through an increasingly narrow club of authorized representatives who are empowered to accept (or refuse) our transaction.</p><p>And real communication enclosures can happen and have happened in blockchain projects. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">Ethereum hard fork in 2016</a>, right-minded as it may have been, was a means of invalidating transactions that had occurred. EOS has also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-reverses-previously-confirmed-transactions-as-pundits-decry-centralization">reversed transactions</a>, as has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cash-miners-undo-attackers-transactions-with-51-attack">Bitcoin Cash</a>.</p><p>So, even though the very intention of many blockchain projects is to address intermediation and the centralization of power, they are actually subject to the same kinds of power imbalances we see in other mediums. It’s a tilted playing field, and even a slightly tilted playing field results in a <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/blockchain-blind-spots-1904d490218d">self-reinforcing feedback loop</a> that eventually leads to massive wealth imbalances – which is a fair narrative for what’s happened in economies around the world over the course of the last 500 years.</p><p>So we’re back to our original question: is it possible to have a system of communicating and transacting that 1) is truly unenclosable and 2) is capable of massive scale?</p> Having It Both Ways <p>In considering how a communication system might be both unenclosable and scalable, let’s look at the evolution of language itself. How does language arise? Who gets to change the rules of language? We do. Any one of us can create a new word, turn of phrase, or other language pattern that may or may not spread based upon whether others freely adopt it. If it spreads far enough, it becomes part of a language. There is no central committee that determines what you can say or not, or what gets adopted or not.</p>A new ecosystem of communication might look something like the spaces of language itself.<p>So, a new ecosystem of communication might look something like the spaces of language itself. We can imagine a scenario in which anyone can spin up new protocols for interacting — protocols that can be voluntarily adopted by those who choose to participate in them. Anyone is free to transfer the rulesets of any given space into another space, just as anyone is free to populate an uninhabited island, start speaking any particular language there, and invent new words.</p><p>This does not mean an absence of rules. Protocols are essential within any given space for filtering signal from noise, and to avoid the gaming of that space. People need to be free to create any kind of space on the network, but that doesn’t mean that all the activities within voluntarily joined spaces must also be unrestricted. To continue with our analogy: maybe on a certain island there’s a protocol that new residents introduce themselves at a weekly meeting, or post a bio on a bulletin board or profile page. Maybe there’s a social norm not to interrupt one another at certain meetings, and there might be corrective protocols activated if someone repeatedly violates that norm. Notice, though, that these rulesets only pertain to the particular scope of this island (which people can choose to join or not), rather than being built into the language itself or governing migration among islands in general.</p><p>So, one key ingredient in making any system fundamentally unenclosable is free association: the ability for anyone to create segmented spaces that people can join or not, with rulesets that are particular to those spaces. An unenclosable version of Wikipedia would be free of the centralized servers that host the data today, but it would still have protocols that say how articles are written. An unenclosable version of Twitter would still have a character limit. It wouldn’t make sense for someone to be able to post a tweet on Wikipedia or an encyclopedic article on Twitter. Within the scope of each app, people are free to express themselves according to the parameters they opted into when joining the app.</p><p>Many apps will even need to have centralized aspects of control, such as moderation by individuals or groups. But if the underlying carrier system is unenclosable, everyone owns and controls their own data (versus having it held in centralized or third-party enclosure points), so everyone always has the option of leaving the application space for any reason, including if they don’t like some new rule or the way the space is being moderated.</p><p>Which leads us to another fundamental aspect of an unenclosable system: forkability, which is the freedom for anyone to spin up alternative application spaces, based on the same (or similar) source codes and rulesets, and invite people to the new version. For true forkability, users need to be able to migrate easily between versions, taking their data from one version — such as their complete activity history on a social network or search engine — and load it into the new version. This is, of course, very much not the case with the likes of today’s Facebook and Google, who own and control your data, making only a fraction of it available to you.</p> A Natural Selection <p>With free association and forkability in place, an evolutionary phenomenon emerges: the spaces themselves, each with their own patterns and protocols, enter into a process of natural selection. The ones that solve problems better or serve people better will gain greater adoption, while the ones that don’t do as good a job will die off. To return to the island analogy again: if people can move freely between islands, bringing language patterns from one to the other, the dialects that are most suitable to people’s needs will be the ones that thrive and spread.</p>With free association and forkability in place, an evolutionary phenomenon emerges. Holochain Is Unenclosable by Design <p>Holochain is designed to foster this kind of evolution. It’s a framework for building and running applications in a truly peer-to-peer way, with zero centralized infrastructure and therefore no vulnerability to corruption over time. Wealth and influence can still flow within the application spaces according to patterns mutually agreed to within those spaces: reputation systems, ownership systems, subscriptions, sales, badges, degrees, or whatever else makes sense for the nature of the application. But no one can gain influence by simply controlling the medium of communication itself. The work of holding and transferring the data is distributed among the regular participants within the application, with everyone hosting their own data and sharing a bit of the load of hosting the data published to the network. Same thing with the work of validating data, such as verifying account balances or making sure posts conform to formatting rules: that job is also spread equally among the regular participants within the application.</p><p>And in case you don’t like the rulesets of a given application space, Holochain guarantees, through a combination of technical and legal provisions, that you can spin up alternatives and take your data with you between applications.</p><p>(We get deeper into how Holochain works in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unleashing-the-power-of-unenclosable-carriers-and-how-holochain-can-help/">Part 3 of this series</a>.)</p> The Future of Communication	 <p>What becomes possible in a world of unenclosable carriers isn’t just better versions of Twitter or Wikipedia. It’s an explosion of entirely new ways of collaborating and transacting whose forms we can only begin to guess at. What might be possible if we didn’t have corporations, governments, or surveillance systems in the middle of our communication? Could a system of unenclosable carriers help us solve some of humanity’s most intractable problems? We turn to this very question in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-the-world/">Part 2 of this series</a>.</p>

At GlobaliD, we see DeFi as a core pillar to the future of web3 with the potential to democratize finance.</p><p>That massive growth has also shone a light on issues such as fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing.</p><p>Money laundering spiked 30 percent in 2021, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">according to Chainalysis</a>, with DeFi protocols receiving $900 million from illicit addresses.</p><p>DeFi projects typically rely on non-custodial wallets that aren’t tied to an identity and forgo KYC (know your customer) protocols altogether. Part of the issue is that relying on traditional identity frameworks undermines the decentralized vision for DeFi. Ignoring those procedures has driven DeFi’s frenetic growth, but it’s also attracting increasing attention from regulators.</p><p>SEC chief Gary Gensler has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">stated on more than one occasion</a> that projects are still required to follow relevant regulations — no matter how “decentralized” they&nbsp;are.</p><p>Allowing any unidentified wallet to connect to and participate with the platform also opens DeFi projects up to bot attacks and bad&nbsp;actors.</p><p>This is where the natural symbiosis between decentralized finance and decentralized identity comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>GlobaliD’s self-sovereign identity solution allows DeFi projects to address their identity needs while maintaining the decentralized spirit of their&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Meanwhile, DeFi users used to being anonymous or pseudonymous can rest easy knowing that they control their digital identity, and that no one — including GlobaliD — can access their encrypted data without their permission.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/why-self-sovereign-identity-matters-8fd2c982ca2e">Why self-sovereign identity&nbsp;matters</a>  <p>From the XDC Network press&nbsp;release:</p><blockquote>As Layer 1 networks, like XDC Network, continue to roll out mainstream solutions, there is an increasing need for users to be able to bridge identity with on-chain solutions for fast and secure verification. This is where the GlobaliD integration can address today’s identification challenges by providing self-sovereign ID (SSI) for passwordless login to XDC Network’s leading dApps, protecting users from bots, scams, and bad actors. By combining GlobaliD’s reliable, trusted SSI with the XDC Network’s array of decentralized finance (DeFi) and dApps services, users now have a more safe and secure way to access XDC’s growing web3 ecosystem with a pathway for regulatory compliance.</blockquote><p>And here’s Billy Sebell, Head of Ecosystem Development for the XDC&nbsp;Network:</p><blockquote>As Web3 matures, enabling users to roam across networks without constant identification holdups is going to be crucial. Mainstream users shouldn’t have to understand the complexities of safe IDs and network bridging — nor should they bear the responsibility of complex identity management. Integrating GlobaliD with our new XDC Observatory creates the foundation for a streamlined user experience and represents a big step forward towards chain interoperability</blockquote><p>GlobaliD users will also have access to a brand new feature called the XDC Observatory, a block explorer that enhances data management and accessibility on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>This integration with XDC Network and DeFi is just the beginning at GlobaliD. We’re looking forward to working on a slew of upcoming applications of self-sovereign identity for financial tools, NFTs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Given web3’s nascent state, we believe these partnerships are the key to building a web3 ecosystem that stays true to our values while building bridges to the rest of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>If your DeFi project is looking to incorporate decentralized identity, we encourage you to reach out to us: <a href="mailto:info@global.id">info@global.id</a></p><p>See also:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/trusted-airdrops-with-globalid-cf7cd6b51797">Trusted Airdrops with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-globalid-enhances-trust-for-xrpl-labs-xumm-wallet-d397cc836cf7">How GlobaliD enhances trust for XRPL Labs’ XUMM&nbsp;Wallet</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/defi-enabled-xdc-network-integrates-globalid-8eddac93fbc">DeFi-enabled XDC Network integrates GlobaliD</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#198 — How stablecoins break the monetary&nbsp;system <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-197-how-solana-makes-web3-possible-24a8acc23a96">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  How stablecoins break the monetary&nbsp;system  When regulators get it&nbsp;right  9 things you need to know about&nbsp;web3  This week in&nbsp;Solana  Tweet of the week — Wormhole&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. How stablecoins break the monetary&nbsp;system Image: Sefa&nbsp;Ozel<p>When people think of money printing, they typically think of central banks like the Federal&nbsp;Reserve.</p><p>But outside of extreme circumstances such as quantitative easing in response to once in a generation disasters like the financial crisis in 2008 and the recent global pandemic, the Fed has historically outsourced the creation of money to&nbsp;banks.</p><p>Which makes sense. Banks have branches and customers. They have closer ties to the community. Banks are better positioned to understand where new money should&nbsp;go.</p><p>It’s a way to decentralize money creation.</p><p>That new money is created through a process called fractional reserve banking, which is really just a fancy term for how really boring banking works. Banks take in deposits. They also lend money. The amount of money they lend is greater than the number of deposits they take in — hence, their reserves are only a fraction of their&nbsp;lending.</p><p>When banks lend out more money than they have, they’re essentially creating new money out of thin&nbsp;air.</p><p>The Fed is generally happy with this system. It’s also why they’re worried about stablecoins. Unlike fractional reserve banking, many stablecoins are set up with 1-to-1 reserves. That’s not an issue in and of itself — some people prefer their coins to be&nbsp;stable.</p><p>The problem is the potential impact on the rest of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-02-01/hedge-funds-are-a-job-now">Matt Levine</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a>):</p><blockquote>A less obvious risk of stablecoins is that they might be too stable. A stablecoin is, among other things, a substitute for putting money in a bank. Banks are generally very safe places to put money, but they are not perfectly safe. There can be runs on banks; banks can fail. For most U.S. retail bank accounts this is not a very salient problem, since they are backed by government deposit insurance, but many large institutional pools of money (corporate cash accounts, money-market funds, etc.) park their money in short-term bank instruments and are sensitive to risk. If a bank gets riskier, it will lose deposits. And if a stablecoin is so stable that it is safer than a bank, then banks generally will lose deposits.</blockquote><blockquote>Why is this a risk? Well, banks do useful stuff. Classically, they take people’s deposits and lend them out to other people to start businesses and buy homes. The provision of credit by banks helps the economy grow. More to the point, the withdrawal of credit by banks hurts the economy, and the risk here is wrong-way. If people get nervous about banks and pull out all their money to put it in safer stablecoins, then (1) that will probably happen at a time when the economy is shaky and (2) that will definitely make the economy shakier. The bulk of the response to the 2008 financial crisis involved preventing runs on banks, because those would have made all of the problems of the crisis much&nbsp;worse.</blockquote><p>In other words, the existence of stablecoins could potentially exacerbate a retreat in money supply during economic downturns. It would also generally undermine the way modern money&nbsp;works.</p><p>Adding fuel to the fire are the returns being offered for stablecoins on certain platforms, which far exceeds what you’d get with a typical bank savings&nbsp;account.</p><p>(On the other hand, the world’s biggest stablecoin, Tether, doesn’t <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">appear all that&nbsp;stable</a>.)</p><p>Of course, none of these means that we should be writing off stablecoins. It just means there’s plenty to consider in the context of what this means for our monetary system going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>(The U.S. Senate will be looking at just that next week in <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/132540/us-senate-slates-hearing-on-stablecoins-for-february-15">a hearing scheduled to discuss stablecoins</a>.)</p><p>As Matt&nbsp;adds:</p><blockquote>I should say here that my sympathies are with the Fed researchers: I think that fractional reserve banking and credit intermediation are good, and accidentally getting rid of them would be bad. But I am also aware that lots of crypto people disagree; they got into crypto specifically because they are suspicious of the existing financial system and of fractional reserve banking.

Web3 is a reaction to social networks not keeping our data secure, and selling it for their own&nbsp;profit.  Web3 is a way for artists and creators to not only own what they produce on a platform, but the platform&nbsp;itself.  Web3 is a new patron model for the internet.  Web3 makes it easy to set up cooperative ownership and governance structures.

 As tensions mount with Russia, we examine the use of cryptocurrency by Ukrainian NGOs and volunteer groups to crowdfund war.&nbsp; Our analysis shows that hundreds of cryptoasset donations totalling several hundred thousand dollars have been made to these groups – increasing by over 900% in 2021.  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>[Updated 10/2/2022, to reflect additional information provided by the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance.]</p> 
<p>Volunteer groups have played a critical role in the Ukraine conflict over the past decade. During the Maidan Revolution – which led to the ousting of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 – volunteer organizations emerged to support the protesters and assist the wounded. <br><br>Shortly afterwards, Russia seized Crimea and triggered a war in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. After decades of corruption and neglect, the Ukrainian military could not cope, and again volunteer groups stepped in. They provided soldiers, weapons and medical supplies to fill the gap.<br><br>These groups are funded by private donors, who have used bank wires and payment apps to donate millions of dollars. Bitcoin has also emerged as an important alternative funding method, allowing international donors to bypass financial institutions that are blocking payments to these groups.<br></p> 
  
 &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Elliptic has identified several cryptocurrency wallets used by these volunteer groups and NGOs, which have collectively received funds totalling just over $570,000 – much of it over the past year. Here, we examine some of these groups.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Come Back Alive  
<p>One of the largest organizations providing support to the Ukrainian army is <a href="https://savelife.in.ua/">Come Back Alive</a>. Founded in 2014, the group takes its name from the inscriptions on the bullet-proof vests that were its first donations to the army. The group now provides a range of military equipment, training services and medical supplies. It even funded the development of a drone-based <a href="http://gisarta.org/">reconnaissance and targeting system</a> for Ukrainian artillery units.</p> 
 
  &nbsp; 
  
  
 Ukrainian soldiers with equipment supplied by Come Back Alive 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Come Back Alive began accepting cryptoassets in 2018, and it has seen a recent surge in Bitcoin donations – with close to $200,000 received in the second half of 2021.</p>

 Ukrainian Cyber Alliance  
<p>Ukraine’s conflict with Russia extends into the cyber realm, and here too volunteer groups are active and funded through cryptocurrency donations.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://cyber.org.ua/">Ukrainian Cyber Alliance</a> is a collective of activists who have engaged in cyberattacks against Russian targets since 2016. The group's operations have reportedly included attacks on propaganda websites, the Russian Ministry of Defence and various individuals linked to Russia’s activities in Ukraine. Intelligence collected during these operations is reportedly <a href="https://www.5.ua/nauka/kibervoin-jeff-tse-persha-u-sviti-kiberviina-i-my-u-nii-voiuiucha-storona-video-137476.html">shared</a> with Ukrainian law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</p> 
<p>Unlike the other groups described here – which rely heavily on bank wires – the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance’s public fundraising relies exclusively on cryptoasset donations. In January 2020 the group requested donations through a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220209091318/https://m.facebook.com/UkrainianCyberAlliance/photos/a.1827960854182302/2395900657388316/?type=3&amp;source=54">post on Facebook</a>, with the title "Toss bitcoin to your hacker". Donations were requested to be sent to <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/19fMSv8ULjoBR7UNgNGuTrqoQmwiZEa63v">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://blockchair.com/ethereum/address/0x34b5593122bae35c54a066e93317cef214f4f224">Ethereum</a> and Litecoin addresses. These addresses have received transactions totalling close to $100,000.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian Cyber Alliance have stated that they have only received "$3,000-$4,000" in donations, and that the other transactions received by the addresses do not constitute donations to the group.</p> 
 
  &nbsp; 
  
  
 The Ukrainian Cyber Alliance has received close to $100,000 in Bitcoin donations over the past year. 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Cyber activists from outside of Ukraine have also been active in countering Russian aggression towards the country. The Belarussian hacktivist collective Cyber Partisans conducted an <a href="https://twitter.com/cpartisans/status/1485618881557315588">attack</a> against the Belarussian rail network in order to disrupt Russian troop movements to the Ukrainian border. This group also solicits donations – exclusively in Bitcoin. It has raised $84,000 in Bitcoin donations over the past six months.</p> 
 
  &nbsp; 
  
  
 The Cyber Partisans demand the removal of Russian troops from Belarus - following its cyber attack on the Belarussian rail network. Their Twitter profile also contains a Bitcoin donation address. 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Myrotvorets Center  
<p><a href="https://myrotvorets.center/">Myrotvorets Center</a> is a controversial, Kiev-based NGO with strong links to the Ukrainian government and law enforcement agencies. The Myrotvorets website publishes personal information about individuals considered to be “enemies of Ukraine”, including Russian “war criminals”, mercenaries, propagandists and journalists. In April 2015, a Ukrainian writer and a legislator were assassinated, just days after their home addresses were published on Myrotvorets.</p> 
 
  &nbsp; 
  
  
 The Myrotvorets website lists “pro-Russian terrorists, separatists, mercenaries, war criminals, and murderers”. (Identifying details obscured by Elliptic) 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Myrotvorets Center has accepted cryptoasset donations since 2016, and the group found particular success when fundraising for its “IDentigraf” project. IDentigraf is a facial recognition app, which allows users to identify “militants, Russian mercenaries and war criminals” listed in the Myrotvorets database – based on a photograph.</p> 
 
  &nbsp;

  &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Myrotvorets claims to have received donations from more than 40 countries, and appears to have enabled cryptoasset contributions after PayPal closed its account and seized the organization’s funds. To date, it has raised at least $268,000 through more than 100 Bitcoin donations.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Crypto Fundraising by Pro-Russia Separatists  
<p>By embracing cryptoasset fundraising, Ukrainian volunteer groups are actually emulating techniques previously employed by Russia since the very start of the Russo-Ukrainian War. A series of online campaigns <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/world/europe/russian-groups-crowdfund-the-war-in-ukraine.html">raised money</a> for Pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine, with donations channeled through Russian and overseas banks. These campaigns also accepted cryptoasset donations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For example the “Save the Donbass” campaign received at least 68 Bitcoin donations between 2014 and 2016.</p>

  &nbsp; 
  
 
  &nbsp; 
  
<p>Another campaign solicited Bitcoin donations for Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, a Russian army veteran and FSB officer who led a group of militants into Ukraine and participated in the Siege of Sloviansk. Dutch prosecutors later charged Girkin with murder, for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014.</p>

  &nbsp; 
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Cryptoassets: a Powerful, Emerging Tool for the Crowdfunding of War  
<p>For most of the fundraising campaigns examined in our investigation, cryptocurrencies represented a small proportion of the funds received. The majority of donations were received through traditional payment methods, such as bank wires and online payments services.</p> 
<p>However, cryptocurrency has proved to be a robust and increasingly popular alternative. In some cases, we found that financial institutions had closed accounts belonging to these fundraising campaigns - this cannot happen with a crypto wallet. Cryptocurrency is also particularly suited to cross-border donations, allowing easier access to wealthy overseas donors.</p> 
<p>Some of the Ukrainian volunteer groups and NGOs accepting crypto donations have very close links to the Ukrainian government - and this adds to a trend of nation states turning to cryptoassets as a means of raising funds. Iran is using Bitcoin mining as a way to <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/how-iran-uses-bitcoin-mining-to-evade-sanctions">monetise its energy reserves</a>,&nbsp; while North Korea is believed to be stealing cryptocurrency to support its missile development program.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>For anyone trying to keep up with “crypto” trends, good luck. Very often, articles and news around “crypto” lumps together everything that is futuristic about currency, investments and payments. As usual, the hype around new or trending concept leads to an overgeneralization of what that concept actually means. Organizations do need to decide what “crypto” means for their business, but they should be on their guard so as not to fall prey to a blind “crypto” craze. There is influence, risk, and legitimate business models to be found in the term “crypto”, but the first challenge is to understand it.</p>
 “Crypto” is a Misrepresentative Term 
<p>It’s first necessary to understand that “crypto” is a term that shouldn’t really be used to describe futuristic digital payments and currency systems. Its evolution is likely a short one, from cryptocurrency to cryptography. Cryptography, described at its simplest, is the mathematics of converting information into secrets. Cryptographic methods are used in some of the things that “crypto” tries to include: decentralized finance (DeFi), distributed ledger technology (DLT), cryptocurrencies (crypto), blockchain, Bitcoin, central bank digital currency (CBDC), and so on. Overall, “crypto” is an unsuccessful umbrella term for very different technological developments with very different risks, opportunities, and trajectories. A more suitable umbrella term for these terms could be Digital Currency, which has a wide enough definition to include the varying methods like cryptocurrency and stablecoins. The figure below lists a few of the terms most often lumped together under “crypto”, offers a very brief definition, and some of their distinctive features.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Terms Often Misrepresented by “Crypto”</p>
 Questions to Ask About Cryptocurrency 
<p>It’s worth it to keep these terms separate, but with an open eye for overarching trends. Cryptocurrency, for example, has plenty of people on edge. Cryptocurrency is intertwined with digital crime, ransomware being among the largest threats. Chainanalysis estimated that there was $14 billion worth of cryptocurrency lost to criminals in 2021, primarily from ransomware attacks, scams, and darkweb transactions. Concern is valid, as this is a <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/01/06/crypto-crime-all-time-high-2021/">79% increase over 2020</a>. But cryptocurrency should not just be a looming threat and risk to business, especially given that the overall volume of cryptocurrency transactions increased far more than criminal transactions did: <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">Chainanalysis also estimates</a> that legitimate cryptocurrency transactions reached $15 trillion in 2021, which is a 567% increase over 2020.&nbsp;Legitimate use of cryptocurrency is outpacing criminal use, and if cryptocurrency can ever get out of the speculative market there are strong opportunities for business.</p>
<p>These strong opportunities for business must be framed carefully. Cryptocurrencies in and of themselves don’t bring value to the business, but they can help to deliver business value. Their strengths lie in harnessing smart contracts to trigger payments only when certain required actions have been completed. Businesses should pay close attention to the ways that cryptocurrencies are stabilized to reduce their volatility. When this is achieved, the regulatory environment will be pressured to move quickly on issuing standards. The quickly evolving decentralized identity space will also play a role here, namely in enabling <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity">reusable, verifiable identities</a> for transacting parties. Pairing verifiable identities with cryptocurrency transactions may be a stabilizing factor for business transactions.</p>
<p>So how does the modern business reconcile itself with the astounding opportunities of a risky, crime-infused, and nonregulated technology? It begins with asking more questions:</p>
 
 What are the business models that align well with your business? 
 How do you move cryptocurrency from a private, peer-to-peer dominated space to enterprise functionality? 
 How do you separate the legitimate opportunities from risky, over speculative, or criminal use of cryptocurrency? 
 How do you secure cryptocurrencies (or do cryptocurrencies even need securing)? 
 Who can establish governance requirements and technology standards to enable successful leveraging of cryptocurrencies by enterprises? 
 
<p>Be on the lookout for future blog posts that consider these questions, and be sure to check the agenda of the European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC), coming up in May.</p>

<p>Munich, 08 February 2022, IDnow, a leading German provider for identity verification, will in future, enable every user to store their verified ID data locally on their smartphone in addition to their digital proof of vaccination in the luca app. This makes it possible to visit a restaurant, café or bar just by the luca app and without a manual ID check.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows the situation: you enter a restaurant and are asked for proof of vaccination. You pull out your mobile phone and have the QR code quickly at hand. Then the search for the wallet begins, as you must show your ID card. This annoying everyday problem will soon be a thing of the past. We are giving restaurants and other locations digital tools to work more efficiently and cost-effectively and to get back to pre-Corona levels more easily. In addition to the integration of payment services, this includes the uncomplicated ID solution that we are now providing with IDnow,” says Patrick Hennig, Managing Director of culture4life GmbH, operator of the luca app.</p>
<p>The reason for the ID check is the fact that the vaccination certificate, with whose QR code the digital proof of vaccination is generated, can also be scanned by other people. To avoid fraud, most state governments require the person to be matched by an ID document in addition to the vaccination certificate.</p>
<p>In the future, the luca app will digitize and simplify this process together with IDnow. luca users will soon be able to identify themselves once via the IDnow app and their digital identity will be stored locally on the smartphone. Within the luca app, the identity will be linked to the vaccination certificate. Only the identified person can check in at the restaurant using fingerprint or FaceID. This eliminates the need to show the ID card.</p>
<p>Technically, the identity is transmitted back to luca as so-called verifiable credentials from IDnow. The data is saved exclusively on the smartphone and encrypted with the help of the Secure Element. There is no central storage of the data. By storing the data locally, the user retains full control over his or her digital identity. From a data protection point of view, this approach is optimal because neither luca nor IDnow can access the data stored on the smartphone.</p>
<p>“With this use case, luca and IDnow are setting a positive example for the use of digital identities in everyday life. While the use of digital identities is already enjoying great popularity in other European countries, such as Belgium and Sweden, Germany is lagging behind. IDnow wants to change that and is already working with other partners on relevant use cases that use digital identity to simplify everyday situations.” Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and CTO of IDnow.</p>

 Navigating uncertainty — part&nbsp;2 <p>How three Swedish food actors coped during&nbsp;Covid-19</p><p>This is a series of two blog posts by Rapid Transition Lab, a collaboration between Stockholm Resilience Center, Dark Matter Labs, and Vinnova. <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/navigating-uncertainty-part-1-74029c9986d3">The first one</a> presents the findings from interviews with three Swedish food system actors. In this second post presents key learnings and further research.</p> Insights and takeaways <p>Based on the three cases presented in the last blog post, evidence shows that the pandemic opened up a critical ‘need for change’ for food system actors, since pre-existing operations were unable to function during parts of the crisis. The structure below outlines layers that enabled the transformational potential of each actor, along with different factors that helped them to shift and iterate their methods over&nbsp;time.</p>  Preparedness: Features of each actor that existed before the&nbsp;pandemic  Uncertainty: Emergent context with an uncertain time-frame that has a direct effect on the organization  Buffer: Cushions to reduce the emergent situation and enable a ‘softer landing’, eg., financial support for the organization  Trigger: Factor that creates space or opportunity for transformational potential  Transformational potential: Long-term strategic thinking and actions towards sustainable development  Layers of enablers for transformational potential © Rapid Transition Lab 1. Preparedness <p>Preparedness can be defined as a set of inherent organizational features each actor held before the pandemic. Depending on this foundational layer, actors were directly and indirectly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic to different extents, and so their responses were also unique. These features include actors’s defining mission[1], vision for the future[2], financial or growth strategy, network, organizational structure, or capabilities and knowledge built through experience. These features are embedded in their context and change over time, and are challenged during times of&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>All three cases revealed how financial security, such as external investors or savings, became crucial as preparedness during the crisis. But also, shared objectives and a shared belief in the vision for the future are the significant drivers that lead to secure investors and investment. For example, the shared trust in the mission that Karma experienced from their investors, gave them financial security. For Martin &amp; Servera, the owners’ belief in the long-term vision allowed them to proceed with investments towards sustainable development that were planned already before the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> 2. Uncertainty <p>Uncertainty became a critical aspect throughout the crisis period. Actors from all three cases had difficulties making decisions because they were uncertain of how long the pandemic would last, or for how long crisis packages would apply. For instance, after keeping the restaurant open for 9 months after the breakout, Debaser chose to fire all the staff and close the restaurant. When the stricter regulations were introduced, it was too hard for them to remain profitable while open. After all, the interviewee expressed a clear regret of firing all the staff, as if conditions concerning restrictions and support packages would have been known beforehand, they might have kept the staff temporarily furloughed instead.</p><p>On the other hand, uncertainty such as not knowing for how long the crisis would last could provoke actors to rethink and reinforce what the business wants to achieve in the longer term. Karma decided to expand the mission from reducing food waste to establishing a much broader mission: enabling the sustainable restaurant of the future. The restaurant (Debaser) has established a new strategic objective: to educate customers about the climate impact of food. Martin &amp; Servera kept their focus on their long-term goals despite the uncertainty, not letting it hinder them in achieving their strategic vision.</p><p>Uncertainty turned out to not only be a hindrance, but also a catalyst for change — without it, change in both operations and longer-term strategies might not have happened. In the face of unknown time-frames and uncertain conditions, actors were forced to act on what they believed to be the right decision in the present, using their existing core values or vision in order to act rapidly, and with some&nbsp;agility.</p> 3. Buffer <p>A buffer, in this case, can be thought of as a reserve that helps actors to better cope with a crisis, such as their financial security. In the three cases, the crisis package from the Swedish government provided a buffer of financial support to cover for lost income. It also gave companies the possibility to temporarily furlough staff with salary. Thus, the organization could keep the business running even if the company stopped making a profit. This assurance, in combination with existing financial savings or support from investors, unlocked certain triggering factors during the pandemic: the space to learn, self-reflect, experiment, and collaborate rapidly.</p> 4. Trigger <p>In face of the crisis and its consequent uncertainty, the actors managed to stay resilient due to their inherent preparedness in combination with external support (e.g. government packages). Triggers can be described as factors or actions which led actors to change their strategies and modes of operation in response to the altered context. From the above cases, these core triggers&nbsp;emerged:</p>  Rapid experimentation and immediate feedback  <p>Karma had an organizational culture that encouraged fast, small-scale experiments, in place well before Covid-19. This appetite for risk, in terms of trying new things, enabled them to experiment during the crisis, responding as conditions constantly changed. The actor launched two new services during this time, and the immediate feedback received helped them to make further strategic decisions, changing their service and business model. This actually re-focused the company’s mission, enabling it to become more resilient to future&nbsp;crises.</p>  Time for rapid learning and self-reflection  <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, Debaser decided to temporarily close their business and Karma scaled-down operation to a bare minimum. This break gave the actors time for learning and self-reflection and ultimately allowed the organizations to re-evaluate their visions for the future. Karma’s strategy had previously been to focus on aggressive growth (re-investing all their earnings directly into the company’s growth agenda), something that turned out to be a vulnerability rather than a strength during the crisis. They changed their strategy to focus on a slower, more-controlled growth dynamic, including securing savings as a buffer. Debaser also took the time for self-reflection and learning about the impact of food production on climate. The owners ensured that their staff was also educated in these matters. By redesigning the menu to reduce their climate impact, and communicating this impact to their guests, the company’s new objective became to educate customers about the carbon footprint caused by different dishes and to inspire other actors to do the&nbsp;same.</p>  Opportunity for a new collaboration  <p>All three cases initiated new collaborations during the crisis. For Martin &amp; Servera, closer collaborations with other actors in the food chain became a positive effect of the pandemic and a key to coping with the crisis. From finding new logistics collaborations, as volumes became smaller, to collaborating with suppliers around receiving the right products. Debaser also initiated a new collaboration with Klimato to help make changes in their menus. For Karma, many new collaborations emerged. For example the initial collaboration with delivery companies and also with food producers as they introduced their weekly boxes of fruit and vegetables.</p><p>Each of these triggers functions as crucial conditions for building capabilities and capacities to make use of emerging opportunities for positive change. They enable, iterate and reinforce the actor’s preparedness for resilience in face of uncertainty.</p> Further research and next&nbsp;steps <p>As these cases reveal, whilst a crisis can often be overwhelmingly negative, it can also be interpreted as a time of forced experimentation. It can force the formation, refinement, and consolidation of new relationships in face of uncertainty. As we have seen from supply chains to healthcare provision to food systems, the Covid-19 pandemic revealed the fragile interdependencies that often underpin what was previously perceived as seemingly stable systems. It could be argued that the prevailing tendency to reduce food to a product or a thing — seeing it merely as an industry, supply chain, and resource flow — neglects our ability to cherish it as a richer kind of process, as embodying sets of relationships, a complex and diverse set of cultures, and a core part of our personal and collective health, and our ecosystems and environments. Covid-19 has revealed this narrow, reductive reading of food, just as it has of other fundamental aspects of our everyday&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Prior to the pandemic, we have become increasingly aware that multiple actors pursuing unsustainable social, ecological, and economic practices produce outcomes that make our whole food system unsustainable, unhealthy and un-just. However, Covid-19 has functioned as a form of ‘highlighter’, underscoring this dynamic very clearly. In coming blog posts we will further explore this relational aspect of food — as culture, ecosystem, collective health, environment — and how Covid-19 puts these more fundamental questions about food on the table. This first set of posts concentrates on only three cases from our extensive interviews conducted thus far, and on the restaurant ‘end’ of the food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>This analysis is one way of looking at the changes during the pandemic. Going forward, we will continue exploring what innovative responses during the Covid-19 pandemic could have the potential to move food systems towards sustainable pathways — and how those opportunities could be harnessed. Further, we will be reflecting on other parts of the systems as it was stress-tested by the pandemic, drawing insights from other actors and their experiences. We will translate these insights, and the questions they raise, into tangible, speculative, and exploratory scenarios, highlighting possible intervention points, relationships, and systems transformations.</p><p>This blog is co-written by Aleksander Nowak and Juhee Hahm from <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, and Jenny Norrby from <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/">Stockholm Resilience Centre</a>, with contributions by My Sellberg, Per Olsson and Garry Peterson from Stockholm Resilience Centre, Alexander Alvsilver and Dan Hill from <a href="https://www.vinnova.se/">Vinnova</a>, and Linnea Rönnquist from Dark Matter Labs.

 Navigating uncertainty — part&nbsp;1 <p>How three Swedish food actors coped during&nbsp;Covid-19</p><p>This is a series of two blog posts by Rapid Transition Lab, a collaboration between Stockholm Resilience Center, Dark Matter Labs and Vinnova. In this first one presents the findings from interviews with three Swedish food system actors. The <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/navigating-uncertainty-part-2-857e4edd4f56">second post</a> presents key learnings and further research.</p> 1. Introduction <p>The Covid-19 pandemic, as every crisis, happens unevenly in time. It both rapidly and gradually shapes the entangled relationships across the food system, forms new alignments, collaborations, and opportunities as well as challenging circumstances for its&nbsp;actors.</p><p>For some, the current crisis has meant a fight for survival. For others, as a result of ‘<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9502904">forced experimentation</a>’, it turned out to be a learning and evaluation process, leading to new ideas, new strategies.</p><p>This first blog post presents the results from interviews with three Swedish food system actors on their Covid-19 responses. These results, combined with selected official regulations introduced during the crisis, are visualized in time as an attempt to analyze their connections.</p><p>Juxtaposing the influences of the crisis on the individual system actors with the regulations, restrictions and support measures over time, allows for a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between policy and action. In the second blog post, we will analyze this further and present the key findings and takeaways.</p><p>These insights can provide important recommendations for all food systems actors, including policy makers, not only for responding to the current pandemic, but also to other crises such as climate, biodiversity, health, social justice — now and in the future. The insights can also inform the process of navigating transformations towards more resilient, just and sustainable food systems’&nbsp;futures.</p> 2. Cases <p>The cases presented below are based on interviews with three Swedish food system actors that have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in somewhat different ways. Interviews were conducted in December 2021 and are not taking into consideration events that occurred after that. We are continuing to interview food systems actors, and look through multiple different lenses on the systems around&nbsp;us.</p><p>The timelines, illustrating each case, present Covid-19 related regulations, the emerging impact the crisis had on each actor, how the actor responded and the effects it had on the organization. Actors’ responses are highlighted according to their nature; if they were results of actors adapting to the new situation or if actors used the opportunity to develop long-term strategic thinking and actions towards sustainable development and thereby show transformational potential.</p>Legend of timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Case 01 — KARMA <p>Interviewee: App service that helps restaurants to sell their leftover food to consumers at discounted price.</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, Karma was operating in Sweden, London and Paris and had about 90 employees. The business model was based on relationships with foremost urban/city-center restaurants and customers residing in that&nbsp;area.</p><p>When Covid hit Europe, in March 2020, the app service experienced its most profitable month since launching in 2016. However, due to the pandemic, the following months were the hardest since the start of its operation.</p><p>Across Europe restaurants closed down, and Karma’s operations in London and Paris stopped abruptly. In Sweden, however, most restaurants were still open. Pre-pandemic, app users were mainly people on their way home from work buying leftover meals from city restaurants to have for dinner. So, as people began to work from home, they started using the app in their local areas instead with a more dispersed supply of food. At the same time, as the pandemic hit, using the app to save leftovers was no longer a priority for the restaurants as they went into a survival mode. Due to these dynamics, the app service operations went down by about&nbsp;50%.</p><p>In order to cope with the new reality, Karma started providing home delivery through the app to ensure people could still rescue food albeit being forced to stay home. The home delivery service was launched within two weeks after the pandemic outbreak in Sweden and was made possible through the collaboration with delivery and transportations companies who were also affected negatively by the pandemic. Karma also introduced home delivery of boxes of leftover fruit and vegetables, as well as the possibility for restaurants to sell boxes of leftover meals as well as non-leftover meals through the app. After three months, they realized that delivering leftover meals was too costly. In consequence, the company decided to focus only on subscriptions of weekly delivered boxes of leftover fruits and vegetables from producers and wholesalers to customers’ doorsteps.</p><p>Initially, when Covid hit, the company put their staff on temporary furlough with support from the government. However, as the pandemic continued, they realized that in order to survive, the organization had to be slimmed down to a bare minimum. As such, nine months after covid hit only 18 of originally 90 staff members remained employed in the&nbsp;company.</p><p>The service of delivering weekly boxes of fruits and vegetables continued until the end of 2020, when the company realized they had moved too far away from their original business operations. This left the company in a situation where continuing to grow both businesses would mean building two different companies from an operations standpoint. A strategic choice that would be too costly. Hence, they phased out the service and took time to contemplate around their vision and future and then re-launched again in March&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Meanwhile, as restrictions eased and customers started going out again, restaurants were struggling to find staff. To meet this demand, Karma developed a service whereby customers can order and pay online while seated at the restaurant, to help reduce the workload on staff. This has led the company to re-formulate and expand their vision. Originally, their main focus was reducing food waste, yet now they want to be a bigger part of establishing the sustainable restaurant of the future. Saving leftover food remains highly important, but is now part of a wider, more systemic approach.</p><p>As a result of the experiences of Covid-19, the company has changed its strategy. From being a company focusing on aggressive growth rather than profitability, they are now looking to be more resilient, ensuring savings and more carefully managed growth, as well as innovation.</p>Karma’s Covid-19 response in the timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Case 02 — Debaser <p>Interviewee: A business that entails a concert arena, a nightclub and a restaurant.</p><p>When Covid-19 hit, the concert arena and the nightclub closed completely but the associated restaurant, Calexico’s, stayed open until December 2020. The concert arena was hit both by the fact that performing actors could not travel and also by limitations for public gatherings. When the government forced the concert arena and nightclub to close, they based the decision on the wrong law according to the interviewee. This hindered Debaser and other actors from using their epidemic insurance. The CEO tried to influence the government to change this decision but without any&nbsp;luck.</p><p>From 11th of March 2020 to mid/end of April the restaurant Calexico’s had practically no customers. In connection to the restaurant, Debaser has a large outdoor seating area that became particularly valuable during the pandemic. When opening this area at the end of March, unusually early in the season, customers started to return throughout spring and summer. Yet they still had only 30% of the pre-pandemic capacity.</p><p>The interviewee explains that like many others in the restaurant business, they thought the crisis would be over after that first summer. So they kept the restaurant running and kept the staff. However, as restrictions came in during autumn and finally the requirement to stop serving alcoholic drinks after 8pm and close at 8.30pm, they decided to shut down the restaurant in December 2020. They had to let go of almost all their staff. They kept the restaurant closed between the end of December 2020 until the end of April&nbsp;2021.</p><p>During this period, starting already during the autumn, they took the opportunity to self-reflect. They learned more about the climate crisis and the impact of food production during this time. This resulted in a decision to re-design their whole menu, which they did in collaboration with <a href="https://www.klimato.co/">Klimato</a>, a service that calculates the carbon footprints of specific dishes by using the <a href="https://www.ri.se/en/what-we-do/expertises/rise-food-climate-database">RISE food climate database</a>. The restaurant now wants to act as an educator for their customers and inform them about the impact that food has on climate. Their experience is that a lot of people lack this knowledge.</p><p>When opening again in April 2021, they retained half of their staff, but they regretted firing everyone in December 2020. If the company had known from the beginning for how long the restrictions would last for, and the support packages that they could apply for, they would have only temporarily furloughed their staff with salary for the whole period&nbsp;instead.</p>Debaser’s Covid-19 response in the timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Case 03 — Martin &amp;&nbsp;Servera <p>Interviewee: Wholesaler distributing food and beverages to private restaurants (incl. fast food), public restaurants, cafes, hotel chains, conference facilities, nightclubs and other businesses offering food and beverages.</p><p>When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the wholesaler had a lot of stored food, and food on the way to be delivered to their customers. But since the restaurants and hotels had no guests at that point, they canceled their orders and the wholesaler had to find other sales channels. For a while, they sold bulk packages of cornflakes and beef to supermarkets, for example, until they had managed to correct their orders towards the suppliers to match the lowered&nbsp;demand.</p><p>In this initial phase, the wholesaler was hit hard. At the lowest point, they lost 50% of their total orders. But during summer 2020 business went up again. Tourists never came to visit Sweden in any great numbers, but equally Swedes were not overseas tourists either. They stayed in Sweden and spent money on amusement parks, in hotels, and in restaurants. Restrictions were not yet limiting opening or serving hours; they were mainly focused on distancing. But in Autumn and Winter 2020, new restrictions were introduced and the situation got tougher again. Usually, a lot of the sales at this time of the year comes from the restaurants’ Christmas offer, and from New Years Eve and seasonal tourism. But little of this happened in 2020’s version of the holiday&nbsp;season.</p><p>During Spring 2021 sales recovered somewhat, and as restrictions were eased during the summer, sales improved as people again went out to eat, travel, socialize, stay in hotels and visit places and attractions. During Autumn 2021, the wholesaler was back to about 90% of their pre-Covid sales. The ‘missing’ revenue was mostly due to conferences, tourism, and traveling not returning to pre-Covid levels.</p><p>During the pandemic, Martin &amp; Servera had to fire some of their staff, but they also used the financial support provided by the government to retain the staff part-time, using flexible working patterns when needed. They also received support to cover for lost&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Despite the outbreak of the pandemic, the company still managed to pursue planned investments in electric trucks and a large solar cell park, and they also built a new, more energy-efficient, warehouse. The company owners had taken a longer-term perspective, which enabled them to conduct strategic investments even during these difficult conditions.</p>Martin &amp; Servera’s Covid-19 response in the timeline © Rapid Transition Lab Thoughts and questions — Transitioning to part&nbsp;2 <p>We can look through multiple lenses to analyze the resilience of the food system. Looking at the cases presented in this post, we can assess the conditions created by a pandemic: the direct and indirect impacts, coping and adapting strategies, the transformational potential as well as the opportunities or barriers for change that the system actors engaged with and encountered during the&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>Through this perspective, some of the critical questions emerge: How might actors navigate times of crisis towards ultimately-necessary sustainable practices? How might actors survive whilst adapting to ever-changing conditions? What are the responses that have the potential to contribute to transformations? What forms of resilience are being exhibited? And what are the multiple time-frames and paces in which change occurs?

<p>Access control in websites and web applications is a top priority for security, but how you set up access depends on how you store the data to be authenticated. This, in turn, enables user authorization. Cookies and tokens are two common ways of setting up authentication.</p>
 
 
<p>Cookies are chunks of data created by the server and sent to the client for communication purposes. Tokens, usually referring to JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), are signed credentials encoded into a long string of characters created by the server. The main difference between cookies and tokens is their nature: tokens are stateless while cookies are stateful.</p>
 
 
<p>With this in mind, why is there a need to store authentication on the browser? Because HTTP is stateless, even if you authenticate with one request, the server essentially "forgets" that authentication with subsequent requests. Therefore, you need to supply the token/cookie on every request for authentication by the server. The frontend stores the token or cookie and uses it to make subsequent requests to the server until the cookie or token expires.</p>
 
 
<p>This article will examine the use of cookies or tokens for authentication, comparing the pros and cons of each method, so that you can determine which is best for your project.</p>

 About authentication 
 
 
<p>Authentication is the act of verifying user credentials in terms of either correctness or time.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Correctness: The user credentials are verified based on existing details. At the sign-in request, an authentication token is assigned to the user. It will be used to authorize the user and authenticate subsequent interactions with the application.</p>
 
 
<p>Time: The authentication token assigned to the user is only valid for a specific period of time. If the token becomes invalid, the user needs to be re-authenticated before access can be granted.</p>
 
 
 
 






The term "authentication token" is used here to describe any form of authentication credential that might be implemented by the application, not explicitly an access token.



 
 
<p>The above instances aren’t environment-specific and could be demonstrated visually on the frontend or the backend during API testing.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Why use authentication 
 
 
<p>There are two reasons why authentication is necessary to allow full access to an application:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Authentication establishes the identity of the user and verifies that the user is who (or what) it says it is. Authentication protects your resources by denying access to unauthenticated users.</p>
 
 
<p>Authentication gives each user a distinct identity, protecting your data and theirs. Applications that require users to create an account give each user a unique profile, which is what determines the data shown to the user. For example, PayPal requires users to sign in before displaying their account balance and transactions.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Generally, the process works like this:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>You sign in.</p>
 
 
<p>The server verifies your sign-in details and assigns you an authentication token.</p>
 
 
<p>The authentication token is used to make a request to your homepage that displays your unique dashboard.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Both session cookies and access tokens allow users to make requests to the server without needing to re-authenticate at each request. The following is a comparison of the two.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What you should know about cookies 
 
 
<p>Session cookies are stateful elements. They contain data that the server sends to the browser for temporary use. The authentication data inside a cookie is stored on both the client and server. The server keeps track of active sessions in a database, while the browser holds the identifier to the active session. When a request is made to the server, the session ID is used to look up information such as user roles or privileges for authentication, in order to check if the session is still valid.</p>
 
 
 Advantages of cookies 
 
<p>Consider these key benefits:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Cookies use the same session across subdomains: They take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Domain_and_Path"><code>Domain</code></a> argument: You specify the domain name for which the cookie is valid. Setting the domain name to <code>yoursite.com</code> allows the same session for the domain and subdomains.</p>
 
 
<p>They reduce manipulation by client-side JavaScript: You can restrict client-side access by setting the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/HttpOnly"><code>HttpOnly</code></a> flag. This reduces the likelihood of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on your application, since most XSS attacks involve the use of malicious JS code.</p>
 
 
<p>They require little storage: Cookies use as little as 6 KB to store a simple user ID. Depending on what information you store in your cookie, you’ll transmit a minimal amount of bytes with every request.</p>
 
 
<p>Finally, cookies are managed by the browser: This is automatic, so you don’t have to worry about it.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 The downside of cookies 
 
<p>Some of the disadvantages of cookies include:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p> Cross-site request forgery attacks (XSRF or CSRF): CSRF attacks are only possible with cookie-based session handling. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite"><code>SameSite</code></a> attribute allows you to decide whether cookies should be sent to third-party apps using the Strict or Lax settings. A strict setting can prevent CSRF attacks, but it can also contribute to a poor browser experience for the user. For example, say your site uses a cookie named <code>tutorials_shown</code> to determine whether a user has already seen specific tutorials in order to show them new ones every time they visit. If <code>SameSite</code> is set to <code>Strict</code> and someone follows a link to your site, the cookie will not be sent on that first request, and previously viewed tutorials will be shown. This creates a less personalized user experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Scaling issues: Since sessions are tied to a particular server, you can run into issues when scaling your application. In a load-balanced application, if a logged-in user is redirected to a new server, the existing session data is lost. To prevent this, sessions need to be stored in a shared database or cache. This  increases the complexity of each interaction.</p>
 
 
<p>Not good for API authentication: APIs provide one-time resources for authenticated end-users and don’t need to keep track of user sessions. Cookies don’t work perfectly in this case, since they track and verify active sessions. Tokens, meanwhile, provide authentication with a unique identifier on every request to the API endpoints.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Cookies aren’t the only way to store session IDs; other options include URLs and form fields. Cookies are more secure than those two, but how secure are cookies?</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Cookies are only secure in an HTTPS connection. Enforcing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Secure_and_HttpOnly"><code>Secure</code></a> flag ensures that cookies are only sent via an encrypted HTTPS connection. Use of HTTPS prevents disclosure of session ID in person-in-the-middle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MITM</a>) attacks.</p>
 
 
<p>As noted earlier, cookies can be manipulated by client-side scripts (JavaScript or Visual Basic). This can be prevented by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Secure_and_HttpOnly"><code>HttpOnly</code></a> flag.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>While cookies can be made secure by setting the appropriate attributes and following best practices, they can also be made insecure by neglecting these steps.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Structured security tokens 
 
 
<p>Tokens—or JWTs in this context—are stateless in nature, meaning the server doesn’t need to keep a record of the token. Each token is self-contained, holding the information needed for verification and identification on the server.</p>
 
 
 Advantages of tokens 
 
<p>Here are some specific advantages of tokens:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Flexibility and ease of use: JWTs are easy to use. Their self-containing nature helps you achieve what you need for verification without database lookups. This makes JWTs more suitable to use in an API, since the API server doesn’t need to keep track of user sessions.</p>
 
 
<p>Cross-platform capabilities: Because of their stateless nature, tokens can be seamlessly implemented on mobile platforms and internet of things (IoT) applications, especially in  comparison to cookies..</p>
 
 
<p>Multiple storage options: Tokens can be stored in a number of ways in browsers or front-end applications.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>If you use a browser’s local storage, tokens can’t be accessed by a subdomain. However, they can be accessed and manipulated by any JavaScript code on the webpage, as well as by browser plugins. This isn’t a recommended method: first, itposes a security risk, plus you must manage the storage.</p>
 
 
<p>Session storage is another way to store tokens. The drawback is that the token is destroyed when the browser is closed.</p>
 
 
 
 Disadvantages of JWT tokens 
 
<p>Here are some downsides of tokens to be aware of:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Revocation: A JWT cannot be revoked. Even if a JWT leaks, it remains valid until it expires, resulting in a serious security hole. As a workaround, you must implement a deny-list technique that requires a more complex setup.</p>
 
 
<p>Need more space: A JWT might need 300+ bytes to store a simple user ID, because they store other data for authentication.</p>
 
 
<p>Stale: The information inside of a JWT represents a snapshot in time when the token was originally created. The associated user may now have different access levels or have been removed from the system altogether.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>But what about the security of tokens?</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>JWTs are cryptographically signed and base64-encoded. They’re only secure when they aren’t exposed, so they should be treated like passwords.</p>
 
 
<p>A JWT can be viewed but not manipulated on the client side. You can take your token to <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, choose the algorithm you used to sign, and see the data. You just can’t tamper with it because it’s issued on the server.</p>
 
 
<p>The lifespan of a JWT should be kept short to limit the risk caused by a leaked token.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When to use cookies or tokens 
 
 
<p>In general, the choice between a session cookie or a structured token will depend on your use case. You should use cookies when you need to keep track of user interactions, such as with an e-commerce application or website. You can use tokens when building API services or implementing distributed systems.</p>

Conceived during the Blockchain Summit on Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island, the GBBC is a Swiss-based non-profit launched in 2017 in Davos, Switzerland that&nbsp; is dedicated to furthering adoption of blockchain through engaging regulators, business leaders, and global changemakers on how to harness this ground-breaking technology to create more secure, equitable, and functional societies.</p>
<p>Sumiran’s role as Ambassador to India for GBBC will not only bring her depth of experience and expertise to the GBBC membership, but will also help to grow the understanding of the value of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials to a wider, global community.</p>
<p>Sumiran’s work at GBBC and Indicio has already led to the inclusion of Indicio and five of our Node Operators in <a href="https://gbbcouncil.org/news/gsmi-2-0-announcement/">GBBC’s Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI) 2.0 summary report</a>. GSMI 2.0 is GBBC’s most comprehensive effort to map and analyze the blockchain and digital asset landscape and was spearheaded by the GBBC in partnership with 131 institutions, organized into nine working groups and one of the groups was Digital Identity.</p>
<p>GSMI 2.0 includes an Interactive map of blockchain and digital asset regulation and guidance across 187 jurisdictions and also a report dedicated to the findings and guidance of the working groups with focuses in five key areas:</p>
 
  Legislation and regulatory guidance 
  Technical standards 
  Industry standards and recommendations 
  University courses and degree programs 
  Industry consortia 
 
<p>Indicio was mentioned in several areas of the report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, in the <a href="https://gbbcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GBBC-GSMI-2.0-Report-1.pdf">main GSMI Report 2.0</a> (1) cite’s Indicio’s recommendation on the use of machine readable governance . Machine-readable governance embeds governance rules in the software for each party in a decentralized ecosystem. This allows governance rules to be cached, meaning the system can work offline, as well as providing the most effective and efficient way for managing complex information flows and conditional logic. Machine-readable governance was&nbsp; <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-decentralized-identity-revolution-is-powered-by-machine-readable-governance/">developed by Indicio</a> in collaboration with SITA and an open-source version will bedonated to Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) for use by health authorities as part of the Cardea project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the report highlighted use cases from some of Indicio’s node operators:&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.snowbridge.se/">Snowbridge</a> – Usecase is in real estate industry vertical and is based in Taiwan 
 <a href="https://snapperfuturetech.com/">Snapper Future</a> – Use case is in E-governance and education vertical and is based in India 
 <a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralized-identity-opens-the-doors-for-safe-travel-and-tourism/">Indicio for Govt</a> – Use case is in government industry vertical and is based in US 
 <a href="https://indicio.tech/cardea/">Indicio for Healthcare</a> – Use case is in healthcare industry vertical and is based in US 
 <a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a> – Use case is in hi-tech industry vertical and is based in US 
 <a href="https://idramp.com/">ID Ramp</a> – Multiple use cases in cross industry and public sector identity services and is based in US 
 <a href="https://finclusive.com/">Finclusive</a> – Use case is in financial industry vertical and is based in US 
 
<p>This section is particularly valuable for those in the Digital Identity space as it summarizes the commercial benefits of the technology with real life use cases in this space along with recommendations for adoption. Listing these solutions also helps advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 16,1— “Identity for all by 2030.”</p>
<p>Indicio is a global network for a technology that brings value to everyone. We are extremely proud to have the expertise of Sumiran helping to support the diverse community of twenty-six companies on five continents as they operate our growing global network. Each organization is an innovator. All are committed to building a better way to manage digital identity and to create the trust in data needed for the machine, spatial, and Web3 age.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%2523HoloMonday">#HoloMonday</a> everyone! If you’re not familiar with Holo Monday, it’s an initiative our community has created to celebrate our devs — both people working on hApps and Holo team members — on the first Monday of each month.</p><p>In that spirit, I want to share updates from a number of projects building on Holochain, as well as dev tools reaching new stages of maturity and even a new project I’d never heard of! Let’s see what’s fresh.</p> Holochain Launcher 0.3.8 <p>Launcher, the user-friendly Holochain runtime and hApp runner, has been updated for Windows, macOS, and Linux to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.3.8">include Holochain 0.0.124</a>. The previous Launcher version included Holochain 0.0.119, and the HDK and network protocol have changed since then, so applications built for newer versions should direct their users to update their Launcher version.</p> Flux 0.2.16 <p><a href="https://github.com/fluxsocial/flux/">Flux</a>, the flagship communities app from <a href="https://junto.foundation/">Junto Foundation</a>, is progressing nicely. This is the first time I’ve reported on this application, so there’s a lot to talk about.</p><p>Flux is the newest iteration of Junto’s vision of healthy online social spaces. Long-time followers will know that Junto were <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/junto--a-new-breed-of-social-media-powered-by-holochain/">one of the first</a> projects to commit to building on Holochain. A few years ago, they produced a proof-of-concept app for mobile phones and learned a lot in the process. Their newest iteration, Flux, embodies their core insight: focus on community creation rather than a new social media platform, because close-knit communities are what create healthy online social spaces.</p><p>To me this feels like this takes the best parts of early Web2 — the community cohesion of old-fashioned forums and blog networks — and brings them into the hyperconnected Web3 world. Right now, Flux just gives your community a multi-channel chat server, but they plan on <a href="https://www.fluxsocial.io/">adding more features</a>, like blogs, knowledge bases, DAO-style governance, and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>This is early days for Flux, and you may notice a few bugs and speed issues, but I’m very impressed by what they’ve already accomplished. It feels like a professionally-designed, well-thought-out app.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/fluxsocial/flux/releases/tag/v0.2.15">Download Flux and create a community!</a></p> Acorn 0.6.0-alpha <p>Acorn, the collaborative goal-planning whiteboard, has gotten a cool new feature in <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha">its newest version</a>: presence indicators! Built on Holochain’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">signals</a> feature, it shows you which cards your colleagues are currently working on, giving you the comforting feeling of working in the same room as them. As the release notes point out, it’s also good for keeping you from stepping on each other’s toes!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha">Download Acorn and try it out with your colleagues!</a></p> Electron template for hApps <p>Sprillow, the dev shop behind Acorn, have created a super useful template repo for anyone who wants to bundle their hApp, UI, and Holochain itself into a single cross-platform executable. I understand they’ve done a huge amount of work getting it usable, from taking care of cross-platform build issues to dealing with the tricky bits of getting the app trusted on macOS. If you’re planning on releasing your hApp as a standalone, you ought to check it out.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain-template">Clone the electron-holochain-template repo</a>.</p> Clutter lives again! <p>Those of you who went to a hackathon or simply checked out Holochain back in 2018 might remember Clutter. It was a demo app (written in both JavaScript and Lisp) that aimed to create a microblogging experience like Twitter.</p><p>Well, a small team of developers, headed by Moritz (a former colleague), is rebuilding Clutter for the new Holochain SDK. The project has gained attention from a number of developers (including some who weren’t previously involved in building hApps!) who are working on it ‘hackalong’-style. This means arranging regular times where they can all work on it together over a video call. This is a side project for most of them, and this format doesn’t demand much from them (and working together is more fun), so this appears to be a great format for getting things done.</p><p>If you’d like to get involved in Clutter development, head over to the <a href="https://discord.gg/wEuA2C4R">new dev.hc Discord server</a> and look for the ‘clutter’ channel!</p> New Discord server for hApp developers <p>I think the aforementioned Discord deserves a mention of its own: There already are a few Discord servers for developers, and they seem to be where the action is right now rather than the forum. Most of them have membership criteria, though. So if that feels intimidating to you, the <a href="https://discord.gg/wEuA2C4R">dev.hc server</a> is wide open to all developers!</p><p>It seems that the chat format serves a lot of developers well, especially for building community around the work they’re doing. Recently the Clutter working group is using it to coordinate meetings, share information, and generally get to know each other better.</p> Koru: a mutual credit module for your hApp <p>Recently I learned about a project called <a href="https://koru.finance/">Koru</a>, which claims that it’s building software that lets any group spin up their own customised mutual credit currency. If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you’ll know I am <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/mutual-credit-part-1-a-new-type-of-cryptocurrency-as-old-as-civilisation/">pretty excited about mutual credit</a>. I don’t think it’s the perfect design, a currency to end all other currencies, but I think it comes pretty darn close. So I was doubly excited when I discovered this project — not only did it feel like my dreams were coming true, but it turns out they’re already <a href="https://github.com/KoruProtocol/koru">prototyping on Holochain</a>!</p><p>I get the impression that it’s still early days for this project, but their lead dev is very active in our ecosystem and it seems like it has a lot of promise — in terms of development activity, plus usefulness for your own hApp and of course value to real humans. Wishing Koru lots of success!</p><p>When I discover a project like this, it makes me wonder, what other projects are building on Holochain that I know nothing about? If you know of any, please <a href="https://twitter.com/helioscomm">share them with me on Twitter</a>!</p>Imran, Koru’s lead developer, shares about the project Reusable Modules mini-site <p>Recently I came across this <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/reusable-modules/">mini-site called Reusable Modules</a>, created by the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev">Holochain Open Dev</a> group. It captures a design philosophy that appears to be very popular among Holochain devs (and really, should be popular among all devs): composability. It describes how the community feels about how to architect hApps: as collections of small, single-purpose, customisable, open-source components. It addresses both the front-end and back-end aspects this design philosophy, and is really worth reading.</p> Holochain 0.0.124: no-op <p>This release brings some compilation fixes and some documentation updates (note: we’ll be giving renewed focus to documentation in the coming months). The HDK has seen a version bump to 0.0.120, but there are no breaking changes. <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.124/CHANGELOG.md#20220126200716">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.125: DHT arc resizing stability <p>This release brings some of the gossip improvements the core dev team has been working on, and finally turns on sharding by default! It’s not the end of our improvements, though; a future release will have a lot of big improvements to both the stability of arc (AKA shard) resizing and the efficiency of syncing between nodes. <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.125/CHANGELOG.md#20220202112225">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> What’s on the horizon for Holochain? <p>That’s a good question. As we approach beta, what sorts of things should application developers expect? When will we see new features, how much churn will we have to refactor through? We intend to produce a more solid Holochain roadmap soon, but here are the most important things to know for now. (Keep in mind that most of these things are still subject to change; I just want to give you a heads-up so you can plan for contingencies.)</p>  Stabilisation of the HDK, so you can develop against a more slow-moving target. We’re currently taking a fresh look at how validation works, and there ought to be some changes soon which will make it easier for you to keep your hApp more stable. In short, we may create two separate HDKs, one with validation callbacks and one without. The idea is that your DNA will be made up of ‘integrity’ zomes which contain data type definitions (including validation callbacks) and rarely change, and ‘coordination’ zomes which contain your app’s controller logic, don’t affect the DNA hash, and can hence be changed more often.  Stabilisation of the gossip protocol — including a new DHT arc resizing algorithm and syncing algorithm. The reduced network and CPU load should make the user experience much nicer, and it should make it less necessary for you to keep recompiling your hApp for the newest and greatest Holochain.  New HDK and DHT features, including ‘baseless’ links, saving you from requiring every user to test for the existence of a base anchor at app startup; links that can have headers as their base or target; ephemeral (off-chain) storage; a pub/sub model for signals to replace the current everybody-gets-everything model; ‘true’ deletes via two new DHT operations: ‘purge’ and ‘withdraw’; and validated rate limiting to prevent DHT spamming and other time-based abuses.  More core hApps that are useful to all devs, including <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey">DeepKey</a> for distributed key management, Verifiable Credentials for people to make signed claims about others, Compository for managing shared source code and distributing binaries, Personas and Profiles for managing and syncing personal information across all your devices, and Source Chain Backup for easy recovery of lost agency.  Security and resilience features, including warrants and defensive action for warrantable offenses, plus a top-to-bottom security review of the codebase.   FOSDEM 2022 recap <p>I didn’t attend FOSDEM myself this year, but it looks like a lot of great projects presented their work. A few colleagues mentioned that it was good to hear about what others are doing, partly because it’s always valuable to learn new things, but also because there seems to be an agent-centric trend among P2P projects that validates Holochain’s approach.</p><p>Here are three of the four Holochain-related presentations. I have to say, I’m personally thrilled about all of them; I think they will be important projects in the growing Holochain ecosystem.</p>Harlan Wood shares TrustGraph, a framework for building subjective reputation in P2P networksEmaline Friendman and Michael Hueschen share Neighbourhoods<a href="https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fosdem/2022/D.web3/where.mp4"></a>Eric Harris-Braun presents Where, an app for collective sensemaking using a simple question: "Where are you at right now?"<p>Check out all the other talks in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/web3_infrastructure/">Web3 Infrastructure room</a>.</p><p>Well, I think that’s plenty for this Holo Monday!

<p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates – 7 February, 2022: IDnow, one of the leading global digital identity verification providers, has announced its launch in the Middle East, with the opening of its new office in DIFC’s Innovation Hub. This is the first IDnow office outside of Europe, adding to its headquarters in Munich, and offices across Leipzig, Düsseldorf, London and Manchester.</p>
<p>The business is targeting the huge Middle East and Africa (MEA) digital identity verification market, which is expected to reach USD 800M by 2025*. It is a rapidly expanding market, with the facial verification sector expected to grow at 20 percent CAGR for the next five years. IDnow’s regional team will be led by Oliver Obitayo, Chief Commercial Officer of IDnow Group and Head of Region – Middle East, Basil Macklai.</p>
<p>On the occasion of its Middle East launch, Oliver Obitayo commented, “The Middle East is a rapidly growing market for digital identity verification, supporting the region’s booming and innovative digital economy. We have been working in conjunction with regional regulators for more than two years, and the time is right to expand our presence with a dedicated team and office. IDnow’s combination of international experience, German-quality standards and in-depth knowledge of requirements across Middle East jurisdictions, puts us in a unique position to serve government, regulators, banks, financial services, enterprises and fintechs.”</p>
<p>More than half of businesses in the MENA region have faced new financial crime risks due to the pandemic, including payments fraud, account takeovers and identity theft. According to a study by Comparitech, in the UAE alone cyber crime claims 166,667 victims annually, losing $746 million, with identity theft and fraud key contributors. McKinsey research highlights financial services as the largest driver of identity verification services. As such, these businesses will account for around 62 percent of digital identity verification spend this year (Juniper Research).</p>
<p>For nearly a decade, IDnow has been developing quality technology that serves some of the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions. The IDnow platform provides a range of secure and seamless products, including its signature IDnow AutoIdent, an automated, AI-powered identity verification. Benefits include reducing onboarding friction, improving customer experience and automating conversion at scale. For banks and financial services, deploying IDnow enhances KYC, AML and regulatory compliance, helping to reduce risk of fraud to protect businesses and their customers.</p>
<p>Aligning with the vision of regional governments to strengthen the digital transformation of the banking sector and underline trust in Middle East financial services, IDnow facilitates greater integration with the global financial system and supports development of legislative and legal frameworks to ensure compliance with international standards.</p>
<p>IDnow is an industry leader and has set the standard for digital identity verification in the EU. It is backed by significant investors including Corsair Capital, Seventure Partners, BayBG Venture Capital, and a consortium of other financiers. The business has also received debt funding from the European Investment Bank, the European Union’s investment bank which is owned by the EU Member States.</p>

<p>Introduction: What Is GEMpay And What Are Its Intricacies?</p><p>GEMpay is a points-based payment system specialized for small business owners and entities. Instead of small business owners being plagued by brokerage fees charged in the normal terminal payment process, small business owners can become the subject of point issuance. By turning the small business entity into the focal component of the point-based system, a business can provide more benefits to loyal and new consumers alike. In the most brief manner of speaking, it is a win-win model for both the business and the consumer.</p> 🌟 First, The Dream, The Direction And Vision Of&nbsp;GEMpay <p>The direction of GEMpay, like blockchain technology, intends on eliminating the necessity of middle-men and payment intermediaries. The point discount concept has been adopted by GEMpay to increase discounts as opposed to fees, providing numerous benefits for the producer, business and consumer alike! GEMpay is a blockchain based solution as a service. With the innovation of blockchain, merchants and consumers are directly connected. Lets think if the merchant and consumer are two end points in a peer-to-peer network in the Bitcoin network; directly connected, without middle-men. This enables virtually zero commission costs. Unlike traditional financial systems, the core paradigm of the blockchain is “decentralization.” By excluding PGs and VAN companies that have gotten in the middle of the payment process, it is possible to conceive of a “double discount” with&nbsp;GEMpay.</p><p>GEMpay aims to become the subject of the service by transparently sharing the transaction process. Payment details and discount rates are shown in a direct and concise manner with GEMpay and enables users to exercise their own choice in operation. This is the ethos of decentralization that GEMpay aims to&nbsp;achieve.</p><p>GEMpay transparently shares the transaction process with users, allowing users to be the subject of payment data thereof. Rather than just sharing payment details and discount rates, you can easily check the details of why such a discount is possible through the GEMpay application. This creates efficient and easier services which allow users to exercise choice in a huge platform base created with their own data and aggregation. This will in return increase the actual benefits they will&nbsp;receive.</p><p>From the user’s point of view, it is quite burdensome to use coins that are extremely volatile and fluctuate in valuation on a second-by-second basis. BLOCKO intends on creating the AERGO Gem token on the self developed AERGO mainnet to ensure the consistent value of 1:1 value exchange with the KRW. BLOCKO will initially focus on the exchange pair with the KRW. Users can then use the AERGO Gem charged through the GEMpay app into the Korean&nbsp;won.</p> 🧐 So How Do I Use&nbsp;GEMpay? <p>To use GEMpay, it is necessary to follow these steps provided. To begin, you first must top-up your AERGO Gem tokens. AERGO Gem has the same value as the KRW, and when more users utilize the AERGO Gem on the GEMpay platform, users are able to garner more discounts. So how can individuals charge up their AERGO Gem with AERGO tokens? We want to increase user convenience by supporting the ARC-1 (based on the AERGO native token) and ERC-20 (based on Ethereum) AERGO&nbsp;token.</p><p>Since the AERGO mainnet has a Merkle Bridge function, it is possible to recharge your AERGO Gem with numerous different ERC-20 tokens, which include Ethereum. To do this, we need to pull the price for each token, and we need to have an Index for the price. However, there is no reliable index to date. The price shown on the exchange is not a reliable index because the exchange has the lead. If there is a transparent index related to Ethereum in the future, GEMpay will support various tokens through the Merkle Bridge function at any time.<br>The Merkle Bridge is a technology that enables the exchange between assets of the AERGO blockchain and assets of the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Because AERGO Gem is charged with AERGO tokens, the GEMpay app also serves as an ‘AERGO wallet’ as well. Users can transfer their AERGO tokens to the GEMpay app seamlessly for storage and recharge with AERGO GEM whenever they want. GEMpay supports both online and offline payments. At offline issuer A, a QR payment is made through the GEMpay app, and at online issuer B, payment is made with AERGO Gem by selecting ‘GEMpay’ among various payment methods such as credit card, Naver Pay, and Kakao&nbsp;Pay.</p><p>The issuing point is the subject of point issuance and can initially set the exchange rate of the issuing point points and the AERGO Gem. The moment a user pays with AERGO Gem, AERGO Gem is automatically converted into points at the point of issue. AERGO Gem is then exchanged for points which exclude brokerage fees, so a discount is automatically applied when paying with AERGO Gem. Users simply need to proceed with all payments with AERGO Gem. With this type of payment paradigm, payments become easy and seamless and you receive more discounts.</p><p>Issuers can settle accumulated points in the AERGO Gem and periodically receive AERGO Gem in the form of the Korean won currency. Through the GEMpay app, specifically on the administrator page, the issuer can glance and see the contents of the GEMpay payment and can then easily apply for a KRW settlement of the transaction. GEMpay provides consumers and businesses ample opportunities for discounts, efficient payment processes and more use-case for the AERGO token through these various mechanisms.</p> 💎 If you have a Gem double discount, you will have a lot to look forward to in the very near future! 😇 Provided is a three line summary of GEMpay for your convenience.   The AERGO Gem can be charged with AERGO tokens (ERC-20 and Native&nbsp;AERGO).  AERGO Gem can be used both online and&nbsp;offline.  Issuers can settle AERGO Gem in KRW through the GEMpay app on the admin&nbsp;page.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/gempay-so-how-is-it-written-dfbd16f5a30d">GEMpay: So How Is It Written?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

I’ll keep things short and to the&nbsp;point.</p> 🌎⚠️🔒 VaultAlert.net Release <p>With <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert</a> users can check the status of their VerusID Vault from anywhere in the world. VerusID Vault always protects your crypto assets even if your private keys are compromised. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/%EF%B8%8F-vaultalert-net-always-know-your-crypto-assets-are-safe-a20b4d537c61">Read more on VaultAlert here</a>.</p><p>Last month a lot of quiet progress was made on the development of the Verus multichain protocol. A new public testnet is on the verge of release with additional core protocol features. All effort is put into making Verus a decentralized and robust protocol that just&nbsp;works.</p> Exporting Currencies <p>Currencies on one PBaaS-blockchain can be exported to any other PBaaS-blockchain. This means that a currency can easily be made available on multiple blockchains.</p><p>An example: we have CHICKEN-currency on a PBaaS-chain and want it to be available on the Verus-blockchain as well. We export CHICKEN-currency to the Verus-blockchain for a fee and now CHICKEN-currency is available there too. It goes without saying that all fees go to the miners and stakers of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We can pay this fee in whatever currency we want, as long as it is available in the bridge-converter.</p><p>This fee is defined by the PBaaS-chain where you want the currency to be exported to, and thus can differ within all the multiple blockchains in the&nbsp;network.</p> Fee Structures <p>On the previous public testnet you could only make transactions if you had the native currency of the blockchain. Now you can use any currency that is in the bridge-converter as a fee to do operations on any PBaaS-blockchain.</p><p>Any currency on a blockchain can be used as fees to do transactions. Example: if you have USDC on the Verus-blockchain you don’t need VRSC to send the USDC around. It automatically converts a small fee of USDC to VRSC through a bridge-converter and uses that as its transaction fee.</p><p>This is an incredibly hard problem to solve. Yet it is working now on internal Verus test&nbsp;builds.</p> 🔊 Public Technical Updates from Mike Toutonghi <p>On January 8, 2022, Mike Toutonghi gave the community technical updates on the Verus Discord channel. 🔊 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6M0l0zjkQ0&amp;t=1168s">You can listen to it&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Awesome Mining&nbsp;Rigs <p>Some community members have shown their mining rigs in the #mining channel on <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discord</a> this month.

 New hires (and a new website!), buzzy op-eds, and an upcoming $SHFT campaign to kick off the Year of the&nbsp;Tiger. <p>2022 is here at Shyft Network, and there’s already a lot going on for our platform and community! From essential new hires to a couple of pointed op-eds and a new community campaign, see below for critical updates on where we’ve been during the last&nbsp;month.</p> Malcolm Wright Joins Shyft Network as Head of Strategy for its Global Regulatory &amp; Compliance Solutions <p>January saw the hiring of blockchain veteran Malcolm Wright who recently came on board to oversee the expansion of Veriscope and strategy and growth for upcoming core public network products, including institutional DeFi, NFTs, and our forthcoming DAO. Malcolm joins us from his former post as Chief Compliance Officer at BitMEX, where he’s been instrumental in global policy work and advocacy on behalf of the digital asset ecosystem. Malcolm is also the founder of InnoFi Advisory, a consulting firm supporting innovation and growth in DeFi, DAOs, and NFTs, and co-lead of the anti-money laundering (AML) working group at Global Digital Finance&nbsp;(GDF).</p><p>Read the full blog release below on Malcolm’s appointment to learn more about how he will be leading teams and all regulatory compliance and institutional strategy for upcoming extension systems of Veriscope.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/malcolm-wright-joins-shyft-network-as-head-of-strategy-for-its-global-regulatory-compliance-c599323a2af4">Malcolm Wright Joins Shyft Network as Head of Strategy for its Global Regulatory &amp; Compliance Solutions</a></blockquote> Shyft Network CEO Joseph Weinberg Op-Eds for CoinTelegraph &amp;&nbsp;CoinDesk <p>​​One month, two buzzy op-eds from our fearless leader Joseph Weinberg. Following the industry-shaking news coming out of DeFi protocol Wonderland regarding their pseudo-anonymous CFO “Sifu,” Joseph went deep on the battle between pseudonymity and trust in DeFi and crypto for Coin Desk as part of their Privacy Week series. Give it a read to learn more about the power of attested reputation and why it’s essential for the future of DeFi mass adoption!</p><p>Additionally, Joseph was quoted in another Coin Desk Privacy Week piece on the current state of Travel Rule compliance. Read it&nbsp;<a href="https://t.co/cqL2lKpaFv">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/privacyweek/2022/01/29/wonderlands-and-defis-anonymity-problem/">Wonderland’s (and DeFi’s) Anonymity Problem</a></blockquote><p>Earlier in January, Joseph also penned an op-ed for CoinTelegraph on an essential but often overlooked topic in NFTs: compliance. Following a year of exponential growth in NFTs, Joseph looked into a couple of negative instances for the sector regarding malicious activity and fraud. Joseph explained how battle-coded compliance, on-chain KYC, and regulatory solutions can help protect NFTs buyers and exchanges from setbacks and keep the industry moving in the right direction.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nfts-and-compliance-why-we-need-to-be-having-this-conversation">NFTs and compliance: Why we need to be having this conversation</a></blockquote> Another $SHFT Giveaway Campaign to Celebrate the Lunar New&nbsp;Year <p>New year, new $SHFT giveaway for our community! To buzz up excitement for the rollout of the upcoming Shyft Network DAO — and help select our community key signers — we’ll be giving away $SHFT tokens in Discord every day from February 3rd-10th to celebrate the Chinese New Year. We will also give away an NFT from the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fanggangnft">Fang Gang collection</a>.</p><p>As we did with our Doodle NFT giveaway, our Lunar New Year campaign will kick off on Gleam, and then daily token giveaways will take place in our <a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">Discord</a> channel via a giveaway&nbsp;bot.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/celebrate-the-lunar-new-year-win-a-fang-gang-nft-and-shft-603a892e56fd?source=user_profile---------2-------------------------------">blog post</a> for more details on the Lunar New Year giveaway and head to <a href="https://gleam.io/D47ca/shyft-lunar-new-year-giveaway/">Gleam</a> to join.

<p>Identity is a fundamental part of financial services. Identity of both individuals and organisations is critical in enabling or denying access to financial services (e.g. for payments, loans, claims) as financial institutions mitigate against fraud and risk. Given that successful/unsuccessful identification of an organisation determines whether or not it is able to do business (if transactions are legally permitted, if business loans are granted etc.), organisation identity is key to economic growth across the globe.</p>
<p>A large number of family-owned small businesses, the real job creators in most economies, struggle to get funding from financial institutions to secure their next 12 months of operation. This story is heard across all continents, and even in rich countries like the USA. In terms of access to credit from financial services, today many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) experience a familiar story of financial exclusion, often due to their identity information being deemed insufficient by financial institutions.</p>
<p>Beyond SMEs, corporations have their own pain points too. A company with a large number of resellers and suppliers knows the real risk of vast financial losses because of social engineering attacks. They could be next. The CISO can’t sleep at night knowing that the process of giving purchasing rights to authorised employees still relies on signing printed forms, and the inconsistency of old school line managers. Nothing that last quarter’s expensive pen test can help with.</p>
<p>In these two cases, building a bridge between people’s identities and organisations’ identities has the power to transform businesses digitally and deliver superior security, as well as increasing financial inclusion and growing economies. Such bridges cannot be built without strong pillars, and those pillars are the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/faq/what-is-a-legal-entity-identifier-lei/">LEIs</a> (Legal Entity Identifiers) – 20-character alphanumeric codes that identify legal entities in a global database.</p>
<p>This article explores the benefits of LEIs for financial use cases through three innovative business models pioneered by Ubisecure and our FinTech partners. Let’s define each of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. LEIs Help Fight against “Musty” Businesses 
<p>“The notes smelled musty, as if they had been stored under the floorboards” was said by the court. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/natwest-fined-264m-after-admitting-breaching-anti-money-laundering-rules">This blatant example</a> of NatWest shows how cash enters into the financial system in the millions to fund illegal activities when there are insufficient anti-money laundering checks. To mitigate against such situations, anti-money laundering regulations require banks and financial institutions to verify who exactly their customers are. Among many, one typical compliance requirement is called a <a href="https://rapidlei.com/ultimate-beneficial-ownership/">UBO declaration</a>, whereby a legal entity must declare its ultimate beneficial owners.</p>
<p>One innovative company, <a href="https://www.uboservice.com/">UBO Service</a>, is helping to streamline these declarations using LEIs. When a financial institution starts its compliance checks for a new customer, UBO Service captures information on the beneficial owners of the company. &nbsp;At this point, the LEI provides accurate entity identity information.</p>
<p>Ben Cronin, MD at UBO Service, said on the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/obliged-entities-ben-cronin-ubo-service/" title="Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast">Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast</a>: “Because there are a number of standards inherent in getting an LEI issued, that really feeds into our mantra about using official, appropriate and the best-in-class data sources when you’re onboarding a customer. So, by getting that right at that early stage, the lifecycle of that customer is much easier to manage if you capture the really accurate information at the start.”</p>
<p>An executive with the right to represent the company (e.g. a director) will then sign and confirm the full list of beneficial owners. If this matches the information captured from the registries, the financial institution (an obliged entity) has the confidence of having done the appropriate checks to onboard that customer.</p>
<p>A solution like UBO Service needs flexible APIs that allows it to generate LEIs and fetch live entity identity information from the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) repository in real time, and this is achieved by partnering with <a href="https://rapidlei.com/">RapidLEI</a>.</p>
<p>This innovative method of Know Your Business (KYB – KYC for B2B) is not exclusive to financial institutions. Other types of companies such as funds, foreign exchanges, state agents, lawyers, accountant firms can benefit from LEIs for KYB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. LEIs Help Include the Real Job Creators 
<p>Even in richer countries, small businesses can find it very hard to get access to credit. The main reason is that a company’s financial reputation is directly based on the owner’s financial score. What if the family, on top of not owning any property, never built up a good credit score to prove that they are reliable for re-payments?</p>
<p>The same anti-money laundering regulations that helped in the previous example are often a hindrance for SMEs. Due to these stricter regulations, a small company falls into a high-risk category from a bank’s perspective. What is the response from most banks? Well, they prefer not to do business with them at all. Consequently, these SMEs join the lonely island of financial exclusion.</p>
<p>So what’s the solution? FinClusive’s mission is “to bring secure, compliance-centered banking to the 2.5 to 3.5 billion people and businesses worldwide who are financially excluded or underserved”. It is <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/finclusive-validation-agent-gleis/" title="leveraging LEI issuance in its Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) solution">leveraging LEI issuance in its Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) solution</a> for financial institutions, who can in turn provide such SMEs with an affordable, verifiable identity in a simplified, digital workflow. When a new customer (e.g. an SME) wishes to open an account with a financial institution, the process of validating their identity and financial status will be done with a simplified, fully digital workflow. In this process of validating a new customer, the financial institution will generate an LEI for the new customer. </p>
<p>The power of creating an LEI for the SME at this early stage is huge. From the financial institution’s perspective, it will reduce the need to do further checks in the near future, as an LEI contains up-to-date information about both the legal entity and its owners and legal representatives, creating transparency around who is at the other side of this potential new deal and therefore reducing risk – resulting in greater inclusion.</p>
<p>Amit Sharma, Found and CEO at FinClusive, said on the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/identity-financial-inclusion-amit-sharma-finclusive/" title="Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast">Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast</a>: the LEI “legitimises them interacting with each other, which in an increasingly peer-to-peer world is hugely important for security and trust.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. LEI and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) 
<p>Among established companies who have access to financial services, it is very common to have corporate accounts with suppliers. Let’s look at an example: a large company – “Malco” – buying from a computer and electronics supplier – “eCommerce”.</p>
<p>Mike has a small bicycle accident on his way to Malco’s office (his employer). He’s safe and sound but his work smartphone gets badly damaged and inevitably has to be replaced. Mike goes to order a new mobile, logs into Malco’s supplier, eCommerce, using the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/representation-governance/">Sign in with RapidLEI</a> identification service – a service that links an individual’s identity to its verified organisation identity using the LEI. By using such a service, the supplier not only has securely authenticated Mike, but has verified that Mike has the legal right to represent Malco (in spending money on its behalf). That’s something a “Login with Google”-like service can’t offer.</p>
<p>Further, after a successful login, Mike sees that his preferred smartphone exceeds his current spending limits as originally authorised by Malco. No problem, he just clicks the “Request Higher Spending Limits” button and waits until the CFO approves it. Grace (CFO) sees the request and approves it, with every step done electronically and no cumbersome emailing back-and-forth/reimbursements etc. required. Finally, Mike receives a notification that his request has been approved, logs in again securely and completes the order.</p>
<p>Watch a video of this example:</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two key elements behind this successful scenario:</p>
 
 Authentication via Sign in with RapidLEI, which not only offers strong authentication but also gives to the service provider (eCommerce computer supplier) information on what are the user’s rights to represent their company. All this information is fetched in real time from the global repository of LEIs. 
 “eCommerce” uses advanced electronic delegation (a CIAM feature) to allow an admin user—the CFO — to transfer a set of roles and attributes to another — Mike. 
 
<p>Without this robust service that combines the best of CIAM and organisation identities, the story would involve paperwork and hand-written signatures, and it would be slower and less secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Summary 
<p>LEIs create a new spectrum of business models that bring benefits for all types of digital identity scenarios. The innovation I’ve just described delivers more than security and compliance, by ensuring that nobody is left behind in an island of financial exclusion. That’s the power of organisation identities and individual identities combined.</p>
<p>If you have your own use case that could benefit from the inclusion of LEIs/LEI issuance, find out more about <a href="https://rapidlei.com/partners/">partnering with RapidLEI</a> – the world’s leading LEI issuer, with a pioneering automated LEI issuance API that makes such use cases possible.</p>

 Let’s Replace Seed Phrases on Solana — Make Onboarding Easy for the Next Billion Users on both Wallets and Applications  Web3Auth receives Solana Foundation Grant, Launches Solana Torus Wallet, and Commits to 100% Support for all Wallets &amp; Applications <p>Along with scalability and transaction time, key management has posed a critical problem to any ecosystem gunning for mainstream adoption. And while the former two are solved on Solana, the current standard of managing keys via seed phrases is a far cry from perfect. Quantifiably, reports have shown that up to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-2-billion-lost-bitcoin-154948781.html#:~:text=Approximately%2020%25%20of%20all%20Bitcoins,billion%2C%20a%20new%20study%20says.">20% of all bitcoin in circulation has been lost</a>, users take up to 10–15 minutes to onboard onto any application/wallet and it’s almost every day that you hear stories of lost&nbsp;phrases.</p> A grant to push adoption — Eliminating seed phrases on dApps and&nbsp;wallets <p>It’s clear that in order to onboard the next billion users onto the ecosystem, something needs to change. These users need a seamless onboarding — an experience where the user can interface with the Dapp immediately without grappling with seed phrases. Fixing seed phrases has been Web3Auth’s mission and the Solana Foundation is glad to award us with a grant to help solve these gaps in onboarding for their ecosystem. Used already by Binance, Ubisoft’s NFT launch, Keplr (Cosmos), Rarible and other popular wallets/applications, we’re excited to share that today, Web3Auth’s threshold cryptography auth suite fully supports all Solana dApps and&nbsp;wallets.</p> How does Web3Auth solve the problem of onboarding for&nbsp;Solana?  1. Web3Auth Auth&nbsp;Suite <p>Web3Auth is a pluggable infrastructure that enables Web3 wallets and applications on Solana to provide seamless user logins for both mainstream and crypto native users. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets, and existing key management solutions, Web3Auth provides a familiar experience that fits every user thereby increasing conversion rates by up to&nbsp;64%</p><p>You can integrate Web3Auth into your application with a couple of lines of code. With web and mobile SDKs, you can customize its look for your application and even plug in your own existing auth/user base with the infrastructure.</p><p>Web3auth currently powers 500+ dApps and has over 8 million&nbsp;users.</p> 2. A state of the art Solana Torus&nbsp;Wallet <p>The Solana Torus Wallet is a result of months of collaboration between the development teams at Solana Labs and Web3Auth. It is a feature-rich non-custodial wallet built for users to securely store all digital assets on the Solana Blockchain and a gateway to access all dApps on Solana. The Solana Torus wallet is rich with some first-of-it’s-kind features such&nbsp;as:</p>  Meta transactions — Users can start interacting with your application without having any SOL in their wallets. Applications get to pay transaction fees on behalf of the&nbsp;users.  Fiat-to-crypto without KYC — Users can purchase crypto with credit card W/O KYC for up to a certain limited threshold.  Social logins — Users can log in straight into dApps under a min with non-custodial social&nbsp;logins.  Mobile &amp; web support — The wallet is mobile-first and supports both web and mobile flow with no need to download any&nbsp;app.   Experience the power&nbsp;yourself <p>Try out Solana torus wallet for yourself <a href="http://solana.tor.us">here</a>. You can get started with the wallet by directly integrating it <a href="https://docs.tor.us/solana-wallet/get-started">here</a> or via the Solana adapter&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter">here</a>.</p><p>You can access Web3Auth’s Whitelabel SDKs&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.web3auth.io">here</a>.</p> What’s next? <p>Web3Auth is committed to building an ecosystem and a lasting culture around the Solana blockchain to enable mainstream adoption among developers and users. You can look forward to Web3Auth supporting <a href="https://solana.com/riptide">Solana’s Riptide hackathons </a>throughout the year and for any developers looking to integrate, the Web3Auth team has been and continues to extend 100% support for dApps &amp; wallets on the Solana blockchain.</p><p>At the heart of it, this collaboration is all about empowering the developer community to onboard users into the ecosystem as seamlessly as it can get. Perhaps even better than the Web2 experience down the line. We don’t want any user to miss out on the possibilities that the world of Web3 has to offer to them just because they can’t remember their seed&nbsp;phrase.</p><p>About Solana&nbsp;Labs:</p><p>Solana is the most performant blockchain in the world. It gives developers the confidence to build for the long term by delivering predictable scaling without compromising security or composability. Solana’s performance is driven by intra-shard parallelism, which is capable of processing thousands of smart contracts at once, and by Proof of History, an innovation in distributed timekeeping that unlocks low-latency, sub-second finality across the global&nbsp;state.</p><p>Stay in touch with&nbsp;Solana</p><p><a href="https://solana.com/">Website </a>| <a href="https://docs.solana.com/">Docs </a>| <a href="https://twitter.com/solana">Twitter </a>| <a href="https://t.me/solana">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/solana">Discord </a>|&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/solanalabs">Linkedin</a></p><p>About Web3Auth: Web3Auth, is a pluggable non-custodial infrastructure that enables Web3 wallets and applications to provide seamless user logins for both mainstream and Web3.0 users.

<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p></p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p></p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p></p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Trial Dock Certs Today</a></p><p>Trial Dock Certs here and create, issue, and verify verifiable credentials without writing a single line of code. Dock Certs is the perfect tool for organizations that want to benefit from verifiable credentials without having to worry about integrating or changing current workflows. All data can be easily downloaded in various ways or can be kept in the safe platform of Dock Certs. </p><p>Dock Certs is an alpha release and we encourage users to trial the platform and feedback on the product, let us know what they like, what they don’t like as well as describe any future feature requests they’d like to see.</p><p>What are Verifiable Credentials?</p><p>Starting with the basics, Verifiable Credentials are an open standard for digital credentials. They can represent information found in physical form, such as a passport, license, or graduation certificate, as well as things that have no physical equivalent, such as ownership of an NFT. </p><p>Why Do We Need It?</p><p>The average professional presents 10 certificates to a job site. A qualified doctor, practitioner, or professional worker must present a copy of a physical certificate to a business in order to work. Today, the holders of the credentials must keep these qualification papers in order and up-to-date while the organization is left to manually verify the qualifications. Issuing, printing, and delivering these paper or PDF certificates can take weeks and months and the verifying process can take just as long to complete. There are many notable problems with paper or PDF certificates:</p>  Paper certificates and PDF credentials can be easy to tamper with creating fake credentials. This makes verifying the credentials difficult for an organization and undermines the trust in the training and educational body that issues the credentials.  If the verifying process by the employer is not done correctly, fraudulent certificates and compliance documents can go unnoticed, therefore putting the worker at risk and the organization at fault.  Paper certificates can be lost or damaged.  <p>The Use of Dock Certs</p><p>Dock Certs mitigates the risk of these incidents occurring, allowing users to create, issue, and share verifiable credentials and decentralized identities without writing a single line of code.</p><p>Users can <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">sign up to Dock Certs</a> and begin creating verifiable credentials and decentralized identities in a few simple clicks. Organizations can benefit from the functionality of Dock’s technology without requiring any coding or development work. </p><p>After creating the credential, organizations can issue these to the holder via a link in an email or by sending a PDF/digital certificate. Another option of issuing is to send the credential via a JSON file that the holder can store in their credential wallet. These verifiable credentials are different from their non-verifiable counterparts as they can be instantly verified using cryptographic methods. This leaves no room for fraudulent activity, making it easier for the job site to verify credentials and maintain the reputation of the training/education body. </p><p>The organization can store all credentials they’ve created and issued on Dock Certs. Alternatively, if the business wants to take ownership of the credentials, they can be saved via a PDF download or a JSON file. </p><p>Dock’s API for Organizations Who Have the Time</p><p>For those organizations that have in-house developers and want a more custom look and feel to the credentials they issue, Dock’s API can be integrated with current workflows. Developers can create and issue verifiable credentials that sit on the holder's device and have the option to create a decentralized identity on the blockchain which is anchored to the verifiable credential. </p><p>Even if the organization ceases to exist, the credential and decentralized identity still exist and can be instantly verified. </p><p>Verifiable credentials via Dock’s API and Dock Certs are almost impossible to tamper with allowing any third party to easily verify credentials. </p><p>More to Come</p><p>Dock Certs is the perfect tool for organizations that want to benefit from verifiable credentials without the need for coding and development. <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Trial Dock Certs today</a>.</p><p>We have more updates launching in the coming weeks, keep an eye out for the release of Dock’s credentialing wallet and verifier tool, making it easy to store and verify credentials.</p>

 Looking Forward — SocialKYC  self-owned, trustworthy social account credentials…now what? <p>Written by Paul Pomerleau — Developer Relations and Community Manager at BOTLabs GmbH, the company that initially developed KILT Protocol.</p><p><a href="https://socialkyc.io">SocialKYC</a> recently launched. In short, it’s a service that lets you get credentials which validate that you own various social accounts. Right now that means email and Twitter…although I hear rumours that Discord and GitHub are coming soon. Cool, so I have these credentials, why not just use my account directly? Because by using credentials to prove your ownership of an account you protect your data, break data silos, increase trust, portability and&nbsp;value.</p> Protect Your&nbsp;Data <p>When you share your credential, you can decide not to disclose the details. This is called selective disclosure. For example the <a href="https://clankilt.io/raffle">Clan KILT raffle</a> asked for email or Twitter credentials to trust you’re not likely to be a bot. This is enough, so it doesn’t need to know your details. But it could ask for opt-in disclosure (it doesn’t, but it could) in order to count the entries that are also registered to the newsletter or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">@KILTProtocol</a>. This puts you entirely in control and whatever you choose, no trust is&nbsp;lost.</p><p>Websites typically ask for email and password, but what happens if the database gets hacked? Data stores from multiple sources get compromised, hackers build data sets over time and build more complete pictures of you, the mark. But do sites really need email and password? The email often serves as a persistent identifier, and the password proof of ownership. With SocialKYC we can use credentials to ensure requirements, and leverage DIDs and server side secrets to generate site unique user ids. Services would get a persistent identifier unique to the user, proof of ownership and as a bonus, added trust if they want by verifying additional credentials. And if this database gets compromised? If data is a hacker’s ammunition, this just gives them&nbsp;blanks.</p> Break Silos <p>In recent years “sign-in with XYZ” has provided both developers and users convenience for signing up and signing in. What happens here is that you allow a third party access (if enabled) to your XYZ account. But you also allow (if enabled) data from the third party to feed back to XYZ. Now yes there’s more concern with user privacy these days, and yes for the most part services are compliant with giving users choice to share or not. But these are businesses and their business is data… your data, and you’ve ever tried to navigate user agreements and privacy settings, choice and data protection isn’t exactly at the forefront of the UX. SocialKYC does exactly that, it puts choice and data protection at the forefront of the UX. A service will use sign-in with XYZ because they trust their registration process. With SocialKYC none of that trust is lost but the data feed between the two parties is severed. Congratulations, your data is&nbsp;free.</p> Increase Trust <p>SocialKYC credentials are just trust transferred from other accounts… so same trust right? Maybe for one credential, but not so for many. “A single twig breaks, but the bundle of twigs is strong. — Tecumseh”. How much would you trust that the owner of an email address is human? Now how much would you trust that the owner of an email address, Twitter account, GitHub account and Discord is human? But it goes further, what if you need to know that the owner is an employee? What about requiring disclosure of corporate email, GitHub and public Twitter. The system could verify the email domain, check the GitHub username and for good measure make sure the employee is following the corporate Twitter before authenticating. Then using some DID hash identifier (or some better approach), the user can get a session and the disclosed details used for authorization are discarded.</p> Increase Portability <p>The utility of your socials increases as credentials for two reasons, portability and economic leverage. Social web2 credentials aren’t inherently portable. Right now, where can you use your Twitter? Twitter itself of course, then with services that integrate sign-in with Twitter. In other words it’s limited to a small subset of web2. Credentials on the other hand… simple maths. Okay not so simple maths. But it can be used anywhere you can prove ownership of the DID via cryptographic proof. Yes we need tools to manage these handshakes, but anyone can build them for any of our social worlds. Brick and mortar yup, web2 check, web3 sure, metaverse absolutely. Online, offline, off-chain and on. The identity is yours, it goes where you&nbsp;go.</p> Increase Value <p>When you consider a social network with a central data silos… who gets the economic value and leverage? They do; of course they have the data. With SocialKYC who has the data? You do; So who gets the economic value and leverage? Exactly. Business, employers, nonprofits… all these entities don’t want to connect with the social network, they want to connect with YOU. But the network has your data, so connecting with it is the next best thing. So these entities pay the data silo to run their algos and hope to reach their intended demographic. With SocialKYC they don’t have to hope, they can verify, and instead of paying the silo for the right to push unwanted ads, they can offer you the value. And you can seek them out based on your wants and needs and form a real relationship. Conversion rates, click-thru rates, views and shares are good, cash-in hand, real ROI and lifelong customers are&nbsp;better.</p> Looking Forward <p>I can imagine web2 login alternatives for easy data compliance, email sign-in at local membership clubs with discounts for social followers, e-sports tournaments based on university emails, corporate email smart locks, value driven advertising and a million other things we haven’t thought of. So now what? Who can say, but I’m optimistic and the possibilities are endless. Now it’s up to us the decentralised community to build it to its needs. Check out our community <a href="https://trello.com/kiltprotocol">Trello workspace</a> to find inspiration, vote and discuss ideas: join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a>, a DAO-inspired community, focused on outcomes and impact. We meet every Friday to mobilize, educate, inspire and build. KILT Protocol is purpose built for identity and credentials; an infrastructure layer for trust, and it’s yours to shape…time to claim independence.</p><p>Find Paul Pomerleau on <a href="https://twitter.com/paulpomerleau_">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmpomerleau/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/users/923613352507375766">Discord</a> to engage with&nbsp;him.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/looking-forward-socialkyc-3edf0bfa0d73">Looking Forward — SocialKYC</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Take a look in your physical wallet.&nbsp;Maybe you have some credit cards and probably identification of some kind.&nbsp;Do you have a roadside assistance card, perchance? The cards we carry and present every single day feel different than many common digital credentials (such as federated credentials) that identify us and communicate our attributes online, but that gap is narrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the identity ecosystem looks at emerging paradigms for trust and individual agency in our online interactions, we see use cases where the federated identity model we know so well in the real world might work to provide more digital autonomy and control.&nbsp;We call this model the “presentation model” because an end user collects and controls the presentation of their credential when and where they choose.&nbsp;The presentation model does not replace online federated models, but instead, each model can be used where most valuable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part one of our series introduced our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/06/microsofts-5-guiding-principles-for-decentralized-identities/">5 guiding principles for decentralized identities.</a>&nbsp;In this and subsequential blogs, we will continue to dive deeper into the technical basics of decentralized identity. Read on for part two of this five-part series on decentralized identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part I:&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://aka.ms/identityprinciples">The Five Guiding Principles</a></p>
<p>Part II: &nbsp;The Direct Presentation model &lt;--&nbsp;You are here</p>
<p>Part III: The Basics of Decentralized Identity</p>
<p>Part IV: Deep Dive: Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>Part V:&nbsp; Deep Dive: Anchored Decentralized Identifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we use identity-related credentials in the real world, they often have different properties than digital credentials. There are two separate ceremonies in most cases: issuance and presentation.&nbsp; If you have spent any time at a department of motor vehicles or a passport office, you’ve seen what an issuance ceremony can be – it is usually an intensive process, but the tradeoff is that once you have a credential like a driver’s license or passport, you can use that credential for multiple purposes, at multiple places, over a long period of time. You, the “holder” of the credential, can choose to present your credential as a (mostly) voluntary exchange, in which the verifier of your credential can grant you access to some kind of resource - for example, they might allow you into a nightclub, or allow you to check out a library book.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s use a concrete real-world scenario: roadside assistance. Many of us are members of automotive clubs which advertise national and international coverage in the case of vehicle mishaps. After a sign-up song and dance and giving them my annual fee, they issue me a card I stuff into my wallet and forget about. Until one fateful night when my car breaks down in a location I am unfamiliar with. In this case, a miraculous thing happens – I can pull my auto club card from my wallet, and present that card to a garage that has never heard of me before, and a tow truck will arrive to help me. This issue-then-present credentialling model that has long powered the physical world is ready for adoption in the digital world too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technical name for the model at work here is called the Direct Presentation model. A credential is issued, and then held for a long period of time with intermittent voluntary presentations to many different verifiers. To put that back into our example, my auto club issues me a card, which I hold in my wallet for years (maybe decades!), and I might choose to show that card to a garage when I need a tow, or possibly to a store to get a discount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s switch gears (see what I did there?) to look at the digital world as you use it today. Rather than giving me a card I can store in my wallet, websites (and other services) create a user account. My resource access is tied to this account, and I must prove I own the account by authenticating to the website. After I have authenticated, there is a limited amount of time where the website “knows” who I am and can vouch on my behalf to applications and to other domains, introducing me to resources while sharing data about me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process of an authoritative Identity Provider who redirects me to resources and introduces me as a valid account within their domain with certain attributes and entitlements is called the Federated Presentation model. Going back to my night on the highway, instead of presenting my road service card to the garage, I’d have to borrow their point of sale (POS) terminal to authenticate to the auto club website, then be redirected to the garage website - with my card information included in the redirect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these models got me my tow truck. They both have important qualities, and there are a number of use cases where either could do the job. But each has a few use cases where they can really shine. In the case of federated presentation, enterprise scenarios such as single sign-on (SSO) provide a compelling combination of convenience and security. Likewise, the digital version of the direct presentation model has great applications - where users benefit from increased agency in their dealings with businesses, governments, and even each other. We’ll cover the key qualities of the direct presentation model in the rest of this blog, and then in our next blog, we can talk through what high level architectural requirements we foresee. Remember, my car has broken down, I’m in a remote and unfamiliar place, and I need to leverage the roadside assistance that I have purchased in advance to get service from a garage that I have never previously done business with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Common qualities of the Direct Presentation model (Real-world and digital) 
<p>My choice of when and what gets presented</p>
<p>As I sit in my broken-down car, I have options. I might have roadside assistance coverage from multiple providers. I might even have a coupon for a free tow I picked up from the roadside diner or prefer to use a credit card. If I do, I can debate which offers the best deal, and present what works for me. This sounds like a simple thing, but it is tougher to do in the federated model because I can’t look through my wallet to remember which clubs I’m a member of or what coupons I’ve squirreled away. Instead, the garage would have to try to help me remember which auto clubs I might be affiliated with by showing me logos until I see one I recognize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything goes through me</p>
<p>When I interact with the garage, I’m the person presenting my credential and I’m the person getting a receipt back. No real-time interaction is needed with the auto club, which is lucky because it’s the middle of the night. But I am aware of the interactions in real time, and if I want to, I can compare my receipts from all the breakdowns my car has had, see trends in what kinds of transactions I’ve been a part of, and even find places where I’ve been overcharged or where the promises of the transaction haven’t materialized. This is because I was an agent in the direct presentation. In a federated model, the logs of what data was passed about me are likely available but I would have to collect those logs from many different places – if they’re made available to me - to see the full picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Present it anywhere</p>
<p>Imagine the case where every garage had to have a separate contract with every regional auto club whose members might want to use their services. The overhead of such a system would be high. Instead, the garages and regional clubs all agree to abide by a common association’s trust framework that establishes the rules and practices that everyone must follow. In the direct presentation model, standards help establish the rules which allow easy establishment of associations, and there’s a potential for direct presentation to make it easier to set up common trust frameworks. This is what allows me to present my membership card from Alberta on a dark highway in North Dakota – where both I and the driver can be confident in the transaction. If everyone uses a common presentation model, it opens the doors to make it easier for trust frameworks to be formed and governed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unique properties of the Digital Direct Presentation model 
<p>There are few things that couldn’t work for me as I sit in my broken-down car with a physical auto club card, but that could work if I were using a digital credential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selective disclosure</p>
<p>When I hand my auto club card to the tow truck operator on the dark highway, I cannot prevent that person from reading everything printed on that card. If the card were to show my home address, the truck driver would know where I lived. But with a digital credential, I can choose what to release (and what not to) during presentation – in this example, I can simply release the fact that I qualify for a tow, and nothing else. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wallet has a brain</p>
<p>Another unique quality of a digital direct presentation is that because software can help, my wallet has a brain and can be a trusted advisor. As I sit in my car, shivering, I might make a bad choice about which garage to call. A digital wallet might cross-reference my choice in garages with the Better Business Bureau and suggest I choose a business with a rating higher than one star, saving me from a bad experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 But what IS the digital version of Direct Presentation? 
<p>There are several important initiatives already underway that qualify as direct presentation – including mobile Driver’s License projects based on the ISO 18013 specification, as well as various ePassport initiatives. Vaccine passports are another case where the direct presentation model is emerging, with initiatives such as <a href="https://vci.org/">VCI</a> and <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass (GHP)</a> gaining traction.&nbsp; In the identity world, we at Microsoft see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> specification as a Data format with long-term potential to let the industry move towards multi-purpose direct presentation. We hope to see some of the models converge over time as they mature, and we’ll deep dive on each of these options over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Federated Presentation and Direct Presentation are complimentary 
<p>You might be wondering: do we see the direct presentation model replacing federated models? No. We believe that federated and direct presentation models will co-exist, and that each model lends itself to solving different problems. Federated presentation is a modern workhorse when it comes to use cases like enterprise single sign-on, and there will continue to be many places where involving the user in a presentation ceremony will never make sense. The good news is that we have specifications that can help federated and direct models to co-exist, and we are working in the <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, and other standards bodies to find an interoperable balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want a sneak peek, check out Kristina Yasuda and Torsten Lodderstedt at the recent OAuth Security Workshop, talking about some of their work that leverages the&nbsp;Self-Issued Identity Provider section of the OpenID Connect specification. This work truly bridges the worlds of Direct and Federated Presentation models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 But wait, what does this have to do with Decentralization? 
<p>If you’ve noticed that we’re not talking a lot about decentralized tech here, don’t be shocked. Microsoft sees unique and differentiated value in how decentralized technology can fulfill many of the criteria listed above, and we’re excited to dig deeper into what decentralized technology can deliver in later posts! But our goals center on both human and business outcomes. As such, we can and will use decentralized technology where it’s needed and useful, and we’ll do our best to discuss with the community the trade-offs and advantages in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next? 
<p>Now that we have a foundational understanding of the Direct Presentation model and its place in the digital world, our next installment will discuss how we build a reference architecture that could deliver on our principles using the Direct Presentation model. We’ll start with a high-level architecture and slowly drill into the various parts of that architecture, describing the standards at play and how we can see those standards pushing us closer to the 5 guiding principles. There are quite a lot of standards – we’ve constructed a <a href="http://linktr.ee/decentralizedidentity">handy linktree</a> to let you easily index into the various specifications we are participating in and/or implementing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is going to be fun!</p>

<p>The fourth quarter of 2021 rounded out a year of volatility and growth <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/31/volatility-ruled-crypto-markets-in-2021-from-69k-bitcoin-to-elon-musks-dogecoin-to-the-moooonn/">across the cryptocurrency sector</a> and cemented the end of a year when <a href="https://twitter.com/reesew/status/1433524984723349507?lang=en">pop culture</a> became aware of NFTs. Governments responded to the rise of digital currency too: <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/12/09/bitcoin-miners-hashrate-record-activity-china-crypto-crackdown-kazakhstan/">Miners relocated</a> after China cracked down on cryptocurrency mining and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) provided <a href="https://t.co/t77D51EpO6">more definition</a> around rules under development. This new guidance <a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1453917982892036101">falls in line</a> with the role Civic is assuming for permissioned DeFi environments.</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>At Civic, our Q4 2022 was all about building trust and safety within the broader blockchain ecosystem. In October, we announced our new <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">Developer Hub</a> and <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-pass-integration-guide/">Civic Pass integration guides</a>. Civic Pass is our identity layer that allows for permissioned dApp platforms for web3, whether they are DEXs, an NFT mints or marketplaces, metaverses or otherwise.</p>



<p>Headed into the Solana Breakpoint conference, we announced a new suite of tools for creators, including <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/introducing-new-tools-for-creators-to-build-trusted-communities/">free bot prevention</a> using Civic Pass technology. While at Breakpoint, Civic and Identity.com created some beautiful <a href="https://twitter.com/identity/status/1460753722552688642">Identity.com Tech Showcase videos</a>; I took to the stage for a panel about <a href="https://youtu.be/0ZimB8y8HYc">building cross-chain</a>; and we hosted a Twitter Spaces event with our new partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1457771416409886721">Snowcrash Labs</a>, a premier NFT marketplace, launching Q1 2022. We made a concerted effort to embed our technology further within the Solana ecosystem by strengthening partnerships while we were there, and we’ve seen dividends across a short timespan from these efforts.</p>



<p>To close out November, Civic and Identity.com sponsored the <a href="https://twitter.com/redacted_j/status/1465364695766949888">Solana Labs Miami Hacker House</a>. During that time, our on-site crew worked together tirelessly with the Metaplex team to <a href="https://twitter.com/juamps/status/1471546856203116547">integrate bot prevention</a> from Civic Pass with Candy Machine. And, our head of product joined other NFT luminaries for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrr9DJIJuBs">panel discussion at DCentral Con about identity</a>.</p>



<p>We wrapped up December by <a href="https://allart.medium.com/announcing-all-art-ido-and-nft-drop-a92554e66962">partnering with ALL.ART</a>, which owns SolSea, to provide KYC and KYB services for their end-of-year IDO. We also announced a partnership with <a href="https://blog.magiceden.io/p/magic-eden-open-listing-nft-marketplace?">Magic Eden for trust and safety services</a>. To close out the month, we partnered with SolSea on the first-ever NFT drop for a US federal campaign, which benefited <a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1471553890893975552">Shr</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1471553890893975552">i</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1471553890893975552">na Kurani for Congress</a>.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>In the fourth quarter, Civic accumulated a total online readership of more than 73M. Though many of our partnership announcements were made via Twitter this quarter, we did make a <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/introducing-new-tools-for-creators-to-build-trusted-communities/">new product announcement</a> during Solana Breakpoint in November with our new suite of NFT creator tools. The announcement made headlines in <a href="https://decrypt.co/85492/combat-solana-bot-problem-civic-unveils-digital-id-nfts">Decrypt</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/civic-launches-free-tool-to-combat-nft-hungry-bots-on-solana">CoinTelegraph</a>, <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2021/11/08/civic-launches-ignite-pass-tool-to-eliminate-bots-in-nft-mints-and-drops/">Invezz</a> and <a href="https://www.cointrust.com/market-news/civic-launches-free-tool-for-bot-free-nft-minting-and-dropping">Cryptopian</a>.</p>



<p>And, we made great strides in compliance-related thought leadership as FATF made announcements and the DeFi space continued to grow. Our head of risk and compliance, Chris Harding, made appearances on a panel for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmUjvkPYXNs">LA Blockchain Summit</a>, at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KIhF6M3uO8">Reimagine conference</a> and on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/71VDJTahPBq4m5wfRx5Sxi">CryptoNews podcast</a>. He also penned <a href="https://thedefiant.io/crypto-regulation-defi-adoption/">an op-ed for The Defiant</a> about regulation in crypto, and interviewed with both <a href="https://www.gokhshteinmedia.com/article/where-the-worlds-of-blockchain-and-identity-verification-intersect">Gokhshtein Media</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/crypto-security-2022-prepare-for-more-defi-hacks-exchange-outages-noob-mistakes.htm">Crypto News</a>.</p>



<p>Coming Soon</p>



<p>What a ride 2021 was! We’re poised for further growth in 2022, and we’re also pruning some programs to keep up with the growth, including our Verified by Civic Pass program, which we recently closed. During Q1, expect to see more partnership announcements as we continue building out the DeFi side of our business. In fact, in Q1 2022 we’ve already integrated Civic Pass with KYB for a new partner that is attracting institutional investors, Credix. We’ve also partnered with Liquid Meta to <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/liquid-meta-partners-with-civic-technologies-to-bring-capital-liquidity-to-permissioned-dapps/">bring capital liquidity to permissioned dApps</a>. And, we’ll be adding features to our NFT products as we continue to respond to dynamic community needs.&nbsp;</p>

 As you probably know, Anonyome Labs has created two popular products based on personas or digital identities we call&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=what+is+a+sudo">Sudos</a>: 



<p></p>



  A persona-based application (<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;consumer app)&nbsp;  A persona-based services platform (<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>), for enterprise developers to include persona-based services into their consumer products (MySudo also uses this).&nbsp;  



<p>Having multiple personas (digital identities or Sudos) means the user can compartmentalize (silo) their daily activities and gain greater&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;protection. (Read our popular deep dives on&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;as a data privacy protection strategy, why&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/why-data-privacy-experts-urge-businesses-to-proactively-protect-customer-data/">data privacy matters</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">what consumers want</a>.)</p>

<p>This patent outlines the design of a persona application and persona services that allow a user to create personas for their own use and where only they know the identity and can operate the personas that they own. The persona services do not have the information to relate users to personas.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Administering Proxy Identities, Patent #: US10356052, July 16, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This patent outlines the design for the persona services. Each user can have multiple personas, each persona fitted with identity attributes such as phone number, email address, virtual payments information, contacts, and avatar, and with capabilities such as communications, browsing, anonymous payments, and reputation. The persona services also allow for a marketplace of personas so that personas can be bought and sold between users.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Building, Extending and Managing Interactions Between Digital Identities and Digital Identity Applications, Patent #: US10931650, February 23, 2021 (Issued)</p>



<p>This is a more detailed examination of the design of the persona applications and persona services, including verifying the distribution of applications built from the persona services.</p>

				  The power of decentralized identity is that it decentralizes governance—enabling flexible solutions within a privacy and security-driven framework.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:trevor@indicio.tech">Trevor Butterworth</a></p>
<p>The past year has seen decentralized identity emerge from its “talk” phase and into its market phase. At the same time, the market is increasingly aware of the need for decentralized identity solutions to manage &nbsp;immediate problems, like the privacy and security challenges in banking and finance, &nbsp;the how to share and verify personal health data in hospitality and travel, and the need for constant, frictionless authentication in zero trust security applications.</p>
<p>But there is also the growing realization that decentralized identity is the way to manage verification and security in decentralized finance, Web3, and the metaverse, while allowing each to maintain its underlying decentralized integrity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable, secure, and interoperable identities will be critical to controlling the “Internet of Everything,” otherwise known as the spatial web, where an ever-expanding range of cameras and sensors using hyperspatial markup language will allow digital objects to engage with non-digital objects. It’s not just the drone that will have a verifiable identity; the parcel it carries will have one too.</p>
<p>All of this makes 2022 the year of the decentralized identity solutions, a chance for this long-evolving and much-talked about technology to show how it can solve the verification problems inherent in Web 2.0 and create trust in Web 3.0. Now is the time for these solutions to articulate how they will save money, make money, and mitigate risk. To do that, obviously, we need products and services; less obviously, we need to understand that the role of governance is to serve the solution and the customer.</p>
<blockquote>
 Enterprises want to buy solutions that solve problems, not engage in philosophies that make deployment feel like climbing a mountain of documentation 
</blockquote>
<p>Given decentralized identity’s long gestation, it is inevitable that a lot of talk accumulated into governance documents and governance frameworks. Every new technology needs to be talked into existence while the engineers catch up: We have to talk about something to figure out how to build the solution; we have to talk about problems and pain points, standards and protocols and technical requirements. </p>
<p>But there comes a point when all this talk must recede into the background documentation. Right now, it can often seem that governance frameworks are the solutions and the technology is incidental or worse, inadequate.</p>
<p>This is a problem, and it is compounded by a miasma of confusing &nbsp;terminology, sequential processes, and technology and governance “stacks.” These &nbsp;are difficult to process into a simple “aha” if you are among the uninitiated — which is most of the potential market for this technology. Decentralized identity has not yet found its equivalent to the “1,000 songs in your pocket,” what-it-all-means message that successfully launched Apple’s iPod. That kind of messaging is critical, and governance frameworks do not, frankly, speak with that clarity and compulsion.</p>
<p>This is not to say that we don’t appreciate the importance of shared standards, clear technical requirements, and best practices: we do; but they are not the solution—no more than governance is for cloud services. They serve the solution &nbsp;and the solution serves the customer’s needs. </p>
<p>It is time for solutions to take the spotlight.</p>
<blockquote>
 Governance should be flexible, pragmatic — and decentralized 
</blockquote>
<p>You may have noticed that this article has, so far, avoided mentioning “self-sovereign identity” or SSI. SSI is what the identity community originally called decentralized identity—and still largely does. But it can be a problematic term for some audiences because it can be read as saying that in decentralized identity there is no such thing as society, there are just &nbsp;“selves”— self-sovereign identities that are all co-equal.</p>
<p>While a foundational principle of self-sovereign identity is that individuals should be in control of their own data and identity, the reality is that there are other kinds of sovereign entities besides individuals: nations, institutions, membership organizations, companies, each of which carries its own governance history and culture and which imposes rules on its subjects and negotiates and interoperates with other sovereign entities.</p>
<p>If any of these entities chooses to adopt decentralized identity, it is making a clear commitment to a privacy-preserving, secure technology, simply because that’s the technology’s function and not just a feature. But it is also going to deploy the technology in a way that accords with the goals of its existing governance because that is what sovereign entities do. </p>
<p>Some of these deployments are going to be <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/4/247949/2021-Perkins-Coie-LLP-Health-Passport-White-Paper.pdf">less than fully self-sovereign</a>, and we must recognize that governance frameworks for decentralized identity are going to be negotiations with existing governance requirements; there needs to be flexibility.</p>
<p>This is the reason why we advocate “machine-readable governance” as an architectural solution.</p>
 
 First, machine-readable governance simplifies how decentralized identity works: The user software handles the rules for information flows and authentication, which are established and published by the entities with authority for governing the use case. 
 Second, this architecture makes these rules transparent. 
 Third, and critically, it enables these rules to function offline through caching, which, when you think about it, is an essential feature in any digital identity verification system; trust can’t be dependent on a Wi-Fi signal. 
 
<p>But there’s a broader value here too. The architecture of machine-readable governance architecture enables nations, institutions, and people to set up and participate in systems that directly address their problems without having to transfer power to unnecessary intermediaries; power, instead, remains with the existing governing bodies. </p>
<p>This, we believe, makes the system more trustworthy, as we don’t need another layer of bureaucracy to ensure that we can trust the third-party trust registry from enacting tolls, excluding participants, or exercising monopolistic power.</p>
<p>We also believe it is a mistake to think that governments are going to show up and submit to governance institutions and frameworks that are not of their making or under their control. Similarly, any decentralized identity solution that posits, “first, we create a league of nations,” isn’t just doomed, it actively dissuades people from taking the technology seriously because it makes unrealistic government participation a prerequisite for the technology.</p>
<blockquote>
 Futureware is a vampire that will suck the life out of opportunity 
</blockquote>
<p>No matter how well-meaning, governance recommendations that require implementing technology or standards that aren’t presently available — and may not be available for months or years — are acts of marketing self-sabotage. There must be a path to immediate implementation. It is vitally important that this path does not foreclose better solutions in the future, but there must be a path.</p>
<p>We understand the fear of institutionalizing the wrong software solution and then being stuck with applying band-aids for years. This is, after all, what landed us with the problem decentralized identity is designed to solve — the internet’s missing identity layer for people. But the benefit of open-source software development is that it promises continuous improvement.</p>
<p>If we deliver a good open-source solution today — in the face of many terrible centralized and federated alternatives — it will keep evolving as technology improves.</p>
<blockquote>
 &nbsp;Ockam’s Decentralized Razor 
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, for all those in the decentralized identity field, we should remember the value of parsimony, famously attributed to themedieval philosopher William of Ockham: Do not multiply entities beyond necessity. In other words, don’t create rules and processes and bureaucracies without established and compelling reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>The aim of decentralized identity governance should be the greatest number of applications from the smallest number of rules and in the shortest possible number of pages. Confusion and complexity will block adoption. </p>
<p>Consider what scientists discovered about effective communication to policymakers: If you can’t explain the science in a half page, chances are you’ll lose the attention of those with the power to implement change.</p>

  Holochain: a marlinspike to undo the knots

<p>In response to many questions about Holochain’s fitness for Web3, and in the face of growing criticisms of Web3, my colleagues and I share why we think Holochain is capable of building Web3. Not Web3 as it exists today — centralised, expensive, and finance-oriented — but a truly people-powered web built with distributed ledger tech that isn’t blockchain-based.</p><p>What are people saying about Web3? Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1473165434518224896">can’t seem to find evidence of it</a>. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey says it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098">not what it appears to be</a>. But I think the <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">sharpest critique</a> comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/moxie">Moxie Marlinspike</a>. As co-creator of the Signal protocol that protects the privacy of <a href="https://www.signal.org/">most</a> <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">of</a> our <a href="https://matrix.org/">online</a> <a href="https://messages.google.com/">conversations</a>, he knows something about cryptography, but he isn’t too excited about ‘crypto’.</p><p>Moxie’s definition of Web3 is simple: it’s the class of technologies that wants to offer the features of Web2 — services that let us easily connect, create, interact — with the decentralised freedom that we enjoyed with Web1.</p><p>To most people, Web3 means blockchain. Moxie exposes some fairly serious challenges that blockchain faces — not just its ability to handle real-world applications, but also whether people even care about the problems it’s trying to solve.</p><p>When my colleagues and I read the article, we got excited. Moxie seemed to be making the <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae">same</a> <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/perspectives-on-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies-7ef391605bd1">diagnoses</a> <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/cryptocurrencies-are-dead-d4223154d783">we’ve</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/#back-story-agent-centric-data-enables-collaboration">made</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">for</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/satoshi-nakamoto-and-the-fate-of-our-planet-2/">years</a>. We also realised — hey, Holochain addresses a lot of the problems he’s talking about! I’d like this article to be an invitation to a larger conversation both with him and the broader ‘Web3 world’.</p> A short history of tangled webs <p>True to the original spirit of the internet, Web1 was all about decentralisation. Its big innovation was the hyperlink, allowing any author to connect their work to someone else’s without permission. And because anyone could create web pages and run a server (if they had the technical skills), anyone could be a publisher.</p><p>Slowly and then suddenly, everyone wanted to join the web party — but not everybody had the technical skills. So Web2 built big servers and easy-to-use software, then invited the whole world. It spread out a generous banquet, offering the power to create not just documents and links but conversations, calendars, photos, videos, music, lists, diagrams, and more. And by getting us all together in the same room, it really did become a party — an explosion in our capacity to connect and interact with each other.</p><p>However, we know how the story has unfolded since then. Web2 looked like a good idea at the time, but it’s turned out to have a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/opinion/facebook-privacy.html">dark side</a>. We appear to have become ‘<a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/">the</a> <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/">product</a>’, as they say, not the authors of our own lives as we’d thought.</p><p>The centralisation that enabled the capture of our online lives is inherent in the design of HTTP, the protocol that powers the web. Over the years, more and more people have called for a re-decentralisation — a new web, a ‘Web3’ that avoids the mistakes of the original web by design.</p><p>Why do we need to reimagine the web? If the first web was already decentralised, why can’t we just go back to it? Moxie argues that the reason is simple: “people don’t want to run their own servers, and never will.”</p><p>Is this true? The 3000+ HoloPort owners worldwide would seem to disagree. But I think Moxie is really saying that people just want to get down to the business of doing what they want to do, not managing a bunch of tech. For most of us, the computer is just a tool, not a hobby.</p> Real reasons people don’t want to go back to Web1 and run their own servers   Setup cost: You need a domain name and a stable IP address, which are either complicated or expensive.  Technical burden: Generally, server management is extremely complicated, and getting more so every day.  Security issues: Running web server and application software can expose your machine and network to security vulnerabilities.  Fragility: You’re the sole authority for your little piece of the web, so you bear the consequences if your server suddenly gets popular — or goes offline.  Isolation: Your server is just that — yours, and yours only. The power of Web2 is that it brings everybody together in a shared space. Does anybody want to give that up?  <p>Blockchain simply doesn’t have an answer to most of these challenges. And it doesn’t need to — blockchain wasn’t designed to be the basis for Web3. It was designed to record events, particularly changes of ownership on a bunch of crypto tokens.</p><p>At best, problem #3 (security issues) is solved by the fact that blockchains ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandbox</a>’ their running code. Problems #4 (fragility) and #5 (isolation) are irrelevant, but only because everybody has to store everybody else’s stuff anyway. Here we see a new problem — “everybody else’s stuff” is a lot of stuff, so it becomes <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html">too costly</a> for all but the biggest players to run their own blockchain server.</p><p>Sounds like centralisation all over again. And Moxie describes how that’s playing out in reality — centralised, unaccountable gateways are now our windows into the supposedly decentralised ledger.</p><p>On top of that, the high operating cost puts a price tag on every online activity, which means that most Web3 applications justify the cost by being financially-oriented — currency trading, investment derivatives, property speculation, gambling, and ‘play-to-earn’ games. Moxie suggests that this is why the world is actually so excited about Web3. It’s about the money, not the decentralisation.</p> Holochain is fit for the real Web3 <p>What if you could get the benefits of decentralisation for free while you used your normal, everyday apps and services? Well, Holochain can help — it neatly addresses all five barriers to running your own server. Here’s how.</p>  Setup cost: In a Holochain app people connect securely, privately, and directly to each other’s computers, either via public IP addresses or through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT">relay</a> service. Holochain creates an ‘overlay’ on top of the underlying network, making fixed IP addresses and domain names unimportant.  Technical burden: You don’t need to care or even know you’re running a personal ‘server’. It’s just a background process that’s built into the app, running on your computer with no configuration required. Really, it’s easy to set up, and it’ll get even easier in the future — you should <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/">give it a try</a>!  Security issues: Holochain has a strictly defined network protocol that validates every interaction with your peers. It also sandboxes the back-end of every application, preventing it from gaining direct access to your filesystem and network.  Fragility: You’re responsible for the original copy of your data, along with a small slice of everyone else’s data — and only for the applications you use. If you go offline, other people serve your data for you. Everyone shares the load evenly — with a Twitter-like app, we predict that you’d only accumulate 20 MB of data per year, equivalent to three photos or five seconds of video.  Isolation: Holochain is intended to deliver apps with the decentralisation of Web1 and the connectedness of Web2. Each application has its own shared database that every participant can read from and write to. In other words, you and your peers are each other’s ‘Web2’ — not an organisation that sees you as the product.  <p>There are still a couple centralisation points — the aforementioned proxy relay and a service called a ‘bootstrap’ are both hosted on remote servers. But they are about as irrelevant as Signal’s own servers are — they’re just places for peers to find each other and pass encrypted messages back and forth. Besides, you can always run your own, and you <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/683">don’t even need them</a> if you and your peers are in the same local network.</p> Shared protocols, evolution, and innovation <p>There’s one more downside of running your own web server: it’s hard to get everyone speaking the same ‘language’. It wasn’t such a big deal back in the Web1 days when the only language was ‘documents and links’. But as we started using the web for mass-scale, real-time interaction, it became important. We needed to make sure we were all speaking the same ‘tasks and meeting invites’ language as our colleagues, the same ‘posts and likes’ language as our friends and relatives, the same ‘money transfers’ language as the stores we shopped at.</p><p>Web2 platforms give us these shared languages — let’s call them ‘application protocols’ — as well as a central place to route every interaction through. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">Attempts</a> to decentralise this have only been moderately successful.</p><p>Moxie argues that protocols evolve slowly, while platforms evolve quickly. That’s because a platform can make decisions without waiting for a whole crowd of others to reach consensus. But here’s the thing — some protocols don’t need to evolve quickly. As long as a ‘base protocol’ is versatile enough to let people create and express things in an unlimited range of fit-for-purpose application protocols, it can be as stale and boring as it likes. And it’s precisely the decentralisation, versatility, and stability of these base protocols — HTTP, email, and yes, Bitcoin and Ethereum — that allow platforms to innovate so quickly on top of them.</p><p>It’s true, though, that an application’s evolution can slow down if you try to decentralise it. So what will it take to enjoy the benefit of rapid innovation while maintaining healthy decentralisation?</p>  Users must be able to painlessly upgrade to a new application protocol across the entire network when they need to.  Users must have choice over the versions of the application protocols they use — in other words, a group must be empowered to make its own governance decisions.  <p>Holochain does all that! Its base protocol is versatile enough to build any sort of interactions people want to do online: social media, team productivity, currencies, carbon credits, micro energy grids, and so on. These are regular, real-world applications, not just applications that “[move] all aspects of life into an instrumented economy” as Moxie describes it. For these application protocols, we’ll soon be adding the ability for users to automatically download and activate an update — no manual steps needed.</p><p>Additionally, in contrast to Web2, where everyone is forced into the same experience, a Holochain application can give groups a choice about whether to accept protocol changes, while also being able to keep all their existing data. For instance, if a chat app releases an upgrade, one team in a company can upgrade because they want the new features, while another team in the same company can stay on the old version because they prefer the UI. They run the app; it’s their choice.</p> Empowering everyone <p>That only leaves one problem: how can we, as users of an app, be part of the design of the apps we use? How do we choose the rules that govern our interactions, gain a stake in the design of the protocols our apps speak? Moxie suggests that this might be the thing worth working on if we want to change our relationship to technology.</p><p>We see a lot of promise in ideas like <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/">end-user programming</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/01/07/what-is-low-code-development/?sh=76ddde41496d">low-code development</a>. Done right, they will empower people to create their own apps.</p><p>We also see an <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/reusable-modules/introduction/motivation/">encouraging trend</a> in the Holochain development community. Small, composable components are being developed, with the intention that beginning developers can reuse them easily without having to become experts in Holochain application design.</p><p>And projects like Neighbourhoods’ <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/low-code-marketplace.html">low code marketplace</a> are another important step in that direction. It aims to offer a place where developers can offer generic, customisable parts that users can connect like Lego blocks into applications that suit their needs, without requiring any programming knowledge at all.</p><p>Finally, the developers behind <a href="https://youtu.be/6ZiUekVAg3A">Generative Objects</a>, a low-code development tool, are working on adding Holochain support so that people can create their own applications from scratch, again without a line of code.</p><p>But we believe that digital tools are useful for more than just everyday apps, as important as they are. Traditional modes of governance are <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/the-future-of-governance-is-not-governments-9c894e17b1cd">failing us left and right</a>. We intend to help spark a Precambrian explosion of innovation in collective governance patterns. This requires an upgrade of humanity’s ability to create, express, and practice those patterns together. And we think that a software toolkit like <a href="https://holochain.org/">Holochain</a> will be a crucial part of making that happen.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Phillip Messerschmidt</a></p><p>As advisors, we at KuppingerCole Analysts have regular contact with our customers. The topics discussed range from strategic directions to operational challenges in different IT security and IAM topics. We often encounter similar, ambitious questions and challenges - an example from the Zero Trust environment: How can we implement Zero Trust? What do we need to do in order to have implemented the Zero Trust initiative to a large extent by the end of the year? This attitude is not limited to Zero Trust, but can be found in almost all subject areas.</p>
<p>Even if the ambitions behind it are respectable, it is nevertheless always equally concerning how often buzzwords are chased without understanding their substance and creating the appropriate basis. Let's stay with some Zero Trust examples: Does device management exist? Are all identities that want access known and recorded? How is the zoning of the networks done? It is not uncommon to get questioning faces in reaction to these questions.<br><br></p>
<p>The realization of trend themes often requires operational excellence</p>
<p>In the resulting discussion of the experiences listed above, it often turns out that the customer has not yet dealt with the topic well enough. In fact, this is not a problem, because it is our task to sensitize our customers accordingly and to provide them with the necessary knowledge. Nevertheless, organizational, functional, and technical weaknesses are uncovered in this process. Customers have discussions with us about Cloud Identity and Access Management with third party involvement, but they have not yet managed to execute an end-to-end joiner-mover-leaver-process for internal employees without any media discontinuity and without manual activities. Another example is application onboarding, which is often planned without a list of all applications and their responsibilities. Such circumstances make it not only significantly more difficult but also more dangerous, as sensitive information can be exposed. Therefore, the realization of trend topics often requires that companies have operational excellence or at least a high level of maturity in the corresponding areas.<br><br></p>
<p>Automation is the operationalization of formulated structures and rules.</p>
<p>When designing their IT landscape, many companies claim to be individual and special. However, this attitude does not stand in the way of successful automation to increase overall efficiency. Regardless of the degree of individuality of a company, decisions are always made according to certain rules and contexts in both manual and technology supported implementations. As soon as a context can be captured by a rule, it can be operationalized and automated. Technically, nothing stands in the way of such automation!<br><br></p>
<p>Use case: Policy based access control (PBAC)</p>
<p>A classic example of automation in the IAM environment, is the move to Policy Based Access Control (PBAC). Historically, many applications that were previously hosted on-premises were managed locally by an administrator. This type of access management is typically very costly, difficult to keep track of, and prone to error or manipulation. In line with the complexity and workload, departments were also made accountable and empowered to manage themselves via a Role based access control (RBAC) approach. The delegation relieved the administrators, but only shifted the workload and further increased the complexity. To relieve complexity, attribute-based access control (ABAC) is used to assign access rights based on functional decisions, which are based on attributes of identities, in an automated way. This is the first step towards automation!</p>
<p>Rapid digitalization has made it increasingly easy for companies to obtain more information and data about users. User Behavior Analytics (UBA) are capturing more and more processable context about users that can be used in automation. Location and time of a login, device of access, destination of the request can all be captured, processed, interpreted and used to make an informed and rule-based decision. If this decision is mapped technically, a policy is created to control access (PBAC). Operationalizing and organizing these policies not only dramatically increases efficiency, transparency and agility, but also sustainably reduces costs and risks.<br><br></p>
<p>Identity &amp; Process Automation: Where and How to Find Efficiencies?</p>
<p>If we return to the initial question, the answer is relatively simple and yet difficult to grasp: Automation potential can be found everywhere!</p>
<p>The challenge is often to identify and formulate the implicitly applicable rules that may already exist and have applied for a long time. The actual automation of a formulated rule is then usually the smaller step.</p>

 Count Calories Better, Diet Healthier — Guide Of All What You Need To&nbsp;Know  The Dos and Don’ts of Counting&nbsp;Calories  Do: <p>When it comes to counting calories, there are a few dos that will help you stay on track and achieve your weight loss&nbsp;goals.</p>  Use a <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator/">diet calories calculator</a> app or website to track your intake. This will ensure accuracy and make it easier to stay on&nbsp;track.  Read the nutrition labels of all foods you eat. This will help you know how many calories are in each&nbsp;serving.  Create a calorie budget for yourself, and try to stick to it. This will help you lose weight gradually and&nbsp;safely.  Do make sure to include all foods and beverages in your calorie count. This includes those pesky little extras like condiments and sugar-free beverages.  Do be honest with yourself about how many calories you need to lose weight. If you want to lose 1–2 pounds per week, then aim to consume 500–1000 fewer calories than you burn each&nbsp;day.  Do adjust your calorie intake as needed. If you hit a plateau or if you start gaining weight, then adjust your calorie intake accordingly. A good rule of thumb is to reduce your intake by 100–200 calories per day until you start seeing results&nbsp;again.  Do focus on healthy foods that are low in calories but high in nutrients. This will help ensure that you are getting the most out of your diet while still losing weight. Some great options include vegetables, fruits, lean protein, and whole&nbsp;grains.”  <p>Check also: <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/benefits-of-red-beans/">Red bean&nbsp;benefits</a></p> Don’t: <p>If you’re trying to lose weight, counting calories is a great way to do it. But there are a few things you should avoid if you want to see results. Here are four don’ts of counting calories:</p>  Count calories without also considering other factors such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat. All of these nutrients play important roles in your health and should be taken into account when counting calories.  Skip meals or go too long between meals. This can cause you to become ravenous and overeat later&nbsp;on.  Obsess over every little calorie that you consume. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and obsessing over every calorie will only lead to stress and unhealthy eating&nbsp;habits.  Don’t forget about fiber. Fiber is another important nutrient, and it’s especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough fiber each day to help keep you full and support your weight loss&nbsp;goals  Don’t forget about carbs. Carbs are also an important part of a healthy diet, and they’re especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough carbs each day to help burn fat and fuel your workouts.  Don’t forget about protein. Protein is an important part of a healthy diet, and it’s especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough protein each day to help burn fat and build&nbsp;muscle.  Don’t overdo it. It’s important not to eat too few calories, as this can actually slow down your metabolism and make it more difficult to lose weight. Try to find the right balance for you, and don’t cut more than 500–750 calories per&nbsp;day.   The Pros and Cons of Calorie&nbsp;Counting <p>Calorie counting is a popular way to keep track of the number of calories you eat each&nbsp;day.</p><p>This can be an effective way to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. However, there are some pros and cons to calorie counting. The Pros of Calorie&nbsp;Counting</p>  You are in control of your food choices. When you are calorie counting, you are able to choose the foods that fit within your daily calorie budget. This can help you make healthier food choices and avoid unhealthy foods.  <p>2. It is an easy way to track progress. By keeping track of the number of calories you consume each day, you can see how your diet changes over time. This can be helpful in monitoring your progress and seeing if your current diet is working for&nbsp;you.</p><p>3. It helps you become more aware of portion sizes. Often when we don’t count calories, we tend to underestimate how much we are actually eating. Calorie counting can help teach you about proper portion sizes and how much food constitutes a serving&nbsp;size.</p><p>4. It may increase your metabolism&nbsp;. Some research has shown that people who calorie count may have a higher metabolic rate than those who do not count calories&nbsp;. This could lead to more successful weight loss in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>The Cons of Calorie&nbsp;Counting</p><p>1&nbsp;. It can be time consuming&nbsp;. Keeping track of every calorie that goes into your mouth can be a tedious process&nbsp;.</p><p>2&nbsp;. You may become obsessed with numbers&nbsp;. Focusing too much on numbers can lead to eating disorders and unhealthy relationships with food&nbsp;.</p><p>3&nbsp;. You might develop restrictive eating habits&nbsp;. Restricting yourself from certain foods can cause negative thoughts about food and body image&nbsp;issues</p> How to make Calorie counting effective   Make sure you’re accurately counting your calories. A lot of people make mistakes when counting, either by underestimating or overestimating the number of calories in their food. Use a calorie tracking app or website to get an accurate estimate of the calories in your&nbsp;meals.  <p>2. Don’t obsess over every little thing. If you eat a cookie or have a slice of pizza, don’t worry — just adjust your calorie intake for the rest of the day to make up for it. Trying to be perfect can be counterproductive and lead to feelings of guilt and frustration.</p><p>3. Find a method that works for you. Some people prefer to track their calories manually, while others find it more helpful to use an app or online calculator. Figure out what works best for you and stick with&nbsp;it.</p><p>4. Be patient. Losing weight takes time, so don’t expect results overnight. Stick with it for several weeks before deciding if calorie counting is right for&nbsp;you.</p><p>5. Make a list of foods that you enjoy and that are healthy. This will help you stay on track with your diet and make it more enjoyable.</p><p>6. Try to stick to healthy, nutrient-rich foods as much as possible. This will help you meet your nutritional needs while keeping your calorie intake in&nbsp;check.</p><p>7. Avoid processed foods whenever possible. These tend to be high in unhealthy fats, sugars and sodium, which can sabotage your weight loss&nbsp;efforts.</p><p>8. Drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks. Water is essential for good health and helps keep you feeling full throughout the day. Sugary drinks are packed with empty calories and can quickly derail your diet&nbsp;plans.</p> conclusion <p>We do Counting Calories for three purposes:</p><p>If you’re trying to lose&nbsp;weight:</p><p>Counting calories is a great way to help achieve your goals. There are many online tools and apps that can help with&nbsp;this.</p><p>Second, make sure you’re burning more calories than you’re eating. This can be done through exercise and physical activity.</p><p>Finally, give yourself time. It may take a while for your body to adjust to your new calorie intake, so be patient and keep up with your healthy&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Check also: <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/best-parsley-tea-brands/">Best parsley tea&nbsp;bags</a></p><p>If you are looking to gain&nbsp;weight:</p><p>You need to consume more calories than you burn. The average person needs around 2,000–2,500 calories per day to maintain their weight, so if you want to gain weight, you’ll need to eat more than&nbsp;that.</p><p>It’s best to spread your extra calories throughout the day, with three main meals and a couple of snacks in between. You can use a calorie calculator to help you determine how many calories you should be eating each&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are looking to maintain&nbsp;weight:</p><p>By simply eat as much as you&nbsp;burn.</p>

<p>Buying a home in today’s market is challenging from start to finish for many consumers. Reduced supply, increased demand and competitive bidding wars riddle the path to homeownership. The struggle doesn’t end there, according to recent homebuyers who responded to Finicity’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">2021 Mortgage Survey</a>, which is available now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many are still struggling with the decades-old headache of collecting mountains of paper documentation for underwriting. This antiquated holdover from a bygone era continues to add unnecessary stress and anxiety to processing, underwriting and closing a mortgage.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of what borrowers are going through in this white-hot market, Finicity surveyed over 1,000 consumers who have purchased or refinanced a home in the last year and compiled the insights into <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">High Demand, Higher Hurdles in the Mortgage Market</a>, which details these pain points and provides a window into how the mortgage lending industry can evolve to meet the shifting needs of today’s homebuyers and refinancers.</p>
 Big Opportunities for Change in the Mortgage Process 
<p>Many consumers approach their home purchase with excitement and, understandably, a bit of trepidation. But while today’s homebuyer grits their way through a challenging shopping and bidding environment, any excitement can quickly turn to angst when they are met with a cumbersome and laborious mortgage loan process.</p>
<p>Refining the mortgage process means identifying and removing pain points for homebuyers. Our survey uncovered that 89% of borrowers believe the loan application experience was as stressful if not more than the home buying experience itself. Eliminating friction during the mortgage process is a critical step in building loyalty and meeting the expectations of today’s homebuyer.</p>
<p>Many homebuyers were surprised to learn that physical documents still make up a large portion of mortgage documentation. Seventy-two percent of respondents were surprised or very surprised at the volume of paper that’s still used during the mortgage process.&nbsp;</p>
 Going Digital Means Reduced Stress 
<p>The majority of today’s homebuyers are accustomed to navigating life digitally, and the mortgage experience should align with this.</p>
<p>Only 12% of respondents indicated that they were uncomfortable permissioning their personal financial data to a lender. Meeting consumers where they feel most comfortable helps save them time and reduces unnecessary stress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Borrowers who used digital verifications were less likely to say the loan process was the most stressful part of buying or refinancing a home, and 83% of respondents using digital verifications said their loan processing time was shorter than expected or met their expectations.</p>
 Embracing Change 
<p>For many industries, the COVID-19 pandemic has been the catalyst to transition to digital solutions. While the mortgage industry has started down this path as well, there is still work to be done. Reducing friction through digitization of manual loan documentation and minimizing the document-chasing between lender and borrower is a key component of this transformation.</p>
<p>Consumer-permissioned data delivered through our open banking platform allows for digital verifications throughout the mortgage process, significantly reducing the time it takes to close. In today’s mortgage landscape, this can mean the difference between consumers stepping into their dream home after a quick, seamless loan process, or losing out to a buyer who is using digital lending for a quick close.</p>
<p>The complete findings are now available in Finicity’s most recent mortgage survey, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">High Demand, Higher Hurdles in the Mortgage Market</a>.</p>

 GiD Report#197 — How Solana makes web3&nbsp;possible <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-196-how-crypto-is-changing-the-central-banks-72586652b6d2">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  How Solana makes web3&nbsp;possible  Tweet of the week — It’s time to&nbsp;build  The U.S. approach to regulations and innovation in a&nbsp;nutshell  The IRS learns that people care about their identity frameworks — a&nbsp;lot  Stuff happens   1. How Solana makes web3&nbsp;possible Anatoly Yakovenko, Photo:&nbsp;Solana<p>The arrival of the SMTP protocol in 1981 — based on a proposal by Jon Postel — allowed people to directly communicate with each other via email. Later, the invention of Tim Berners-Lee’s world wide web in 1989 and corresponding protocol HTTP allowed people to access websites through a&nbsp;browser.</p><p>These developments from the early internet allowed people to easily share information.</p><p>Satoshi’s 2009 white paper on Bitcoin took that one step further — describing an elegant system combining cryptography, consensus mechanisms, and networked computers that would enable people to directly exchange value online without an intermediary for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>The next breakthrough would come in 2015 — the year Ethereum went live. Building on Satoshi’s core concepts, Vitalik Buterin conceived a system that enabled decentralized computation. Smart contracts are essentially programs or applications that run directly on the blockchain.</p><p>That framework would set the stage for use cases such as NFTs and DeFi, which came of age last&nbsp;year.</p><p>This concept of decentralized computation would plant the seeds for&nbsp;web3.</p><p>What if we could build an entire generation of decentralized applications on the blockchain?</p><p>Pioneers in the space immediately ran into roadblocks.</p><p>When Alameda Research and FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried assessed Ethereum as a platform for building a global, decentralized exchange, it was a nonstarter.</p><p>SBF — as he’s often referred to — earned his stripes at Jane Street Capital, one of the most storied prop shops on Wall Street. As such, the bar for their decentralized exchange was high. Coming from a world where high-frequency trading is the norm, your trades have to move as fast as information flows. Cost is also a major concern as fees directly eat away at your trading model. Scalability is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>In other words, Ethereum’s technology was too slow and too expensive.</p><p>That’s where Solana came&nbsp;in.</p><p>As Peter Thiel described in his book, Zero to One, you’re not moving the needle unless your offering is an order of magnitude better than what came&nbsp;before.</p><p>A host of so-called “Ethereum Killers” had been floating around that were potentially better than Ethereum but objectively, not that much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Released in 2019, Solana was different. Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko would incorporate learnings from his time as an engineer at Qualcomm working on cell networks into his development of the Solana blockchain.</p><p>The result is a blockchain that can process 50,000 transactions per second (tps) compared to Ethereum’s 15 tps for a fee that’s fractions of a penny. Given the massive growth in Ethereum’s ecosystem in recent years, computation fees can cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars during peak usage — something anyone who’s tried to mint a popular NFT drop on Ethereum intimately understands.</p><p>For SBF, Solana was fertile ground for developing his vision around decentralized finance.</p><p>Here’s Sam <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/yahoo-finance-live-nov-09-144954467.html">speaking at Yahoo Finance and Decrypt’s Crypto Goes Mainstream back in November</a>:</p><blockquote>“Solana is one of the few currently existing public blockchains that has a really plausible road map to scale millions of transactions per second at, you know, fractions of a penny per transaction, which is a scale that you need for&nbsp;this.”</blockquote><blockquote>“That is not where a lot of other blockchains have been focusing, including ethereum.”</blockquote><p>For the industry at large, Solana’s throughput and cost profile has taken decentralized computing from zero to one, paving a path forward where web3 is a legitimate reality.</p><p>Naturally, developers have followed suit — including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who announced last fall that he would <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/reddit-cofounder-ohanian-invests-100-million-social-media-solana-blockchain-2021-11">invest $100 million in decentralized social media projects built on&nbsp;Solana</a>:</p><p>Today, much of the NFT and DeFi ecosystem lives on Ethereum, but what we’re seeing in the market is the product of the last few&nbsp;years.</p><p>If Github commits are any indication, much of the next generation stuff — what will emerge in the market in this next cycle — will likely live on&nbsp;Solana.</p><p>The rise of Solana’s futures and derivatives markets also suggests growing institutional participation:</p><p>Solana is not without its issues. With development only starting in 2017, the network is still going through growing pains given its explosive growth.</p><p>In a rocky start to the year, the blockchain <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/01/25/solana-founder-anatoly-yakovenko-crypto-crash-blockchain-instability/">suffered 6 outages in January alone</a>. There’s clearly plenty more work to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Competition is also heating up as other next generation chains vy for market share including Avalanche, which offers its own scalability promises.</p><p>For end users, that can only be a good&nbsp;thing.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about Solana, you can check out this <a href="https://twoprime.io/is-solana-the-next-institutional-crypto-investment/">report published last week by Two Prime</a> (via /gregkidd).</p><p>It’s where we got these nifty charts&nbsp;from.</p><p>You can also check out <a href="https://youtu.be/wx6ZvC91n4Y">Greg’s conversation with Anatoly from our YouTube channel here</a>.

Tweet of the week — It’s time to&nbsp;build <p>The stock market — with crypto in tow — is having a rocky start to 2022, apparently the worst&nbsp;ever.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/stock-market-2022-worst-start-year-ever-73c15533-b443-4290-8693-c215df7a44ab.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>State of play: As of the end of trading yesterday — the 16th session of the year — 2022 is now, officially, the worst-ever start in the history of the S&amp;P 500, according to data from Ned Davis Research, a stock market research&nbsp;shop.</blockquote><p>The silver lining? Market downturns can be the best time to build — without the frothy distractions of all the hype and conference parties. (Solana began development during the last crypto winter in&nbsp;2017.)</p><p>And as SBF suggests, <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1485839809683800065">in a tweet responding Solana’s outages</a>, there’s still plenty of building required:</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/defi-shakeout-seen-as-liquidations-lead-to-crypto-user-exodus">DeFi Shakeout Seen as Liquidations Lead to Crypto User&nbsp;Exodus</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/ftxus-8b-valuation-f0352455-ddb9-4dbe-bced-b64a0ade8645.html">FTX US raises at an $8 billion valuation.</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/TravisXRP">/TravisXRP</a> — <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-may-allow-crypto-mining-and-gold-backed-stablecoins-lawmaker-says/">Russia May Allow Crypto Mining and Gold-Backed Stablecoins, Lawmaker Says — Regulation Bitcoin&nbsp;News</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bitcoin-is-failing-its-original-mandate-that-doesnt-mean-its-worthless">Bitcoin Is Failing Its Original Mandate.

The U.S.’s regulatory dilemma <p>First, here’s what happened — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-26/crypto-lending-firms-celsius-network-gemini-face-sec-scrutiny">Bloomberg</a>:</p><blockquote>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing cryptocurrency firms Celsius Network, Voyager Digital Ltd. and Gemini Trust Co. as part of a broad inquiry into companies that pay interest on virtual token deposits, according to people familiar with the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><blockquote>The SEC enforcement review focuses on whether the companies’ offerings should be registered as securities with the watchdog, said the people, who weren’t authorized to speak publicly. The firms are able to pay customers rates higher than most bank savings accounts by lending out their digital coins to other investors, a practice that the SEC and states including New Jersey and Texas have said raises concerns about investor protection.</blockquote><p>Here’s also what happened — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-27/you-get-the-crypto-rules-you-want">Matt&nbsp;Levine</a>:</p><blockquote>The other story is about&nbsp;… well, see, there’s a billion-dollar Ponzicoin called Wonderland, 1 which as of about 11 a.m. today was advertising an annual percentage yield on staked deposits of EIGHTY-THREE THOUSAND, SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY-SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT (83,687.5%), and it is in the news today because one of the pseudonymous people running its treasury is allegedly a famous convicted serial scammer who previously co-founded Quadriga CX, which was the biggest Canadian crypto exchange before it collapsed in an exit scam in which the other co-founder apparently stole most of the money and may or may not have faked his&nbsp;death.</blockquote><p>And here’s Matt Levine aptly summarizing the current state of affairs when it comes to crypto regulation in the U.S. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-27/you-get-the-crypto-rules-you-want">his Money Stuff newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Man, come on. Read that sentence. If you were an SEC enforcement lawyer and you had the choice of (1) calling up the “revolution needs rules” guys to tell them that under SEC precedents interest-bearing crypto accounts paying 8.05% have to be registered as securities or (2) looking into the very popular billion-dollar Ponzicoin run by an exit scammer that is offering an 83,000% APY to U.S. investors&nbsp;… just&nbsp;… what are we doing&nbsp;here?</blockquote><blockquote>What is the difference between Gemini and Wonderland? I think two critical differences are:</blockquote>  Wonderland is hilariously riskier and less compliant than Gemini in every&nbsp;respect.  Gemini answers the phone when the SEC&nbsp;calls.  <blockquote>There is a certain drunk-under-the-lamppost element to current U.S. crypto regulation. If you incorporate a company in the U.S. and walk into the SEC’s office and ask “hey what are we allowed to do,” the answer is “almost nothing.” If you just launch the wildest thing in the world pseudonymously, call it “decentralized,” and advertise eye-popping investment returns to U.S. investors, then, I mean, I don’t want to give you legal advice, but look&nbsp;around.</blockquote><p>As Matt points out, it’s also why Facebook/Meta’s crypto project failed to&nbsp;launch:</p><blockquote>Or we talked yesterday about stablecoins. Specifically we talked about the fact that Facebook Inc. (now Meta Platforms Inc.) announced in 2019 with enormous fanfare that it was going to launch a stablecoin and work closely with all of the relevant regulators blah blah blah, and it went to the Federal Reserve and said “what do we need to do to launch a stablecoin,” and the Fed said “you must bring me the egg of a dragon and the tears of a unicorn,” and now the Facebook stablecoin is shutting down.

People care about their identity frameworks — a&nbsp;lot <p>People’s trust in institutions are at an all-time low. They’ve also become increasingly cognizant of and educated on what’s at stake with the ever-expanding digitization of their lives, accelerated by the pandemic.</p><p>And so what the IRS likely expected to be a lowkey update regarding new digital identity requirements has boiled over into a firestorm of controversy.</p><p>It started with <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/irs-will-soon-require-selfies-for-online-access/">a blog post by Brian&nbsp;Krebs</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-be2ba817-5ac9-4f10-a17b-53c32dc21747.html">a quick overview from&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The IRS’ move to require some taxpayers to use facial recognition to identify themselves is reigniting a debate over how the government should use such technology.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Critics warn that, without sufficient guardrails, information collected by one agency for a seemingly benign purpose could easily be re-used in other&nbsp;ways.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: The IRS will soon require taxpayers to provide a third-party company — ID.me — with a combination of documents and a video selfie to verify their identity before undertaking certain online interactions with the&nbsp;agency.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>What they’re saying: “This announcement signals one of the largest expansions of facial recognition technology in the U.S. and there is no question that it will harm peoples’ privacy,” says Caitlin Seeley George, campaign director at Fight For the&nbsp;Future.</blockquote>  “This will essentially create a new, massive database for law enforcement to use to track people without their knowledge,” Seeley George&nbsp;said.  ID.me’s terms of service, she notes, give the company the right to share peoples’ data with police, government and “select partners.”  <p>And the latest — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-a1ca9ca9-57da-4a9a-aa1f-cd601dd0b8ae.htm">Axios</a>,&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>A growing number of civil rights groups are calling on the IRS to sever ties with ID.me over concerns about the company’s face recognition technology as well as its lack of transparency.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: A coalition of groups, including Fight For the Future, the Algorithmic Justice League and EPIC, have launched Dumpid.me, an online petition urging individuals to indicate their opposition to the agency using the private company’s video selfie-based technology to verify identity.</blockquote>  Meanwhile, as Bloomberg reported on Friday, the IRS is weighing alternatives to ID.me. “Treasury and the IRS are constantly in search of ways to improve taxpayers experience, and are looking into alternatives to ID.me,” the agency confirmed in a statement to&nbsp;Axios.  <blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Catch-up quick: The IRS plans to require taxpayers who want to do certain online transactions to use ID.me’s video selfie-based authentication system.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote>  Those concerns were exacerbated after revelations that ID.me compares selfies to a database of those who have previously used its service, despite previously denying using so-called one-to-many face recognition.

				  The Indicio TestNet is a robust platform that’s free to use for developers, making it the best way to dive into the powerful technology behind decentralized identity.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>The Indicio Network contains three networks: a MainNet for hosting solutions, a DemoNet for demonstrating products, and a TestNet for development and experimentation. We’ve made the TestNet free for developers to use — making it ideal for exploring, building, testing, and demonstrating your ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the open-source technology of Hyperledger Indy, Ursa, and Aries, the Indicio TestNet has a stable 100% uptime, is monitored by professional staff, and offers limited technical support (for greater technical support we offer a range of highly competitive plans).</p>
<p>Why Indicio?</p>
<p>There are several decentralized networks that offer some form of testing network. But here’s why the Indicio TestNet is the best option:</p>
 
 It’s free: The Indicio TestNet is and always will be free to use.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
 
 It’s professionally staffed and monitored: We don’t rely on volunteers to keep our networks running — our networks are supported by engineers whose job is to ensure they are always stable and accessible.<br> 
 
<p></p>
 
 It’s stable: We understand the critical importance of network stability; the Indicio TestNet clocks at 100% uptime. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Tools are already set up for ease of use: We have a monitoring tool and a scanning tool already implemented; they can tell you which nodes are live and what has been recently written to the network at a glance. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Cross-network test ready: We see a future of interoperable credentials and networks. Our TestNet is ready to test your interoperability with other products from other networks. Issue and verify on multiple networks, explore the possibilities! 
 
<p></p>
 
 Straightforward governance: We believe in simple and streamlined governance with clear principles and rules. You’re here to build — not hear us philosophize! 
 
<p></p>
 
 Node Operator Program: For those that want to really dive into decentralized identity we offer the unique opportunity to host a node on the network. This will give you hands- on experience running part of the network as well as significantly more technical support. See the perks here: <a href="https://indicio.tech/node-operator-program/">https://indicio.tech/node-operator-program/</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
 
 Community resources: Because our network is based on open-source technology, we have a repository of additional resources we can point new users to for general information and assistance. This provides a more immediate place to seek help with your project in addition to the more hands on support offered by our technical team.&nbsp;

Decentralized identities offer compelling advantages for organizations to benefit from increased identity assurance levels, interact securely and with higher confidence with partners, suppliers, and other ecosystem members, and reduce the administrative load during onboarding or ongoing verification and/or validation of credentials. This guide supports organizations by showing how decentralized identity can fit into an Identity Fabric, exemplified in the KuppingerCole IAM Reference Architecture.

<p>While the ethos of cryptocurrency was partly driven by anonymity at its inception (see <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin White Paper</a>), mass adoption and subsequent fraudulent activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing conducted by both individuals and institutional investors forced legislators to fill the regulation void in cryptocurrency. Thus, cryptocurrency had to adapt to KYC regulations and implement such policies in order to screen properly their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance and Coinbase, both leaders in crypto trading worldwide now enforce strong KYC policies, in order to comply with main AML and KYC regulations. While registering in one of those platforms, a law-abiding cryptocurrency user is likely to provide a government-issued ID, comply to a photo identification through a selfie, as well as provide additional personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 However, some people are looking to beat KYC requirements for multiple reasons:&nbsp; 



<p>• Some users believe that identity verification goes against the ethos of cryptocurrency;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Other individuals may want to avoid sanctions, embargo, PEP or SDN lists screenings;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Illicit organizations looking to access crypto exchanges to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">launder money</a>;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Other users may just want to evade tax;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Finally, some of them are simply underage looking to trade cryptocurrencies although not legally allowed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the different reasons mentioned, some users may appeal to dubious methods in order to avoid <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC checks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>User behaviour to bypass KYC checks and identity verification may not only have serious consequences for crypto users, but rather also cause serious (regulatory) difficulties for crypto <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">platform</a> operators.&nbsp;</p>



 A strong regulatory risk in case of failing KYC procedures&nbsp; 



<p>While KYC processes prevent most users from signing in without proper screening, these restrictions created a business opportunity on black markets. Indeed, marketplaces on different dark webs (Tor network primarily) now offer vetted accounts on crypto exchanges and other payments services for a small amount of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For prices ranging from US $150 to $500, you can now buy an approved account on peer-to-peer trading platforms, professional crypto exchanges, or mainstream payment services. Those accounts are either provided with a fake name, address, and identification documents, or with genuine data obtained by any means.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an investigation from the specialized news outlet CoinDesk, sample accounts were purchased between US $170 and $250 and reviewed by a reporter. The accounts were on the exchanges Binance US, Coinbase Pro or Kraken, and payment services Cash App and Wirex. The analysis showed that most of them belonged to genuine United States and European Union citizens, and came along with instructions for VPN networks usage; however, it was also found that the credentials for email addresses were linked to the exchange account and Google Voice numbers. The latter appears to be a tool for fraudsters aiming to create fake accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They even adopted specific behavioral patterns, matching the geolocation of a victim, respecting transactions amounts, etc. Therefore, it is likely that a certain number of users are able to access crypto wallets on exchanges by using other individual’s accounts, thus evading KYC checks themselves. It must be taken into account that crypto exchange accounts are just a subset of the global black ID market. As reported by the <a href="https://resources.digitalshadows.com/whitepapers-and-reports/from-exposure-to-takeover">cyber consultancy firm Digital Shadows</a>, more than 15 billions of credentials would be for sale online, giving many opportunities for fraudsters to leverage data for illicit purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such activities may represent a major risk for cryptocurrency platforms and service providers, as regulators such as the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), already fined cryptocurrency exchanges like BitGo for apparent violations of multiple U.S. sanctions programs. Indeed, the platform had allowed – even though not knowingly – individuals from Syria, Iran, Sudan, Cuba and probably North Korea, to access and use its trading services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another platform exchange, BitPay, was forced to pay US$507,375 to settle its liability in a similar case. Finally, the crypto giant Coinbase may also face an investigation by OFAC, after having voluntarily disclosed alleged violations, in order to avoid major fines and sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, users who prefer to stay anonymous have other options such as peer-to-peer crypto marketplaces or Bitcoin ATMs, and do not always have to evade KYC checks. Indeed, peer-to-peer platforms enable transactions between private actors without having to disclose its identity. Thus, users would avoid to put themselves at risk, as their black market acquired account could be flagged by a platform as not genuine, consequently jeopardizing their assets.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC as a support for crypto market development&nbsp; 



<p>Although platforms are aware of black markets trading of verified accounts, it is possible to mitigate those risks by leveraging robust KYC processes. However, it must remain as simple as in any other financial services. In conjunction with threat intel teams deployed within major cryptocurrency companies, the robustness of KYC processes must be analysed and put to the test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although crypto enthusiasts might see KYC processes as a diminishing factor for adoption, Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as “CZ” declared to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-16/binance-ceo-cz-zhao-advocates-for-fundamental-crypto-rights">Bloomberg</a> that implementing such rules had only little impact on his business. In fact, CZ declared that only 3% of its customers were lost after improving its KYC robustness: “we have chosen to go with full compliance, full mandatory KYC for global users, for every feature. We feel that being compliant will allow more users to use us. Most people do feel more comfortable using a licensed exchange. Most people – 97 per cent of users – go through KYC. We lose only 3 per cent of users.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using a layered approach and combining different identification methods, KYC processes can be drastically improved. While a simple selfie is not cutting it anymore to keep fraudsters at bay, other means such as video identification, in addition to collecting official documents may provide a more solid KYC approach for crypto actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Straightforward and rapid, this procedure must also be painless for the user, crafted in a user-friendly environment, to keep the onboarding experience intact. Automated systems with fast response time, powered by artificial intelligence and combined with screening mechanisms and geolocation checks, provide an unparalleled solution to mitigate risks brought by fraudsters trying to circumvent KYC processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respecting these conventions will allow exchanges to participate in the democratization of cryptocurrencies and mass adoption by non-initiated, along with deterring fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 Cryptocurrency platforms must be aware of the risk of poor KYC mechanisms&nbsp; 



<p>KYC processes in crypto community are still fighting their way in, as adoption increases. Although it is possible to buy crypto without submitting to a KYC check, it is more complicated and a risky thing to do, conversely to using an exchange complying to KYC requirements. Regulations aside, KYC processes allow user confidence to grow, whether it is in the market, or in crypto exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an onboarding process, KYC can be transparent and painless without harming conversion rate, as many other <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/regulatory-risks-fintechs/">fintechs</a> and crypto exchanges have already proven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto actors evolving on the European market now have to comply with the European Union’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)</a>. For this reason, it may be the best time for these platforms to re-think and enhance KYC and AML procedures (see our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto KYC Page</a>), which will ultimately bring a benefit to both the users and the platform itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>London and Manchester, February 1st, 2022: Leading Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity proofing and verification, IDnow, has appointed a new Director of Customer Success to lead its global customer success programme.</p>
<p>Based in the UK, Doug Pollock has joined IDnow following several years in the identity verification sector where he held similar roles, all centred on developing best practice around managing enterprise clients. Doug’s immediate priorities will be on building up IDnow’s customer success programme to deliver increasingly efficient service levels as well as growing his team with the right talent to support organisational growth. He will also focus on the IDnow value proposition to ensure the company can demonstrate effective ROI to its customers.</p>
<p>With more than three decades’ experience in the tech sector, most recently spent in the identity verification space, Doug has worked across a range of sectors including e-commerce and banking systems.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Doug said: “No matter what sector you are working in, as long as a business puts customers front and centre, then customer success should follow. Throughout my career, customers have always been at the forefront of my mind, and I look forward to bring that customer-first approach to IDnow.</p>
<p>“IDnow is already a European powerhouse in its field. Our next steps will be to expand beyond Europe and to build out our identity proofing platform with NFC-based identity methods and self-sovereign applications. It’s an incredibly exciting time to join IDnow as we continue to invest in growth and innovation.”</p>
<p>Co-founder and Chief Customer Officer at IDnow, Sebastian Bärhold, added: “We’re delighted that Doug has joined IDnow, bringing with him a wealth of knowledge around scaling international customer success and service organisations. I am sure that our customers and partners will benefit from his vast experience.</p>
<p>“This is an important time for us as a business and as we continue to grow, we must ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service. Doug’s focus on putting the customer first will ensure we deliver highly efficient and exemplary service levels to our customers. His deep experience will guide our customers as they embark on or continue their identity proofing journey.”</p>
<p>Doug’s appointment marks the start of a major recruitment drive in the UK as the firm looks to meet the growing demands of businesses, often in highly regulated industries, seeking highly secure ways to verify customer identities. This follows its news last year which highlighted an eightfold growth in the UK compared to 2020 as more companies look to switch to fully digital customer onboarding processes. </p>

Community Growth &amp;&nbsp;Bounty   This month, DuMont, an outstanding Harbinger from our English community, published <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/staking-vs-candidate-node-ownership-9191bfbd5661">Staking vs Candidate Node Ownership</a>, which outlined the Ontology staking strategy for community members in great detail. The article answered questions like “How to participate in Ontology staking”, “How to launch a candidate node”, and more. Community members have expressed that they benefited a lot from the&nbsp;article.  This month, Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to join an AMA held by <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481824177879273477?s=20">BingX</a>. He shared Ontology’s long-term efforts and future goals, with a focus on DID and data. He explained how users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence. Humpty also highlighted the Ontology 2022 Roadmap: From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not&nbsp;changed.  This month, the <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1484246853189193729?s=20">Ontology Community Call</a> on Discord and Telegram was held as usual, focusing on topics such as “EVM” and “Staking”. Ontology Harbinger Polaris, and Atherton Hoge discussed those issues with community members, sharing the latest development of Ontology EVM, the the upcoming Ontology EVM launch will help Ontology attract more decentralized applications, and be a key step to realize the rapid expansion of the Ontology ecosystem. About staking, they believed that it is necessary to pay more attention to the revenue distribution ratio of each&nbsp;node.  We held our Telegram Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about “ENS”, “DID” and more. The Ontology community believes that DID will be an indispensable foundation in Web3; by comprehensively deploying DID, Web3 will realize the protection of identity and privacy, and truly return data ownership to&nbsp;users.

 What Is Really Matters to Make Diet Calories Calculators Work <p>To use a <a href="https://bit.ly/3HgH1uz">calories calculator</a>, you need to know how many calories you need per day and how many calories are in the food you’re&nbsp;eating.</p><p>While it’s important to know how many calories are in the food you’re eating, it’s even more important to make healthy choices when it comes to what you’re eating. A calories calculator can be a helpful tool, but it’s not everything. Here we will cover what really&nbsp;matters.</p> How many calories do I need each&nbsp;day? <p>This is a difficult question to answer without knowing more about your lifestyle and activity&nbsp;level.</p><p>The recommended calorie intake for the average, sedentary person is about 1200–2000 per day. If you are moderately active, you may need closer to 2000–2500 per&nbsp;day.</p><p>And if you are very active, you may need upwards of 2500–3000 or more. To calculate your specific calorie needs, use an online calculator or speak with a registered dietitian. Also we are going to cover the topic in&nbsp;depth.</p><p>In general, your daily caloric intake should include: 45–65% carbohydrates, 20–35% protein, and 10–30%&nbsp;fat.</p> What are macros and why do they&nbsp;matter? <p>Macronutrients are the three main nutrients that our body needs in order to function: carbohydrates, protein, and&nbsp;fat.</p><p>Each of these nutrients play different roles in our health and metabolism, so it’s important to make sure we are getting enough of all of them. Tracking your macros can be a helpful way to make sure you’re hitting your nutrient goals for the&nbsp;day.</p><p>There are many online calculators and apps that can help you track your macros. A good starting point is calculating what percentage of each nutrient you should aim for each day (see question #1). From there, you can adjust as needed depending on your specific goals and preferences.</p> (USDA) guidelines: <p>Calorie and macronutrient guidelines can be helpful in determining how many of each nutrient to eat each day. However, it is important to remember that everyone’s body is different and what works for one person may not work for another. It is also important to listen to your own body and make adjustments as needed. A good place to start when calculating calorie and macronutrient intake is to use the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines. The USDA recommends that adult women consume 2,000 calories per day, adult men consume 2,500 calories per day, and children between the ages of 4 and 8 years consume 1,400–1,600 calories per day. Regarding macronutrients, the USDA recommends that 45–65% of daily caloric intake come from carbohydrates, 20–35% from protein, and 10–35% from&nbsp;fat.</p> Formulas diet calories calculator uses (exposing the back end&nbsp;algos) <p>The Harris Benedict&nbsp;formula:</p><p>The Harris Benedict Formula is a mathematical equation that calculates someone’s basal metabolic rate&nbsp;(BMR).</p><p>This is the number of calories a person needs to consume each day to maintain their current weight. It takes into account a person’s sex, height, weight, and&nbsp;age.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>There are a number of ways to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), but the Harris Benedict Formula is one of the most&nbsp;common.</p><p>To use the Harris Benedict Formula, you’ll need to know your weight in pounds and your height in&nbsp;inches.</p>  multiply your weight by&nbsp;703  divide that number by your height in&nbsp;inches  add 655 4. if you’re a woman, subtract 456 5. if you’re a man, add 68&nbsp;Your  BMR is then the result of this calculation.  <p>Mifflin-St Jeor&nbsp;formula:</p><p>The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is a formula used to calculate the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its current weight. The equation takes into account your sex, age, and&nbsp;weight.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>To calculate BMR, you use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which takes into account your sex, age, weight and&nbsp;height.</p><p>To use the equation, you first need to determine your basal metabolic rate factor (BMRF), which is a number that reflects how many calories your body burns at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>You can find BMRF by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters&nbsp;squared.</p><p>Once you have your BMRF, you can use the following equation to calculate BMR:</p><p>BMR = 10 x BMRF +&nbsp;665</p><p>For example, if you weigh 60 kg and are 1.7 meters tall (68 inches), your BMR would be: 10 x 0.924 + 665 =&nbsp;1,608</p><p>Owen formula:</p><p>The Owen equation is a mathematical formula used to calculate the cardiac output, or the amount of blood pumped by the heart each&nbsp;minute.</p><p>The equation is named for Dr. John H. Owen, who developed it in the early 1900s. The equation takes into account a number of factors, including the heart rate, the stroke volume (the amount of blood ejected from the heart with each beat), and the resistance to blood flow throughout the&nbsp;body.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>Owen equation to calculate your&nbsp;BRM:</p><p>BRM = 370 + (9.8 x weight in kg) + (6.8 x height in cm) — (4.7 x age in&nbsp;years)</p><p>For example, a 30-year-old woman who weighs 70 kg and is 170 cm tall would have a basal metabolic rate of 1,537 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>Katch-McArdle formula:</p><p>You can use the Katch-McArdle formulas to calculate your BMR if you know your lean body&nbsp;mass.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>The Katch-McArdle formulas are: BMR = 370 + (21.6 x lean body mass) or BMR = (9.8 x weight in kilograms) + (4.7 x height in centimeters) — (4.7 x age in&nbsp;years)</p><p>Now what?!</p><p>After you find your BMR use one of these multipliers to find the amount of calories you need to stay at the same&nbsp;weight</p><p>The American Council on Exercise (ACE) has developed the following activity factor multipliers:</p><p>sedentary lifestyle =&nbsp;1.2</p><p>light activity =&nbsp;1.375</p><p>moderate activity =&nbsp;1.55</p><p>heavy activity =&nbsp;1.725</p><p>A sedentary lifestyle means you lead a relatively inactive lifestyle, with light physical activity only a few times a&nbsp;week.</p><p>If you have a light activity level, that means you engage in some exercise or physical activity on most days of the week but it’s not very&nbsp;intense.</p><p>Moderate activity means you are regularly active and heavy activity means you are very active — you probably have a physically demanding job or workout intensely several times a&nbsp;week.</p> The Key To Make It&nbsp;Work: <p>Now a note, all Calorie Counts Are Wrong as scientific american explained <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-reveals-why-calorie-counts-are-all-wrong/">Why</a>. But its not wrong to relay on them in the condition of you now they are just guessing efforts by great scientists. The wise decision is to use numbers generated by <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator">diet calories calculator</a>s as a starting point. If you do so you can make them&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with online calorie calculators. First, they can be inaccurate. Second, they can be difficult to use. And third, they can be expensive.</p><p>If you don’t get enough calories, your body will start breaking down muscle tissue to use as&nbsp;energy.</p><p>This can lead to a loss of muscle mass, which can make it harder to stay active and healthy. Additionally, if you don’t eat enough calories, you may not have enough energy to do the things you enjoy or to work hard at your&nbsp;job.</p> Where did the humble calorie come&nbsp;from: <p>The calorie is a unit of energy that was first defined by the French scientist Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree&nbsp;Celsius.</p><p>The calorie calculator can help you determine how many calories you should eat each day to reach your weight loss goals. It takes into account your basal metabolic rate (the number of calories your body burns at rest), as well as the number of calories you burn through physical activity. If you use application doing so then be sure that you are getting right information about your calorie&nbsp;needs.</p> How do you figure out how much calorie you need per&nbsp;day <p>To figure out <a href="https://bit.ly/3AKhFmi">how many calories you need per day</a>, you’ll need to first calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its current weight at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>You can use an online BMR calculator to estimate this number. Once you have your BMR, you’ll need to multiply it by an activity&nbsp;factor.</p><p>This number accounts for the amount of activity you do on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>If you’re sedentary, use a multiplier of 1.2; if you’re moderately active, use 1.3–1.4; if you’re very active, use 1.5–1.7; and if you’re extremely active, use 1.8 or&nbsp;higher.</p><p>Now add in any extra calories you burn from exercise or other activities throughout the day. The resulting number is your approximate calorie intake for the&nbsp;day.</p><p>Basal metabolic rate:</p><p>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its basic functions while you are at rest. This includes functions like breathing, circulating blood and keeping your heart&nbsp;beating.</p><p>How to Calculate Your Basal Metabolic Rate:</p><p>To calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR), you’ll need to know your weight, height, and&nbsp;age.</p><p>You can use this online <a href="https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html">BMR calculator</a> to do the math for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Once you have your BMR, you can use that number to help you determine how many calories you need each day to maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To lose weight, you’ll need to eat fewer calories than your BMR; to gain weight, you’ll need to eat&nbsp;more.</p><p>Remember that these are general guidelines, and everyone’s needs vary. If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, for example, you’ll likely need more than 2,000 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you’re very active, you may need even more. Talk with a healthcare professional if you’re unsure about how many calories you should be&nbsp;eating.</p> How to Use the Diet Calories Calculator <p>The <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator">diet calories calculator</a> is a handy tool for figuring out how many calories you need to eat each day in order to lose weight or maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To use the calculator, simply enter your sex, weight, height, and age into the corresponding fields.</p><p>The calculator will then provide you with your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories you need to maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To lose weight, you’ll need to consume fewer than this number of calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>To maintain your current weight, you’ll need to consume the same number of calories as your&nbsp;BMR.</p> General Tips: <p>The number of calories in food is determined by the amount of energy that the food provides.</p><p>When you eat, your body breaks down the food into tiny pieces that it can use for energy. This process is called digestion.</p><p>The number of calories in a particular type of food is determined by how many nutrients it contains and how easily your body can digest it. Some foods are high in calories because they contain a lot of nutrients, such as protein, fat, or carbohydrates.</p><p>Other foods are high in calories because they are not very nutritious and are easy to digest, such as candy or processed snacks. If you eat something and then poop it out, the number of calories in that food would not be counted. However, if you ate something and it was absorbed into your body and used for energy, then the number of calories in that food would be&nbsp;counted.</p><p>If you throw up do you still count the calories?</p><p>Yes, you still count the calories! Throwing up does not get rid of the calories you consumed.</p><p>In fact, it can actually make you gain weight because you might eat more later to try to make up for what you threw&nbsp;up.</p><p>How many calories you need to eat to gain&nbsp;weight</p><p>How many calories you need to eat to gain weight depends on your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and how much you want to&nbsp;weigh.</p><p>To find out your BMR, use this calculator: <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/.">www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/.</a></p><p>Once you know your BMR, multiply it by the amount of activity you do in a day. If you are sedentary, multiply by 1.2. If you are lightly active, multiply by 1.375. If you are moderately active, multiply by 1.55. If you are very active, multiply by 1.725. And if you are extremely active, multiply by 1.9. This will give you the number of calories you need to eat each day to maintain your current weight (not including exercise).</p><p>To gain weight, add 500–1000 calories per day to this number (again not including exercise).</p><p>So if your BMR is 2000 and you are moderately active, you would need to eat 2500–3000 calories per day to gain&nbsp;weight.</p><p>How many calories should i eat for breakfast</p><p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the number of calories you need for breakfast will vary depending on your age, sex, activity level, and&nbsp;weight.</p><p>However, a good rule of thumb is to aim for around 400–600 calories for breakfast. This should provide enough energy to start your day without leaving you feeling too full or sluggish.</p><p>Some healthy breakfast options that are within this calorie range include: oatmeal with honey and banana; eggs with whole grain toast; yogurt with fruit and granola; a smoothie made with protein powder, almond milk, and frozen&nbsp;fruit.</p><p>How many calories do i need to maintain my&nbsp;weight</p><p>Maintaining weight is all about balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories you&nbsp;burn.</p><p>To maintain your weight, you need to eat the same number of calories that your body burns each day. This means that if you eat more than your body burns, you will gain weight; and if you eat less than your body burns, you will lose weight. There is no single magic number for how many calories everyone needs to maintain their&nbsp;weight.</p><p>It depends on factors such as age, sex, activity level, and muscle mass. However, general guidelines suggest that women need around 1,500–2,000 calories per day to maintain their weight, while men need around 2,000–2,500 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are trying to maintain your current weight, aim to consume the same number of calories each day. To do this, keep track of the foods you eat and make sure that your calorie intake stays within your recommended range. You can use a calorie calculator or app to help monitor your intake, or simply keep a food journal to track what you ate throughout the&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are looking to gain or lose weight, it’s important to adjust your caloric intake accordingly. For example, if you want to lose 1–2 pounds per week, aim to consume 500–1,000 fewer calories than your body needs each day. Conversely, if you want to gain 1–2 pounds per week, aim to consume 500–1,000 more calories than your body needs each&nbsp;day.</p> Conclusion <p>One of the most important aspects of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is controlling your calorie intake. It can be tricky, because you want to make sure you’re eating enough to fuel your body, but not so much that you’re packing on the&nbsp;pounds.</p><p>Luckily, there are plenty of ways to do this. One key is to make sure you’re eating nutrient-rich foods. These are foods that provide your body with the vitamins and minerals it needs to function properly. They’ll also help keep you feeling full longer, so you won’t be as tempted to snack between meals. Some good options include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources like chicken or&nbsp;fish.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is portion size. When dining out, for example, order an appetizer instead of an entree, or split a main course with a friend. At home, use smaller plates and measuring spoons to help control your portions. Finally, it’s important to get regular exercise.</p><p>This doesn’t mean hours at the gym every day; even moderate activity like walking or biking can help burn calories and keep your metabolism going strong. Just be sure to stick to a routine that works for you and fits into your schedule.</p>

Let’s go through Cory’s critique, and then present some answers to his questions.</p><p><a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/the-inevitability-of-trusted-third-parties-a51cbcffc4e2">The Inevitability of Trusted Third Parties</a></p><p>In one section of “The inevitability of trusted third parties” Cory Doctorow quotes extensively from one of my comments on the Well’s <a href="https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/516/State-of-the-World-2022-page01.html">State of the World 2022</a>. I&nbsp;said:</p> Here is an NFT on OpenSea which gives the owner the right to<br>physically take delivery of a 1oz gold bar currently vaulted in<br>Singapore, or its financial value.  <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/47824387705324153400210554042155132922682187088261737780213014306821163188225">https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/47824387705<br>324153400210554042155132922682187088261737780213014306821163188225</a>  [...]  Here is the full legal text of one of the Ricardian contracts:<br><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.20.alpha.004.619263/06_carbon/assets/out/certification-contract.html">https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.20.alpha.004.619263/06_carbon/asset<br>s/out/certification-contract.html</a>  This one is a contract between the NFT owner and my company, which<br>guarantees that we have bought-and-retired carbon credits to cover<br>the physical mining of the gold bullion that is being sold. It also<br>covers the CO2 emissions of the NFT issuing process.  Clause 20 has the arbitration machinery.  We've worked fairly closely with the UK government on arbitration<br>rules for blockchain asset disputes.  <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/new-dispute-rules-envisage-direct-to-blockchain-enforcement-arbitral-decisions">https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/new-dispute-rules-envisage-direct-to-<br>blockchain-enforcement-arbitral-decisions</a>  The rules themselves are here:<br><a href="https://35z8e83m1ih83drye280o9d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lawtech_DDRR_Final.pdf">https://35z8e83m1ih83drye280o9d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021<br>/04/Lawtech_DDRR_Final.pdf</a>  We get a name check on page 4.  So what's being built out here is a very tightly bound legal<br>framework for buying and selling physical goods, with suites of<br>Ricardian contracts creating legally-enforceable claims about what<br>the goods are **DRAWN ON THIRD PARTIES**. Those third parties do not<br>benefit from the sale of the goods themselves, they make a living<br>providing legal warranties on the goods - they're essentially third<br>party inspectors with no economic interest in the situation other<br>than by selling insurance on the fact that something (for example)<br>contains no slave labour. <p>Cory then continues:</p><blockquote>But the more I think about this smart contract, the fewer reasons I can find for it to be a smart contract instead of just, you know, a contract.</blockquote><blockquote>As Vinay Gupta — the creator of this system and someone I have a lot of respect for — says, right there in the text, the entire system relies on third party arbiters to make sure that the parties involved don’t rip each other off, that no one uses slave labor, that the carbon is all offset through various schemes and so&nbsp;on.</blockquote><blockquote>The point is, all of that could be a deception. The only reason to trust it is that you trust the auditors who have signed the&nbsp;scheme.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t mean to pooh-pooh the role of auditors here. Auditors are great. In fact, we’re in the middle of several kinds of serious economic crises because <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/04/aaronsw/#crooked-ref">we allowed auditors to become an oligopoly of hopelessly conflicted megafirms</a>, and they are <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/01/fallout-carillion-collapse-hits-kpmg.html">cheating like crazy</a>, and so much of the world is broken as a&nbsp;result.</blockquote><blockquote>We know that the big auditing firms are riddled with fraud. We know that <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/17/do-well-do-good-do-nothing/#greenwashing">carbon offsets</a> are among <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/26/aggregate-demand/#murder-offsets">the most fraudulent</a> instruments that companies make.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t get how blockchain fixes any of&nbsp;this.</blockquote> How blockchain fixes some of&nbsp;this <p>So let’s talk about how blockchain improves the situation: not a blanket fix, but an economically-efficient risk reduction across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>Alan Turing named the Oracle Problem in 1937, and people have been wrestling with it in the Ethereum space since the early days of the platform.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@DelphiSystems/the-oracle-problem-856ccbdbd14f">The Oracle Problem</a></p><p>The state of the art in Ethereum Oracles is pretty sophisticated and pretty successful.</p><p><a href="https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-blockchain-oracle-problem/">What Is the Blockchain Oracle Problem? Why Can't Blockchains Solve It?</a></p><p>Part of the reason the Oracle Problem is hard in blockchain is the old computer security adage, “things are weakest at the&nbsp;joints”.</p><p>The pathway by which information from the physical world comes into the blockchain smart contract is a potentially-weak joint between physical world systems and ultra-reliable blockchain systems. The blockchain systems are almost transcendentally reliable: this is why the strain concentrates on the Oracles, and on key management (we’ll come back to key management below). The computer does not break, but you can get at their&nbsp;inputs.</p> Blockchain reliability is not a magical&nbsp;process <p>The blockchain systems are theoretically reliable because of massive redundancy. It’s a bit like flight computers, where there are five independent systems.</p><p><a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2020/04/06/airbus-flight-control-system-single-points-of-failure/">Five Where Only One is Needed: How Airbus Avoids Single Points of Failure - Right Attitudes</a></p><p>All of the flight computers have to agree for it not to be A&nbsp;Problem.</p><p>In the blockchain space there are thousands of computers forming the consensus on the current state of the system. This is very inefficient, but it is very effective. Given inputs will produce the same outputs very, very reliably.</p><p>This redundancy method produces insulation from the statistical problems of the real world. This is a very important point. A non-redundant system can get hit by a cosmic ray or a stray particle produced by normal radioactive decay. It can go down from a power outage and go offline. Non-redundant systems are flakey. There is no cure for this. Redundant systems are inefficient. There is no cure for this either. This is the&nbsp;law.</p><p>The massively redundant blockchain systems are decoupled from the randomness of life to form a statistical approximation of a perfect system. You can program the Ethereum metacomputer — a virtual machine made of thousands of regular computers in a redundant array — as if it was perfect. You can just totally ignore how the physical world works when programming this virtual machine: does not get hacked, does not have physical hardware problems.</p><p>Any individual node in the metacomputer which develops issues drops out of the consensus. The tens of thousands of remaining machines go on. As a programmer, the massive redundancy means you completely stop worrying about hardware problems or failovers. There is no “error handling.” Nothing ever&nbsp;crashes.</p><p>It just&nbsp;works.</p><p>There is a downside to this redundancy. The archaic Bitcoin proof of work mechanism would cost about $750,000,000 to carbon offset every year, if we even thought CO2 offsetting worked. There’s good redundancy and bad redundancy. It’s unfeasibly expensive to do this the wrong way. But the Avalanche system runs on less than 500 tons of CO2 a year, it’s hundreds of times faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum, and it’s been available for a&nbsp;year.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1456329570295193601">@el33th4xor</a></p></blockquote><p>So massive redundancy is one half of what produces the effective decoupling of the blockchain from physical reality: the system is so redundant that there can be chaos in the physical world and the blockchain soldiers right on. It is not efficient (yet — we’ll cover proof of stake systems below) but it is&nbsp;elegant.</p><p>Now let’s look at the other half of what separates the blockchain from physical&nbsp;reality.</p><p>The other half of the decoupling of the blockchain from physical reality is True Names. You can download the Metamask wallet, create a key pair, and proceed to perform transactions on the blockchain without ever giving anybody any additional information about you at all: you’re an unaccountable ghost. Your legal identity is not tied to your&nbsp;actions.</p><p>This kind of power was a Cypherpunk dream for decades. <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-86207-7">Vernor Vinge’s True Names</a> explores the boundary between the cryptographic metaverse and the physical world in minute detail. It is a massively important formative work. In that world, nobody can bind your metaverse avatar to your physical body: the system protects your privacy. But if the link is made, and your True Name is cracked, you can be shut down — or even killed — in the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>In the blockchain environment, nobody has to know your True Name. This turns out to be a lot more of a mixed blessing than it was in SF&nbsp;novels.</p><p>Of course, in practice, the True Name protection on the blockchain is weak for three&nbsp;reasons:</p>  If the actions you take benefit you in the real world (“I mail ordered this book”) then you are bound to your name and address for delivery. If you cash out money you want to spend, you’re tied by banking. If you rent an apartment, you’re tied to the&nbsp;address.  Funding a cryptocurrency wallet through crypto exchanges requires KYC/AML/CTF checks, just like regular banking or even more strict. This enables a “follow the money” approach to de-anonymizing people who later receive those funds, even if those people believe themselves to be anonymous. The crypto cash is tied to your real identity from the get&nbsp;go.  You’re still going to have to pay&nbsp;taxes.  <p>So while the blockchain space is in some abstract sense perfectly private and perfectly reliable, things are weakest at the joints. The on-ramps and off-ramps are parts of the real world, they’re tied to physical reality and KYC/AML/CTF regulations. Furthermore, when a user wants blockchain software to act on their behalf in ways which touch the real world, the blockchain’s security model breaks: the system acting as an extension of your will is no longer just the massively redundant blockchain. Now it’s a bunch of messy, regulated, human or Web2 systems. You and your software agents are no longer entirely anonymous because the real world requires named actors with&nbsp;KYC.</p><p>Any system connected to the real world is going to have some of the problems of the real world connected to it too. That’s just&nbsp;life.</p><p>Of course, there is the key management problem, and the software reliability problem. If you lose your key, or more likely somebody hacks the device on which you store your key, your blockchain identity and all its assets now belong to someone else. <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/">Hardware wallets help a lot</a>, but no system is&nbsp;perfect.</p><p>And if the software you write and upload to the chain — the smart contracts — have a bug? God help&nbsp;you.</p><p>It’s a machine, and it’s utterly unforgiving. It’s more like programming aeroplane avionics systems or satellites than web pages. Here be&nbsp;dragons!</p> The best of both worlds: Oracles that&nbsp;work <p>So we’ve looked at the problems of connecting blockchain systems to the real world: reliability and anonymity break down, and the core benefits of the blockchain are&nbsp;diluted.</p><p>But there are pragmatic systems that find advantages in connecting the blockchain and the real world. I’ll briefly cover two: Chainlink (a big Web3 project of some note), and Mattereum (my own company, as described in the Well State of the World quote&nbsp;above.)</p> Chainlink <p>Consider the Chainlink oracle&nbsp;system.</p><p><a href="https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles">What Is an Oracle in Blockchain? " Explained | Chainlink</a></p><p>A dazzling array of partner organizations with access to high quality data about things like weather conditions, stock prices and plane departures use a cryptographic and financial architecture to publish their data into the blockchain. They’re standing on their reputations: if they input bad data, they’re going to pay. There are complex “staking” arrangements coming this year which further automate this access to&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://chainlinktoday.com/staking-is-coming-to-the-chainlink-network-in-2022/">Staking Is Coming To The Chainlink Network In 2022</a></p><p>So that’s the True Names side of the bridge: in the Chainlink system, people publishing data are identified by their True Name. Only worthy partners are&nbsp;allowed.</p><p>The security side is more complex: Trusted Computing infrastructure signs transactions, multiple data feeds are integrated into an oracle feed, no data is single-pathed. It’s not quite the fully redundant system of the blockchain, but it’s a lot of cryptographic hardware and a lot of data source diversity. Not quite the same statistical guarantees as the blockchain itself makes, but a lot better than you would get with a conventional API-based price feed or other&nbsp;oracle.</p><p>It’s a bridge: not as squishy and unreliable as real-world APIs are, with lots of single points of failure that hackers could attack. But not as utterly, relentlessly infallible as the Ethereum metacomputer. Better than what we have now: Chainlink manages the Oracle Problem well enough to produce a highly functional system, without some kind of Science Fiction fix. It’s just a lot of hard work and good engineering by teams of smart people over years, building the most fraud-resistant and functional thing they&nbsp;can.</p><p>Actual Machines, not Fucking Magic, <a href="https://fritzfreiheit.com/wiki/AM/FM">as they&nbsp;say</a>.</p><p>So that’s one end of the pragmatic solutions to the Oracle Problem in the blockchain space: highly automated systems for doing things like price feeds using trusted computing hardware to guarantee data integrity.</p> Mattereum <p>Now let’s look at my own company, <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a>.</p><p>Mattereum operates all the way at the other end of the automation landscape: we rely on domain specialists such as curators, art historians and collectors to evaluate physical items. These physical items are being sold as&nbsp;NFTs!</p><p>The model&nbsp;is:</p>  An issuer puts the physical item in a vault with a set of third party evaluations provided by those&nbsp;experts  The issuer then publishes an NFT which gives the owner of the NFT the right to the item in the vault, akin to a coat check, but&nbsp;secure  The NFT owner can cash in the NFT for the item in the&nbsp;vault.  <p>It’s a system for doing real world trade in valuable things with a huge reduction in the risk of fraud: better expert opinions than one would usually get, and intermediate owners (e.g. dealers, auctioneers) are never touching the physical item. It stays securely in the&nbsp;vault.</p><p>We’ve worked on quite a few assets already, such as a selection of <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/third-millennia-collection-1">props and memorabilia</a> owned by legendary actor William Shatner, a <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/2">350,000 year-old hand axe</a>, and a <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/7">signed first edition</a> by Gonzo icon Hunter S. Thompson.</p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4aD73411CeC7D05c2EA1a17B4597E76/7">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4aD73411CeC7D05c2EA1a17B4597E76/7</a><p>These <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.hunter.s.thompson.17082021/#01_Identity">physical asset evaluations</a> are performed by curators with relevant domain expertise and presented as legal warranty contracts — <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.hunter.s.thompson.17082021/01_Identity/assets/out/certification-contract.html">pen and ink type legalese </a>— bound into the blockchain using a legal/technical construct called a Ricardian Contract. Not a lot of people seem to have heard of Ricardian Contracts these days: they were widely understood 5 years ago, but the number of people in the blockchain space has grown by something like 10000x since then and the Old Wisdom has become&nbsp;diluted.</p><p>Invented in the 1990s by Ian Grigg for managing a physical gold reserve with a cryptocurrency system, the Ricardian Contract is the key to understanding the new blockchain ecosystems.</p><p><a href="https://101blockchains.com/ricardian-contracts/">What are Ricardian Contracts? A Comprehensive Guide</a></p><p>Ricardian contracts are paper contracts, which use international arbitration law to appoint technically sophisticated arbitrators to manage cases involving a hybrid legal/technical system. Those arbitration laws carry hundreds of billions a year of settlements, so they’re well used and well understood and stable: <a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/english">the system has run since&nbsp;1958</a>.</p><p>Using those systems to make legalese contracts signed and paid on the blockchain arbitrable in the real world by real courts is the Ricardian Contract breakthrough. It’s another bridge: an extremely robust legal framework for getting enforceable legal rulings in complex areas like maritime law or civil engineering, carefully paired up to blockchain smart contracts.</p><p>What does the blockchain bring to the table in this instance? Well, the payments are taken on chain, using digital signatures, which are <a href="https://rightsignature.com/legality/electronic-signature-laws.html">universally accepted as legal signatures</a> these days. Actual statute legislates that in almost all countries. Those statues in each country are one part of the bridge, built out 20 years ago for general purpose use of digital signatures. But what this means is we have an instant and immediate settlement: the warranties on the physical object, and the ownership transfer, happen in a single atomic moment with the technical, legal, and financial transaction perfectly coordinated because they are the same transaction.</p><p>Remember I said “things are weakest at the joints” — well, in this case, there are no&nbsp;joints.</p><p>The legal, technical and financial transaction are a single transaction, there’s no way to wind up with a thing half-insured or stuck in an indeterminate state waiting for more paperwork. It’s a “performative speech act.” You say “make it so” and it is&nbsp;so!</p><p>That will stand up in court in 160+ countries because of the arbitration framework described above. It’s not an end-run around “the system” — it is an extension of “the system.” It’s a bridge! The legal system and the blockchain system can, with due care, work as one&nbsp;system.</p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0</a><p>In the beginning, Cory asked “why isn’t this just a contract?”</p><p>The answer is “it is a contract, but it’s a contract embedded in a Ricardian context — one half in the world of automated smart contracts, and the other half in the world of&nbsp;courts.”</p><p>If you do it right, when you put legal contracts on to the blockchain, you get the best of both worlds, and that’s what we&nbsp;did.</p> Some examples of our&nbsp;work. <p>A gold mood ring, one of the first issued, recently sold as an NFT for $65,000.<br><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/">https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/</a><br><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-mood-ring---a-cultural-icon-re-emerges-as-smart-wearable-nfts-301414759.html">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-mood-ring---a-cultural-icon-re-emerges-as-smart-wearable-nfts-301414759.html</a></p><p>An original Andy Warhol print of Alexander the Great<br><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0</a><br><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/">https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/</a></p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/">https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/</a> About Mattereum <p>London-based Mattereum was established in 2017 by a trans-disciplinary team with a track record in designing and launching nation state-level infrastructure and headed by former Ethereum release coordinator Vinay Gupta.

			 Tokeny’s 2022 Roadmap: Enhancing the Liquidity of Tokenized Assets 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in Jan 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Welcome to our monthly Product Focus newsletter, designed to keep you informed about our product developments at Tokeny. As this is the first newsletter of this year, we thought it would be good to introduce you to our product development priorities for 2022. These are:</p>
 🔰 Security and scalability 
<p>As a technology company, providing secure solutions to our customers and their end-users is fundamental, so security will remain our top priority. This year, we plan to pass more audits, certifications and cybersecurity tests than ever before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the tokenization market evolves, we will make our solutions more resilient and scalable to ensure that the upcoming mass adoption of tokenization will be seamless for asset issuers simply by integrating our solutions into their existing systems with APIs and SDKs. For this, we plan to improve our monitoring tools and release an improved customizable blockchain indexer.</p>
 🤩 Enhanced UX for issuers and investors 
<p>New features will be added for issuers to further reduce their administrative and compliance costs via more automated and guided processes. However, the main innovations will concern the token holder side. As our customers are scaling their operations and proposing more tokenized securities to their investors, our team will release a unified, multi-token, enriched Investor Portal this year.</p>
 🌊 Liquidity enabler&nbsp; 
<p>We always considered blockchain networks as shared infrastructure. This year, we will take our solutions to another level on this infrastructure by offering asset issuers tools and networks to easily connect liquidity providers and gradually create a robust and compliant distribution ecosystem for security tokens.</p>
 🆔 Making DeFi acceptable to institutions and regulators&nbsp; 
<p>The DeFi space is full of opportunities, but a lack of compliance prevents institutions from injecting large amounts of capital into the space or involving tokenized securities. More than ever, we are convinced that onchain identities are the solution. Therefore, we will launch developer tools to easily create compliant DeFi protocols where only eligible actors can participate. As we believe that this will be the first year of the “Permissioned DeFi” wave, these tools will allow DeFi project teams to quickly catch up with the trend.</p>
<p>The year ahead promises to be exciting, as we will provide our customers and partners with more powerful tools to enhance asset liquidity and accelerate institutional adoption.</p>

  Now is the time to implement the Zero Trust security model because the traditional model of enforcing security at the network perimeter is no longer effective. However, moving from theory into practice can be challenging unless you start with a key element like effective endpoint management.

				  Indicio is proud to have been named by <a href="https://www.vcnet.nyc/">New York VC Network</a> in their recently compiled list of the most exciting early-stage teams that they’ll be following closely this year!   
			  
				
				
				 <p>This exclusive list is made up of recently founded companies that are now raising their Seed or Series A and have applied to the VC matching program in the past six months. Based on the space the teams are working in, they are divided into 5 categories:&nbsp; HealthTech, Fintech, B2B Solutions, Consumer Tech, and Top Scorers in ESG.</p>
<p>The New York VC Network Rating Committee consists of current and former VCs, angel investors, exited entrepreneurs, and Fortune 500 employees in M&amp;A roles. The rating for companies is primarily based on two criteria. The first is the team’s past track record, mostly relying on founder profiles, past achievements, and their ability to gather a talented team around them. The second is the company’s current traction/scalability, based on the chosen market, current traction, and ability to scale.</p>
<p>The focus here was not on raised capital, but for insight these companies had already raised $3.4M on average (the median being $1.4M) and continued to receive more after applying.&nbsp; More information on the full list, including companies, full company profiles, and contact information are available in the <a href="https://www.vcnet.nyc/nyc-top-50/top-jan-2022">full announcement from New York VC Network.</a></p>

  DIDs and VCs are a new type of unique identifier with linked verifiable information that can be controlled solely by the user. DID-based representations for Ethereum Accounts and ENS names have been already defined.

<p>Moving past the login box using Verifiable Credentials</p><p>Visit any traditional website today and you’ll likely be confronted with a barrage of obstacles. The first thing will be those annoying cookie pop ups pushing you to consent to the countless number of 3rd parties that will track your visit. This information is peddled on exchanges around the world. Get past that, and you will eventually be pushed to share your email address or phone number, and create yet another password. All making you a likely target for phishing attacks and putting your personal data at risk of being included in the <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/96667-the-top-data-breaches-of-2021">1,291 data breaches </a>affecting <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/10/06/data-breach-2021-2020-total-hacks/">nearly 281.5 million people</a> in 2021. This approach is not going to last.</p><p>Web 3 has brought a new way to engage with websites, and dare I say, it is almost magical. No cookies, no username, no password, no sharing personal information. I can browse freely and pseudo-anonymously without having to worry about the cookies and terms I was forced to accept. When I want to transact, I connect to a website with a “wallet”. The wallet (e.g, <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>) is a browser extension or mobile app that holds a unique pseudonymous identifier, such as my Ethererum address. When I click “Connect”, my wallet proves to the website that I control the private keys associated with that address. All my data stays with me, on my device. This puts me, the user in control. </p><p>The wallet replaces the username, the password, the cookie and requires no personal data to be shared. This is great for website owners as well because they no longer need to store sensitive data about their users. No surprise then that MetaMask, for example, claims to be “trusted by <a href="https://decrypt.co/86263/ethereum-wallet-metamask-reports-21-million-users">21 million users</a> worldwide”. The Web3 community is also exploring using other identifiers like NFTs and Ethereum Name Service (<a href="https://ens.domains/">ENS</a>) that can be associated with a wallet.</p><p>The Role of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials</p><p><br>But if we do not share any personal data, how do we complete web transactions that require age verification or affordability criteria(e.g. loans). How could users prove that they meet those eligibility or qualification criteria without breaking the Web3 model or privacy and convenience?</p><p>This is where the W3C standards on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralised Identifiers </a>(DIDs)and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials </a>(VCs) come into play. DIDs and VCs are a new type of unique identifier with linked verifiable information that can be controlled solely by the user. DID-based representations for Ethereum Accounts and ENS names have been <a href="https://medium.com/uport/ens-names-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids-724f0c317e4b">already defined</a>, and with zero transaction costs, users can easily create their own DIDs. They will then be able to prove control over their DID, enable trusted third parties to “issue” cryptographically signed verifiable credentials (e.g. I am over 21) linked to the user’s DID, and allow websites to “verify” a user meets any eligibility (e.g. age verification) and/or qualification criteria (e.g. affordability checks) whilst preserving the user’s privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, these verifications can be done using selective disclosure (e.g. to prove your age, you need only disclose your date of birth versus showing your entire drivers’ license), predicates( e.g. instead of sharing your full date of birth, you can simply prove you are over 21), and zero knowledge proofs (e.g prove that I am a European citizen without sharing my passport details), using “<a href="https://blog.dock.io/anonymous-credentials/">anonymous credentials</a>”. This makes it possible for users to not have to compromise on neither the user experience nor on their anonymity within the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>Get Started with Dock</p><p>To find out more about how to implement DIDs, Verifiable Credentials and Anonymous Credentials in practice, have a look at <a href="https://console.api.dock.io/">Dock’s platform</a> or reach out to <a href="https://www.dock.io/contact">Dock directly</a>.</p><p>About Dock:</p><p>Dock is a platform designed to provide a simple solution for businesses and developers to build, manage and present digital credentials that are instantly verifiable using blockchain technology. With a standalone blockchain and seamless adoption and interoperability, Dock is part of a movement to solve universal problems with existing data and how it is captured, shared and controlled.</p>

			  Mihalis Plelis is a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p></p>
 Who are you? 
<p>I am Mihalis, Senior Software Developer at Tokeny. I graduated from the Technological Educational Institute of Crete as a software engineer. I live in Crete and I like to work remotely.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After working for two big companies and a startup in the past, I wanted a change. After I started looking for a new challenge in my career, my ex-colleague <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-talent-story-of-jose/">José</a> who works for Tokeny referred me to the team, and this is how our journey started.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny is something different. Right from the start, I was given the best welcome to date, better than any company that I have worked for in the past. We have a lot of freedom in our work, and we are free to do things the way we prefer. The team is really friendly, helpful and committed, which allows us to do things efficiently. The level of programming in our team is very high, allowing me to become a better developer and learn new things every day.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I like exploring new things, that’s why I like traveling. I’ve been to many European countries so far and I hope to continue traveling and exploring the world, experiencing new cultures and lifestyles. Also, I like to taste new kinds of food as this combines well with traveling around the world.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Being happy, like everyone else’s, I suppose. I try to have a balanced life, free of stress, close to nature and away from the noise of the big cities. I also hope I can contribute to making this world a better place via my work.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could?

<p>1.&nbsp; Basics first&nbsp;</p>



<p>The basics sound simple, and yet are so significant. Make sure your devices are secure: your computers, smartphones, and tablets. By that we mean, check if you have a comprehensive data security policy. That includes antivirus software, firewalls, and data recovery. To protect data in transit, all connections to your system should be on a secure platform. Emails should be encrypted, and remote desktops should be accessed via a VPN (virtual private network). At the end of the day, preventing security breaches is far less costly than curing it if it happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Enforce password management&nbsp;</p>



<p>Did you know that weak or stolen passwords account for as much as 80% of attacks? Ensuring that you have strong passwords in force can help lower the chance of those attacks. Today there are password manager applications in use that allow you to generate strong passwords and store them securely, like LastPast. The best password is one that you can remember, but one that will be hard for other people, even malicious programs, to guess. An abbreviated sentence or passphrase is often better than a single word with numbers and symbols inserted. If possible, you can also add 2-factor authentication on most software platforms. Needless to say, everything you would do to protect your computer should be done on your mobile devices also. Update your software whenever possible, use strong passcodes, turn off Bluetooth when not in use, and verify legitimacy before you download anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. Educate yourself&nbsp;</p>



<p>Education is everything, and when considering that human errors and negligence are the major causes of data breaches, it becomes even more important. Keep up to date with the latest security best practices and do your research on how to prevent cybersecurity threats such as malware or phishing scams – it might pay off in the end! In general, it is good to follow the Better safe than sorry guideline. As multiple studies have shown time and again, many data breaches could have been prevented if we had taken better care earlier on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. Finding a good connection&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever we go online in a public place, e.g. by using a public WIFI connection, we have no direct control over its security. Before providing information, such as your bank account number, be sure that you are using a secure WIFI network – or wait for a better time. Using a secure VPN connection further enables you to have a safe connection between device and Internet server: one that no one can monitor or access the data you are exchanging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. Be sceptical&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you receive a link that looks strange from a trusted friend or family member, better contact them to ask if the link you’ve received was sent on purpose. Viruses and other forms of malware often spread because of phishing or social engineering, meaning you click on a link from someone you know. This is when you are tricked into revealing personal or sensitive information for fraudulent purposes. Spam emails, ‘free’ offers, or online quizzes all use these tactics to entice you to click on dangerous links or give up your personal information. Always be wary of offers that sound too good to be true or ask for too much information. Again: better safe than sorry!&nbsp;</p>

“None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.”- Johann Wolfgang von&nbsp;Goethe<p>Payment processing is an extremely complex system that involves several intermediaries; it isn’t as easy as sending monetary value from the consumer to the merchant. Let’s make an easy to understand example of such a notion. An office worker pays by credit card after eating at a franchise restaurant. It is evident that the transaction occurred between two people, the office worker and the restaurant owner, however many intermediaries are involved with one payment. These intermediaries can cause inefficiencies and additional costs for the business owner. This complexity is one of the focal components on why many businesses charge an additional processing fee when paying with a credit card as opposed to a cash transaction. Countless intermediaries and contracts form the basis of even the smallest of payments; at your local 711 or deli, an innocuous three dollar transaction can turn into a convoluted process where multiple systems must become involved. This creates a problem for the small business&nbsp;owner.</p><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic specifically, small businesses in particular have seen the degradation of their businesses. This is due to a number of reasons which include shutdowns, a slowdown in economic expenditures and now, a looming supply crisis and payment processing only adds to these multiple nuisances. Many contract structures that provide convenience and risk management to the business owner in return conceive of a high commission burden to that specific small business owner. This is a fundamental flaw in the payment processing paradigm. Naturally, it is evident that the burden of this fee must be borne by the individual franchisees and the consumer. An easy and innovative payment service must be the answer, and one is on the horizon,&nbsp;GemPay.</p><p>Ask yourself this question, and answer it honestly, has fintech and big tech platforms enhanced the monetary performance of your business, or retracted upon it and left it in economic stagnation? It is an honest question that every small business owner should be asking. At the end of 2021, the fee for small merchants with annual sales of 300 million won ($250,000 USD) or less was only&nbsp;.08% for credit cards. However the percentage for Naver Pay is 2.2% (order management) and 2.0% for Kakao Pay (online), higher than the majority of card processing companies. It has been analyzed that the approximate fee is 2–3 times higher. It has become difficult to simply compare fee rates because of the broad range of services that credit card companies and simple payment operators provide. Of course, it is true that it is difficult for everyone to know transparently about the standards and specific details of processing fees. But we must ask ourselves about the fundamental maxim of big tech service companies, whose sole purpose is for-profit business. Are big tech service companies competing to provide quality services for their customers rather than financial companies that are subject to stricter audit and regulatory restrictions? Even so, it will be just a temporary marketing to dominate the market and that creates a major&nbsp;dilemma.</p><p>The fact that the development of technology has made it possible for consumers to easily consume is certainly a benefit of fintech technology; resulting from this, more people and business entities experience convenience and versatility. ‘Easier’, ‘faster’ and ‘kinder’ have become essential features of all services as technological innovation has increased astronomically over the last two decades. However, for sellers, this means higher fees and more platform dependencies which perpetuates the ability for payment processing platforms to price gouge processing fees because of the “leverage of reliancy.” We are not just satisfied with the simplicity of the service, but can actually increase the benefits that we can receive from the huge platform created with data and aggregation. This is where GemPay comes into play, developed by Blocko&nbsp;XYZ.</p><p>Blocko XYZ is an incredibly forward thinking company that creates blockchain solutions for enterprises of all sizes. GemPay is a convenient solution to the major processing fee dilemma that small business owners face. Bitcoin and blockchain technology are great solutions to these problems, but they have unfortunate dilemmas as well which include scalability, high transaction fees, exploits, slow transaction times and bottlenecks. After consistent deliberation and study of the mechanics of blockchain technology, Blocko was able to collect the following three notions to successfully integrate and amalgamate into GemPay. Beginning with the first pillar, the philosophy entailed is this “accept the notion of eliminating payment intermediaries and borrow the concept of point discounts to increase discounts instead of fees!” The second pillar highlighted is “let’s become the subject of the service by transparently sharing the transaction process, such as payment details and discount rates, and allowing users to exercise their own choice in operation!” And lastly, the third pillar is thus “keep the value 1:1 with the legal currency, so let’s focus on the points that can be easily paid rather than the investment purpose!”</p><p>The first pillar highlights the ethos of decentralized blockchain technology, comparing it to its non-traditional notions in accordance with the existing financial system. The core principle of blockchain is decentralization. Through blockchains the fee dilemma can be resolved by excluding electronic payment agencies (in essence, removing the oligopolist middle-men such as Payment Gate PG) and value added networks that are interconnected in the payment process. In English, buyers and sellers are directly connected through a peer-to-peer paradigm without the necessity of third parties, which results in virtually zero commission costs. Because GemPay is a blockchain based payment system, a “double discount” is possible.</p><p>The second ethos of GemPay revolves around the notion of preventing a second merge point which allows for the service to operate transparently with blockchain technology. Anonymity and paradoxically, transparency are the quintessential components of blockchain technology, and these can be utilized in an open payment system. At the time of payment, the user can clearly and easily check through the app how much discount the business received, unlike other payment methods, and that this amount of discount is possible only with the GemPay application. Instead of “you were charged x amount of won, please pay’, we become smart users by becoming the subject of payment data from consumers who used to make payments passively. This is one of the focal components of why GemPay is a practical solution in payment processing.</p><p>The third ethos of GemPay revolves around the controversy surrounding the coin price volatility. A justifiable question that small business owners ask themselves when utilizing blockchain and cryptocurrencies is “why would I accept such a volatile currency, I could make the transaction now and the value of the transaction can drop 20% in one minute”, which is a completely understandable sentiment. Afterall, a business must protect its profit and revenue streams. Blocko has conceived of an idea that will end this notion. Blocko will create AergoGem tokens on itself-developed AERGO mainnet to ensure 1:1 value exchange with fiat currency, and will initially focus on exchange with the KRW pair. Users can use the Gem charged through the GemPay app as in original currency and Gem can then be recharged with AERGO tokens, and you can also link third-party points with GemPay to exchange each point of the Gem. To conclude with a simple summary, GemPay allows for a high discount rate through its “double discount”, it enables transparency and independence through blockchain technology, and easy payments with gems that maintain 1:1 value with legal currency.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency involves substantial risk, do not invest more than you can afford to lose!

 🌎⚠️🔒 VaultAlert.net — Always know your crypto assets are&nbsp;safe  <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert.net</a> is a brand new service for the Verus ecosystem. Every user who set up the secure VerusID Vault can now check its status from anywhere in the&nbsp;world.  VerusID Vault: A secure place for your crypto&nbsp;assets <p>Vault is part of the <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">VerusID self-sovereign identity protocol</a>, built within the Verus multichain blockchain protocol. One of many VerusID features is that it functions as a human-readable cryptocurrency address. You can store $VRSC on your VerusID and lock them with Vault. In the future tokens and other bridged crypto-assets can also be stored and locked on a&nbsp;VerusID.</p><p>A locked VerusID can not spend, which means assets can not leave your VerusID. Even if someone has the private keys. It’s a revolutionary novel technology that will help many people from getting their crypto assets stolen. It can also be used for inheritance, trusts or vesting&nbsp;periods.</p><p>$VRSC that is locked with Vault can still stake. You can create a setup for yourself in which you won’t have to worry about your $VRSC being&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>In combination with other VerusIDs functioning as revocation and recovery authorities you can be a self-sovereign superpower. Having peace of mind and full control over your crypto assets is an incredibly powerful thing to&nbsp;have.</p> Revocation and Recovery Authorities <p>What if the private key of your VerusID is exposed? Maybe through your own fault, or a hacker that tries to steal your crypto assets. You don’t want anyone to be able to run away with your hard-earned assets. You’d want to be able to revoke access to that VerusID, so no one can do anything with the assets that are on it. And after that, you’d want to completely recover those assets into your own control. <a href="https://www.vaultalert.net/intro#RevocationAuthority">Read more here on how the revocation and recovery authorities function.</a></p> TimeLock &amp; DelayLock <p>Vault has two different options to lock your assets, TimeLock and DelayLock. You can only choose one option to lock the Vault. And the only way to circumvent a locked Vault is through revoking and recovering the&nbsp;VerusID.</p>  With TimeLock you determine how long you want the Vault to be locked. After the determined period is over the assets can be spent again. The maximum amount of time the Vault can be locked is 21&nbsp;years.  With DelayLock you determine a cooldown period. You lock the Vault and have to request an unlock. After requesting the unlock you have to wait for the determined cooldown period before the assets can be spent&nbsp;again.   VaultAlert.net <p>So how does it work? You can search for any VerusID on <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert.net</a> and it shows you all you need to know about the Vault status and&nbsp;more.</p>  LOCKED: the Vault is locked and funds can not be&nbsp;spent  UNLOCK SOON: the Vault is locked but gets unlocked within a time period of 30&nbsp;days.  NO LOCK: Vault is not active and thus funds can be&nbsp;spent.  DelayLock or&nbsp;TimeLock  Primary address: The primary address is the owner of the VerusID, as it contains the private key. It can contain more than one&nbsp;VerusID.  Identity address (also called i-address): The identity address is, next to the name, the identifier of the&nbsp;VerusID.

<p>Previously…<br><br>Staking rewards were allocated each era, but these rewards needed to be triggered in order to payout. This manual step required validators or stakers to initiate the rewards payout for each validator in each era. As soon as a validator or staker requests a payout for an era, all the stakers for that validator would receive the rewards into their accounts. </p><p>After liaising with our community and taking into account the feedback, we’ve made some changes to this process. Dock has now enabled these payments to take place automatically. </p><p>The New Process</p><p>Validators and stakers will no longer have to manually request a rewards payout. The payout will occur automatically after each era. Now validators can continue to produce blocks and validate blocks made by other validators without worrying about claiming the rewards after each era. Rewards will be paid to the winning validators and their stakers accounts after each era, automatically. </p><p>The automatic staking process also saves validators the cost of running the transactions to issue the payouts for each era. This cost will be covered by the Dock Association moving forward with funds from the Dock Treasury.</p><p>The only time the rewards payout after each era will not be automatic is when the validators commission is over 5%. If the validators commission is set to over 5%, the manual process as mentioned above will come into play. Only when the rewards payout is triggered, will the payout be made.</p><p>Start staking today and get the rewards paid to your account automatically.

<p>We had a busy fourth quarter 2021 at Northern Block working on NB Orbit, our suite of self-sovereign identity products.</p>
<p>We feel quite fortunate to be on the forefront of bringing SSI closer to mass adoption. We’re working alongside great partners and customers who have the same goal. Everything we build is to further this mission.</p>
<p>Through the NB Orbit Platform, organizations can deploy digital credentialing ecosystems, become credential issuers, accept digital credentials within workflows and use a variety of digital wallets and agents to connect and exchange credentials.</p>
<p>Note: throughout this post, when we refer to the NB Orbit Platform, we’re talking about our enterprise products (e.g., Issuer, Verifier), which you can read more about towards the end of this post</p>
<p>In this post we’ll cover some of the major items we worked on during Q4 2021 within our suite of products.</p>
 <br>
1&nbsp; B2B Interactions &amp; Credential Exchanges 
<p>Legal entities are required to be holders of credentials, just like people. We started seeing more demand for organization credentials (e.g., audit results, financial proofs, ESG credentials), so we wanted to provide a way for our customers to easily manage them through a user interface.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
We built in features on the NB Orbit Platform where a person acting on behalf of their organization can view their organization’s credentials, and interact on behalf of it with offers and proof requests. The features include:</p>
 
 Accepting connection invitations from other Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Accepting credential offers from connected Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Displaying the list of credentials stored in the cloud wallet with pagination or card layout 
 Receiving proof requests from connected Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Displaying received proof requests with pagination 
 Displaying the list of credentials available for requested proof 
 Attribute selection option while generating the proof 
 
 <br>
2&nbsp; Verified Business – Enhancements 
<p></p>
<p>With increasing compliance and AML requirements, the veracity and source of company data have become a central point in combating money laundering and other frauds. We started seeing an increasing demand from clients to validate legal entity data at source.</p>
<p>Onboarding in a self-sovereign manner to digital trust ecosystems is different than in federated models. When network operators manage a trust network and an entity connects into the network and begins transacting, it’s important to first ensure that it’s&nbsp; a verified entity, and that the claims the entity makes about itself are verified using a trusted source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enables the NB Orbit Platform to create ecosystems for trusted entities to conduct business and daily operations.</p>
 <br>
3&nbsp; Support for Multiple Verifiable Data Registries 
<p>Our customers do not want to have multiple wallets to hold their credentials. Instead they prefer to have one wallet and connect with multiple verifiable data registries from this one wallet to receive verifiable credential offers and provide proofs.</p>
<p>Therefore we added the option to select from multiple Indy-based networks on the mobile device so that it can function with other networks.</p>
<p>See below how our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a> was used to show network interoperability with the BCovrin Indy Network:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
4&nbsp; Customized Wallet Branding 
<p>Many of our customers have their existing branding that they wish to leverage for their customers, employees or vendors.</p>
<p>To enable them to provide a customized user experience to their end users, we wanted to ensure&nbsp; the process of white labeling our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet </a>was quick and easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now offer two ways to get a customized branded wallet:&nbsp;</p>
 
 We work with you to collect information we need for whitelabelling such as colour guides, assets, texts, and languages (more on the multi language support below). 
 We can provide you with a base Figma file&nbsp; and once your designs are finalized, we will quickly implement them. 
 
<p>Once assets are collected, it’s a fairly automated process from then on to have a build ready for private or public distribution via mobile app stores.</p>
<p>Below is a customer of ours, <a href="http://thrivacy.io/">Thrivacy</a>, who we worked with to quickly launch of their SSI&nbsp;Mobile Wallet &amp; Enterprise Issuer/Verifier product suite.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
5&nbsp; Multi Language Support 
<p>We now offer language selection in our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>. Being a Canadian company, it’s very important that we can offer multilingual options to Canadian citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now support two languages: English and French. We will be expanding to offer other languages based on our roadmap and needs from our partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re looking for other languages or simply to modify certain existing text copy for your branded app, the process is now extremely simple thanks to the good work put in by our wallet team to make the code modular and scalable.</p>
 6&nbsp; Verified Person – Enhancements 
<p>We use ID Proofing within our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a> for use cases where a high-level of assurance on the person is needed from a Government-issued ID perspective.</p>
<p>We added assurance to our Verified Person by including more checks and controls over the digitization process.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
7&nbsp; Digitize Any Document 
<p>There exists lots of authentic and valuable data/documents that aren’t digitally available today. Therefore, rather than waiting for various industries (source data owners/issuers) to go fully digital, we’ve decided there is a continuous need for digitization – turning physical or digital documents into machine readable data. The value of digitizing them is massive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We implemented a powerful AI-based document parser in our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>&nbsp;to support the digitization of any document with a standard structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use an AI-based algorithm that can be trained to support any structured documents.</p>
<p>The use case here is to provide attested documents without going to the attestor physically (e.g., lawyer or notary’s office). We digitized a manual process which takes a ton of time, causes friction/effort and has a cost.. With our document parser, the attestors can instead issue digital credentials remotely. Rather than a stamped seal on a document, attestors can use the NB Orbit Platform to issue cryptographic digital signatures.<br>
</p>
<p>The other value we see is that this process doesn’t have to be repeated over and over again, as verifiable credentials are reusable, once again saving cost and time.</p>
 <br>
8&nbsp; Proof Requests – Enhancements 
<p>With use cases that enable the supply of many verifiable credentials with the same schemas, it’s important that the holder can pick and choose the right verifiable credential during a proof request.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you purchased a microwave from Walmart and it’s broken – you may want to return it – and you’ll need to show your receipt credential. Or perhaps you are looking to get insurance coverage for your microwave – you will need to prove the item and purchase information to the insurer. In both of these scenarios, when the verifier asks for a proof request, you need to show your microwave credential from Walmart (issuer), rather than other credentials you have with the same schema.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We built this functionality into our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>&nbsp;to allow holders to do just that. We also worked on updates in our Mobile SDK to enable this.</p>
<p>We see this whole process as becoming more intelligent with time as smart agents become able to pull out most relevant credentials based on context, while learning over time.</p>

9&nbsp; P2P Messaging Between Agents – Enhancements 
<p>From Kaliya’s post on <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">Understanding DIDComm</a>:</p>
<p>“If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (DID) are: they are “identifiers” or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented.”</p>
<p>Continued: “DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another. It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities, which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is, barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that DID.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIDComm messaging is such a powerful mechanism to achieve security, privacy, decentralization, and transport independence. Most messaging software today is routed through centralized servers. Although different encryption methods are used by them, there’s still an entity between yourself and the other entity you’re communicating with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wanted to give more flexibility to the multitude of use cases we are seeing by enabling chat to happen over DIDComm, independent of what role and system you’re using in the SSI trust triangle. We built in a web interface on the Enterprise Platform where organizations can now directly chat with their employees, customers, vendors, partners, etc.</p>
<p>We now support chat across these types of relationships:</p>

 10&nbsp; NB Orbit Mobile Wallet Demonstrates AIP 1.0 Compliance 
<p>As Canadian and European governments prepare to issue digital identities to their citizens (e.g., passports, driver’s licences, health cards), ensuring ownership, control and interoperability of data is paramount.</p>
<p>Northern Block has committed itself to compliance with open source projects which lead to the interoperability of verifiable credentials. In November 2021, we worked with the Digital Identity Laboratory of Canada to have them evaluate conformance of our wallet technology to the Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Profile.</p>
<p>The IDLab team conducted the testing of the NB Orbit mobile wallet on both iOS and Android devices, running testing within the IDLab’s technology environment.</p>

11&nbsp; General Platform Operation Enhancements 
<p>Lastly, in Q4 2021 we also continued enhancing general functionalities, infrastructure and security features of our product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recap on our NB Orbit suite of products:</p>
 
 NB Orbit Digital Wallets – store personal credentials using our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>. Store organization-related credentials in our Organizational Cloud Wallet. Maintain high-levels of assurance around identities through integrated ID proofing solutions. 
 NB Orbit Issuer – a Hyperledger Aries cloud agent and controller that can create and issue verifiable credentials.&nbsp; It can create invitations to holders to connect and to track the status of connection invites and credential offers.&nbsp; The issuer has a web interface to provide users with the controls for handling connections and credential issuances.&nbsp; 
 NB Orbit Trust Registry – a server application used to provision new issuer and verifiers.&nbsp; It handles the process to invite, authorize and orchestrate the cloud containers for each issuer and verifier on the platform. 
 NB Orbit Verifier – a Hyperledger Aries cloud agent and controller that can create proof templates and initiate proof requests. It can create invitations to holders to connect and to track the status of connection invites and proof requests. The verifier has a web interface to provide users with the controls to handle connections and credential verifications. 
 NB Orbit Verifiable Data Registry – a Hyperledger Indy network running four nodes.&nbsp; It is used to hold credential schemas and definitions as well as the DID Documents for the public DIDs of the issuers and verifiers.&nbsp; The DID Documents contain information such as the public key and endpoints of the issuers and verifiers.&nbsp; No data pertaining to the holders is ever stored in this network. Alongside this, we also run a revocation registry – a cryptographic tails files store that provides credentials issued based on a credential definition to be revoked.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 NB Orbit Mediator – a store and forward system that provides the mobile wallets with a static endpoint. Mobile devices are not guaranteed to be available online when a cloud agent needs to communicate with them.&nbsp; The mediator acts as an answering machine for the mobile wallet and will forward on the encrypted messages it has received when the mobile device is back online.

 The Sovereign Yidindji Government (SYG) has issued and deployed the Sovereign Yidindji Dollar successfully using MetaMUI Identity-based Blockchain Sovereign Yidindji has successfully issued their own Central Bank Digital Currency(CBDC) <br>“Sovereign Yidindji Dollar” on top of MetaMUI Blockchain<p>After more than half a year of intense collaboration between Sovereign Yidindji Government(SYG) and MetaMUI, the team had successfully issued a fully functioning Central Bank Digital Currency using the revolutionary technology of MetaMUI, the world’s first Identity-based Blockchain.</p><p>While hundreds of CBCD projects are cropping up around the world, most projects are still at the research or Proof of Concept stage. Only a few, such as ‘Sand Dollar’ in the Bahamas, and ‘e-Naira’ in Nigeria, have launched CBCD so far. Yidinji Dollar has four distinctive features which differentiate it from&nbsp;others.</p><p>● Yidindji Dollar is the first Central Bank Digital Currency issued by the “CBDC Issuance Platform.”<br>● Yidindji Dollar was issued only in digital currency without any paper bills.<br>● A new payment system connected with MetaMUI’s SSID system is used in all retail stores and government offices. Payment can be processed without using the dedicated network, there is no transaction fee, sales settlement is done immediately, and cross-border payment can be made without using Visa or Mastercard.<br>● It is a convertible currency whose collateral assets are gold and silver and other minerals and natural resources such as green and blue carbon. Money issuance, backed by a digital certificate, is also backed with collateral assets. Convertible currencies ended in 1971 when President Nixon stopped the exchange between the dollar and gold. It is the first convertible currency since Nixon and the first digital currency.</p><p>MetaMUI is the first identity-based token blockchain that combines the concept of self-sovereign identity and decentralized blockchain. Self-sovereign identity is a decentralized identity that protects users’ privacy. It avoids the problem of centralized censorship and the abuse of private information. The Sovereign Yidindji Government has already built the national identity system utilizing MetaMUI’s technology. Therefore every Yidjindji citizen, Yidindji company, and Yidindji organization can create their own digital identity, own various digital assets, and make payment with Yidindji&nbsp;Dollar.</p><p>“Yidindji is the first nation to choose MetaMUI’s CBDC platform. MetaMUI platform allows any country to publish the state-of-the-art CBDC within a few days at a fraction of the cost. MetaMUI platform also provides a single integrated solution for national identity, e-Government, peer-to-peer payment, digital certificates, and cross-border payment.” said Phantom Seokgu Yun, CEO of&nbsp;MetaMUI.</p><p>“The benefits of central bank digital currencies are profound, and it is only a matter of time before they are implemented by countries around the world,” said Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute. “But they need to be done right to safeguard citizen privacy and to interoperate around the world. I am delighted to see this technology used to build a more sustainable future for the people of the Sovereign Yidindji Government in Australia.”</p><p>Loretta Joseph, an advisor of MetMUI, who connected with the Sovereign Yidindji Government, said, “I am very excited for the oldest civilization to adapt to the 21st century by embracing technology and change for a more inclusive and better&nbsp;world”.</p><p>The Sovereign Yidindji Government is an Aboriginal Australian micronation, and its territory is home to some of the world’s most pristine rainforests. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>“‘Gayaburra galin nyundu’ With the blessing of Yeshua Hamashiach, the Yidindji nation is becoming a fully digitized nation, thanks to MetaMUI revolutionary technology we made a leapfrog towards the future. The Yidindji reserve currency will stabilise and add security, it will also ensure credibility to the global economy and financial system. Yidindji’s participation not only makes sense being logical, but it is also inevitable. The world is now ready for the indigenous peoples to underwrite a new future.” said Gudju-Gudju Gimuybara, Chief Minister of&nbsp;SYG.</p> About Yidindji <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qjX1OysGbk4">Yidindji people</a> are a rainforest-based society with several clan groups in the area described as far north Queensland on the Australian continent. The Yidindji territory is home to some of the world’s most pristine rainforests and is an essential gateway to the great barrier reef. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the planet. In 2014, history was made on September 20 as the official government of the Yidindji nation came into life with the launch of its coat of arms. Since then, the SYG, as it is known, has created several departments, and its parliament continues to pass laws for the peace, order, and good governance of the Yidindji territory. SYG has 17 ministers and 22 ministries and plans to be the first government to become entirely digitized in its venture towards e-governance.</p> About MetaMUI <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-W5nwN9dMU">MetaMUI</a> is the first identity-based token blockchain. The design approach of MetaMUI is opposite to most cryptocurrencies and other anonymous token blockchains. In contrast, most token technologies follow the anonymous token design of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc. MetaMUI chose to redesign the blockchain structure based on identity entirely. The main reason for this is to satisfy the regulatory framework of current financial systems such as FATF’s travel&nbsp;rule.</p><p>[SOVEREIGN WALLET NETWORK ‘SWN’] is the genius behind the development of the MetaMUI identity-based blockchain. The Sovereign Wallet Network (SWN) has redesigned the blockchain and developed the MetaMUI blockchain. We are proud to provide the state-of-the-art 4th generation blockchain with a mainnet launched on January 3, 2021. The Sovereign Wallet is located in six (6) different countries globally, with headquarters in Singapore and offices in Korea, Sweden, the United States, India, and Uzbekistan. The MetaMUI blockchain is paving the way towards building the Internet of Sovereign Digital Currencies (IoSDC).

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Have you entered a password somewhere today? Do you wonder why you’re still having to do that? Did entering that password give you a feeling of digital safety? Did it make your consumer experience more enjoyable?</p>
<p>Cybersecurity and identity management experts have been proclaiming the benefits of and absolute necessity of Multifactor Authentication (MFA) and risk-adaptive authentication for years now.&nbsp; MFA is the leading concept for implementing strong authentication, which is defined as the combination of two or more of the following: something you know, something you have, or something you are. Indeed, you won’t hear anyone in the field deny that MFA and risk-adaptive authentication are two of the best ways to reduce cybercrime and fraud, particularly account takeover (ATO) fraud. But we enter passwords every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every. Single. Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn’t improve security, and it doesn’t make for a pleasant user experience. So why are we still doing it?&nbsp;</p>
 
 Security and user satisfaction are just not high enough priorities in some organizations yet&nbsp; 
 
<p>That’s it, there’s no need for a second bullet point. Here are some common retorts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Security and user satisfaction are important to our org, but we don’t have the budget.” Find the budget. Authentication system and service upgrades are not as expensive as you may think. The offset against potential fraud risks, especially in certain sectors, can be demonstrated to pay for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We haven’t had any security incidents tied to password breaches.”&nbsp; Are you sure? Even if that’s true, it’s only a matter of time before it does happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re a small business, the big cybercriminals aren’t targeting us.” The days when big global brands and big banks were exclusively targeted are gone. If your organization has something of value or processes transactions of any kind, then it is likely already on the radar of cybercriminals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have legacy Line of Business (LOB) applications that don’t interoperate with identity and authentication standards.”&nbsp; Admittedly, this is a tougher issue. Most IAM and IDaaS authentication services allow for customization to address compatibility for older applications. It’s probably harder to integrate old apps, but not impossible. Moreover, legacy LOB apps often reside on unsupported operating systems which are more vulnerable to exploits. A project to upgrade authentication may have additional security benefits if legacy apps on out-of-service OSes can be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Users are used to entering passwords.” That may be true, but it doesn’t mean we like doing it. Many of us know that passwords are weak security. It makes us wonder what else you’re doing wrong. When security conscious users enter passwords into websites or mobile apps, we doubt that those organizations are committed to the security of our information and finances. Repeated entering of passwords leads to reduced trust in the organization asking for passwords. Erosion of trust leads to diminishing customer loyalty, lost business, and shrinking revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insecurity leads to doubt, doubt leads to mistrust, and mistrust leads to the dark downside of lost business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of us have been waiting for years for the promise of passwordless authentication. IAM vendors typically define passwordless as removing password databases from centralized systems, thereby improving security by reducing the likelihood of password breaches. Mobile phone-based biometrics and FIDO are good examples of passwordless authentication. It’s important to note that although password databases may be omitted in passwordless authentication systems, users may still have to enter passwords or PINs occasionally, but those factors are evaluated locally on the users’ devices.&nbsp; We have, however, fortunately observed that the number of completely passwordless solutions in the market is increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, thanks to many excellent authentication solutions and services available in the market, it’s never been easier for organizations that still use traditional passwords with centralized databases to move away from them. For more information on authentication solutions, see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research?q=authentication&amp;f=&amp;ref=eic22blogjohn" title="KuppingerCole Research">KuppingerCole Research</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can’t get to fully passwordless, we’ll settle for password-fewer. Password authentication can be augmented by risk analysis. Many sites that still appear to use passwords are actually doing sophisticated examination of many attributes in the background. This is what social media, some big retailers, and other forward-looking organizations are doing. Their users have passwords “on file” but rarely have to use them because of the advanced risk analysis that going on behind the scenes. Examples of contextual information considered includes device intelligence, IP address (history and reputation), browser attributes, geo-location of request, time/day, etc. All these data points can be compared at transaction time to a per-user historical baseline. In cases like this, the password is the fallback. If the risk analysis concludes that the request context is within acceptable parameters, the user doesn’t get prompted to re-enter a password, get an email/SMS OTP, etc. It’s smooth surfing. Only if the risk analysis shows a significant deviation would the user be asked to explicitly demonstrate they are who they say they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unobtrusive nature of risk-adaptive / password-fewer authentication is a win-win for those who deploy it: they reduce their own risks of loss from fraud while providing a better experience for their customers. Happy customers mean repeat business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of all, MFA and risk-adaptive authentication can go hand-in-hand. Risk-adaptive authentication systems can leverage MFA methods for those cases where they do sense something is amiss in the request context and need to re-authenticate or step-up authentication for certain types of transactions. Mobile push notifications, mobile biometrics, and FIDO authenticators improve usability and security concomitantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than continuing to wait on the organizations we interact with to update their authentication systems, how do we move forward?&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ask. Use available contact methods such as emailing support or chat options. At least requests are registered. Honestly this method has not met with much success.&nbsp; 
 Ask more formally. Contact CISOs of organizations that use weak authentication and respectfully request that they implement MFA and risk-based authentication to reduce their risk and protect your information and assets better. Consider having an attorney send a letter on your behalf. If the organization in question does not have a CISO, find contacts for their legal counsel, CIO, CTO, or another high-level position that has the power to make positive changes.&nbsp; 
 Look for more secure alternatives in the marketplace. If you feel that your info and assets are not being properly protected by the service providers you are currently doing business with, then look for those that do offer the kind of security that you need.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It’s time for consumers to make their concerns and desires for a more secure ecommerce ecosystem known. Join us at EIC in Berlin in May for a vibrant discussion on the latest authentication technologies and how implementing them can protect organizations, consumers, and improve business.&nbsp;</p>
