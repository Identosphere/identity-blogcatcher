 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Kaliya Young – consultant, conference organiser, author, activist. 
<p>In episode 36, Kaliya and Oscar discuss the long-running Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) that she co-founded, the effects of moving to virtual identity conferences in 2020, insights from Kaliya’s books – ‘The Domains of Identity’, newly published in 2020, and ‘A Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity’ – plus some great tips for all business leaders on how to view the role of identity in their organisation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think we may be selling self-sovereign identity all wrong. It should be infinitely scalable, low-cost federation. That’s really powerful!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Kaliya Young is the author of two books “<a href="https://www.anthempress.com/the-domains-of-identity-pb">The Domains of Identity</a>” and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Guide-Self-Sovereign-Identity-ebook/dp/B07Q3TXLDP/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=guide+to+self+sovereign+identity&amp;qid=1601333817&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">A Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity</a>”.</p>
<p>For the past 15 years, she has been working to catalyse the creation of a layer of identity for people based on open standards. She co-founded the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) in 2005 to bring together technologists who want to see decentralised identity come into being. In the fifteen years their community has been meeting, they have created standards being used all over the internet, like OpenID Connect and OAuth. In 2012 she was recognised as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>The next IIW is in April. Sign up on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxii-32-2021a-tickets-131551119941">Eventbrite</a>.</p>
<p>Kaliya is widely recognised for her community leadership. She travels to Africa and Asia at least once a year to ensure the development of person-centric identity is truly global and inclusive. Most recently, she co-founded <a href="https://humanfirst.tech/">HumanFirst.Tech</a> with Shireen Mitchell, a project focused on creating space for diverse voices and building a more inclusive industry.</p>
<p>In 2009, she was named one of Fast Company’s Most Influential Women in Technology.</p>

 Having a dedicated part of a mobile app for authorized users is a must for a modern-day app. Users want to have a personalized experience with the apps they love. They expect to seamlessly use services on different devices and platforms. And, most of all, they want to be sure that their personal data is secure.

<p>Having a dedicated part of a mobile app for authorized users is a must for a modern-day app. Users want to have a personalized experience with the apps they love. They expect to seamlessly use services on different devices and platforms. And, most of all, they want to be sure that their personal data is secure.</p>
 
 
<p>Implementing a secure login process on Android can be challenging to achieve since many different moving parts need to be working in sync. On the Android side, you need to create a friendly login UI, communicate with a back-end service, securely persist the user data on the device, and maintain that data since the user expects to go through the login process only once. On top of that, you need to have a back-end app that supports the login features in the most secure way possible.</p>
 
 
<p>Here is where the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-android">Okta OIDC SDK</a> comes to the rescue! It’s a mobile SDK developed by industry-leading security experts, designed to provide a simple way for your users to log in into your app. This is done by using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC), which are the security industry’s standards for authorization and authentication. A fun guide to these technologies can be found in <a>An Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>This post will show you how easy it is to set up the Okta OIDC SDK on Android and leave you with a working app that allows users to securely login!</p>

 Create an Android Login Application 
 
 
<p>To begin, create a new Android app. It will consist of three screens:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Splash screen where you figure out if the user is already logged in or not.</p>
 
 
<p>Login screen.</p>
 
 
<p>Home screen, which is only accessible to the logged-in users.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>First, you’ll need to download and install the latest version of <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> (v4.1.1 at the time of this writing).</p>
 
 
<p>Next, launch the app and navigate to File → New…​ → New Project…​. Then, create an "Empty Activity" for "Phone and Tablet." You should now see a screen similar to this:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Change your application name and add the right package name, set the minimum SDK to API 23, and click Finish to create the project.</p>
 
 
 Add the Okta Android OIDC SDK 
 
<p>Android apps use <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> as their build tool. To add the Okta OIDC SDK as a dependency to your project, you will need to modify the app module’s <code>build.gradle</code> file:</p>
 
 
<p>You need to add the right auth redirect scheme for your Okta app and add the Okta library as a dependency. Make sure the <code>applicationId</code> matches what you used when creating your app.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>plugins {
    id 'com.android.application'
    id 'kotlin-android'
}

1
The redirect URI for the application you created in your Okta Developer Console.


2
We are using a view binding feature to interact with our views. More information can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding">here</a>.


3
Okta OIDC libraries require Java 1.8 compatibility.


4
Add the dependency required for the Okta OIDC library.


 
 
 
 
<p>Sync the project with Gradle files by clicking the File → Sync Project with Gradle Files, so the Okta dependency gets downloaded.</p>
 
 
 
 Install the Okta CLI 
 
<p>Getting started with Okta is made quite straightforward with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a>. It’s a tool that makes creating an Okta account and an Okta application a breeze!</p>
 
 
<p>The Okta CLI is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows.</p>
 
 
 MacOS (via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>) 
 
 
 <code>brew install --cask oktadeveloper/tap/okta</code> 
 
 
 






<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is a package manager for macOS.



 
 
 
 Linux (via Flatpak) 
 
 
 <code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install com.okta.developer.CLI
alias okta="flatpak run com.okta.developer.CLI"</code> 
 
 
 






<a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a> is a utility for software deployment and package management for Linux.



 
 
 
 Windows (via Chocolatey) 
 
 
 <code>choco install okta --version=0.7.1</code> 
 
 
 






<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> is a package manager for Windows.



 
 
<p>If you don’t want to use a package manager, you can install the Okta CLI with curl and bash.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli/master/cli/src/main/scripts/install.sh | bash</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Register Your Android Application 
 
<p>To create an Okta developer account, simply run the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>okta register</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You will be prompted with a few questions:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>➜  okta register
First name: Dino
Last name: Bikic
Email address: ******@*****.***
Company: Okta

 Create an Okta OIDC App 
 
<p>To create a new Okta OIDC app, run the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>okta apps create</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You will be prompted with a few questions:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>➜  okta apps create
Application name [dbikic]: Android Login (1)
Type of Application
(The Okta CLI only supports a subset of application types and properties):
&gt; 1: Web
&gt; 2: Single Page App
&gt; 3: Native App (mobile)  (2)
&gt; 4: Service (Machine-to-Machine)

Okta application configuration:
okta.oauth2.issuer: https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id: ********************  (5)</code> 
 
 
 


1
Name your Okta app.


2
Native app (mobile) is the option to select for Android applications.


3
Press enter for the default value. You will need this value for the Okta library setup.


4
Press enter for the default value. You will need this value for the Okta library setup.


5
You will need this ID for the initialization of the Okta library in your application.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Create an Android Application Class 
 
 
<p>In the root folder of your app’s package (in the provided example, that’s the folder <code>app/src/main/java/dev/dbikic/oktaloginexample</code>) create a Kotlin application class named`OktaLoginApplication`.</p>
 
 






The <code>Application</code> class is the entry point of your app and is used to maintain the global state of the application. The most common use for it is to initialize the third-party libraries in its <code>onCreate()</code> method. More info about it can be found in <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application">Android’s official documentation</a>.



 
 
<p>For now, just create the class and make it extend the <code>Application</code> class from the Android framework.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample (1)

import android.app.Application

class OktaLoginApplication : Application()</code> 
 
 
 


1
Update the package to match the one you set when creating the project.


 
 
 
 
<p>After creating the application class, you need to reference it in your <code>app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample"&gt;

  &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt;    (1)

  &lt;application
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:name=".OktaLoginApplication"  (2)
    android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
    android:supportsRtl="true"
    android:theme="@style/Theme.OktaLoginExample" /&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code> 
 
 
 


1
<code>Okta OIDC SDK</code> needs internet permission to communicate with the back-end.


2
Reference the application class you created in the previous step.


 
 
 
 






<code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> is an essential file for an app that contains basic info about the app’s name, the package name, permissions, activities, and many other things. More information about it can be found in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro">official documentation</a>.



 
 
 
 
 Manage Authentication with a Manager Class 
 
 
<p>When adding third-party libraries to your codebase, it’s usually a good idea to create a wrapper class that will hide the actual usage. Reasons for this include:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Reusing of the common interaction with the libraries.</p>
 
 
<p>You can define all the library interactions in an interface and provide the actual implementation with dependency injection throughout your app.</p>
 
 
<p>Everything related to that library is in one place. Replacing the library with a different one is easy as you only need to change the wrapper class.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Because the above, create a class called <code>OktaManager</code> in the root package. This class will be used in all the screens you create:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample

import android.app.Activity
import android.content.Context
import com.okta.oidc.*
import com.okta.oidc.clients.sessions.SessionClient
import com.okta.oidc.clients.web.WebAuthClient
import com.okta.oidc.net.response.UserInfo
import com.okta.oidc.storage.security.DefaultEncryptionManager
import com.okta.oidc.util.AuthorizationException

class OktaManager(applicationContext: Context) {

    /**
     * Authorization client using chrome custom tab as a user agent.
     */
    private var webAuth: WebAuthClient (1)

    /**
     * The authorized client to interact with Okta's endpoints.
     */
    private var sessionClient: SessionClient (2)

    init {
        val config = OIDCConfig.Builder()
            .clientId("********************") (3)
            .discoveryUri("https://dev-123456.okta.com") (4)
            .redirectUri("com.okta.dev-123456:/callback") (5)
            .endSessionRedirectUri("com.okta.dev-123456:/") (6)
            .scopes("openid", "profile", "offline_access")
            .create()
        webAuth = Okta.WebAuthBuilder()
            .withConfig(config)
            .withContext(applicationContext)
            .withCallbackExecutor(null)
            .withEncryptionManager(DefaultEncryptionManager(applicationContext))
            .setRequireHardwareBackedKeyStore(true)  (7)
            .create()
        sessionClient = webAuth.sessionClient
    }

    fun isAuthenticated(): Boolean {
        return sessionClient.isAuthenticated
    }

    fun registerWebAuthCallback(callback: ResultCallback&lt;AuthorizationStatus, AuthorizationException&gt;, activity: Activity) {
        webAuth.registerCallback(callback, activity)
    }

    fun registerUserProfileCallback(callback: RequestCallback&lt;UserInfo, AuthorizationException&gt;) {
        sessionClient.getUserProfile(callback)
    }

    fun signIn(activity: Activity, payload: AuthenticationPayload) {
        webAuth.signIn(activity, payload)
    }

    fun signOut(activity: Activity, callback: RequestCallback&lt;Int, AuthorizationException&gt;) {
        webAuth.signOut(activity, callback)
    }

    fun clearUserData() {
        sessionClient.clear()
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
<code>private lateinit var webAuth: WebAuthClient</code> is a reference to the web client you will invoke to log in.


2
<code>private lateinit var sessionClient: SessionClient</code> refers to the session you can use to conduct multiple operations after logging in, such as getting the user’s profile, revoking the authentication token, refreshing the authentication token, etc.


3
Replace with your client ID.


4
Replace with your discovery URL.


5
Replace with your redirect URL.


6
Replace with your end session redirect URL.


7
<code>setRequireHardwareBackedKeyStore(true)</code> forces the app to require a device with encryption capabilities. This is the default configuration for Okta OIDC, and it’s considered the best practice. If you want to run this code in an emulator, though, you can temporarily set it to <code>false</code>.


 
 
 
 






Make sure to use the values you received when completing the <a>Create an Okta OIDC App</a> step.



 
 
<p>The last step of the setup stage will be to initialize the <code>OktaManager</code>. Remember the empty <code>OktaLoginApplication</code> class? Now you need to modify it to initialize the manager when the app is created.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample

import android.app.Application

class OktaLoginApplication : Application() {

    lateinit var oktaManager: OktaManager

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        oktaManager = OktaManager(this)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! Now, let’s create the screens.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Add an Android Splash Screen 
 
 
<p>The purpose of a splash screen is to initialize all the applications' dependencies and prepare the app for usage. You’ll use it to figure out if the user is authenticated and decide which screen to show next: the login screen or the home screen.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a <code>SplashActivity</code> class in the root package.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample

import android.content.Intent
import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.ui.LoginActivity

class SplashActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    (1)
    private val oktaManager: OktaManager by lazy { (application as OktaLoginApplication).oktaManager }

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        if (oktaManager.isAuthenticated()) {
            navigateToHome()
        } else {
            navigateToLogin()
        }
    }

    private fun navigateToHome() {
        // todo implement
    }

    private fun navigateToLogin() {
        startActivity(Intent(this, LoginActivity::class.java)) (2)
        finish()
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
For simplicity, the instance of the <code>OktaManager</code> class is in the application class so that it can be easily accessed from all the activities. The real-world solution here would be to use dependency injection and inject the instance class.


2
Ignore the unresolved reference error for now because we will add the missing class in the next step.


 
 
 
 
<p>Register the activity in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample"&gt;

  &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt;

  &lt;application
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:name=".OktaLoginApplication"
    android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
    android:supportsRtl="true"
    android:theme="@style/Theme.OktaLoginExample"&gt;

    &lt;activity
      android:name=".SplashActivity"&gt;
      &lt;intent-filter&gt;  (1)
        &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
        &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;
      &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;/activity&gt;
  &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code> 
 
 
 


1
This intent filter specifies that the <code>SplashActivity</code> is the first activity that will be shown when the app is launched


 
 
 
 
<p>This class won’t compile just yet. You’ll need to create <code>HomeActivity</code> and <code>LoginActivity</code> classes before it does.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Build an Android Login Screen 
 
 
<p>Now, let’s do the <code>LoginActivity</code>! First, create a simple layout with a button in <code>app/src/main/res/layout/activity_login.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
  xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
  android:background="@color/white"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  tools:context=".LoginActivity"&gt;

  &lt;Button
    android:id="@+id/signInButton"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_margin="40dp"
    android:text="Sign in"
    app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
    app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent" /&gt;

&lt;/androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, create the <code>LoginActivity</code> class in a new <code>ui</code> package:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.ui

import android.content.Intent
import android.os.Bundle
import android.util.Log
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import com.okta.oidc.*
import com.okta.oidc.AuthorizationStatus.*
import com.okta.oidc.util.AuthorizationException
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.OktaLoginApplication
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.OktaManager
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.databinding.ActivityLoginBinding

class LoginActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private val oktaManager: OktaManager by lazy { (application as OktaLoginApplication).oktaManager }
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityLoginBinding

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityLoginBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
        setupOktaCallback()
        setupViews()
    }

    private fun setupOktaCallback() {
        oktaManager.registerWebAuthCallback(getAuthCallback(), this)  (1)
    }

    private fun setupViews() {
        binding.signInButton.setOnClickListener {
            val payload = AuthenticationPayload.Builder().build()
            oktaManager.signIn(this, payload)  (2)
        }
    }

    private fun getAuthCallback(): ResultCallback&lt;AuthorizationStatus, AuthorizationException&gt; {
        return object : ResultCallback&lt;AuthorizationStatus, AuthorizationException&gt; {
            override fun onSuccess(result: AuthorizationStatus) {  (3)
                when (result) {
                    AUTHORIZED -&gt; navigateToHome()
                    SIGNED_OUT -&gt; Log.d("LoginActivity", "Signed out")
                    CANCELED -&gt; Log.d("LoginActivity", "Canceled")
                    ERROR -&gt; Log.d("LoginActivity", "Error")
                    EMAIL_VERIFICATION_AUTHENTICATED -&gt; Log.d("LoginActivity", "Email verification authenticated")
                    EMAIL_VERIFICATION_UNAUTHENTICATED -&gt; Log.d("LoginActivity", "Email verification unauthenticated")
                }
            }

            override fun onCancel() {
                Log.d("LoginActivity", "Canceled")
            }

            override fun onError(msg: String?, exception: AuthorizationException?) {
                Log.d("LoginActivity", "Error: $msg")
            }
        }
    }

    private fun navigateToHome() {
        // todo implement
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Register the auth callback with the <code>OktaManager</code>.


2
Call the sign-in method when the button is clicked.


3
The result is an <code>AuthorizationStatus</code> object. With a simple <code>when</code> expression we can quickly figure out the status type and access its members if needed.


 
 
 
 
<p>And register it in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;application
    ... &gt;
    ...
    &lt;activity
      android:name=".ui.LoginActivity"
      android:theme="@style/Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar" /&gt;
  &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The purpose of the <code>LoginActivity</code> is to try to authenticate the user with Okta when the login button is pressed. To achieve that, you need to register the web auth callback with the Okta OIDC SDK, and call the <code>signIn()</code> method.</p>
 
 
<p>This is enough for the SDK to open a custom Chrome tab with the login screen of the Okta application. Users input their credentials into the form, and when the process is finished, the appropriate method of your auth callback will be called. This allows you to gracefully handle the possible errors or handle the login success, which is, in this case, navigating to the <code>HomeActivity</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create an Android Home Screen 
 
 
<p><code>HomeActivity</code> is the part of your app which can be accessed only by authorized users. In this example, you can fetch the user details, display the user name on the UI, and sign the user out of the app. First, create the layout file in <code>res/layout/activity_home.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  tools:context=".HomeActivity"&gt;

  &lt;TextView
    android:id="@+id/userLabel"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="0dp"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:gravity="center"
    android:textSize="22sp"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText"
    tools:text="Hello, user!" /&gt;

  &lt;Button
    android:id="@+id/signOutButton"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_margin="40dp"
    android:text="Log out"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText" /&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, create the <code>HomeActivity</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.ui

import android.content.Intent
import android.os.Bundle
import android.util.Log
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity

    private val oktaManager: OktaManager by lazy { (application as OktaLoginApplication).oktaManager }
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityHomeBinding

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityHomeBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)

        oktaManager.registerUserProfileCallback(getUserProfileCallback()) (1)
        binding.signOutButton.setOnClickListener {
            oktaManager.signOut(this, getSignOutCallback()) (2)
        }
    }

    private fun getSignOutCallback(): RequestCallback&lt;Int, AuthorizationException&gt; {
        return object : RequestCallback&lt;Int, AuthorizationException&gt; {
            override fun onSuccess(result: Int) {
                oktaManager.clearUserData() (3)
                val intent = Intent(this@HomeActivity, LoginActivity::class.java) (4)
                intent.flags = Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP (5)
                startActivity(intent)
                finish()
            }

            override fun onError(msg: String?, exception: AuthorizationException?) {
                Log.d("HomeActivity", "Error: $msg")
            }
        }
    }

    private fun getUserProfileCallback(): RequestCallback&lt;UserInfo, AuthorizationException&gt; {
        return object : RequestCallback&lt;UserInfo, AuthorizationException&gt; {
            override fun onSuccess(result: UserInfo) {
                binding.userLabel.text = "Hello, ${result["preferred_username"]}!" (6)
            }

            override fun onError(msg: String?, exception: AuthorizationException?) {
                Log.d("HomeActivity", "Error: $msg")
            }
        }
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Register the user profile callback with the <code>OktaManager</code>.


2
Sign out from the app on the sign out button.


3
After the user is successfully logged out from Okta, clear the user’s data.


4
Navigate the user back to the <code>LoginActivity</code> after they sign out.


5
This flag makes sure that all the back stack activities are cleared and that the <code>LoginActivity</code> will be the only activity in the memory.


6
You have fetched the user info successfully! You can check which fields you received <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#response-example-success-5">here</a>.


 
 
 
 
<p>And register it in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;application
    ... &gt;
    ...
    &lt;activity
      android:name=".ui.HomeActivity"
      android:theme="@style/Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar" /&gt;
  &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can now implement the empty method <code>navigateToHome()</code> in both <code>SplashActivity</code> and <code>LoginActivity</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.ui.HomeActivity

...

private fun navigateToHome() {
    startActivity(Intent(this, HomeActivity::class.java))
    finish()
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run Your Android Application 
 
 
<p>Now it’s time to run the application on an emulator or on a physical device, by pressing the play icon in the top right part of Android Studio. Your app and its login process should look similar to the video below:</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>What’s cool about the Okta OIDC SDK is that it also securely stores the user session to the app’s local storage and maintains its state for you. Instead of creating a custom user management system and handling multiple edge-cases that can happen in the real world, you can concentrate on spending your time building app features for your users.</p>
 
 
<p>You also implemented the logout flow, which is triggered by the user clicking the Log Out button:</p>
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Learn More About Android and OIDC 
 
 
<p>This post showcased how easy it is to set up and use the Okta OIDC SDK for an Android app. The functionalities which the SDK brings to your app, like the OAuth 2.0 authorization and OpenID Connect authentication, are essential for a modern-day app with challenges like security and data privacy.</p>
 
 
<p>Creating a custom solution for security and privacy is challenging and time-consuming since the code on the mobile part is not enough, and you also need to have a back-end app that supports those features. Maintaining two applications can cause a lot of long-term work.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-android-login-example">oktadeveloper/okta-android-login-example repository</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Although the example you created here does enough to satisfy the needs of most apps, the Okta OIDC SDK doesn’t stop there. The <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-android">Okta OIDC Android repository</a> contains a variety of ideas and suggestions to improve user experience such as:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Using your own OkHttp client.</p>
 
 
<p>Using a custom UI to log in.</p>
 
 
<p>Add a social login for accounts that include Google, Apple, Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>
 
 
<p>Biometric login, with Iris authentication, fingerprint authentication, PIN authentication, pattern authentication, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Having fine-grained control over session tokens' expiration and refresh.</p>
 
 
<p>Settings to handle preference of browser client for the authentication process.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>This post has provided you with the foundations to set up a successful OIDC client. If you want to deepen your knowledge around modern authentication systems, check these additional resources on Android, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect:</p>

(New episodes every two&nbsp;weeks.)</p><p>A morsel for you. Here’s&nbsp;Greg:</p><blockquote>The ironic thing here is if you read what the mission is of the SEC, it’s to protect investors, to maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and to facilitate capital formation. If you go through each of those five things — is this protecting investors? Is this fair? Is this orderly? Is this efficient? Does this promote capital formation? And in every one of those checkboxes, this action achieved exactly the opposite&nbsp;outcome.</blockquote><p>This first episode&nbsp;covers:</p>  Our hot take on the SEC lawsuit (and what their intentions were — hint: it’s a turf&nbsp;war.)  How the lawsuit comes off like a Tony Soprano shakedown — without actually bringing regulatory clarity. (And certainly not in step w/the spiritual mission of the&nbsp;SEC.)  Whether or not XRP is a security. (It’s&nbsp;not.)  And what this means for the industry at large.

 Naast informatie uit overheidsbronnen kan nu ook banktransacties aangeleverd worden 



<p>Ockto stelt consumenten in staat om makkelijk en veilig persoonlijke gegevens bij verschillende overheidsbronnen op te halen en te delen met financieel dienstverleners. Inmiddels is de Ockto dataset uit te breiden met informatie uit banktransacties. Hierdoor zijn acceptatieprocessen voor financiële diensten nog verder te digitaliseren. Daarnaast maakt deze uitbreiding het werken met brondata voor nog meer sectoren interessant.</p>



<p>Na de toekenning van de PSD2-vergunning door DNB afgelopen zomer is er bij Ockto veel werk verzet. Klanten van Ockto kunnen consumenten nu ook vragen benodigde informatie uit banktransacties aan te leveren. Deze worden gecategoriseerd naar soort inkomsten en uitgaven. Denk daarbij aan de maandelijkse vaste lasten en inkomsten voor een huishouden zoals betaalde huur, kinderopvang, eventuele alimentatie, etc. Dat maakt het mogelijk voor een consument om niet alle banktransacties te delen, maar alleen de informatie die noodzakelijk is voor het verlenen van de betreffende dienst.</p>



 Werken met brondata nu voor meer sectoren interessant 



<p>Met de toevoeging van informatie uit banktransacties wordt het digitaliseren door te werken met brondata voor nog meer sectoren interessant. Auke Dirkmaat, Sales Manager Ockto: “We zien dat informatie uit banktransacties een belangrijke game changer is voor onder andere aanbieders van consumptief krediet en de private lease sector. Maar denk ook aan overheidsinstanties. Zij kunnen met behulp van Ockto de dienstverlening digitaliseren waardoor burgers veel persoonlijke gegevens niet meer los aan hoeven te leveren. Bijvoorbeeld bij schuldhulpverlening en het toekennen van regelingen en subsidies.”</p>



 Toezichthouders 



<p>Ook toezichthouders bewegen inmiddels mee met de trend om processen te digitaliseren met behulp van brondata. Per 1 april wordt bijvoorbeeld de VFN-leennorm aangepast waarbij het gebruik van brondata wordt toegestaan voor de kredietwaardigheidstoetsing.</p>



 Klanttrajecten 



<p>Inmiddels lopen er verschillende klanttrajecten waarbij informatie uit banktransacties gebruikt worden. Bijvoorbeeld voor bijzonder beheer in de hypotheeksector. Gert Vasse, Account Director Ockto: “Partijen beginnen logischerwijs met deze functionaliteit bij afdelingen waar een consument al banktransactie informatie moet aanleveren. Voor zowel de consument als de casemanager kunnen hiermee veiliger en efficiënter banktransacties opgehaald, gecategoriseerd en geïnterpreteerd worden.”</p>



 Snel, eenvoudig en veilig gegevens aanleveren via een app 



<p>Met Ockto kunnen financiële dienstverleners consumenten verzoeken digitaal gegevens aan te leveren via de Ockto-app. Bijvoorbeeld voor een hypotheek, financieel advies, een huurwoning, of het openen van een spaarrekening. Snel, makkelijk en veilig. Hierdoor wordt het aanleveren van losse documenten verleden tijd. Ockto zorgt dat alleen de gegevens aangeleverd worden die nodig zijn voor het proces waarmee dus volledig wordt voldaan aan de AVG.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>MYKEY, the multi-chain smart wallet, officially supported the DOT token through third-party custody, and the custody service is provided by Hashkey Hub. To ensure the security of users’ assets, KYC authentication is required(PS: users who have enabled BTC feature no longer need&nbsp;it).</p><p>DOT is the token of Polkadot. Polkadot is an open-source sharding multi-chain protocol that can facilitate the cross-chain transmission of any type of data or asset (not only tokens) so that various blockchains can interoperate.</p> The difference between the MYKEY DOT token and the DOT of other&nbsp;wallets <p>1. Implementation method: MYKEY uses a decentralized account to authorize centralized custody, and all operations can only be performed after the user’s signature, ensuring the security of the user’s DOT assets to the greatest&nbsp;extent.</p><p>2. Cost of Transfers: DOT transfers between MYKEY users can be made in a fast way and free fee (the Network&nbsp;Fee).</p><p>3. Asset Retrievable: Based on the recovery mechanism of the KEY ID protocol, even if the MYKEY account/device is lost, users can retrieve the DOT&nbsp;assets.</p><p>4. The compliance Agency: HashKey Hub is a product of HashKey Group, committed to providing users with one-stop digital asset management services in a simple, easy-to-use, safe, and compliant manner. An App realizing the safe storage, gain, and trade of digital assets. Free transfers amongst Hashkey platform users, and steady income based on regular financial products in mainstream tokens.</p> How to add the DOT&nbsp;token <p>Enter MYKEY and update to the newest version 3.4.0. Click [Assets] &gt; [Token] &gt; [+] &gt; [DOT] and add&nbsp;it.</p><p>Note:</p><p>1. The single transfer amount of the user to MYKEY DOT account is at least 1.5 DOT. If a single transfer is less than 1.5 DOT, the tokens will be&nbsp;lost.</p><p>2. Because the custodian needs to be responsible for users as much as possible and ensure the security of BTC assets, KYC authentication is required to create an account. Please upload the ID card and handhold a note with Hashkey and the application date and your ID. Users who have enabled the BTC feature no longer need&nbsp;it.</p><p>FAQ</p><p>1. How long does the KYC audit take? What if the submission fails?</p><p>Generally, it takes 1–2 working days for the audit, if the application fails to be submitted, please contact the MYKEY Customer Service: @mykeytothemoon in Telegram.</p><p>2. How much Network Fee is required for transfer?</p><p>There is no Network Fee for internal transfer, and it will arrive quickly. $0.2 Network Fee per transaction is required for external transfer.</p><p>About Us</p><p>KEY GROUP: <a href="http://keygroup.me/">https://keygroup.me/</a></p><p>MYKEY Web: <a href="http://mykey.org/">https://mykey.org/</a></p><p>BIHU: <a href="http://bihu.com/">https://bihu.com/people/1133973</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="http://t.me/mykey_lab">https://t.me/mykey_lab</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href="http://twitter.com/mykey_lab"> https://twitter.com/mykey_lab</a></p><p>Medium: <a href="http://medium.com/mykey-lab">https://medium.com/mykey-lab</a></p><p>Github: <a href="http://github.com/mykeylab">https://github.com/mykeylab</a></p><p>Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKpkcMxDMZL-OAVfQPodqgg">MYKEY Laboratory</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/mykey-officially-supported-the-dot-token-8553090058bd">MYKEY officially Supported the DOT Token</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab">MYKEY Lab</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Can you “sense” the next year&nbsp;yet? <p>With 2020 in the rearview mirror, it is time to take a look at all the things Ontology has lined up for 2021. While 2020 was dominated primarily by the rise of DeFi, which Ontology took part in through the successful launch of <a href="http://wing.finance">Wing.Finance</a>, we hope that 2021 will take the momentum DeFi has seen and spread it across other industries.</p><p>Our focus for the upcoming year revolves around optimizing deeper product integrations across different blockchains and bringing more users onboard the Ontology experience with secure layers of protection for their Decentralized Identity and Data. Given the various core projects Ontology is building, we thought it’d be best to share a roadmap of how each of these projects will collaborate and&nbsp;grow.</p><p>Just as human beings have five core senses ‒ sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste ‒ which work in tandem to create the human experience, Ontology also has 5 core “senses” that collaborate intimately to create a better Ontology experience in 2021. In no particular order, they are ONT ID (“Identity”), OScore (“Credit”), ONTO (“Wallet”), Wing (“Lending”), and SAGA (“Data”).</p><p>Below is our 2021 roadmap for how we plan on driving further innovation and bring more users to our platforms.</p> ONT ID &amp;&nbsp;UID <p>2021 Roadmap:</p>  Integrate our decentralized identity features on more public chains in addition to Ethereum, Polkadot, and Binance Smart&nbsp;Chain  Implement additional security and privacy controls for&nbsp;users  <p>At the core of what we do is a laser focus on providing the utmost security and privacy controls for users in regards to their own identity and the data they produce. This is perhaps most commonly seen in our ONT ID, a decentralized form of identification transcribed on the blockchain making it immutable and completely safe from hacking. Through a revamped DDXF which aims to support more decentralized data application scenarios, ONT ID protocols can be exported to an array of different public chains in 2021 in order to become the default market leader for decentralized identities and data protocols across chains. This vision has already been set in motion in 2020, as cross-chain Universal Identity (UID) is now supported on Ethereum, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, and more. By locking down industry leaders, we are confident in adding additional chains in 2021 to the DeID movement.</p> OScore <p>2021 Roadmap:</p>  Integrate OScore into more DeFi platforms  Tackle other use cases for&nbsp;OScore  <p>With the inaugural launch of OScore on Wing’s Inclusive Pool, we have seen market adoption from an extended network of users. Through this data and analysis, we strongly believe that 2021 will see significant growth in other platforms and dApps adopting our credit-scoring system. Many of the immediate possibilities revolve around the DeFi space, such as credit-based lending and borrowing, which is still drastically underdeveloped. Compared to traditional finance, we know that DeFi can only truly take off with the addition of a trustworthy and transparent credit system like OScore. Not only will OScore be used in DeFi, but we envision a world where decentralized credit scoring could evolve into a self-sovereign reputation score controlled by the end-user.</p> ONTO <p>2021 Roadmap:</p>  Add support for more dApps on&nbsp;ONTO  Build deeper native integrations with DEXs and dApps within&nbsp;ONTO  <p>As cross-chain usability becomes a default requirement in wallets, ONTO is focused on bridging multiple chains together within a single user experience. As seen with its recent additions of Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum 2.0, the team behind ONTO will primarily focus on making sure ONTO is the only wallet you need, especially as we continue to invest in adding more decentralized applications and DEXes. We also view ONTO as a leading candidate to give you accessibility to the DeFi space by making it easier for you to stake in different liquidity pools or swap assets across the same, or different chains. As OScore continues to evolve, ONTO and OScore will become more synergistic, ultimately creating an in-depth snapshot of your crypto transactions and dApp activities under your control. We also envision ONTO will help the unbanked around the world by allowing for micropayments, and ultimately salary to be paid directly to a person’s ONTO wallet&nbsp;address.</p> Wing <p>2021 Roadmap:</p>  Launch new product pools to support more asset types beyond fungible&nbsp;tokens  Launch the Wing platform on other blockchains including Ethereum  Drive forward total value locked and usage from existing and new communities  <p>2020 was marked by the sudden astronomical rise of DeFi. As a natural extension to Ontology’s decentralized identity capabilities, the Ontology team invested heavy resources in building out Wing’s technical infrastructure, resulting in successful product launches like the Flash Pool and more recently, the Inclusive Pool. Moving into 2021, Ontology will continue working with Wing to develop further product lines that expand the types of assets which can be lent, borrowed, and collateralized. These include but are not limited to NFTs, art, real estate, derivatives, synthetic assets, and securities. Using OScore, Wing will also lean into deeper elements of undercollateralized lending to expand accessibility for more users to participate in the lending ecosystem. This will also allow Wing to explore new areas such as microlending and credit delegation, all while retaining user privacy and data protection. On top of that, 2021 will see Wing being built on other blockchains as well. The primary focus will be to build it on Ethereum so that Wing can support more ERC-20 assets, making it much more convenient to use for the existing Ethereum DeFi community. At the same time, Wing will work to bring in a generation of new users from emerging markets who stand to benefit from the disruptive potential of decentralized finance.</p> SAGA <p>2021 Roadmap:</p>  Add new ecosystem partners across various industries to the decentralized data&nbsp;platform  Invest into how research can be applied to more real use&nbsp;cases  <p>Moving into 2021, SAGA will invest heavily in research, and how theoretical research applications can be integrated into real use cases that strengthen SAGA’s data interaction protocols. Investments will also be funneled into creating more prototypes that can use the vast amount of data already available on the SAGA platform. Throughout the year, the SAGA team aims to deepen its ties with existing ecosystem partners while improving the product framework and seeking further partners to grow a truly decentralized data marketplace.</p> Conclusion <p>As we grow, our senses continue to adapt and change. Sometimes a scent like vanilla will be enticing, whereas other times it will be bothersome. With this in mind, we treat the five core elements of Ontology the same way, rapidly testing and iterating based on the feedback obtained from external stimuli. We look forward to growing out each vertical and have full confidence in our team to execute on the improvements needed along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Despite the rapid changes being made in these verticals, the core aspect of Ontology, which is our public blockchain, will not undergo much change. Rather, there will be a reinforced focus on improving the security of our decentralized network through onboarding additional enterprises and community run consensus, as well as candidate nodes. Our new governance model lowers the threshold for users to run a node or stake into a node to participate in the governance of our public blockchain. This improves upon its already established high performance while providing security and stability. In addition, more flexible staking mechanisms and support for different types of smart contracts will also be added in 2021. Our core tech team will look to create even more innovative products at the cross-section of DeFi and DeID in 2021 to complement the existing Ontology ecosystem.</p><p>In terms of community, our goal is to continue tackling real-world use cases made possible by using the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID / DDXF, Ontology’s DeFi products such as Wing, and our ONTO Wallet, as well as with the additional support from our innovative community members and all of Ontology’s community-run projects.</p><p>To conclude this roadmap, we want to thank our entire community for your support over the last 3 years, and we look forward to recapping 2021 at the end of next year the same way we recapped 2020 this year — with pride and&nbsp;success!</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-2021-roadmap-f5096d774b11">Ontology 2021 Roadmap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I had no intention to write any blog posts during the holidays or, God forbid, do any predictions for the next year (look how relevant last year’s predictions turned out to be). However, an <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/30/business/ticketmaster-plea-passwords-computers/index.html">interesting story</a> involving Ticketmaster, a large American ticket sales company, has caught my eye and made me think once again about my career in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The whole story goes all the way back to 2013, but the details have only recently been unsealed after the company has entered into a plea agreement and agreed to pay a $10 million fine for illegal access to a competitor’s computer system. Apparently, a former employee of the said (undisclosed) competitor switched to Ticketmaster in 2013, taking with him usernames and passwords for his former employer’s computer systems. On multiple occasions between 2013 and 2015, he and his new Ticketmaster colleagues illegally accessed that company’s computers to assess their competitor’s products and to “steal back” their customers. According to the article, Ticketmaster used this data to gain a competitive advantage while being aware of the illegal tactics and even promoted the employee.</p>
<p>Can't see the forest for the trees</p>
<p>Now, I realize that this is old news, and it will certainly be overshadowed by other, hotter stories like the recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/tolbert/attack-surface-reduction-and-xdr">SolarWinds scandal</a>. However, it is nevertheless worth looking at with more attention since, in a way, it much better represents the current state of cybersecurity as a whole. Pardon me for using a silly analogy, but cybersecurity experts sometimes remind me of the fans of zombie movies. I’m pretty sure everyone watching such a film imagines themselves as the main protagonist defending against a horde of monsters using a truck-mounted machine gun. However, In the very unlikely event of a real zombie apocalypse, most of us will surely end up as an insignificant part of that very horde…</p>
<p>In a similar way, discussing how we should defend against the latest highly advanced attack of another state-sponsored group has very little relevance for the risks an average company is facing daily, and designing your security architecture around the most current buzzword is not a wise strategy, perhaps even less wise than ignoring security risks completely. I’m not going to guess which of the extremes was the culprit of the Ticketmaster scandal, but you don’t have to be an expert to see that the victim company cannot be rated high on the cybersecurity maturity scale.</p>
<p>Not de-provisioning users that have left the company, using passwords without any multifactor authentication, and apparently not having any monitoring tools in place to detect illegal access – these are not some complicated technologies, but the very basic security hygiene rules. Why bother inventing new ways to fight sophisticated Russian or North Korean hackers if any malicious insider can easily exploit your systems for years without causing any suspicion? Maybe cybersecurity vendors, as well as the industry press and analysts should perhaps leave their ivory towers for a moment and focus their efforts on the lowest common denominator among their customers?</p>
<p>A dangerous precedent</p>
<p>There is another, even more worrying aspect in this case, however. Ticketmaster, a large company and a subsidiary of an even larger Live Nation conglomerate with billions in yearly revenue, was basically slapped on the wrist with a mere $10 million fine. Doesn’t it set a precedent that shows that corporate espionage and theft of intellectual property using the tried and trusted malicious insider approach can be considered a valid business practice, maybe unethical but still undeniably profitable? It took years to create reasonably comprehensive and harsh regulations for protecting personal information (with GDPR and such), but what about other types of sensitive data?</p>
<p>I have written about the “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-cargo-cult-of-cybersecurity">cargo cult of cybersecurity</a>” earlier, but what we have here is even worse – that’s cybersecurity’s Stone Age! I really hope that problems like this will be the focus of more discussions in 2021 and not just the trendiest buzzwords like ransomware or supply chain security. Because if they won’t, the worst of cybersecurity predictions for the next year will turn out to be true: nothing will ever change.</p>

  <p>Modern authentication systems use and generate JSON Web Tokens (JWT). There are many different ways that JWTs are used but, in this post, we will concentrate on JWTs that are used as OIDC access tokens. When a user successfully logs in to an application using a service like Okta, an OIDC access token is generated in the form of a JWT. That token can be passed in requests to the backend. The backend can then validate that token and reject all requests with invalid or missing tokens.</p>

<p>A common way to validate OIDC access tokens is to simply make an API request to the issuer with the access token. While this is the simplest method to use, it is far faster to validate tokens “offline”.</p>

<p>Today, we are going to build a simple web application that uses the Okta authentication widget to log users in. An access token will be generated and sent to an API written in Go which will validate the token. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>PS: The code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-offline-jwt-validation-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a Go Application 

<p>First things first, if you haven’t already got Go installed on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Download and install - The Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>Next, create a directory where all of your future code will live.</p>

   <code>mkdir jwt-go
cd jwt-go
</code>   

<p>Next, we will make our directory a Go module and install the Gin web server package, and the JWT verifier package.</p>

   <code>go mod init jwt-go
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go
</code>   

<p>A file called <code>go.mod</code> containing these dependencies will be created by the <code>go get</code> command.</p>

<p>To use Okta authentication, you need to have a free [Okta Developer account] (https://developer.okta.com). Once you’ve done this, sign in to the developer console and select Applications &gt; Add Application. Then select Single-Page App and hit Next. The next page is filled in with default values, most of which are sufficient for this application and don’t need to be changed. Important: Add the URL <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to the allowed redirect URLs. Hit Done.</p>

<p>There are two pieces of information that you need to obtain from the Okta Developer Console. These are your Okta domain name (e.g. <code>dev-12345.okta.com</code>) and your client id (e.g. <code>0ab1c2defg3AB4Chi567</code>).</p>

 How to Build a Web Client in Go with Okta Authentication 

<p>First, we need to create a directory for the static web pages.</p>

   <code>mkdir client
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>client/index.html</code> which loads the Okta JavaScript, and has a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with an id of <code>widget-container</code> for use by the Okta authentication widget, and a form to send messages to a backend API.</p>

   <code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Offline JWT Validation with Go&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/4.3.2/js/okta-sign-in.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;link href="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/4.3.2/css/okta-sign-in.min.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/&gt;
        &lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;
        &lt;script src="control.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Offline JWT Validation with Go&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;div id="widget-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="centred"&gt;
            &lt;form id="messageForm"&gt;
                Message: &lt;input id="message" name="message" type="message"/&gt;
                &lt;input type="button" value="Send" onclick="onmessage()"/&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;textarea id="messages" name="messages" rows="10" cols="50"&gt;Messages&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>client/control.js</code> containing the following JavaScript code:</p>

   <code>var accessToken = null;

var signIn = new OktaSignIn({
    baseUrl: 'http://${yourOktaDomain}',
    clientId: '${yourClientId}',
    redirectUri: window.location.origin,
    authParams: {
        issuer: 'https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
        responseType: ['token', 'id_token']
    }
});

signIn.renderEl({
    el: '#widget-container'
}, function success(res) {
    if (res.status === 'SUCCESS') {
        accessToken = res.tokens.accessToken.accessToken;
        signIn.hide();
    } else {
        alert('fail);')
    }
}, function(error) {
    alert('error ' + error);
});

function onmessage() {
    const url = "/api/messages";
    var headers = {}
    if (accessToken != null) {
        headers = { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + accessToken }
    }
    fetch(url, {
        method : "POST",
        mode: 'cors',
        headers: headers,
        body: new URLSearchParams(new FormData(document.getElementById("messageForm"))),
    })
    .then((response) =&gt; {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(response.error)
        }
        return response.text();
    })
    .then(data =&gt; {
        var msgs = JSON.parse(data) 
        document.getElementById('messages').value = msgs.messages.join('\n');
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = "Permission denied";
    });
}
</code>   

<p>So, what is this code doing? First, a variable named <code>accessToken</code> is created to store the JWT access token.</p>

<p>Next, we have created an <code>OktaSignIn</code> object named <code>signIn</code>. Note You need to replace both occurrences of <code>${yourOktaDomain}</code> with the Okta domain name from the console. Also, replace <code>${yourClientId}</code> with the client ID from the application we previously created in the console.</p>

<p>The <code>renderEl()</code> function displays the authentication UI and performs the authentication. If successful, a JWT access token is returned and saved. The UI is then hidden.</p>

<p>The <code>onmessage()</code> function is called when the “Send” button is clicked to submit the message form. This function makes a POST request to an <code>/api/messages</code> endpoint that we will be creating later on. The <code>onmessage()</code> function also passes in the message text to <code>/api/messages/</code>. The request to the <code>/api/messages</code> endpoint will also include the access token in an HTTP <code>Authorization</code> header. As it is a token the header needs to specify its type as <code>Bearer</code>. When the response comes back, the messages are all displayed in the text area.</p>

 How to Build a Simple Go Web Server 

<p>We are going to implement a web server using the Go Gin library. Create a file called <code>main.go</code> containing the following Go code in the <code>jwt-go</code> directory that you created at the beginning of this post:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/gin-contrib/static"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

var messages []string

func Messages(c *gin.Context) {
    message := c.PostForm("message")
    messages = append(messages, message)
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./client", false)))
    r.POST("/api/messages", Messages)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>So, what does this code do? The messages are stored in a slice of strings called <code>messages</code>. The <code>main()</code> function creates a default instance of a Gin HTTP web framework engine. It serves the static content, which we have already created, from the <code>client</code> directory. It calls the function <code>Messages()</code> on receipt of POST requests to <code>/api/Messages</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Messages()</code> function extracts the message from the POST form data and appends it to the list of messages. It then returns the list of messages back to the requester as a JSON object.</p>

<p>Now, we can test the application by running the server and pointing a web browser at http://localhost:8080.</p>

   <code>go run main.go
</code>   
 Introduction to  Complex Data Structures in Go 

<p>For those new to Go, some of the more complex code which we will see later will make more sense if we understand how Go handles lists and maps (also known as dictionaries or hash tables). Here is a short introduction to lists and maps in Go:</p>

<p>Consider an application which reads a JSON object from a file or a network resource. For example:</p>

   <code>[{ "name":"John", "age":30, "car":null },
 { "name":"Jane", "age":27, "car":"Mini" }]
</code>   

<p>We want to use the Go JSON decoder to turn the JSON string into a list of maps.</p>
 
   Map and list values can be of type nil, int, float, string, list, and map. 
   Go is a compiled language and it is also strongly typed. 
   Map keys are always strings. 
   The values of any map or list can be a mixture of types, so the values of a map or list can’t be given an explicit type in the code. 
 

<p>For example, In the code above, we declared a list of type <code>string</code> with this code:</p>

   <code>var messages []string
</code>   

<p>In order to overcome the typing issues, Go allows maps and lists to have values of any type by declaring the type as an interface, for example:</p>

   <code>var persons []interface{}
var person map[string]interface{}
</code>   

<p>This leads to another issue. When writing the code, it is impossible to know for certain what the actual type of the value is. For example, the JSON structure could change. The type can only be determined at runtime. This makes it important to know what the data structure actually is. If you know the type, you can use a type assertion that tells the compiler what the actual type is. In our example above, <code>persons</code> is a list of maps and <code>person</code> is a map containing a number of attributes.</p>

<p>The type assertions become:</p>

   <code>person, err := persons[0].(map[string]interface{})
name, err := person["name"].(string)
</code>   

<p>If the type assertion agrees with the actual type the <code>err</code> will be <code>nil</code>. You can omit the <code>err</code> return value, but if the type assertion fails then an exception will be thrown. Multiple type assertions can be used in the same expression:</p>

   <code>name := persons[0].(map[string]interface[])["name"].(string)
</code>   

<p>Finally, if you don’t know the actual type of an interface value, then you can use <code>reflect</code> to find it out:</p>

   <code>print(reflect.TypeOf(persons[0]))
</code>   

 How to Validate a JWT Token in Go 

<p>Now that we have the application working, it is time to validate the access token which is the focus of this article.</p>

<p>First of all, what is a JWT? It is three base64 encoded components separated by a <code>.</code> character.</p>

<p>The first component is the header. This is a map. The most important fields of the map are <code>alg</code> which specifies the cryptographic algorithm used, and the <code>kid</code> or key identifier which identifies which public key to use to verify the JWT.</p>

<p>The second component is the payload, which is a set of claims. A claim is a map. Important claims are <code>aud</code> which is the audience, and <code>iss</code> which is the issuer of the token.</p>

<p>The final component is the signature, which is a digital signature of the header and payload.</p>

<p>In order to validate the token, we first need the public key so that we can validate the signature. Start by modifying the <code>import</code> section of <code>main.go</code> to look like this:</p>

   <code>import (
    "net/http"
    "crypto/rsa"
    "encoding/json"
    "encoding/base64"
    "math/big"
    "os"

     "github.com/gin-contrib/static"
     "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)
</code>   

<p>Next, add the following Go code to <code>main.go</code>:</p>

   <code>var rsakeys map[string]*rsa.PublicKey

func GetPublicKeys() {
    rsakeys = make(map[string]*rsa.PublicKey)
    var body map[string]interface{}
    uri := "https://" + os.Getenv("OKTA_DOMAIN") + "/oauth2/default/v1/keys"
    resp, _ := http.Get(uri)
    json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&amp;body)
    for _, bodykey := range body["keys"].([]interface{}) {
        key := bodykey.(map[string]interface{})
        kid := key["kid"].(string)
        rsakey := new(rsa.PublicKey)
        number, _ := base64.RawURLEncoding.DecodeString(key["n"].(string))
        rsakey.N = new(big.Int).SetBytes(number)
        rsakey.E = 65537
        rsakeys[kid] = rsakey
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Then and add a call to the <code>Keys()</code> function to the <code>main()</code> function, like this:</p>

   <code>func main() {
    GetPublicKeys()
    r := gin.Default()
    r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./client", false)))
    r.POST("/api/messages", Messages)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>What do these changes do? First of all, in <code>GetPublicKeys()</code> a GET request is made to the Okta API to get the signing public keys for the Okta domain stored in the $OKTA_DOMAIN environment variable. The response is a JSON object containing a list of keys.</p>

<p>Next, we parse the JSON object to extract one or more of the  RSA public keys that we will use to verify access tokens from Okta. The key has two components, a number (called “N”), and an exponent (called “E”). The number is base64 encoded and the exponent is usually 65537 so we just hard-code it.</p>

<p>Now we need to add some code to do the actual verification. Update your <code>import</code> section so it looks like this:</p>

   <code>import (
    "crypto/rsa"
    "encoding/base64"
    "encoding/json"
    "math/big"
    "os"
    "strings"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go"
    "github.com/gin-contrib/static"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)
</code>   

<p>Then, add the following code to <code>main.go</code>.</p>

   <code>func Verify(c *gin.Context) bool {
    isValid := false
    errorMessage := ""
    tokenString := c.Request.Header.Get("Authorization")
    if strings.HasPrefix(tokenString, "Bearer ") {
        tokenString = strings.TrimPrefix(tokenString, "Bearer ")
        token, err := jwt.Parse(tokenString, func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
            return rsakeys[token.Header["kid"].(string)], nil
        })
        if err != nil {
            errorMessage = err.Error()
        } else if !token.Valid {
            errorMessage = "Invalid token"
        } else if token.Header["alg"] == nil {
            errorMessage = "alg must be defined"
        } else if token.Claims.(jwt.MapClaims)["aud"] != "api://default" {
            errorMessage = "Invalid aud"
        } else if !strings.Contains(token.Claims.(jwt.MapClaims)["iss"].(string), os.Getenv("OKTA_DOMAIN")) {
            errorMessage = "Invalid iss"
        } else {
            isValid = true
        }
        if !isValid {
            c.String(http.StatusForbidden, errorMessage)
        }
    } else {
        c.String(http.StatusUnauthorized, "Unauthorized")
    }
    return isValid
}
</code>   

<p>The function extracts an <code>Authorization</code> request header and looks for a <code>Bearer</code> token. If it does not exist, then a 401 <code>Unauthorized</code> response is sent.</p>

<p>The token string is then passed to the <code>jwt.Parse()</code> function, the second parameter being a function that returns the public key.</p>

<p>Now, we can validate the token. It must be rejected if any of the following are true:</p>
 
   The parse function returns an error which means that the token can’t be decoded, or more likely that the public key can’t decrypt the signature. 
   The token is invalid. 
   The cryptographic algorithm must be RSA256. 
   The audience does not match the expected audience. 
   The issuer is not the expected issuer. 
   The token has no key identifier. 
 

<p>Finally, modify the API functions to call <code>Verify()</code>.</p>

   <code>func Messages(c *gin.Context) {
    if Verify(c) {
        message := c.PostForm("message")
        messages = append(messages, message)
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
    }
}
</code>   

 Testing it all out 

<p>We can now test end to end. Start by  running the server:</p>

   <code>go run main.go
</code>   

<p>Next, point a web browser at http://localhost:8080.</p>

<p>Enter a message and hit the submit button. You should get an authorization error.</p>

<p>Now, login and try sending another message. This should send a token that gets validated correctly. Your message should be displayed.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In this post, we have learned how to authenticate with Okta to get a JWT, how to use that JWT in the <code>Authentication</code> header of an HTTP GET request, and how to perform “offline” validation of that JWT in Go.</p>

				  Indicio.tech finishes a working “mediator agent” and contributes its code to Hyperledger Aries and ACA-Py making it possible to communicate verifiable credentials to mobile devices via open source standards. Indicio is hosting a freely available test mediator agent for developers.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Indicio.tech, a professional services firm specializing in decentralized identity, today announced the launch—and availability for open testing—of the Indicio Mediator Agent. The company is also donating the underlying code to the open source <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/aries">Hyperledger Aries project</a><a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/aries">.</a></p>
<p>“It’s simple,” says Indicio CEO Heather Dahl. “If verifiable digital credentials are to be exchanged and identity verified, people need to be able to manage them on their mobile devices through an app. The mediator agent can be thought of as the pipe that enables this to happen.”</p>
<p>“The mediator is the tool that provides a cloud-based connection point to send and receive requests between mobile holders and issuers and verifiers,” says Indicio CTO, Ken Ebert. “We built it to make our clients’ projects work, and we contributed it to the open source community because a working mediator agent is critical to widespread adoption of decentralized identity.”</p>
<p>The Indicio Mediator Agent is the company’s latest contribution to Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) and the Aries Toolbox. Following <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0211-route-coordination/README.md">RFC 0211: Mediator Coordination</a>, Indicio built on the work of the open-source community to make mediation interoperable and vendor agnostic. This expands the opportunities for mobile wallet implementations.</p>
<p>As part of these contributions, mediation can be managed and debugged through ACA-Py’s built-in Admin REST API or the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-toolbox">Aries Toolbox</a>.</p>
<p>“We believe in an open-source foundation for decentralized identity,” says Dahl. “But as a professional services company, we couldn’t wait for critical technology to spontaneously mature—and, more importantly, our clients couldn’t wait either. So we’re filling the technical gaps, and making the code available for everyone to get building.”</p>
<p>For the Mediator Agent tools and repositories at Hyperledger Aries, access is available&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-toolbox">here</a>.</p>
<p>Indicio Offers Mediator Agent Workshops</p>
<p>To bring developers up to date on this latest contribution to the open source community, Indicio has prepared an instructor-led workshop focusing on the use and application of the Mediator Agent. Developers will learn how to access the repository, how to use an agent, and then discuss possible use cases.</p>
<p>“One thing we’ve found is that the community is hungry for professional development opportunities.” says Ebert. “By providing private training, we have motivated engineers to learn more about decentralized identity, develop use cases, and shorten the time between development, demonstration and even launch. We tailor our training&nbsp; to those&nbsp; points in the decentralized identity development journey that give the most trouble to those who want to pick up this technology and get to work building products and services.”</p>
<p>To book a private, instructor-led Mediator Agent training workshop, <a href="https://indicio.tech/#contact">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>Indicio-hosted Mediator Agent ready for developer testing </p>
<p>Those who want to build solutions using a mediator agent now can use Indicio’s free, hosted version of the mediator for testing, development, and demonstrations. This will shorten the time to develop proof-of-concept and pilot solutions, and help with ensuring interoperability.</p>
<p>Anyone in the decentralized identity community will have access to the mediator agent code via the open source contribution in the ACA-Py library.</p>
<p>You can access the Indicio-hosted Public Test Mediator Agent <a href="https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/">here.</a></p>
<p>A portfolio of decentralized identity services</p>
<p>Indicio.tech is committed to becoming a resource-hub for decentralized identity, providing enterprise-grade open source tools to its clients and to the community. This includes the <a href="https://indicio.tech/private-networks/">Private Networks</a> build service, the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">Indicio TestNet</a>, and a variety of customizable <a href="https://indicio.tech/training-packages/">training programs</a>. Companies and organizations from diverse industries around the world rely on Indicio.tech for expertise in building their decentralized identity solutions.</p>
<p>“We are focused on taking decentralized identity from a great idea to a great solution,” says Dahl. “For that to happen, companies and organizations need to focus on the products they want to build and the services they want to offer. They need all the technological elements of decentralized identity finished, working, and available. This is a major step toward &nbsp;that goal.”</p>

 2020 — A Year to&nbsp;Remember  Looking Back on Ocean’s Progress and&nbsp;Growth <p>2020 has been a long, albeit, memorable year for the Ocean&nbsp;team.</p><p>Crypto is intense in normal times but when you layer on a global health crisis that leads to unprecedented disruption of our day-to-day activities, the rollercoaster flipped and flopped us around like never before. It’s hard to see how any other year can&nbsp;compare.</p><p>To a large extent, crypto has been insulated from the economic upheaval. Crypto might even have benefited. The government response of quantitative easing and stimulus programs raised fears of currency debasement, which brought new converts and established crypto as a reliable asset class and a store of&nbsp;value.</p><p>Teams turned inwards to build out technology and focus on user adoption, rather than travel around to conferences. Projects cut out expenses to extend runways and ready themselves for an extended crypto-winter. And as the year progressed, people were finally able to play with working production code, and integrate with other projects to allow the entire space to mature together at a rapid&nbsp;pace.</p><p>At Ocean, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">started 2020 with an ambitious plan </a>to fulfill all of the covenants made since our project inception in 2017&nbsp;. Having released Ocean V1 at the end of 2019, which included the Pacific Network, our service execution agreements to govern access control, for 2020, we wanted&nbsp;to:</p>  Deliver Ocean V2 “Compute-to-Data”, our most requested feature  Re-architect and build out Ocean V3, datatokens using Ethereum infrastructure for the smart contracts and the ERC20 datatokens.  Build Ocean Market as a platform for data providers to meet with consumers and help to launch Initial Data Offerings  Have Ocean running in a fully decentralized manner on unstoppable infrastructure  Deploy a DAO and set the stage for community-based funding for Ocean ecosystem projects.  <p>These were ambitious goals. We were going to give it our best shot to achieve&nbsp;them.</p><p>I’m pleased to declare, that all of the promises made in 2017 were fully discharged. Everything that was promised, was delivered.</p><p>Even better, the nascent community around Ocean grew into a sizable and vocal “Navy”. The many ecosystem programs that had germinated in 2019, were fully deployed in 2020. The Ocean Ambassador, Shipyard and Data Economy Challenge programs were expanded and are reaching critical mass. The Telegram community became more diverse with multiple languages being supported by community members. We have a lively discussion on Discord. And the number of new contributors to our Github repository is growing&nbsp;rapidly.</p><p>We struck new partnerships with other projects and companies like Daimler, dexFreight, Filecoin, GAIA-X, Secret Network, the United Nations ITU and many&nbsp;more.</p><p>The $OCEAN token has increased in value 30x from the lows in Q3/2019, the number of holders has increased from 5,000 to over 20,000, and it is now listed on more than 35 exchanges with traded volumes ranging from $10–25 million per day. $OCEAN tokens have come so far from the days when there would be only $20–50k in daily traded&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Looking solely from the perspective of the Ocean, 2020 was a breakout year in all ways. We are truly blessed as a global, borderless community, fighting the good fight to build an open Data Economy that is accessible to everyone.</p><p>2021 promises to be a year of growth — see you&nbsp;there!</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Elliptic does not believe that the US Treasury’s proposed rules on unhosted wallet transactions are fit for purpose. The data shows that the risk has been overstated and the rules could in fact make it more challenging for law enforcement to pursue financial crime in cryptoassets.  
 We have called on FinCEN to extend the shortened comment period and reconsider their proposal.

					 <p>The year 2020 was quite the year for everyone. Despite its challenges, 2020 was a significant year of growth for the Trinsic platform, team, and brand. Below, we highlight the moments of growth in 2020 that we will never forget.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The world's first SSI platform is born 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>At the beginning of 2020, we <a href="https://trinsic.id/launch/">launched</a> the world’s first self-sovereign identity (SSI) platform. This included our powerful multi-tenant API platform, the Developer Portal (now called <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>) and a new and improved version of the Streetcred Wallet (now called <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>). Trinsic Studio, built on our powerful API platform, made it easy for developers to start issuing credentials in minutes and manage their credential exchange.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was the first production-grade SSI platform to market (prior to this there were only betas, alphas, early-access, pre-release, and other non-production solutions). And it was the first time anyone, not just software engineers, could get started with SSI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward to today, with hundreds of developers actively using Trinsic, we decided it was time to release the next generation of our Studio. The <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-releases-trinsic-studio-2-0/">release of Trinsic Studio 2.0</a> included a simplified <a href="https://trinsic.id/pricing/">pricing model</a>, an improved design, and better performance. These changes to Trinsic Studio have made SSI more accessible than ever. See for yourself at <a href="https://trinsic.studio">https://trinsic.studio</a>.</p>

			 Trinsic receives pre-seed funding &amp; rebrands 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>One of the biggest moments in 2020 was when we <a href="https://trinsic.id/streetcred-id-rebrands-to-trinsic-raises-pre-seed-funding/">raised pre-seed funding</a> from institutional investors and <a href="https://trinsic.id/introducing-trinsic/">rebranded</a> from Streetcred ID to Trinsic. <a href="https://www.kickstartfund.com/">Kickstart Seed Fund</a> led the oversubscribed round as the first investment of its recently-closed <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/29/2024148/0/en/Kickstart-Seed-Fund-Announces-the-Close-of-110-Million-Fund-V.html">$110 million fund</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of this investment, Dalton Wright, Partner at Kickstart Seed Fund, said, “Decentralized identity enables us to finally introduce human trust to the internet, something that has been sorely needed for decades. We’ve been anxiously waiting for an opportunity to invest in this space for years, and when we came across Trinsic, we knew we wanted in. Trinsic is doing for decentralized identity what Stripe did for online payments.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time as our funding announcement, we introduced our new company name and brand—Trinsic. This rebrand included the launch of our new website and <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-introduces-new-design-system/">design system</a>. It has been great to see how our new name has been received with open arms from our developer community and the SSI community in general.</p>

					 <p>One of the main questions at Trinsic that drives our decision-making is: What will make SSI more accessible? With the excellent feedback we receive from our developer community and the skills of our world-class engineering team, we consistently work to improve our platform to answer that question. In addition to the ongoing addition of new Aries RFCs and extensions to the platform, here are a few noteworthy product and feature updates:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/">Provider API:</a> We added a third API to our platform called the Provider API—the first product built specifically for SSI providers. The Provider API allows you to programmatically create and manage credential issuers/verifiers.  <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">Portable digital wallets:</a> Trinsic, Lissi, and esatus AG were the first SSI vendors to achieve wallet portability. This means that for the first time a person could stop using one type of digital wallet and start using a new one without losing their credentials.  <a href="https://trinsic.id/new-documentation-site/">New &amp; improved documentation site:</a> We released a new documentation site which includes a knowledge base for those that want to learn SSI concepts, our API reference, and a public developer forum.  <a href="https://trinsic.id/interactive-connections/">Interactive connections:</a> Interactive connections enable people to have richer interactions with others when using the Trinsic Wallet. This includes the following features: proactive credential sharing, interoperable chat messaging, an activity log, and connection invitations.

					 <p>This year, Trinsic partnered with workflow automation platform <a href="http://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> to bring verifiable credentials to over 2,000 other SaaS apps you use every day, including Office 365, GSuite, Adobe, Atlassian, Slack, Salesforce, and many more. After we released this, the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> used it to integrate Eventbrite (registration &amp; ticketing) with Trinsic (verifiable credentials) in order to issue IIW tickets as verifiable credentials. See our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/zapier-tutorial">tutorial </a>to learn how to get started fast with an example.</p>

					 <p>At the beginning of the global pandemic, Trinsic along with many others in the SSI space, saw the potential that verifiable credentials could have in mitigating the effects of COVID-19. We responded by helping start the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> and called upon the world to explore how verifiable credentials could be used to respond to the virus. Since our initial <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/call-to-action-verifiable-credentials-covid-19-a180155a157c">call to action</a>, dozens of developers and organizations have used Trinsic to build SSI solutions related to COVID-19. The solutions include receiving COVID-19 testing and vaccination credentials.

					 Indicio becomes a public benefit corporation 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  New structure supports the company’s mission, values, and its belief that identity technology should serve the public interest.   
			   
				
				
				 <p>Decentralized identity is a transformational technology that can protect an individual’s privacy, enable their consent in data sharing, and provide a pathway to formal identity for hundreds of millions of people currently without any legal means of proving who they are. Indicio.tech was founded to advance decentralized identity through providing the kind of professional services and critical infrastructure that can catalyze adoption of this technology. Today, in recognition of the role it can play in building and shaping a technology for the greater good, Indicio, announces that it has reincorporated as a public benefit corporation (PBC).</p>
<p>Indicio joins companies such as Patagonia and Kickstarter in embracing a corporate model that aligns shareholders and stakeholders around a shared mission to deliver a material benefit to society, not only through products and services and how they are made and delivered, but through prioritizing the welfare of employees, diversity and inclusion, and environmental impact.</p>
<p>“When it comes to our digital lives, it is hard to think of a technological advance more beneficial to the public than decentralized identity,” says Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “It will transform people’s digital lives by giving them control over who they are online and who they share information with. It will create identity for the hundreds of millions of people who currently lack formal, legal identity, which means giving them a way to access financial and health services. The advances in identity technology help us recover some of the lost, early idealism of the internet as a benefit to everyone. And while we know one company can’t save the world, we can take a stand about how the world can be a better place. Decentralized identity is our stand.”</p>
<p>As a Delaware PBC, the company will operate under the same management structure and corporate and tax laws it does today and with the same commitment to strong growth and profitability.</p>
<p>“Decentralized identity needs a variety of business models to rapidly scale,” says Dahl. “And we think for Indicio, the PBC model combines the best attributes of the traditional for-profit corporation with the public mission orientation of a nonprofit. We need to be agile. We need to be sustainable. We need to be innovative. And we need all of these qualities to be directed, without compromise, toward advancing decentralized identity.”</p>
<p>“For Indicio, becoming a PBC means honoring the idealism of the open source community that brought decentralized identity technology into existence,” says Ken Ebert CTO. “This means open sourcing the infrastructure that we build, and by making interoperability the compass point that directs how we build for others. Indicio has already begun doing this by open-sourcing its monitoring tools package and the company is about to release more tools and services that will make it easier for companies to develop and use decentralized identity solutions.”</p>
<p>As a PBC, Indicio will continue to pioneer architectural solutions and deliver superlative development and engineering support to its list of global clients, and it will do so by cultivating a company culture where employees and interns can get the professional development and mentoring they need in order to consistently deliver their best.</p>
<p>“When we reflect on the values that inspired our launch, propelled our growth, and delivered for our clients, we want to bake them into our company,” says Dahl. “We want to hold ourselves accountable to those values, and we want to be held publicly accountable for them. That’s a powerful feature of the PBC model. And just as it has enabled credible, third-party assessment on whether a company is delivering on its environmental commitments, we see it as providing a path for identity technology to be assessed in a similar way. There’s a long way to go, but at a time, when technology is under increasing criticism, we have a chance to build better and audit better from the beginning.”</p>
<p>Indicio joins a growing number of companies worldwide embracing the public benefit corporate model recognizing that businesses can build greater long-term value by committing to stakeholders, employees, and communities. So far, 35 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation enabling public benefit corporations (sometimes called benefit corporations), and many countries have followed with similar legislation.</p>
<p>Indicio’s PBC status will position the company as a leader in trusted identity platform builders as they advance the technology, the industries it serves, and connect the growing field of decentralized identity vendors. Indicio will set out its public benefit goals in the coming weeks.</p>

   Arguably one of the biggest drivers of innovation in the regtech industry has been the movement to accelerate adoption of the FATF’s Recommendation 16 - commonly referred to as the Travel Rule. That expansion has sparked a wide range of new developments, initiatives and solutions, which we cover in this article.

   Common table expressions are a powerful feature of Microsoft SQL Server. They allow you to store a temporary result and execute a statement afterward using that result set. These can be helpful when trying to accomplish a complicated process that SQL Server isn’t well suited to handle. CTEs allow you to perform difficult operations in two distinct steps that make the challenge easier to solve.

  <p>Common table expressions are a powerful feature of Microsoft SQL Server. They allow you to store a temporary result and execute a statement afterward using that result set. These can be helpful when trying to accomplish a complicated process that SQL Server isn’t well suited to handle. CTEs allow you to perform difficult operations in two distinct steps that make the challenge easier to solve.</p>

<p>In this article, you will learn how to write common table expressions using Microsoft SQL Server. You will then learn how to use that statement in a .NET Core MVC web application that is secured using Okta. Okta is a powerful yet easy to use single sign-on provider. By making use of Okta’s <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> package from Nuget, you will learn how to secure your application and any data from your CTEs properly.</p>

 Secure Your SQL CTE with an Okta Application 

<p>The first thing you want to do is set up your Okta application to handle your authentication. If you haven’t done so yet, you can sign up for a free developer account <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Log in to your Okta Developer console and click on Add Application. Select Web and click Next. On the next page, give your Okta application a meaningful name. You will also want to replace your URIs’ ports from 8080 to 3000. Finally, set your Logout redirect URIs to <code>http://localhost:3000/signout/callback</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on Done, and you will be taken to your application home screen. Make note of your Client ID, Client secret, and Okta domain, as you will need these in your web application.</p>

 Prepare the SQL Database to Use with Your CTE 

<p>To work on your database, you will need to have a database first. Microsoft provides several samples via Github. For this project, I used the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0">Wide World Importers sample database v1.0</a>. To use this, you will need to have at least SQL 2016 installed. Microsoft provides <code>.bak</code> and <code>.bacpac</code> files for you to use.</p>

 Common Table Expressions (CTEs) 

<p>Common table expressions are a temporary result set created by a simple query. Once this result set is obtained, you can perform SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, or MERGE operations on it. CTEs can be used in place of a complicated query - one with difficult joins and logic in it. By operating on a temporary result set, you can simplify the process, making it more readable, easier to optimize, and easier to debug. Let’s take a look at how CTEs work, and how they can make your life easier.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice is that the tax rates are all wrong. You aren’t supposed to charge tax unless the <code>DeliveryPostalCode</code> is <code>90490</code>. So, you’ll need to update each line item in the <code>InvoiceLines</code> table. But, to get the <code>DeliveryPostalCode</code>, you need a join from the <code>InvoiceLines</code> table to the <code>Invoices</code> table; then, a join  to the <code>Customers</code> table. You can round up the <code>DeliveryPostalCode</code> and associate it to the <code>InvoiceID</code> with SELECT, using the common table expression below. Next, you can run one statement using the temporary results set <code>tax_update</code>. After creating your results set of <code>InvoiceID</code> and <code>DeliveryPostalCode</code>, you can update the <code>InvoiceLines</code> table with the new <code>TaxRate</code>, and then you can update the <code>TaxAmount</code> and <code>ExtendedPrice</code> with ease.</p>

   <code>--****************************
--BEGIN CTE
--****************************
WITH tax_update (InvoiceID, DeliveryPostalCode) AS (    SELECT 
        [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices].InvoiceID, 
        DeliveryPostalCode 
    FROM 
        [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices] 
        INNER JOIN [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] ON [Invoices].[InvoiceID] = [InvoiceLines].[InvoiceID] 
        INNER JOIN [Sales].[Customers] ON [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices].CustomerID = [Sales].[Customers].CustomerID
) 
UPDATE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] 
SET 
    TaxRate = CASE WHEN DeliveryPostalCode = '90490' THEN 6.00 ELSE 0 END 
FROM 
    tax_update 
WHERE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines].InvoiceID = tax_update.InvoiceId

--****************************
--END CTE
--****************************

UPDATE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] 
SET 
    TaxAmount = TaxRate * Quantity * UnitPrice 
UPDATE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] 
SET 
    ExtendedPrice = TaxAmount +(Quantity * UnitPrice)
</code>   

<p>Next, you can write a select using a CTE. The example below is a bit simple for a CTE (you can accomplish this just with a join) but it serves the purpose of showing you how a CTE is written for selects.</p>

<p>Here, you are selecting the <code>CustomerID</code> to use to obtain the <code>CustomerName</code> from the <code>Customers</code> table, along with the <code>StockItemId</code> to obtain the <code>StockItemName</code> in your application.</p>

   <code>WITH customer_items (CustomerID, StockItemId, Quantity, 
LineProfit) AS (    SELECT 
        CustomerID, 
        StockItemId, 
        SUM (Quantity) AS Quantity, 
        SUM (LineProfit) AS LineProfit 
    FROM 
        [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices] 
        INNER JOIN [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] ON [Invoices].[InvoiceID] = [InvoiceLines].[InvoiceID] 
    GROUP BY 
        CustomerID, 
        StockItemID
) 
SELECT 
    CustomerName, 
    customer_items.Quantity, 
    customer_items.LineProfit, 
    [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemName] 
FROM 
    customer_items 
    INNER JOIN [Sales].[Customers] ON [Sales].[Customers].[CustomerId] = customer_items.CustomerID 
    INNER JOIN [Warehouse].[StockItems] ON customer_items.StockItemId = [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemID]
</code>   

 Create Your ASP.NET Core Web Application 

<p>Your SQL database is now set up, and it’s time to begin working on your web application. Open Visual Studio 2019 and Create a new project. Select ASP.NET Core Web Application and press Next. Select Web Application (Model-View-Controller). Ensure your framework is set to .NET Core 3.1 and uncheck Configure for HTTPS. Press Create and wait for your application scaffold.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once your application is created, open the project properties window and change your App URL to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> to match your Okta settings. Next, import the <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> package from NuGet.</p>

 <code>Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 3.5.0
</code> 

<p>Once that is completed, you can begin to add your code. First, take a look at your <code>appsettings.json</code> file. This is where you will add application-specific variables such as your Okta information or any connection strings. Replace the code in this file with the following. You will need to replace the <code>WideWorldImporters.ConnectionString</code> information with your connection string.</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "OktaDomain": "",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  },
  "WideWorldImporters": {
    "ConnectionString": "{yourConnectionString}"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add a file to hold the SQL Settings for <code>WideWorldImporters</code>. Add a new folder called <code>Settings</code>, and add a class file called <code>SqlSettings.cs</code> to it. Add the following code:</p>

   <code>public class SqlSettings
{
    public string ConnectionString { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>This very simple class will be populated at start-up and injected into your controllers as needed. You can see that process by opening your <code>Startup.cs</code> file and replacing the code with the following:</p>

   <code>public class Startup
{
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
        {
            options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
            options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        })
       .AddCookie()
       .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
       {
           OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:OktaDomain"),
           ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
           ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
           Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
       });

        services.Configure&lt;Settings.SqlSettings&gt;(Configuration.GetSection("WideWorldImporters"));

        services.AddControllersWithViews();
    }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
            // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
            app.UseHsts();
        }
        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        app.UseStaticFiles();

        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseAuthentication();
        app.UseAuthorization();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
        {
            endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "default",
                pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
        });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Most of this code is boilerplate, but there are a few things you should note. First, the <code>Configure</code> method doesn’t pre-populate with <code>app.UseAuthentication()</code>, so you will need to add it here.</p>

<p>Next, you set up your Okta middleware in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method. You also register your <code>WideWorldImporters</code> SQL configuration in this method.</p>

<p>To consume the <code>WideWorldImporters</code> in your controller, you will need to let .NET Core inject it, and then use it. You can see how this is done in the <code>DashboardController</code>. Add a file to your <code>Controllers</code> folder called <code>DashboardController.cs</code>, and replace the code with the following:</p>

   <code>public class DashboardController : Controller
{
    IOptions&lt;Settings.SqlSettings&gt; _sqlSettings;

    public DashboardController(IOptions&lt;Settings.SqlSettings&gt; sqlSettings)
    {
        _sqlSettings = sqlSettings;
    }

    [Authorize]
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View(getDashboardIndexModel());
    }

    protected Models.DashboardIndexViewModel getDashboardIndexModel()
    {
        DataTable dt = new DataTable();

        string cmdText = 
            @"WITH customer_items (CustomerID, StockItemId, Quantity, 
            LineProfit) AS (    SELECT 
                    CustomerID, 
                    StockItemId, 
                    SUM (Quantity) AS Quantity, 
                    SUM (LineProfit) AS LineProfit 
                 FROM 
                    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices] 
                    INNER JOIN [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] ON [Invoices].[InvoiceID] = [InvoiceLines].[InvoiceID] 
                GROUP BY 
                    CustomerID, 
                    StockItemID
            ) 
            SELECT 
                CustomerName, 
                customer_items.Quantity, 
                customer_items.LineProfit, 
                [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemName] 
            FROM 
                customer_items 
                INNER JOIN [Sales].[Customers] ON [Sales].[Customers].[CustomerId] = customer_items.CustomerID 
                INNER JOIN [Warehouse].[StockItems] ON customer_items.StockItemId = [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemID]";

        SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(cmdText, new SqlConnection(_sqlSettings.Value.ConnectionString));

        da.Fill(dt);

        return new Models.DashboardIndexViewModel(dt);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The application is injecting the <code>IOptions&lt;Settings.SqlSettings&gt;</code> object into this controller. You can reference it later to obtain the connection string for your database. Speaking of your database, this controller also contains the logic for building the model for your view. You will add the model momentarily, but for now, you notice that you are using <code>ADO.Net</code> to call the CTE you wrote earlier. This works just as well with Dapper or Entity Framework; ADO.Net was chosen here because it’s the simplest to set up.</p>

<p>Add a new class to the <code>Models</code> folder called DashboardIndexViewModel and add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>public class DashboardIndexViewModel
{
    public List&lt;DashboardLineItem&gt; Items { get; set; }

    public DashboardIndexViewModel(System.Data.DataTable items)
    {
        Items = new List&lt;DashboardLineItem&gt;();

        foreach (System.Data.DataRow row in items.Rows)
        {
            Items.Add(
                new DashboardLineItem(
                    row["CustomerName"].ToString(),
                    Convert.ToInt32(row["Quantity"]),
                    Convert.ToDecimal(row["LineProfit"]),
                    row["StockItemName"].ToString()
                    )
                );
        }
    }
}

public class DashboardLineItem
{
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public string StockItemName { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal LineProfit { get; set; }

    public DashboardLineItem(string customerName, int quantity, decimal lineProfit, string stockItemName)
    {
        CustomerName = customerName;
        Quantity = quantity;
        LineProfit = lineProfit;
        StockItemName = stockItemName;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This model is just taking the items from the query you ran earlier and injecting them into a nice view-model for your view.</p>

<p>Next, add a controller to your <code>Controllers</code> folder called <code>AccountController</code> if one does exist. Replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>public class AccountController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult SignIn()
    {
        if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
        }

        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Dashboard");
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult SignOut()
    {
        return new SignOutResult
        (
            new[]
            {
                    OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                    CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
            },
            new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/Home/" }
        );
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This code will set your application to use Okta authentication. In the <code>SignIn</code> method, you look to see if the user is already logged in. If they aren’t, you return a challenge which will redirect them to Okta for authentication. Once the user is logged in, they will be directed to the <code>Dashboard/Index</code> page. The signout method will redirect users back to the home page.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to add your views. First, open your <code>Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> file and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;@ViewData["Title"] - CTEsDemo&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" /&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" /&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;header&gt;
            &lt;nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-toggleable-sm navbar-light bg-white border-bottom box-shadow mb-3"&gt;
                &lt;div class="container"&gt;
                    &lt;a class="navbar-brand" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index"&gt;CTEsDemo&lt;/a&gt;
                    &lt;button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent"
                            aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"&gt;

 2020 has been a year like no other. Yet despite the many challenges we’ve faced — we’ve managed to scale our company, and launch a full suite of passwordless authentication products and services for the enterprise.  The year that pushed the world to passwordless <p>Like all businesses, new and old, we’ve had our company direction rerouted by the result of unprecedented travel restrictions, lockdowns, a global recession, and the tumultuous political and social movements that captured and held the attention of people all around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The events of this unforgettable year forced businesses to adapt to how they operate — and one positive outcome we noticed is that this has catapulted enterprises into an era of accelerated digital transformation. We’ve seen unprecedented recognition for the need to protect critical systems and data with zero-trust security solutions — and as a result we’re seeing an increasing appetite for passwordless authentication solutions like ours, that are powered by privacy-first technology.</p><p>In what was already a turning point year for passwordless authentication, the urgency for privacy-first, zero-trust solutions has been continually fueled by high profile hacks and breaches such as the Russian led Solar Winds Attack on the US government agencies, the Twitter hack that targeted the followers of high profile users and the ongoing Spotify hacks… to name just a&nbsp;few.</p><p>Read more on what our CTO and co-founder has to say on COVID-19 driving adoption of passwordless solutions…</p><p><a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/covid19-catalyst-biometrics/">Will COVID-19 be the Catalyst to Finally Replace Passwords With Biometrics?</a></p> How far we’ve come in just one&nbsp;year <p>At this time last year, we’d only just finished building out our platform’s core technology — <a href="https://keyless.io/technology">the Keyless Protocol</a>. The Keyless Protocol combines privacy-enhancing technologies with modern biometrics to enable real-time biometric authentication powered by the Keyless Network. The Keyless Network utilizes a distributed cloud architecture to process and store encrypted authentication data.</p> Breakthroughs in biometric authentication <p>We successfully applied for five patents to date for our novel technology — of these, one is a non-provisional patent, and four are provisional. Our breakthroughs in privacy-first, distributed biometric authentication are enabling a shift away from device-dependent authentication, towards a more unified and user-friendly authentication experience.</p><p>The breakthrough shift from device-dependent biometric authentication, to device in-dependent biometric authentication, means we can use a single, universal set of biometric templates to authenticate and identify users across multiple devices, in a way that enhances privacy compliance, rather than impeding&nbsp;it.</p><p>As a result we’re able to provide secure, private and user-friendly solutions that can help solve some of the larger issues around how we manage identities across the internet.</p> Ensuring Privacy and Security Compliance <p>Since biometric data is considered sensitive, personal information, the use of biometrics is regulated in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, and other similar regulations around the world such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>We’ve made significant headway validating our compliance stance with these regulations, as well as with directives such as the Revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2), which mandates what strong-customer authentication solutions should&nbsp;provide.</p><p>In total we’ve completed five compliance assessments this year, and have been actively engaging industry alliances, such as the FIDO Alliance, to educate certification bodies around the benefits of applying privacy-enhancing technologies and distributed cloud systems to biometric-enabled authentication.</p> Rapid growth, and US $6.2 million in&nbsp;backing <p>This year we not only scaled our team, going from 15 to 32 employees in under twelve months, which forced us to move into brand new offices in the centers of Rome and London. We also <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/preventing-data-breaches-keyless-secures-2-2m-round/">brought our funding to US $6.2 million</a> — a tremendous sign of confidence in uncertain times.</p> Putting Keyless on the passwordless radar <p>In just one year, we’ve managed to build, test and launch a total of five products that serve the full spectrum of enterprise use cases for workforce and consumer passwordless authentication.</p><p>Our workforce authentication products suite includes passwordless authentication solutions for single sign-on (SSO) with providers such as Okta and Microsoft, VPN, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and Windows Workstation Login — all powered by the Keyless Authenticator.</p><p>Check out our Workforce Authentication solutions here…</p><p><a href="https://keyless.io/products/enterprise">Keyless | Zero-Trust Passwordless Authentication</a></p><p>The Keyless Authenticator is an app that users or employees can download on any of their devices to enable seamless, privacy-enhancing access to all of these services.</p><p>For consumer authentication, we offer the Keyless SDK for both Android and iOS platforms. The Keyless SDK can be integrated into existing applications in a matter of hours. It offers fast, secure and frictionless, consumer multi-factor authentication (MFA) powered by the Keyless technology.</p><p>Check out our consumer authentication solutions here…</p><p><a href="https://keyless.io/products/consumer">Keyless | Zero-Trust Passwordless Authentication</a></p><p>On top of launching these products, we’ve partnered with the leading IAM and cloud providers so that customers can integrate and deploy our passwordless solutions quickly and&nbsp;easily.</p><p>We’ve so far partnered with Microsoft, Okta, and ForgeRock to help expand their identity management solutions with privacy-first passwordless authentication. We’ve also partnered with IBM and&nbsp;Cisco.</p> Partnering with Cisco to help universities adapt quickly to remote-learning <p>One of the achievements our team is most proud of is the first commercial deployment of our passwordless authentication technology in the education sector.</p><p>This year, <a href="https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/luiss-esami-distanza-l-ausilio-una-startup-innovativa-ADQDrvR">we partnered with Cisco</a> to help Luiss Guido Carli University, one of Rome’s leading higher education institutions, facilitate secure, remote authentication for students and staff during online classes and&nbsp;exams.</p><p>Unlike other passwordless solutions, Keyless offers Unique Student (or user) Identification. We can offer this feature because, with Keyless, users have one universal set of biometric templates that are used across all their devices and accounts. This means that it’s impossible for users to login to their accounts on another device using a different set of biometrics, essentially giving our clients much higher assurance that a user is who they claim to be&nbsp;online.</p><p>While Luiss University was a huge success for us, it wasn’t the only deployment we’ve been working on this&nbsp;year.</p> 10 customers, 5 sectors, 3 continents <p>Luiss University was our first live commercial deployment, however we currently have a number of customers in the Banking and Fintech and Aerospace and Defense industries who are all currently testing Keyless in pilot stage within their organizations.</p><p>Between these customers, we’re currently processing five thousand biometric authentication requests per day from approximately 15 thousand&nbsp;users.</p> $600k secured in awards and recognized by&nbsp;Gartner <p>Bans on international travel this year didn’t stop us from being invited to participate in a number of technology and cybersecurity competitions around the world. Some of these competitions have awarded us with cash-prizes, which are going directly into improving our product and services.

It’s particularly encouraging to be recognized by Gartner as one of the leading biometric solutions that’s helping companies tackle the evolving threat landscape head&nbsp;on.</p><p>This year, we’ve not only witnessed the fast-tracked adoption of cloud-first platforms, zero-trust technology and passwordless authentication, we’ve seen what impacts a lack of preparedness and unrealized digital strategy can have on organizations who are faced with unforeseen challenges. By merging modern biometrics with zero-trust, privacy-enhancing technologies, we’re able to provide a breakthrough scalable solution that can readily help companies on their journey towards a more secure and private&nbsp;future.</p><p>We’re humbled and excited by the industry recognition we’ve received for technology so far — and believe this proves that the demand for solutions that place equal importance on user privacy, security and usability is limitless.</p> What does the next year&nbsp;hold? <p>Out of darkness often comes light, and so we are hoping that as we head into a fresh year, that despite the urge to return to normal, that we are able to maintain the momentum gained during the last twelve&nbsp;months.</p><p>With the shift to remote and flexible work and the subsequent increased importance on being able to verify that someone is who they claim to be online, organizations around the globe are starting to recognise why we must act fast to converge authentication with identity proofing in the online realms. It’s not simply enough for a user to prove that they know or have something, they must also prove that they are who they claim to be — something that can only be achieved using advanced biometrics combined with machine learning.</p><p>We are confident that organizations sustain their interest in adopting solutions that leverage emerging technologies to enable more secure, reliable and privacy-focused authentication and identity management.</p><p>For us as a company, we plan to continue helping enterprises on their path towards a zero-trust, passwordless future by building out capabilities for our workforce and consumer authentication solutions, while accelerating our go-to-market efforts in&nbsp;Europe.</p> Some of our best content in&nbsp;2020  A beginner’s guide to Shamir’s Secret&nbsp;Sharing <p>Take a deep-dive into one of the core building blocks of Keyless.

  <p>Those of you reading this have certainly heard of Docker. After years of hype, it has become the somewhat standard technology for everyday DevOps operations. It greatly helped to simplify deployments and testing by creating efficient, immutable images of the applications which are working in their own silo. More efficient placement of applications has made this technology central for cloud applications which is why it has gotten so much attention in recent years.</p>

<p>Docker has enabled a new, unified way of application deployment. The basic idea is simple: instead of preparing a target environment on each machine, bring it as a part of your application in the form of a container. This means no conflicting library versions or overlapping network ports. Built images are immutable - your application works the same way locally, on your teammate’s computer, or in the cloud. Also, it’s possible to run multiple instances of the container on the same machine, and that helps to increase the density of deployment, bringing down costs.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will build and run a simple web application into the Docker-compatible image using <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/01/27/creating-docker-images-with-spring-boot-2-3-0-m1">Cloud Native Buildpacks support</a>, introduced in Spring Boot 2.3.0.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 Bootstrap a Secure Spring Boot Application 

<p>Start by creating a Spring Boot application using <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Boot Initializr</a>.
This can be done via the web interface or using a handy curl command:</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz -d dependencies=web,okta \
   -d bootVersion=2.4.1 \
   -d groupId=com.okta \
   -d artifactId=demospringboot \
   -d type=gradle-project \
   -d language=kotlin \
   -d baseDir=springboot-docker-demo | tar -xzvf -
</code>   

<p>This command requests that Spring Boot Initializr generate an application that uses the Gradle build system and Kotlin programming language. It also configures dependencies on Spring Web and Okta. The created project is automatically unpacked to the <code>springboot-docker-demo</code> directory.</p>

<p>Update your main application class to allow unauthenticated access in <code>WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</code>. While in there, add a controller that welcomes the user. It’s safe to put everything in a single file <code>src/main/kotlin/com/okta/demospringboot/DemoApplication.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demospringboot

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
import org.springframework.boot.runApplication
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController
import java.security.Principal

@SpringBootApplication
class DemoApplication

fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {
    runApplication&lt;DemoApplication&gt;(*args)
}

@Configuration
class OktaOAuth2WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter: WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter() {
    override fun configure(http: HttpSecurity) {
        http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().permitAll()
    }
}

@RestController
class WebController {
    @RequestMapping("/")
    fun home(user: Principal?) = "Welcome, ${user?.name ?: "guest"}!"
}
</code>   

 Run Your Spring Boot Application 

<p>Start your application in the project folder via the command line:</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootRun
</code>   

<p>Then, open a browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. Your web application greets the guest user:</p>

<p></p>

 Build a Spring Boot Docker Image 

<p>Since version 2.3.0, Spring Boot has supported <a href="https://buildpacks.io/">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a>. It has become straightforward to deploy a web service to the popular clouds using Buildpacks due to the mass adoption of this technology.</p>

<p>Build your application and send the image to the local Docker daemon:</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=springbootdemo
</code>   

<p>Next, start your containerized web application with Docker:</p>

   <code>docker run -it -p8080:8080 springbootdemo
</code>   

<p>As expected, your web application will be available on <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

 Secure Your Spring Boot Application in Docker 

<p>User management is never an easy task and, most certainly, is not the main objective of your application. Okta is an identity provider that helps you to take care of routine work such as implementing OAuth 2.0, social login, and SSO (Single Sign-On). It’s very developer-friendly, and it has excellent integration with different frameworks, including Spring Boot.</p>

<p>Start with <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">installing the Okta CLI tool</a> - it’s a real time saver for developers.</p>

 
   
    <p>Create your free developer <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">account with Okta</a>, no credit card required:</p>

       <code> okta register

 ...(provide registration details)...
 ...
 To set your password open this link:
 https://dev-xxxxxxxxxxxx.okta.com/welcome/ABCDEFG
</code>       

    <p>Don’t forget to set your password using the link above!</p>
   
   
    <p>Create an Okta application. In your project directory, execute:</p>

       <code>okta apps create --redirect-uri http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta
</code>       

    <p>The Okta CLI will prompt you for an application name—choosing the default is OK. Next, select 1 (Web), then 1 (Okta Spring Boot Starter). Accept defaults, the Okta CLI will configure the default login redirect URI (<code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code>) and logout redirect URI (<code>http://localhost:8080</code>). Don’t worry, you can change these values later if something needs to be adjusted.</p>
   
   
    <p>When an application successfully created, its configuration is saved in the current folder, in a <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>

       <code>cat .okta.env
export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-xxxxxx.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="yyy"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="zzz"
</code>       
    <p>You’ll need to run <code>source .okta.env</code> to set these values as environment variables. If you’re on Windows, rename the file to <code>.okta.bat</code> and change <code>export</code> to <code>set</code>.  These parameters need to be injected into the application to enable OAuth flows for authentication and authorization.</p>

    <p>⚠️ NOTE: make sure you never check in credentials to your source control system.</p>
   
 

 Configure Spring Security to Lock Down Access 

<p>Previously, your webpage was accessible for everyone. To allow access for authorized users only, update the Spring Security configuration in <code>src/main/kotlin/com/okta/demospringboot/DemoApplication.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>@Configuration
class OktaOAuth2WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter: WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter() {
    override fun configure(http: HttpSecurity) {
        http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>That’s it. The Okta Spring Boot Starter takes care of the rest!</p>

<p>Rebuild the application again:</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=springbootdemo
</code>   

<p>The <code>--imageName</code> parameter allows specifying an image name. Without it, the name would be something like <code>appName:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</code>.</p>

 Start Spring Boot Application in Docker 

<p>When your application starts, the Okta module reads environment variables to configure security in your application. Start your application with your values set:</p>

   <code>docker run -it -p8080:8080 \
    -e OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-xxxxxx.okta.com/oauth2/default" \
    -e OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy" \
    -e OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz" \
    springbootdemo
</code>   

<p>The argument <code>-e</code> allows to set an environment variable for the application running inside your container and <code>-p</code> maps container’s point to the <code>localhost</code>.</p>

<p>Now, head over to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and you’ll be asked to log in using Okta’s standard form. Enter your login credentials and, upon successful sign-in, your web browser will be redirected to the main page, displaying a welcoming message.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Congratulations, you have created a simple Spring Boot application contextualized with Docker and secured with Spring Security + Okta.</p>

 Bonus - Use a dotenv File 

<p>While providing a few environment variables in the command-line might be acceptable, it’s not very convenient and can leave unwanted traces of the secrets in your terminal history. Docker supports dotenv file format, which makes it easier to set multiple environment parameters.</p>

 
   Create a <code>.env</code> file in the root of the project and set desirable environment variables:
       <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
</code>       
   
   Always be extra careful with credentials - avoid leaking them to the version control system even for the pet project. Add <code>.env</code> to <code>.gitignore</code>.
       <code>echo ".env" &gt;&gt; .gitignore
</code>       
   
   Run Docker providing your <code>.env</code> file via <code>--env-file</code> argument
       <code>docker run -it -p8080:8080 --env-file .env springbootdemo
</code>       
    <p>Looks much cleaner, doesn’t it?</p>
   
 

 Deploy Spring Boot + Docker to Heroku 

<p>If you’d like to deploy your dockerized Spring Boot app to Heroku, you’ll need to use <a href="https://jkutner.github.io/2020/05/19/spring-boot-buildpacks.html">Heroku Buildpacks</a>. This is because the Paketo buildpacks refuse to allocate heap on containers smaller than 1GB of RAM. A free Heroku dyno has 512MB.</p>

<p>First, you’ll need to add the following to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> so Spring Boot uses Heroku’s <code>PORT</code> environment variable.</p>

   <code>server.port=${PORT:8080}
</code>   

<p>Then, build your image with <code>--builder heroku/spring-boot-buildpacks</code>:</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=springbootdemo --builder heroku/spring-boot-buildpacks
</code>   

<p>Create an app on Heroku:</p>

   <code>heroku create
</code>   

<p>Log in to Heroku’s container registry and push your app:</p>

   <code>heroku container:login
docker tag springbootdemo registry.heroku.com/&lt;your-app-name&gt;/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/&lt;your-app-name&gt;/web
</code>   

<p>Set your Okta app settings as environment variables:</p>

   <code>heroku config:set \
  OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="/oauth2/default" \
  OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}" \
  OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>Next, release your container and tail the logs.</p>

   <code>heroku container:release web
heroku logs --tail
</code>   

<p>You’ll need to update your Okta OIDC app to have your Heroku app’s redirect URIs as well.</p>

 
   Login redirect URI: <code>https://&lt;your-app-name&gt;.herokuapp.com/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> 
   Logout redirect URI: <code>https://&lt;your-app-name&gt;.herokuapp.com</code> 
 

<p>Run <code>heroku open</code> to open your app and sign in.</p>

 Learn More About Docker, Spring Boot, and Buildpacks 

<p>In this brief tutorial, you created a secure Spring Boot application and packaged it with Docker. You configured Okta as an OAuth 2.0 provider, built an image into your local Docker daemon, and learned how to run your app in Docker. This bootstrap project is a great starting point for your next cloud-native project.</p>

<p>Trust frameworks are a foundational component of the web of trust. A trust framework is a common set of best practice standards-based rules that ensure minimum requirements are met for security, privacy, identification management and interoperability through accreditation and governance. These operating rules provide a common framework for ecosystem participants, increasing trust between&nbsp;them.</p><p>As digital service delivery models mature, it is essential that information is protected as it travels across jurisdictional and organizational boundaries. Trust frameworks define and bring together the otherwise disparate set of best practice principles, processes, standards that apply when it comes to collecting and sharing information on the web. As individuals and entities increasingly share their information cross contextually, across industry boundaries, trust frameworks provide the common set of rules that apply regardless of such differences. For example, service providers ranging from government agencies, banks and telecommunication companies, to health care providers could all follow the same set of data sharing practices under one trust framework. This macro application serves to reduce the need for bilateral agreements and fragmentation across industry. Ultimately trust frameworks serve to increase trust, improve efficiencies, and deliver significant economic and social benefits.</p><p>Some use-cases will require more detailed rules to be established than those set out in a trust framework with broad scope. Where this is the case, more detailed rules around specific hierarchies and roles can be established within the context of the higher order trust framework. The goal is always for the components of the framework to be transparent, and adherence to those components to be public. This enables entities to rely on the business or technical process carried out by others with trust and confidence. If done correctly, a trust framework is invisible to those who rely on it every day. It allows individuals and entities to conduct digital transactions knowing that the trust frameworks underpin, create accountability, and support the decisions they’re&nbsp;making.</p> Use Cases for Trust Frameworks <p>Historically speaking, trust frameworks have been extraordinarily complex and only worth the investment for high-value, high-volume transactions, such as the ones established by credit card companies. Now, with the introduction of decentralized technologies, there is a need to create digital trust frameworks that work for a much broader variety of transactions. Realizing the scope of this work comes with the recognition that there will be many different trust frameworks, both small and large in scope, for different federations across the web. Given that context, it is important to preserve end-user agency as much as possible as trust frameworks are developed and adoption and mutual recognition increases.</p><p>Looking at the ecosystem today, we can broadly group trust frameworks into three categories:</p> Domain-specific Trust Frameworks   These are typically developed to serve a specific use-case, for example within a particular industry  Often driven by industry and/or&nbsp;NGOs  These have been able to develop faster than national trust frameworks (which are based in legislation), and as such may inform the development of national trust frameworks   National Trust Frameworks   Typically broad in application and to facilitate a policy objective (for example, increased trust in data&nbsp;sharing)  Driven by individual governments to address the needs of their citizens and residents  Based in legislation, with more enforcement powers than either Domain-specific Trust Frameworks or International Trust Frameworks  Likely to be informed by both Domain-specific Trust Frameworks and International Trust Frameworks   International Trust Frameworks   These are typically broad in nature and developed to serve many countries, much like a model&nbsp;law  Typically driven by governments, industry, or NGOs but geographically agnostic  Likely to inform National Trust Frameworks   Accreditation and Assurance <p>An important part of satisfying the operational components of a trust framework is the ability to accredit ecosystem participants against the trust framework. This is a logical extension of the rules, requirements, and regulations trust frameworks set out. Trust frameworks typically include an accreditation scheme and associated ongoing compliance testing.</p><p>One aspect of accreditation in the identity context is compliance with standards. In the context of identity related trust frameworks, there are several kinds of assurance that relying parties will typically seek. These can include binding, information, authentication, and federation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_assurance">identity assurance</a>. Each standard may define their own distinct levels of assurance. The <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST Digital Identity Requirements</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identification-management/identification-management-standards/overview-of-the-identification-management-standards/">New Zealand Identification Management Standards</a> are a good example of how this works in practice.</p><p>The process of accreditation and a successful certification is a core part of trust frameworks as it proves to the wider ecosystem (including auditors) that the entity, solution, or piece of software meets the business and technical requirements defined. Digital identity systems are increasingly modular, and one solution might involve a variety of different components, roles and providers. These should be developed and defined as part of the process of standing up a trust framework, testing its capabilities and defining processes around accreditation.</p> Technical Interoperability <p>Trust frameworks help to improve interoperability between entities by defining a common set of operating rules. In addition to setting out business and legal rules, it is important that high level technical rules are specified as well. Trust frameworks must clearly define expectations around the technical standards to be used, as well as what aspects of these standards are normatively required, optional, or somewhere in between. When it comes to digital identity trust frameworks, this may mean building on open-source code or evaluating against open test&nbsp;suites.</p><p>Test suites allow for normative testing around standards requirements and offer a way for parties to audit and ensure the processes being used throughout the identity lifecycle. They can be incredibly useful not only for entities using the trust framework, but for mutually recognized trust frameworks to understand and interpret the requirements coming from a particular set of&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Ongoing development of several digital identity trust frameworks based on the emerging decentralized web of trust can be found at industry organizations such as the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> as well as government-driven initiatives such as the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-trust-frameworks-ad96a4427991">Learn Concepts: Trust Frameworks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An important principle that we want to achieve when designing any system that involves handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a> is to minimize the data disclosed in a given interaction. When users share information, they should be able to choose what and how much they share on a case-by-case basis, while the relying parties receiving the information must be able to maintain assurances about the presented information’s origin and integrity. This process is often referred to as selective disclosure of data. As technologists, by having solutions that easily achieve selective disclosure, we can drive a culture based on the minimum information exchange required to enhance user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Privacy and Correlation <p>Selective disclosure of information is particularly relevant when evaluating approaches to using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials (VCs)</a>. Because authorities are able to issue credentials to a subject’s digital wallet, the subject is able to manage which data they disclose to relying parties as well as how that disclosure is performed. This presents an opportunity for those designing digital wallets to consider the user experience of data disclosure, particularly as it relates to the underlying technology and cryptography being used for data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>The problem of user privacy as it relates to digital identity is a deep and complicated one, however the basic approach has been to allow users to share only the information which is strictly necessary in a particular context. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model spec</a> provides some guidance on how to do so, but stops short of offering a solution to the issue of managing user privacy and preventing correlation of their activities across different interactions:</p><blockquote>Organizations providing software to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> should strive to identify fields in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> containing information that could be used to correlate individuals and warn <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> when this information is&nbsp;shared.</blockquote><p>A number of different solutions have been deployed to address the underlying concerns around selective disclosure. Each solution makes a different set of assumptions and offers different tradeoffs when it comes to usability and convenience.</p> Approaches to Selective Disclosure <p>When it comes to solutions for selective disclosure of verifiable credentials, there are many different ways to tackle this problem, but three of the most common&nbsp;are:</p>  Just in time issuance — contact the issuer at request time either directly or indirectly for a tailored assertion  Trusted witness — use a trusted witness between the provider and the relying party to mediate the information disclosure  Cryptographic solutions — use a cryptographic technique to disclose a subset of information from a larger assertion   Just in time&nbsp;issuance <p>Just in time issuance, a model made popular by <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, assumes the issuer is highly available, which imposes an infrastructure burden on the issuer that is proportional to the number of subjects they have information for and where those subjects use their information. Furthermore, in most instances of this model, the issuer learns where a subject is using their identity information, which can be a serious privacy&nbsp;problem.</p> Trusted witness <p>Trusted witness shifts this problem to be more of a presentation concern, where a witness de-anonymizes the subject presenting the information and presents an assertion with only the information required by the relying party. Again, this model requires a highly available party other than the holder and relying party present when a subject wants to present information, one that must be highly trusted and one that bears witness to a lot of PII on the subject, leading to privacy concerns.</p> Cryptographic solutions <p>Cryptographic solutions offer an alternative to these approaches by solving the selective disclosure problem directly at the core data model layer of the VC, providing a simpler and more flexible method of preserving user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There are a variety of ways that cryptography can be used to achieve selective disclosure or data minimization, but perhaps the most popular approach is using a branch of cryptography often known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a>, or ZKPs. The emergent feature of this technology is that a prover can prove knowledge of some data without exposing any additional data. Zero-knowledge proofs can be achieved in a flexible manner with verifiable credentials using multi-message digital signatures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>.</p> Traditional Digital Signatures <p>Traditional digital signatures look a bit like this. You have a message (virtually any kind of data for which you want to establish integrity) and a keypair (private and public key) which you use to produce a digital signature on the data. By having the message, public key, and the signature; verifiers are able to evaluate whether the signature is valid or not, thereby establishing the integrity of the message and the authenticity of the entity that signed the message. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity doing the signing is the issuer of the credential, while the entity doing the verification is the verifier. The keypair in question belongs to the issuer of the credential, which allows verifiers to establish the authority on that credential in a verifiable manner.</p> Sign  Verify  Multi-message Digital Signatures <p>Multi-message digital signature schemes (like <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>), on the other hand, are able to sign an array of messages, rather than a single message over which the entire digital signature is applied. The same mechanism is used wherein a private key produces a digital signature over the messages you wish to sign, but now you have the flexibility of being able to break a message up into its fundamental attributes. In the context of verifiable credentials, each message corresponds to a claim in the credential. This presents an opportunity for selective disclosure due to the ability to derive and verify a proof of the digital signature over a subset of messages or credential attributes.</p> Sign  Verify <p>In addition to the simple ability to sign and verify a set of messages, multi-message digital signatures have the added capability of being able to derive a proof of the digital signature. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity deriving the proof is the credential subject or holder. This process allows you to select which messages you wish to disclose in the proof and which messages you want to keep hidden. The derived proof indicates to the verifier that you know all of the messages that have been signed, but that you are only electing to disclose a subset of these messages.</p> Derive Proof  Verify Proof <p>The verifier, or the entity with which you’re sharing the data, is only able to see the messages or credential claims which you have selectively disclosed to them. They are still able to verify the integrity of the messages being signed, as well as establish the authenticity of the issuer that originally signed the messages. This provides a number of privacy guarantees to the data subject because relying parties are only evaluating the proof of the signature rather than the signature itself.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-selective-disclosure-4b9bf4e5c887">Learn Concepts: Selective Disclosure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With so much data being created and shared on the internet, one of the oldest challenges in building digital infrastructure has been how to consistently establish meaning and context to this data. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic web</a> is a set of technologies whose goal is to make all data on the web machine-readable. Its usage allows for a shared understanding around data that enables a variety of real-world applications and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The challenges to address with the semantic web&nbsp;include:</p>  vastness — the internet contains billions of pages, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms  vagueness — imprecise concepts like ‘young’ or ‘tall’ make it challenging to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts  uncertainty — precise concepts with uncertain values can be hard to reason about, this mirrors the ambiguity and probabilistic nature of everyday&nbsp;life  inconsistency — logical contradictions create situations where reasoning breaks&nbsp;down  deceit — intentionally misleading information spread by bad actors, can be mitigated with cryptography to establish information integrity   Linked Data <p>Linked data is the theory behind much of the semantic web effort. It describes a general mechanism for publishing structured data on the internet using vocabularies like <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> that can be connected together and interpreted by machines. Using linked data, statements encoded in triples (subject → predicate → object) can be spread across different websites in a standard way. These statements form the substrate of knowledge that spans across the entire internet. The reality is that the bulk of useful information on the internet today is unstructured data, or data that is not organized in a way which makes it useful to anyone beyond the creators of that data. This is fine for the cases where data remains in a single context throughout its lifecycle, but it becomes problematic when trying to share data across contexts while retaining its semantic meaning. The vision for linked data is for the internet to become a kind of global database where all data can be represented and understood in a similar&nbsp;way.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges to realizing the vision of the internet as a global database is enabling a common set of underlying semantics that can be consumed by all this data. A proliferation of data becomes much less useful if the data is redundant, unorganized, or otherwise messy and complicated. Ultimately, we need to double down on the usage of common data vocabularies and common data schemas. Common data schemas combined with the security features of verifiable data will make fraud more difficult, making it easier to transmit and consume data so that trust-based decisions can be made. Moreover, the proliferation of common data vocabularies will help make data portability a reality, allowing data to be moved across contexts while retaining the semantics of its original&nbsp;context.</p> Semantic Web Technologies <p>The work around developing semantic web technology has been happening for a very long time. The vision for the semantic web has been remarkably consistent throughout its evolution, although the specifics around how to accomplish this and at what layer has developed over the years. <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">W3C’s semantic web stack</a> offers an overview of these foundational technologies and the function of each component in the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>The ultimate goal of the semantic web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The shared architecture as defined by the W3C supports the ability for the internet to become a global database based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">linked data</a>. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are empowered by technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">OWL</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>.</p>  RDF provides the foundation for publishing and linking your data. It’s a standard data model for representing information resources on the internet and describing the relationships between data and other pieces of information in a graph&nbsp;format.  OWL is a language which is used to build data vocabularies, or “ontologies”, that represent rich knowledge or&nbsp;logic.  SKOS is a standard way to represent knowledge organization systems such as classification systems in&nbsp;RDF.  SPARQL is the query language for the Semantic Web; it is able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in an RDF graph. Query languages go hand-in-hand with databases. If the Semantic Web is viewed as a global database, then it is easy to understand why one would need a query language for that&nbsp;data.  <p>By enriching data with additional context and meaning, more people (and machines) can understand and use that data to greater&nbsp;effect.</p> JSON-LD <p><a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> is a serialization format that extends JSON to support linked data, enabling the sharing and discovery of data in web-based environments. Its purpose is to be isomorphic to RDF, which has broad usability across the web and supports additional technologies for querying and language classification. RDF has been used to manage industry ontologies for the last couple decades, so creating a representation in JSON is incredibly useful in certain applications such as those found in the context of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a> representation of Verifiable Credentials makes use of a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. The primary benefit of the JSON-LD format used by LD-Proofs is that it builds on a common set of semantics that allow for broader ecosystem interoperability of issued credentials. It provides a standard vocabulary that makes data in a credential more portable as well as easy to consume and understand across different contexts. In order to create a crawl-able web of verifiable data, it’s important that we prioritize strong reuse of data schemas as a key driver of interoperability efforts. Without it, we risk building a system where many different data schemas are used to represent the same exact information, creating the kinds of data silos that we see on the majority of the internet today. JSON-LD makes semantics a first-class principle and is therefore a solid basis for constructing VC implementations.</p><p>JSON-LD is also widely adopted on the web today, with W3C reporting it is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld">30% of the web</a> and Google making it the de facto technology for search engine optimization. When it comes to Verifiable Credentials, it’s advantageous to extend and integrate the work around VCs with the existing burgeoning ecosystem of linked&nbsp;data.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-semantic-web-250784d6a49f">Learn Concepts: Semantic Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The ability to prove the integrity and authenticity of shared data is a key component to establishing trust online. Given that <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">we produce so much data</a> and are constantly sharing and moving that data around, it is a complex task to identify a solution that will work for the vast majority of internet users across a variety of different contexts.</p><p>The fundamental problem to address is how to establish authority on a piece of data, and how to enable mechanisms to trust those authorities in a broad set of contexts. Solving this problem on a basic level allows entities to have greater trust in the data they’re sharing, and for relying parties to understand the integrity and authenticity of the data being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>We use the overarching term verifiable data to refer to this problem domain. Verifiable data can be further expanded into three key&nbsp;pillars:</p>  Verifiable data  Verifiable relationships  Verifiable processes   Verifiable data <p>This refers to the authenticity and integrity of the actual data elements being&nbsp;shared.</p> Verifiable relationships <p>This refers to the ability to audit and understand the connections between various entities as well as how each of these entities are represented in&nbsp;data.</p> Verifiable processes <p>This describe the ability to verify any digital process such as onboarding a user or managing a bank account (particularly with respect to how data enables the process to be managed and maintained).</p><p>These closely-related, interdependent concepts rely on verifiable data technology becoming a&nbsp;reality.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p>The basic data model of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> may be familiar to developers and architects that are used to working with <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01276046/document">attribute-based credentials</a> and data technologies. The issuer, or the authority on some information about a subject (e.g. a person), issues a credential containing this information in the form of claims to a holder. The holder is responsible for storing and managing that credential, and in most instances uses a piece of software that acts on their behalf, such as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">digital wallet</a>. When a verifier (sometimes referred to as a relying party) needs to validate some information, they can request from the holder some data to meet their verification requirements. The holder unilaterally determines if they wish to act upon the request and is free to present the claims contained in their verifiable credentials using any number of techniques to preserve their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials form the foundation for verifiable data in the emerging web of trust. They can be thought of as a container for many different types of information as well as different types of credentials. Because it is an open standard at the W3C, verifiable credentials are able to widely implemented by many different software providers, institutions, governments, and businesses. Due to the wide applicability of these standards, similar content integrity protections and guarantees are provided regardless of the implementation.</p> Semantics and&nbsp;Schemas <p>The authenticity and integrity-providing mechanisms presented by Verifiable Credentials provide additional benefits beyond the evaluation of verifiable data. They also provide a number of extensibility mechanisms that allow data to be linked to other kinds of data in order to be more easily understood in the context of relationships and processes.</p><p>One concrete example of this is the application of data schemas or data vocabularies. Schemas are a set of types and properties that are used to describe data. In the context of data sharing, schemas are an incredibly useful and necessary tool in order to represent data accurately from the point of creation to sharing and verification. In essence, data schemas in the Verifiable Credential ecosystem are only useful if they are strongly reused by many different parties. If each implementer of Verifiable Credentials chooses to describe and represent data in a slightly different way, it creates incoherence and inconsistency in data and threatens to diminish the potential of ubiquitous adoption of open standards and&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials make use of <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> to extend the data model to support dynamic data vocabularies and schemas. This allows us to not only use existing JSON-LD schemas, but to utilize the mechanism defined by JSON-LD to create and share new schemas as well. To a large extent this is what JSON-LD was designed for; the adoption and reuse of common data vocabularies.</p><p>This type of Verifiable Credential is best characterized as a kind of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proof</a>. It allows issuers to make statements that can be shared without loss of trust because their authorship can be verified by a third party. Linked Data Proofs define the capability for verifying the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data documents with mathematical proofs and asymmetric cryptography. It provides a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. Due to the nature of linked data, they are built to compactly represent proof chains and allow a Verifiable Credential to be easily protected on a more granular basis; on a per-attribute basis rather than a per-credential basis.</p><p>This mechanism becomes particularly useful when evaluating a chain of trusted credentials belonging to organizations and individuals. A proof chain is used when the same data needs to be signed by multiple entities and the order in which the proofs were generated matters. For example, such as in the case of a notary counter-signing a proof that had been created on a document. Where order needs to be preserved, a proof chain is represented by including an ordered list of proofs with a “proof chain” key in a Verifiable Credential. This kind of embedded proof can be used to establish the integrity of verifiable data&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Overall, the ability for data to be shared across contexts whilst retaining its integrity and semantics is a critical building block of the emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of&nbsp;trust</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-verifiable-data-4515a62c8e40">Learn Concepts: Verifiable Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In order to coordinate the authentication needs of apps and services on the web, many of today’s users will leverage services such as password managers. These tools help users keep track of how they’ve identified themselves in different contexts and simplify the login process for different services. In many ways, the need to overlay such services in order to preserve non-negotiable security properties reflects the broken state of identity on the internet today. Users of these apps (i.e. the data subjects) are often an afterthought when a trust relationship is established between data authorities and apps or services consuming and relying on user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Asymmetry in the nature of the relationships between participants largely prevents users from asserting their data rights as subjects of the data. Users are left to deal with the problems inherent in such a model, foisting upon them the responsibility of implementing appropriate solutions to patch over the shortcomings of identity management under this legacy&nbsp;model.</p><p>The emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of trust</a> based upon self-certifying identifiers and user-centric cryptography is shifting this fundamental relationship by refashioning the role of the user. This role (known in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC data model</a> as a “holder”) is made central to the ecosystem and, importantly, on equal footing with the issuers of identity-related information and the relying parties who require that data to support their applications and services.</p><p>The reframing of the user as a first-class citizen and their empowerment as ‘holder’ represents a shift towards a new paradigm. Such a paradigm offers users greater sovereignty of their own information and empowerment to manage their digital identity. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as digital&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Digital wallets are applications that allow an end user to manage their digital credentials and associated cryptographic keys. They allow users to prove identity-related information about themselves and, where it’s supported, choose to selectively disclose particular attributes of their credentials in a privacy-preserving manner.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Agents <p>When working with technology standards that are inherently decentralized, it’s important to establish a common context and consensus in our choice of terminology and language. Convergence on key terms that are being used to describe concepts within the emerging decentralized identity and self-sovereign identity technologies allows participants to reach a shared understanding. Consequently, participating vendors are able to understand how they fit into the puzzle and interoperability between vendor implementations is made possible.</p><p>Through dedicated research and careful coordination with the broader technical community, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Project</a> at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> offers a useful definition for both wallets and&nbsp;agents.</p><blockquote>Wallets<br>Provide storage of keys, credentials, and secrets, often facilitated or controlled by an&nbsp;agent.</blockquote><blockquote>Agents<br>An agent is a software representative of a subject (most often a person) that controls access to a wallet and other storage, can live in different locations on a network (cloud vs. local), and can facilitate or perform messaging or interactions with other subjects.</blockquote><p>The two concepts are closely related, and are often used interchangeably. In short, the Glossary Project found that an agent is most commonly a piece of software that lets you work with and connect to wallets. Wallets can be simple, while agents tend to be more complex. Agents often need access to a wallet in order to retrieve credentials, keys, and/or messages that are stored&nbsp;there.</p><p>At MATTR, we tend to use the terms ‘digital wallet’ or simply ‘wallet’ to holistically describe the software that is utilized by end-users from within their mobile devices, web browsers, or other such user-controlled devices or environments. A digital wallet can be thought of as a kind of agent, though we try to make the distinction between the software that sits on a user’s device and the data managed and logic facilitated by a cloud-based platform in support of the wallet’s capabilities. We like the term ‘wallet’ because it is analogous to real-world concepts that by and large parallel the primary function of a wallet; to store and retrieve identity-related information.</p> User-centric Design <p>As end users have often found themselves the casualty of the information systems used by the modern web, there has been little opportunity to allow users to directly manage their data and negotiate what data they wish to withhold or disclose to certain parties. Under the new web of trust paradigm, the rights of the data subject are codified in standards, processes, and protocols guaranteeing the user the power to exercise agency. The interjection of the wallet to support end-users as data subjects on equal footing with issuers of identity information and relying parties provides an indispensable conduit and control point for this information that enables new opportunities for user-centric design.</p><p>The innovation in this area is only just beginning and there is no limit to the kinds of new experiences application developers can design and deliver to users. Some examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Allowing users to synchronize their data across multiple applications  Allowing users to self-attest to a piece of data or attest to data self-asserted by&nbsp;peers  Allowing a user to explicitly give consent around how their data may be&nbsp;used  Allowing users to revoke their consent for access to the continued use of and/or persistence of a particular piece of&nbsp;data  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to other verified users, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to certain service providers and relying parties, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  <p>These are just a handful of the potential ways that developers can innovate to implement user-centric experiences. MATTR offers the tools necessary to create new kinds of wallet and authentication experiences for users and we’re excited to see what developers come up with when given the opportunity to create applications and services inspired by these new standards and technologies.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">Learn Concepts: Digital Wallets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The original vision for the World Wide Web was an open platform on which everyone could freely communicate and access information. It was built on the decentralized architecture of the internet, used open standards, and functioned as an accessible platform that would inherit and amplify the fundamentally decentralized nature of the network that underpinned it.</p><p>However, the reality today has fallen far short of its founding vision. The modern internet is largely centralized and siloed. The vast majority of web traffic belongs to a few powerful corporations that control the distribution of data through platforms designed to selectively serve up information based on in-depth analysis of their users’ data. The lack of an identity system native to the internet over time has created an imbalance of power that erodes users’ digital&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Several decades after the web was introduced, most of us are now accustomed to widespread spam, fraud, abuse, and misinformation. We don’t have any real agency over how our data is used, and the corporations controlling our data have shown their inability to properly shoulder the responsibility that comes with it. We’re locked into this system, with no reasonable ability to opt&nbsp;out.</p><p>As a result, the modern internet has made it incredibly difficult to establish trust with others online, creating many barriers to participation that often leave everyday users out of the value chain. Information and data, and the value they create, are no longer freely accessible by the users creating it — most of whom are utterly unaware of the limited agency they have in accessing it. To fix this fundamental problem of digital trust, we need to begin by building a system that allows users to control their identities and to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p> Evolution of Digital&nbsp;Trust <p>The emerging “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web of Trust</a>” is an idea that has been around since the dawn of the internet. To explain what motivated its creation, let’s take a look at how trust on the internet functions today.</p><p>Though we may not always be aware, we rely on a basic form of security practically every day we use the internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>, the secure browsing protocol for the World Wide Web, uses a common infrastructure based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a> to allow users to authenticate and access websites, and protect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy">privacy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity">integrity</a> of the data exchanged while in transit. It is used to establish trust on all types of websites, to secure accounts, and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing&nbsp;private.</p>Centralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This is all based on the usage of cryptographic keys, instead of passwords, to perform security and encryption. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography">Public key cryptography</a> is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication">securely communicate</a> on an insecure public network (the internet), and reliably verify the identity of users via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a>. It is required for activities where simple passwords are an inadequate authentication method and more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication and to validate the information being transferred.</p><p>The type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a> currently used by the internet primarily relies on a hierarchical system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authorities (CAs)</a>, which are effectively third-parties that have been designated to manage identifiers and public keys. Virtually all internet software now relies on these authorities. Certificate authorities are responsible for verifying the authenticity and integrity of public keys that belong to a given user, all the way up to a ‘self-signed’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate">root certificate</a>. Root certifications are typically distributed with applications such as browsers and email clients. Applications commonly include over one hundred root certificates from dozens of PKIs, thereby bestowing trust throughout the hierarchy of certificates which lead back to them. The concept is that if you can trust the chain of keys, you can effectively establish secure communication with another entity with a reasonable level of assurance that you’re talking to the right&nbsp;person.</p><p>However, the reliance on certificate authorities creates a centralized dependency for practically all transactions on the internet that require trust. This primarily has to do with the fact that current PKI systems tightly control who gets to manage and control the cryptographic keys associated with certificates. This constraint means that modern cryptography is largely unusable for the average user, forcing us to borrow or ‘rent’ identifiers such as our email addresses, usernames, and website domains through systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>, and social networks. And because we need these identities to communicate and transact online, we’re effectively beholden to these systems which are outside of our control. In addition, the usability challenges associated with current PKI systems mean that much of Web traffic today is unsigned and unencrypted, such as on major social networks. In other words, cryptographic trust is the backbone of all internet communications, but that trust rarely trickles down to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>A fully realized web of trust instead relies on self-signed certificates and third party attestations, forming the basis for what’s known as a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/draft-documents/Decentralized-Public-Key-Infrastructure-CURRENT.md">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)</a>. DPKI returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to, bringing the power of cryptography to everyday users (we call this user-centric cryptography) by delegating the responsibility of public key management to secure decentralized datastores, so anyone and anything can start building trust on the&nbsp;web.</p> A Trust Layer for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The foundational technology for a new DPKI is a system of distributed identifiers for people, organizations, and things. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifiers</a> are self-certifying identifiers that allow for distributed discovery of public keys. DIDs can be stored on a variety of different data registries, such as blockchains and public databases, and users can always be sure that they’re talking to the right person or entity because an identifier’s lookup value is linked to the most current public keys for that identifier. This creates a kind of even playing field where the standards and requirements for key management are uniform across different users in an ecosystem, from everyday users to large corporations and everything in&nbsp;between.</p>Decentralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This will, in the first place, give users far greater control over the manner in which their personal data is being used by businesses, allowing them to tweak their own experience with services to arrive at that specific trade-off between convenience and data protection that best suits their individual requirements. But more importantly, it will allow users to continue to federate data storage across multiple services while still delivering the benefits that come from cross-platform data exchange. In other words, it gives them the ability to manage all their data in the same way while being able to deal with data differently depending on the context they are in. This also allows them to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without losing access to the services they need, and without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p><p>Eventually, this will allow for portability not only of data but of the trust and reputation associated with the subjects of that data. For instance, a user might be able to transfer their reputation score from one ride-sharing service to another, or perhaps use the trust they’ve established in one context in another context entirely.</p><p>This emerging decentralized web of trust is being forged by a global community of developers, architects, engineers, organizations, hackers, lawyers, activists, and more working to push forward and develop web standards for things like credential exchange, secure messaging, secure storage, and trust frameworks to support this new paradigm. The work is happening in places like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project</a>, and <a href="https://ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>, to name a&nbsp;few.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">Learn Concepts: Web of Trust 101</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 <p>At the core of every <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a> use case is what we call the verifiable credentials model. This simple yet effective model helps conceptualize how <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> are exchanged between people and organizations. In the SSI community, you will often hear the verifiable credentials model referred to as the “Trust Triangle”.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					Often called the "Trust Triangle," this classic diagram helps conceptualize the verifiable credential model.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Roles in SSI 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In the verifiable credentials model, there are three roles: issuer, holder, and verifier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Issuer: The issuer is the person or organization that creates the verifiable credential and gives it (i.e., issues it) to another person, organization, or thing. An example of an issuer would be a DMV which issues driver’s licenses.  Holder: The holder is the person or organization to whom the verifiable credential was issued to. The holder keeps the verifiable credential in their <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-digital-wallets/">digital wallet</a>. An example of a holder would be the citizen that received his or her driver’s license from the DMV.  Verifier: The verifier is the person or organization that gets information shared with them. They can authenticate the information they receive instantaneously. An example of a verifier would be the security agent at the airport that asks to see a person’s driver’s license to verify their identity.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					In this example, the DMV issues the holder a driver's license as a verifiable credential which the holder then presents to the security agent at the airport (the verifier). The security agent does not need to contact the DMV to verify if the driver's license is a valid credential.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The power of verifiable credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Verifiable credentials are unique from other digital documents in that they allow the verifier to know the following four things without having to interact with the issuer at all:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  The original issuing entity (the source of the data)  It was issued to the entity presenting it (the subject of the data)  It hasn’t been tampered with (the veracity of the data)  Whether the issuer revoked the credential as of a particular point in time (the status of the data)  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The standards and protocols associated with verifiable credentials and supporting technology make it possible for verifiers to make more informed “trust decisions” when accepting information from holders online. Based on the four factors above, verifiers can better determine to trust the information in the credential or not.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Use case diversity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The verifiable credentials model is quite flexible in the number and types of use cases it supports. In the example above, we highlighted the use case of digital driver’s licenses, but this same model could apply to a numberless amount of use cases where sharing identifying information is important. Here are a few examples:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Medical insurance credential: In this example, an insurance organization would be the issuer, a person would be the holder, and a doctor’s office could be the verifier.  Login credential: When a person is creating an account with a company online, the company would issue the person his or her login credential. From that moment on, the person can use the login credential to access their account, eliminating the need for usernames and passwords.¹ Check out how Trinsic issues <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">login credentials</a> to its customers.  University diploma credential: As an issuer, the university would send its graduates their digital diplomas which they could then use to apply for jobs online. Trinsic has written <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">a tutorial</a> on how to set up this specific use case in Trinsic Studio.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The SSI use cases above are pretty straightforward, but the verifiable credentials model allows for more complex situations as well. For example, SSI enables the concept of guardianship if a person does not have the ability to control their own wallet (e.g., the person is a child, has dementia, is a refugee, etc.).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Further, in the verifiable credentials model the holder does not necessarily need to be a person. Verifiable credentials can be issued to organizations or things. This includes licensing and accreditations for businesses as well as supply chain-related documentation for products. SSI and verifiable credentials enable digital, trusted interactions which were not possible online before.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>The ongoing SolarWinds incident illustrates that the much-lauded Zero Trust security paradigm is, in fact, based on trust. Zero Trust is about authenticating and authorizing every action within a computing environment. It is putting the principle of least privilege into action. In an ideal implementation of Zero Trust, users authenticate with the proper identity and authentication assurance levels to get access to local devices, on-premises applications and data, and cloud-hosted resources. Access requests are evaluated against access control policies at runtime.</p>
<p>In order for Zero Trust to work though, there are elements that are trusted that are used to evaluate other entities for trustworthiness:</p>
 
 IT products – operating systems, Line of Business applications, office automation products, IaaS environments, mobile devices, IoT devices, etc. 
 IT services – SaaS apps, IDaaS, managed hosting, Managed Detection &amp; Response (MDR), full scale Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), etc. 
 Processes – auto-updates of software, communication between vendor products and their cloud services, identity vetting, federation, authentication, and authorization 
 Suppliers – IT vendors, IT service providers, IT security vendors, identity providers, and members of product and service supply chains 
 
<p>A breakdown in any of these foundational components can become an attack vector and can put organizations at increased risks. As 2020 draws to a close, cybersecurity teams are searching for signs that their organizations have been affected by the Sunburst/SuperNova/Solorigate malware and are beginning to remediate. New information about this set of events is arriving daily, and the big picture will likely take some time to materialize.</p>
<p>As we deal with this on the tactical level, we can also think about how this should impact longer-term security strategies. Zero Trust is a good strategy, but we must consider, expose, and evaluate the processes, products, services, and suppliers that make up Zero Trust infrastructure. Zero Trust cannot be effective if on so many levels it’s still based on blind trust. As users and implementers of technology, we will always be dependent to a degree on those technology vendors to demonstrate that their products and services are indeed trustworthy. However, we must also consider how each organization can increase the level of its own monitoring, detection, and response capabilities to guard against similar attacks in the future.</p>
<p>Supply chain security and risk management, particularly in the IT product and service arenas, will likely be top concerns for organizations of all sizes and types for 2021. KuppingerCole will continue to research, discuss, and publish on the products and services that constitute <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/search?q=zero+trust">Zero Trust architectures</a>.</p>

<p>As we come to the end of December, it’s time to take a look back at what the Ontology team has been up to in the last&nbsp;week.</p><p>We are closing out the year on a high note with two new partnerships announced last week, which includes adding our Decentralized Identity (DeID) solution to the blockchain-based e-voting system launched by Waves Enterprise. Ontology has also added pre-execution features for batch transactions. Our DeID ensures that the identities and data of people who vote are protected and verified. This week we also announced our collaboration with Litentry, and we aim to onboard 10,000 users to our DeID and OScore solutions together!</p><p>Back-end</p><p>- Added Ontology pre-execution feature for batch transactions</p><p>Product Development</p><p>ONTO</p><p>- Launched ONTO&nbsp;v3.6.5</p><p>- Carried out the “Gas Fee Airdrop” campaign with Binance Smart Chain. Users who transferred BEP-20 BNB in their ONTO wallets got the chance to earn BNB from a pool with the highest equivalent value of $50000.

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Khalid Maliki, Co-Founder &amp; Managing Director, and Jimmy J.P. Snoek, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Tykn. 
<p>Khalid and Jimmy join Oscar for episode 35 of the podcast, discussing everything Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the SSI company they co-founded, Tykn. The conversation details the ‘three pillars of SSI’ (verifiable credentials, decentralised identifiers and blockchain), how SSI fits with existing processes, what it should appear as to end users (and what level of education they need around the technology), the importance of accessibility for inclusivity, and what’s next for Tykn.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In 5 years, people should take [SSI] for granted”</p></blockquote>
 <p>Khalid Maliki</p> 
<p>After many years working in UX at the Dutch Ministry of the Interior, Khalid’s keen product design knowledge combined with a passion for social impact led him to put all his time and efforts into co-founding the award-winning digital ID company Tykn. Khalid believes Self-Sovereign Identity will positively impact billions of people’s lives and has advocated for its adoption on the most important stages, from the Economic Forum in Africa to the United Nations in NYC. He considers one of his biggest achievements to have co-founded a happy family.</p>

 <p>Jimmy J.P. Snoek</p> 
<p>Jimmy J.P. is a musician, business developer and entrepreneur, currently residing in The Hague, The Netherlands. After having worked as a professional musician in Spain and having started his first company in The Netherlands before the age of 20, Jimmy was accepted into the prestigious McGill University in Montréal, Canada and co-founded the now award-winning digital ID company Tykn. As an evangelist of data privacy and an early adopter of crypto, Jimmy has spoken about the merits of blockchain and self-sovereign identity at conferences and institutions worldwide since 2017, and has been featured in multiple publications, including The Guardian.</p>

   Today, I’m going to show you how to plug Okta into a Force.com application (along with Mulesoft’s API gateway) using the OpenID Connect protocol (aka ‘OIDC’). 

 By the end of this tutorial, your Force.com application will have user authentication backed by Okta and will be able to securely call your backend APIs through Mulesoft’s API gateway. Sound good? Let’s get to it!

  <p>Today, I’m going to show you how to plug Okta into a Force.com application (along with Mulesoft’s API gateway) using the <a>OpenID Connect protocol</a> (aka ‘OIDC’).</p>

<p>By the end of this tutorial, your Force.com application will have user authentication backed by Okta and will be able to securely call your backend APIs through Mulesoft’s API gateway. Sound good? Let’s get to it!</p>

 What’s Force.com? 

<p><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/products/force/">Force.com</a> is Salesforce’s Platform-as-a-Service (aka ‘PaaS’) which allows you to develop and build custom applications.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll be using the <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.pages.meta/pages/pages_intro_what_is_it.htm">Visualforce framework</a> to build your front end and the <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_intro_what_is_apex.htm">APEX development framework</a> to build your back end.</p>

<p></p>

 What’s an API Gateway? 

<blockquote>
  <p>An API gateway is a firewall that sits between your API and your users. They range from the simplest proxies which apply throttling and white/blacklisting to fully configurable platforms with fine-grained access mapping individual permissions to specific HTTP verbs and endpoints. Realistically, using an API gateway is not necessary, but it makes some things faster, easier, and more reliable, which allows you to focus on your API.</p>

  <p>~<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseysoftware">Keith Casey</a>, API Problem Solver</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll be using the <a href="https://www.mulesoft.com/">MuleSoft API Gateway</a> to protect your API and will use an access token to securely call this API through Salesforce application.</p>

<p></p>

 Set Up Your Okta Developer Instance 

<p>To continue, you’ll need a free Okta account. Head on over to <a>developer.okta.com</a> and create an Okta account if you haven’t already.</p>

<p>For this example, I’ll be using my own Okta tenant, <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com</code>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got an acount, log into the dashboard and click Applications -&gt; Add Application. Select Web and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This will create an OIDC application that represent your Salesforce application. Change Name to “Salesforce Custom Application” and, within the Grant Type allowed section, make sure you have Authorization Code and Implicit (Hybrid) checked. As for the others fields, leave them alone for now.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done.</p>

<p>Take note of the Client ID and Secret as you will use these values shortly.</p>

<p></p>

 Set Up a Salesforce Developer Instance 

<p>You can sign up for a free Saleforce developer edition instance through <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/signup">this link</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have signed up and successfully created your instance, you should be able to navigate to your Salesforce admin console. This will usually look something like: <code>https://ap5.salesforce.com/lightning/setup/SetupOneHome/home</code>.</p>

 Configure a Custom Domain for Your Salesforce Instance 

<p>From your Salesforce dashboard, navigate to Setup -&gt; Settings &gt; Company Settings -&gt; My Domain.</p>

<p>Enter the custom domain you wish to use and click Check Availability. If the domain you’ve chosen is still available, you should get a green check saying the domain is available. Then click Register Domain. You should see the message below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once the custom domain configuration has been successfully applied, navigate back to the main screen and you should see some updates on the displayed page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure you click the Login button so you can test your access to the custom domain once available. Click Deploy to Users to leverage the custom domain for all your users in Salesforce.</p>

<p>We will revisit this page later to allow users to log into Salesforce using OIDC. We’ll do this later.</p>

 Integrate Okta as an OIDC Provider Within Salesforce 

<p>To configure Okta as an OIDC provider within Salesforce, click Setup -&gt; Settings -&gt; Identity -&gt; Auth Providers from the Salesforce “Setup Admin” console.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click New and select Open ID Connect as the Provider Type. Then fill in the fields with the red marker.</p>

 
   Name can be any name you wish 
   Set URL suffix to your Okta subdomain name. In my environment, this will be <code>phdemo</code>. 
   Set Consumer Key to the Client ID of the application you created earlier 
   Set Consumer Secret to the Client Secret of the application you created earlier 
 

<p>For the following endpoints, we’ll be using the default authorization server that is enabled for every Okta instance.</p>

<p>You should be able to get your OAuth server settings from the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#well-known-oauth-authorization-server">.well-known endpoint</a>. This URL is of the format <code>https://&lt;yourdomain&gt;.okta.com/oauth2/default/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server</code> (e.g., <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server</code>).</p>

 
   Set the Authorize Endpoint URL to <code>https://&lt;your domain&gt;.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> (e.g., <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code>) 
   Set the Token Endpoint URL to <code>https://&lt;your domain&gt;.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token</code> (e.g., <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/v1/token</code>) 
   Set the User Info Endpoint URL to <code>https://&lt;your domain&gt;.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo</code> (e.g., <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo</code>) 
   Set the Token Issuer Endpoint URL to <code>https://&lt;your domain&gt;.okta.com/oauth2/default</code> (e.g., <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default</code>) 
   Set the Default Scopes to <code>profile openid email</code> 
 

<p>Once completed, it should look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, you need to set a registration handler as part of the process. Luckily, Salesforce allows us to click a link that will automatically create the registration handler. Click it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once clicked, you should have something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure you set the field Execute Registration As to your account:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once done with the above, click Save and you should end up with this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Notice after saving the OIDC configuration that Salesforce has generated URLs below the OIDC config. You need to copy these values for the following fields:</p>

 
   Set the Test-Only Initialization URL - e.g., <code>https://oktaoidc-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/services/auth/test/phdemo</code> 
   Set the OAuth-Only Initialization URL - e.g., <code>https://oktaoidc-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/services/auth/oauth/phdemo</code> 
   Set the Callback URL - e.g., <code>https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/00D2v000002F7VWEA0/phdemo</code> 
 

 Modify the Okta OIDC Application Redirect URI 

<p>Go back to the application instance you created in the Okta dashboard and update the Login redirect URIs with the values provided above.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once done, click Save to make sure your changes reflect in the OIDC application within Okta.</p>

 Enable Login via Okta Within Salesforce 

<p>Navigate back to Setup -&gt; Settings -&gt; Company Settings -&gt; My Domain.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Edit button under Authentication Configuration. You should be able to see the OIDC configuration as a checkbox option under Authentication Service. Check this so users can log in to Salesforce using Okta via OIDC.</p>

<p>Click Save once you are done. It should look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should be able to see additional buttons as a way to login once you navigate to your custom salesforce domain URL. I’m using <code>oktaoidc-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 Set Up Your Mulesoft Gateway 

<p>You should be able to sign up for a free 30 day trial of Mulesoft through <a href="https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signup?apintent=generic">this link</a>. Once you’ve signed up, you should be able to log into the <a href="https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/?apintent=generic">Mulesoft Anypoint Platform</a>.</p>

<p></p>

 Deploy a Sample API in Mulesoft 

<p>Once you are logged into Mulesoft, navigate to the Design Center from the sidebar navigation.</p>

<p></p>

 
   Click Create new 
   Click Create API specification 
   Provide any name you wish to use 
   Select the Visual Editor radio button 
   Click Create specification 
 

<p></p>

<p>You should be taken to a new page within the Design Center. Click Import Example then  check the Contact API Tutorial option. Now, click the Import Asset button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then click Import &amp; Replace. On the left-side of the page, there is one resource already available and this resource is called <code>/contacts</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Publish -&gt; Publish to Exchange. Provide a version number and click Publish to Exchange.</p>

 Set Up Mulesoft as OAuth as a Service Application in Okta 

<p>Return back to your Okta dashboard. Click Applications -&gt; Add Application. Select Service and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Provide a name then click Done.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Take note of the Client ID and Client secret here as you will use this later on in the step below.</p>

<p></p>

 Integrate Okta as an OIDC Client Provider in Mulesoft 

<p>Return to the home page of the Anypoint Platform and navigate to Management Center -&gt; Access Management.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Navigate to Access Management -&gt; Client Providers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Add Client Provider -&gt; Open ID Connect Dynamic Client Registration and provide the following:</p>

 
   Name: Any name you wish 
   Description: Any description you wish 
   Under Dynamic Client Registration:
     
       The Issuer should be: <code>https://&lt;your domain&gt;.okta.com/oauth2/default</code> (e.g., <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default</code>) 
       The Client Registration URL should be: <code>https://&lt;your domain&gt;.okta.com/oauth2/v1/clients</code> (e.g., <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com/oauth2/v1/clients</code>) 
       Leave the Authorization Header blank 
     
   
   Under Token Introspection Client:
     
       Client ID: The client ID generated from the last step 
       Client Secret: The client secret generated from the last step. 
     
   
   Under OpenID Connect Authorization URLs:
     
       The Authorize URL should be: <code>https://&lt;your domain&gt;.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> (e.g., <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code>) 
       The Token URL should be: <code>https://&lt;your domain&gt;.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token</code> (e.g., <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/v1/token</code>) 
       The Token Introspection URL should be: <code>https://&lt;your domain&gt;.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/introspect</code> (e.g., <code>https://phdemo.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/v1/introspect</code>) 
     
   
 

<p></p>

<p>Next, click Save then navigate to Access Management -&gt; Environments.</p>

<p>Return to the Anypoint Platform home page and navigate to Management Center -&gt; API Manager. Then click Manage API &gt; Manage API from Exchange.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Search for the Mulesoft API you created earlier.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Within the Managing type, check the Endpoint with the Proxy radio button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select CloudHub as the default option and click Save.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll be redirected to a new page. Under Deployment Configuration, set the Runtime version to <code>3.9.x</code> and provide any name you wish to use for your proxy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Take note of the Proxy Application URL as you will use that shortly.</p>

<p>Once the deployment is successful, you should see this screen:</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the left-hand side, click Policies.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Apply New Policy. Search for Open ID Connect access token enforcement and tick the box.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Configure Policy.</p>

<p>Enter <code>openID profile email</code> as scopes and select Skip Client ID validation. Click Apply.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should now see a new record within the API level policies.</p>

<p>You have completed the configuration setup with Mulesoft. In the next step, you will integrate the Mulesoft protected API with Salesforce.</p>

 Get the Auth Provider ID from Salesforce 

<p>As per <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_class_Auth_AuthToken.htm">Salesforce documentation</a>, you need to provide an 18-character identifier to get the access token from your 3rd party identity provider,</p>

<p>If you noticed, in the earlier steps where we created an auth provider in Salesforce, the ID only had 15-characters, meaning it is missing three.</p>

<p>To get the 18-character full value, you can go through the steps below.</p>

<p>Navigate to Setup -&gt; Platform Tools -&gt; Custom Code -&gt; Apex Classes then select the Developer Console.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Navigate to File -&gt; Open Resource.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Search for <code>AuthProvider.obj</code> then click Open.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select Id and click Query twice.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should now see a new text area. Click Execute. You should now see query results.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Take note of the Auth Provider ID value, as you will use this later on within the code snippet of the Auto-created Registration Handler.</p>

 Modify Logic for the Auto-Generated Registration Handler in Salesforce 

<p>Now, return to Salesforce. Remember the Autogenerated Registration Handler which was created earlier? You’ll need to modify it so it can do the following:</p>

 
   Show the access token obtained from Okta 
   Call the Okta userinfo API endpoint to show all the user details using the access token 
   Add the access token in the Authorization header of an HTTP request such that Mulesoft API Gateway can verify if the user is allowed to call the API protected by Mulesoft 
 

<p>Navigate to Setup -&gt; Platform Tools -&gt; Custom Code -&gt; Apex Classes.</p>

<p>You should be able to see the auto-created registration handler earlier. Click the Edit link. You should be able to access an in-line code editor. Overwrite the existing code with the following code inside your class:</p>

   <code>public String accessToken;
public String callOut { get; set; }
public String sub { get; set; }
public String name { get; set; }
public String email { get; set; }

    req.setHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer '+ Auth.AuthToken.getAccessToken('0SO2v000000XjXAGA0', 'Open ID Connect'));//change the first parameter to the Auth. Provider ID obtained earlier.
    HTTPResponse resp = http.send(req);

    if(resp.getBody() != null) {

    HTTPResponse resp = http.send(req);
    system.debug('INSIDE CALLOUT:'+resp.getBody());

    if (resp.getBody() != null) {

        append = values.get('FirstName') + ':' + values.get('LastName') + ':' + values.get('Email') + ':' + values.get('Company');
        callOut = append;
    }

    return null;

</code>   

<p>Click Save.</p>

<p>Navigate back to the Apex Class home page.</p>

<p>Click Security on the AutocreatedRegHandler.</p>

<p>Make sure you add Standard Platform User as an enabled Profile. Click Save.</p>

<p></p>

 Configure Trust Over the Remote URL Called Within Salesforce 

<p>Navigate to Setup -&gt; Settings -&gt; Security -&gt; Remote Site Settings. Then click New Remote Site.</p>

<p>Add your Okta URL (e.g.: <code>https://{yourDomainHere}.okta.com</code>) and click Save &amp; New.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Add your Salesforce Mulesoft Proxy Endpoint URL (e.g., <code>https://domain.cloudhub.io</code>).</p>

<p>Click Save. You have now successfully added your Okta domain and Mulesoft Proxy Endpoint URL as trusted remote URLs.</p>

 Create a Visualforce Page to Tie Everything Together 

<p>Within Salesforce, navigate to Platform Tools -&gt; Custom Code -&gt; Visualforce Pages.</p>

<p>Click New. Provide a Label, Name, and Description.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Generally, as per best practice, you would want to create a separate controller or APEX handler for your Visualforce custom page. For this tutorial, you’ll re-use the same one you have modified earlier. Overwrite and paste the following code below:</p>

   <code>&lt;!-- change the control value with the class name of your controller --&gt;
&lt;apex:page controller="AutocreatedRegHandler1380796002690"&gt;

  &lt;!-- Begin Default Content REMOVE THIS --&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Congratulations&lt;/h1&gt;
  This is your Salesforce page protected by Okta OIDC and OAuth 2.0
  &lt;apex:form &gt;
    &lt;apex:commandButton id="btn" action="{!fetch_data}" value="Call Protected API behind Mulesoft using OAuth JWT Token below"/&gt;
    Token: &lt;apex:outputLabel id="one"&gt;{!accessToken}&lt;/apex:outputLabel&gt;
    Access Token Details from https://yourdomain.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo: &lt;p/&gt;

    &lt;apex:outputText &gt;Sub : {!sub}&lt;/apex:outputText&gt; &lt;p /&gt;
    &lt;apex:outputText &gt;Full Name : {!name}&lt;/apex:outputText&gt; &lt;p /&gt;
    &lt;apex:outputText &gt;Email : {!email}&lt;/apex:outputText&gt; &lt;p /&gt;
    &lt;apex:outputText &gt;Username : {!userName}&lt;/apex:outputText&gt; &lt;p /&gt;
    &lt;apex:outputText &gt;First Name: {!firstName}&lt;/apex:outputText&gt; &lt;p /&gt;
    &lt;apex:outputText &gt;Last Name : {!lastName}&lt;/apex:outputText&gt; &lt;p /&gt;
    &lt;apex:outputText &gt;Callout : {!callOut}&lt;/apex:outputText&gt;
  &lt;/apex:form&gt;
  &lt;!-- End Default Content REMOVE THIS --&gt;

&lt;/apex:page&gt;
</code>   

<p>Click Save.</p>

<p>You’re now done with the Salesforce Configuration and setup.</p>

 Testing Out Your Integration 

<p>To access or test the Visualforce page you’ve created, use the URL: <code>https://salesforce-custom-domain-name-ed--c.visualforce.com/apex/pageName</code> (e.g., <code>https://oktaoidc-dev-ed--c.visualforce.com/apex/OktaPage</code>).</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you integrated Okta into your custom Salesforce application using Force.com (APEX &amp; Visualforce) as well as the Mulesoft API Gateway.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Many if not most organizations have moved to a risk management model for cybersecurity and identity management. Priorities have shifted in two major ways over the last decade:</p>
 
 decreasing attack surface sizes 
 focusing on detection and response technologies instead of prevention only 
 
<p>Reducing attack surfaces inarguably improves security posture. Achieving the objective of reducing attack surfaces involves many activities: secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning and management, consolidation of functions into fewer products and services, access reconciliation, user de-provisioning, avoidance of over-provisioning, use of Privileged Access Management (PAM), OS and app patching, API security gateways, and so forth.</p>
<p>The realization that some attacks get past preventive measures had led to an increase in the prominence of detection and response techniques and technologies. However, deploying EDR, NDR, or XDR products doesn’t obviate the need for endpoint anti-malware, email/web security gateways, or WAFs.</p>
<p>In light of the Sunburst/SuperNova/Solorigate incident, the scope of detection must be expanded. For example, comms between agents on protected resources and remote sites cannot be overlooked. IT product binaries should not be excluded from anti-malware scans. Processes running signed code still need to be examined for signs of malicious behavior. Security log retention periods must increase. 30, 60, or even 90 days’ worth of logs is not enough to keep on hand when faced with investigations that need to go back 9+ months.</p>
<p>The SolarWinds incident highlights the need for <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response/">Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR)</a>, <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80126/network-detection-and-response/">Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR)</a>, or their union, XDR. These tools are the best means for determining if your organization has had any compromises after the event. In the case of the Sunburst/SuperNova/Solorigate malware, most endpoint protection (EPP, or Next Generation Anti-Malware) didn’t recognize the software as malicious initially. These detection focused tools can look for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) once they are identified and shared as threat intelligence.</p>
<p>No tool is 100% perfect, though. The attackers often acquire admin privileges and use them to remove or cover their tracks. XDR tools can help to automate the environment-wide searches to uncover evidence attackers may have inadvertently left behind.</p>
<p>Both approaches, reducing attack surfaces and increasing detection/response, remain valid after SolarWinds. In fact, this global cybersecurity event shows that most organizations, public and private sector, need to re-double their efforts on both objectives. Reducing the attack surface means additional vetting is needed on IT and cybersecurity tools, which primarily must happen at the vendors. Improving the operational effectiveness of XDR, SIEM, and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80016/security-orchestration-automation-and-response-soar/">SOAR tools</a> will require that those who implement these tools to extend their data retention times significantly beyond the default periods, even if it increases the cost of services.</p>
<p>Addressing and mitigating risks in the IT supply chain, especially cybersecurity products and services, will be front-and-center for CISOs in 2021. KuppingerCole will continue to monitor and advise as warranted.</p>

<p>The 6.7 release brings support for more enterprise use cases, improved user onboarding, and security enhancements. The highly anticipated Roaming User Support functionality is now available as a technology preview to enable users to securely unlock any company machine without requiring individual device pairing.</p>
      

      
 Take Workstation Unlock Anywhere 
      
<p>Not all office environments include assigned seating or even assigned machines. With a cluster of domain-joined computers and unique accounts, users can log into any desktop and start working. But how do you secure that login if you have to pair your mobile device with a specific workstation?</p>
      
<p>With HYPR’s support for roaming users, a single registration can be employed to authenticate into any workstation, as long as they’re on the same domain. In this flow, users can select to log in with a QR code and once scanned by the HYPR mobile app, they get access into the machine with their own account. This removes the need to register with multiple workstations and eliminates the burdensome overhead of account management in the mobile app.</p>
      
<p>What does this mean for your business?</p>
      
<p>The HYPR Cloud Platform 6.7 frees you from requiring a 1:1 relationship between workstation and device to securely unlock your machines. Instead, you can equip your users with the HYPR mobile app and a variety of domain-joined computers to enable safe, simple, and truly passwordless authentication.</p>
      
<p>Not only will your end-users benefit from the efficient authentication process, but your administrators will also appreciate the reduction of management as the registration is no longer tied to the machines but rather the users themselves.</p>
      
 Other Notable Enhancements 
      
<p>In addition to roaming user support, HYPR now enables authentication using Feitian K9 security keys to create an even more flexible solution. Feitian keys support FIDO authentication to create an additional passwordless login option.</p>
      
<p>Administrators can improve the device pairing and user onboarding process with dynamic magic links, which automatically adjust where the user is taken based on their device. For example, if the user is on a mobile device, then the link will take them into the HYPR mobile app to pair a new web account, or it will take them to the app store to download the HYPR mobile application; if they click the link on a desktop / laptop, then they will be redirected to the Device Manager page to pair the device.</p>

 The GiD Report#140 — ApplePay finally gets the antitrust attention it&nbsp;deserves <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-138-the-age-of-antitrust-stripe-is-windows-for-fintech-b5dcfbf5da5d">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Note: There was late breaking news about the SEC lawsuit against Ripple—<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ripple-to-face-sec-suit-over-xrp-cryptocurrency-11608598800">WSJ</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/21/ripple-to-be-sued-by-sec-cryptocurrency-xrp/">Fortune</a>. We’ll cover that in next week’s&nbsp;report.</p><p>This week:</p>  Coinbase IPO + new FINCEN wallet&nbsp;rules  Google antitrust lawsuit  Facebook v. Apple (full newspaper ad)  ApplePay antitrust scrutiny (it’s about&nbsp;time!)  Stuff happens   1. It was another big week, this time led by the news that Coinbase had filed for its IPO — a week after Bitcoin reached new all-time highs over&nbsp;$20K. <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-exchange-coinbase-files-for-initial-public-offering-11608232520">the&nbsp;WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>Coinbase’s filing is the culmination of the yearslong development of both the company and the cryptocurrency industry, moving from an anarchist experiment in alternative money to a mainstream asset class that has attracted hedge funds, mobile-money providers and insurance companies.</blockquote><blockquote>Coinbase, founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, has grown into one of the most recognizable names in the cryptocurrency industry. It currently has about 35 million users, more than Charles Schwab Corp.’s platform.</blockquote><blockquote>FINCEN did its best to spoil the party, however, making good on recent rumors about new wallet rules (revealed in a series of tweets by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong not long&nbsp;ago).</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_20201221&amp;instance_id=25260&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;productCode=DK&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=47476&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2F701325de-1460-589a-8dd9-ca1d8dd5f325&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">Dealbook:</a></p><blockquote>Late on Friday, the Treasury Department proposed a<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1216"> new disclosure rule</a> for certain digital currency transactions “aimed at closing money laundering regulatory gaps.” Critics of the move in the cryptocurrency community decried the proposal.</blockquote><blockquote>Critics are focused on the process. While one crypto executive said that the rule, which requires disclosure for certain big transactions with the Treasury Department and had been rumored for some time, “<a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1340135040399904770">could’ve been worse</a>,” critics took particular issue with its rollout. The department is allowing only two weeks over the holidays for public comment, which they say isn’t enough&nbsp;time.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-exchange-coinbase-files-for-initial-public-offering-11608232520">Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase Files for Initial Public&nbsp;Offering</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">Coinbase files to go public confidentially and we’re hyped — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/17/largest-us-cryptocurrency-exchange-coinbase-files-for-ipo-as-bitcoin-soars-past-23000.html">Largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase files for IPO as bitcoin soars past&nbsp;$23,000</a>   2. The antitrust hits also kept coming. It was Facebook again — but also&nbsp;Google. <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/texas-leads-new-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-targeting-ad-tech.html">CNBC</a> (via&nbsp;Jakob):</p><blockquote>Google is set to face a new antitrust lawsuit from a group of state attorneys general led by Texas, this time targeting its advertising technology services.</blockquote><blockquote>The announcement follows a separate complaint from the Department of Justice claiming Google has illegally maintained a monopoly in online general search services by cutting off competitors from key distribution channels.</blockquote><blockquote>The complaint claims Google and Facebook, which it names a “co-conspirator,” harmed competition through an unlawful agreement to rig auctions and fix&nbsp;prices.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a>— <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/texas-leads-new-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-targeting-ad-tech.html">Texas antitrust lawsuit against Google alleges unlawful agreement with&nbsp;Facebook</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-sue-google-over-digital-ad-practices-11608146817">Ten States Sue Google, Alleging Deal With Facebook to Rig Online Ad&nbsp;Market</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/what-the-google-ads-antitrust-lawsuit-doesnt-say">What the Google Ads Antitrust Lawsuit Doesn’t&nbsp;Say</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-new-european-rules-could-affect-amazon-google-and-other-tech-icons">How New European Rules Could Affect Amazon, Google and Other Tech&nbsp;Icons</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/how-google-dominates.html">Google Dominates Thanks to an Unrivaled View of the&nbsp;Web</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/an-amazon-rival-in-france-awaits-new-europe-regulations">An Amazon Rival in France Awaits New Europe Regulations</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-ftc-launches-sweeping-privacy-study-of-top-tech-platforms-345de3ef-f49e-4001-be84-0736b20a2207.html?utm_campaign=%5Bcovid19%5D+Tech+Impac&amp;utm_content=565518&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=197426">FTC launches sweeping privacy study of top tech platforms</a>   3. Facebook made news elsewhere as well, though this time from the other side of the aisle, attacking Apple in a full-page newspaper ad about new iOS platform rules regarding tracking and&nbsp;privacy. <p>We’ve talked before about how legal action is only one prong in a multi-pronged attack when it comes to antitrust. The other is competition as well as showing people/consumers a better way. Facebook’s latest skirmishes with Apple show that, well, hey, a little bit of healthy competition isn’t all that bad now is&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here’s the ad (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>):</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/16/facebook-attacks-apple/">Facebook attacks Apple in full-page newspaper ads — 9to5Mac</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/16/apple-facebook-app-tracking-transparency/">Apple rebuffs Facebook criticism, says iOS anti-tracking features are about ’standing up for our users’ — 9to5Mac</a>  <p>And here’s the Information’s take:</p><blockquote>It’s hard not to feel that Apple CEO Tim Cook has only himself to blame for the battle he now finds himself in with Facebook. Over the past few years he spent an inordinate amount of time preaching about the evils of the advertising-based business model of Facebook and others. It’s not a surprise Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg would retaliate. For all of Cook’s sermonizing, Apple is not free of sin when it comes to how its customers are treated (as anyone buying one of Apple’s high-priced cables could&nbsp;attest.)</blockquote><blockquote>And whatever the merits of Facebook’s argument — which focuses how Apple uses its control of the App Store to hurt developers and advertisers — one thing seems clear. The dispute between the two companies foreshadows a loosening of the gatekeeper powers enjoyed by all the big tech companies, whether Apple, Google or Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>After all, it’s one thing for small companies to complain about the power of big companies. That happens all the time and sometimes feels like sour grapes. But when members of the big tech cartel are also speaking out about the gatekeeper status of one of their colleagues, you know something is&nbsp;wrong.</blockquote><blockquote>The whole point of scale in business is that it empowers you to fight others with scale. What Facebook’s complaints suggest is that even great scale isn’t enough to deal with one company’s control of the mobile ecosystem. And Facebook isn’t the only big tech company to complain about Apple’s App Store — Microsoft has also raised concerns about&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>There used to be a saying about the hazards of attacking a newspaper: “Never pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel.” Perhaps Tim Cook should have realized that he shouldn’t pick a fight with someone who has three billion users. — Martin&nbsp;Peers</blockquote> 3. Speaking of Apple, ApplePay is also getting caught in the antitrust crossfire. <p>Which makes sense. We’ve all about had it when it comes to Big Tech leveraging their platforms to force us into anti-competitive payment&nbsp;rails.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/13da1d7e-d771-40b1-a597-e37ab7112d46">the&nbsp;FT</a>:</p>Photo: Shinya&nbsp;Suzuki<blockquote>Apple’s next antitrust battle is shaping up to be over Apple Pay, the company’s digital wallet, as the Covid-19 pandemic turbocharges use of contactless payments.</blockquote><blockquote>The Cupertino company has spent much of 2020 fighting allegations of anti-competitive behaviour in its App Store. By contrast, its financial services business has attracted little attention in the US, meriting only a passing mention in a 450-page report by Congress’ antitrust subcommittee in&nbsp;October.</blockquote><blockquote>But Apple Pay is growing fast as consumers try not to touch buttons or handle cash because of the coronavirus. Jennifer Bailey, head of Apple Pay, said this month that contactless payments have gone from “being a convenience to a matter of public&nbsp;health.”</blockquote><blockquote>Jason Gardner, chief executive of California-based payments platform Marqeta, said: “They are really building out, within the Apple Pay team, a financial services juggernaut.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Apple Wallet is a killer app — more of a killer app than much of the world really understands right now. And it’s absolutely going to become a battleground for regulators in the&nbsp;future.”</blockquote><blockquote>In June, the European Commission opened a formal antitrust probe into Apple Pay and this month competition regulators in the Netherlands launched their own investigation. Australia’s central bank chief Philip Lowe recently said Apple’s approach to payments was “raising competition issues”.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/13da1d7e-d771-40b1-a597-e37ab7112d46">Apple Pay draws antitrust attention</a>   4.

  <p>While 2020 has been a roller coaster of a year, there has been one note of certainty: digital transformation has accelerated at an unprecedented rate, and identity and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a> (IAM) is a big part of that evolution. In anticipation of 2021, we asked four of our experts to share their perspectives on what you can expect in the new year.</p>

<p>Allan Foster, Chief Evangelist: “Move over multi-factor authentication. User managed access (UMA) will reign supreme in 2021.”</p>

<p>With more services online than ever before, users have come to expect amazing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/connect-everyone">digital experiences</a>. To keep up with these expectations, digital experiences will need to involve more than one identity as more organizations start to embrace the idea of delegation. Often, authorized users are geographically separated or using a variety of devices – and these accounts or devices may not even be connected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here’s a common example. When renting out Airbnb lodging, the host needs to grant guests access to connected things like the thermostat, smart TV, and other devices for the duration of their stay. To make this happen, the host needs to be able to work with more than one identity associated with each device and delegate access to guests. Of course, once the guest departs, access to the devices needs to be revoked. Situations like this drive the need to focus on how to work with a collection of identities.</p>

<p>Enterprises have a similar situation, with a population of users needing access to specific applications at certain times, but not necessarily all the time. Many applications rely on traditional means of authentication, like <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-was-never-enough">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>, but transactions that involve more than one person or identity are not really an authentication problem. This is where advanced technologies like user-managed access (<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/privacy/user-managed-access">UMA</a>) can help customers and employees manage who is allowed access to their resources, for how long, and under what circumstances. Essentially, UMA facilitates the connections of the identities while optimizing the user experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2021, solutions that provide a convenient central management system for organizing digital resources that reside in many locations, delegating access to others, and monitoring and revoking access when necessary will take over from traditional authentication and MFA controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ben Goodman, Senior Vice President: “ 2021 will be the year of ambient identification methods as organizations shift to ‘zero login’.”</p>

<p>Now that <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> technology, such as biometrics, is widely used, we will see a shift toward a “zero login” process, which removes friction for the user unless there is an issue with the initial authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are huge upsides to this. There will be no credentials to remember, and MFA will be silent on the back end. Zero login&nbsp;will be more secure than using a password, username, or MFA because it can use factors such as device enrollment and device reputation, fingerprints, keyboard typing patterns, the way the phone/device is held, and other markers to verify identity in the background while the user enjoys a frictionless experience.</p>

<p>For zero login to be successful, all these identity verification factors must be measured and combined in a transparent way so that consumers don’t feel their privacy is being compromised. Organizations should also have the option to introduce authentication steps into the process if they prefer to introduce more friction for bigger or riskier actions. This is the approach online retailers like Amazon take when customers want to purchase big ticket items. By not allowing the “buy in one click” option for purchases over a certain dollar amount, they are adding friction to the purchase process to ensure the buyer is who they say they are. Rather than only authenticating at the “front door” with passwords or MFA, extra security steps will be added right at the point of potential fraud during the transaction to create a better digital experience for users. Zero login enables smarter authentication that adjusts as necessary for a more seamless login experience across an individual's devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eve Maler, CTO: “IT will infuse access governance with intelligence to protect workforce cybersecurity in 2021.”</p>

<p>Accelerating changes in enterprise technologies, cyberthreats, and the user landscape are increasing pressure on traditional <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance and administration (IGA) </a>solutions and, in turn, on security and compliance teams. On top of growing compliance risks, enterprise IT environments become more complex every year, increasing the number of applications and systems that need to be accessed by their users. These challenges are driving organizations to seek out artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solutions that simplify and automate the access request, access approval, certification and role-modeling processes.</p>

<p>In 2021, we will see AI increasingly employed to enable an <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">autonomous identit</a>y approach. AI-infused authentication and authorization solutions will be layered on top of, or integrated with, existing IGA solutions, providing contextual, enterprise-wide visibility by collecting and analyzing all identity data and enabling insight into different risk levels of user access at scale. The use of AI will allow systems to identify and alert security and compliance teams about high-risk access or policy violations. Over time we will see these AI systems produce explainable results while increasing automation of some of the most complex cybersecurity challenges within the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mary Writz, Vice President, Product Management: “National identities will become more prevalent."</p>

<p>There are two fundamental shifts in the way we view and define digital identity on the horizon for 2021.</p>

<p>First, non-human identities will be just as important as human identities. While we often associate digital identity with a person, many “things” will need identities – from watches to wristbands, from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) sensors to medical equipment, and even DevOps containers and Kubernetes resources. While the number of human identities may grow at a slow pace, the number of non-human identities will explode. For example, enterprises want to attach identities to machines, such as virtual machines, hosts, or containers in order to control security, as well as spend on cloud computing. The ratio of humans or developers to machine identities is 1:200 and still growing.</p>

<p>Second, national identities will become more prevalent as national, state and local governments transform to provide services primarily in digital format. COVID-19 is driving the need for new services like contact track and trace and remote access to benefits services, which will continue globally. For example, the new Japanese prime minister has aggressively called for the digitization of government and a new digital agency that will be established to drive “e-everything.” In the U.K., we saw the emergence of an NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app that citizens could use to enter pubs and restaurants. These examples show how this trend is already evolving.</p>

<p>We hope that you find our predictions insightful and that they help you to uncover new ways to look at the power of identity. We’re looking forward to an exciting year ahead, full of new innovations that will continue to shape the ever-evolving digital identity landscape.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To celebrate the launch of my book, <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">API Security in Action</a>, which was just published by Manning Publications, I've teamed up with my employer, ForgeRock, to demonstrate how some of the techniques in the book can be accomplished with less effort using the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>API Security in Action discusses five primary security mechanisms you can use to strengthen your application programming interfaces (APIs) against common threats:</p>

  Encryption of data in transit and at rest ensures confidentiality and integrity. 
	 Rate-limiting reduces the damage of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. 
	 Authentication checks users are who they say they are. 
	 Authorization ensures that users can't do anything they aren't allowed to do. 
	 Audit logging allows users to be held accountable for their actions. 
   <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the book, you'll learn in detail how to build these features into your APIs and really understand how they work and why you need them. ForgeRock's comprehensive Identity Platform can get you up and running with all of these security controls in no time. Let's take a closer look at a few examples.</p>

 API Protection at the Edge With Identity Gateway 

<p>One of the core security controls in API Security in Action is the use of rate-limiting to protect against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. To get the most from this protection, you really want to push rate-limiting as far out to the edge of your network as possible to reject requests early before they consume significant resources. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">ForgeRock Identity Gateway (IG)</a> provides a suite of functionality for protecting your APIs at the edge, including <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/gateway-guide/throttling-about.html">sophisticated rate-limiting and throttling filters</a>.</p>

<p>However, IG can do much more than just rate-limiting, and is a veritable Swiss Army Knife of API security. The Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection discussed in Chapter 4 is <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/gateway-guide/csrf.html">built right into IG as a general-purpose filter</a>. It can also handle sophisticated authentication and single-sign on flows, protecting APIs with JSON Web Tokens, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect. If that's not enough, you can extend IG with scripts and Java plugins to implement almost any API security pattern described in the book.</p>

 Powerful Authorization Options 

<p>Perhaps the most important topic in the book is authorization: working out who is allowed to do what. You'll learn about three important topics in depth in authorization:</p>

  Identity-based authorization, including role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC). 
	 Capability-based access control, which uses fine-grained tokens that act a bit like keys in the real world. 
	 Delegated authorization, using OAuth2, allowing a user to delegate some of their authority to a third-party application or service. 
 <p>One of the strengths of the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> is its comprehensive support for authorization technologies, through the ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">Access Management</a> product (AM) and policy enforcement points, such as IG or our dedicated policy agents. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/authorization">AM's powerful policy engine</a> can be used to implement sophisticated access control decisions, fully integrated with it's mind-blowing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">intelligent authentication</a>.</p>

<p>As you might expect, AM also provides one of the most advanced OAuth2 authorization server implementations available today, with excellent support for the latest <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-16">best practices</a>. IG's <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/gateway-guide/oauth2-rs.html">Resource Server Filter</a> makes accepting access tokens at your APIs easy and secure, including support for advanced features like <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">OAuth mutual TLS</a> discussed in Chapter 11. The latest release of AM also supports issuing access tokens as Macaroons, a powerful new token format described in Chapter 9, which brings many of the benefits of capability-based security within the framework of existing OAuth2 standards.</p>

 Kubernetes-Ready and Rocking the IoT 

<p>The final third of the book looks at protecting APIs in two increasingly important deployment scenarios:</p>

  Microservice architectures running in a <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes container orchestration environment</a>. 
	 Constrained devices operating in the industrial or consumer Internet of Things (IoT). 
 <p>ForgeRock has invested heavily in recent years in ensuring that our Identity Platform works well in a Kubernetes (k8s) environment, and <a href="https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgeops">provides recipes for deploying our products to k8s</a>. Our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> runs on Kubernetes, so we've got deep knowledge on how to scale and secure deployments in this platform, some of which is distilled into Part 4 of the book.</p>

<p>IoT environments are very different from the comfortable world of servers running in data centers, both due to the constrained nature of the devices involved and how exposed they can be to external threats. ForgeRock has spent several years investigating the challenges of these environments and developing our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">ForgeRock Things</a> offerings that can help secure IoT applications and integrate devices with our identity platform.</p>

<p>During the second half of 2020, Civic has continued charging ahead, making strong gains with our Civic Wallet app, building out Health Key by Civic, and providing our users with a best-in-class experience by transitioning Civic Secure Identity users to Civic Wallet.</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>Following the app store launch of Civic Wallet in June 2020, thousands of users have created Civic Wallets. Civic Wallet users love that their cryptocurrency is protected by our $1M Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee (see <a href="https://www.civic.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>) and is hassle-free, without the need to remember complicated passwords. In the words of one Civic Wallet reviewer: “[It’s]…the most secure way to store your crypto, guaranteed.”</p>



<p>Enhancing the value of Civic Wallet for our users is a top priority. This is why we’ve contacted many of our users to get their unfiltered feedback and improved our app to give them the features they need to make crypto easier. We were also proud in the second half of 2020 to expand our global coverage, which now includes 195 countries. Our customers live around the world, and Civic has them covered where they need to be.</p>



<p>We’ve also expanded Health Key by Civic, our health status verification service, which will help create safer working environments. Health Key by Civic is now available to help reopen daily life in any use case where health information is required for access, and across borders. This summer, Civic <a href="https://youtu.be/U4TnqeG_F5g">presented an overview</a> of the service to a forum convened by the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Sharing health status is easy for consumers, who can access Health Key by Civic through their Civic Wallet. With Covid, navigating border regulations has never been harder, but we’re making the process easier for businesses and other organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/k4C6lP62XFc">Our new demo video</a> and the recent <a href="https://beincrypto.com/vinny-lingham-on-civics-first-mover-advantage-in-health-verification/">deep-dive article</a> appearing in BeInCrypto help explain how the system works. Finally, we made strides in laying a strong foundation for <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/my-turn/2020/09/legislation-offers-solution-to-safely-store-covid-19-testing-data-critical-information/">future health status legislation</a> through our work with the State of California.</p>



<p>When we designed and launched Civic Wallet earlier this year, we took into account lessons learned from Civic Secure Identity to build a better, more flexible experience for users in Civic Wallet. With the improved user experience in place, we’ve <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-secure-identity-is-now-civic-wallet/">removed Civic Secure Identity</a> from app stores and asked our users to download Civic Wallet. By streamlining our processes, we’re better able to serve all of our users.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>During the second half, Civic was covered in a number of publications, including <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/08/24/crypto-mass-adoption">Cointelegraph</a>, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/civic-digital-identity-wallet-with-facial-biometrics-and-health-credential-launched">Biometric Update</a>, <a href="https://identityreview.com/civic-launches-digital-wallet-app-and-announces-proof-of-health-verification/">Identity Review</a>, and <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/06/162888-blockchain-powered-identity-payment-solutions-civic-launches-digital-wallet-out-of-private-beta/">Crowdfund Insider</a>. As a first-mover in the blockchain space for health status, Civic was also featured in an industry profile in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/safe-and-sound-blockchain-backed-digital-identity-in-the-post-coronavirus-era">Cointelegraph</a>. Civic CEO Vinny Lingham was also featured in podcasts and events, such as <a href="https://blockspeak.io/2020/09/04/blockspeak-episode-25-shark-dragons-civic/">Blockspeak</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://nicharalambous.com/blog/vinny-lingham-abundant-thinking">The Curious Cult</a> and <a href="https://blockdownconf.com/live_videos/blockdown-2-0-the-post-pandemic-economy-and-the-endless-reserve-funds/">Blockdown</a>.</p>



<p>What’s Next for Civic</p>



<p>As we take a look around the corner into 2021, Civic is already hitting the ground running with our stand-alone identity verification service for businesses, including more flexible options and pay-as-you-go pricing. Compliance has never been more critical than in 2020, where a remote world needs secure systems to work. Civic Identity Verification does just that by ensuring that commerce with customers is compliant across KYC, AML, GDPR, CCPA and HIPAA regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, we’re focused on enhancing the value of Civic Wallet for our users. As they continue to bring in and hold BTC, our users are assured knowing that their crypto is protected with a $1M Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee. We’ll be introducing more features in 2021 that are sure to appeal to our loyal users.</p>

 Diagnostic: Female livelihoods in the gig&nbsp;economy  Tensions and opportunities <p>Diagnostic is a series of essays and hosted conversations exploring the challenges of building more inclusive Digital economies. For hosted (virtual) conversations, like the one described below, Caribou Digital convenes a diverse set of experts and thought leaders with unique insights on an issue, and facilitates the exploration of a topic together.</p><p>For this conversation, we had 12 experts on women and platform work in emerging markets, ranging from those running platforms to donors, private sector, academia and advocacy. The conversation was under Chatham House rules so this is an edited summary of the key themes and not attributed to any one person. However, we have a list of names and resources discussed at the end of this&nbsp;piece.</p>A still from a promotional video for HelloTask, illustrating the importance of identity and professionalism What’s the landscape in a COVID-19&nbsp;world? <p>As we began our Diagnostic discussion, we acknowledged that COVID-19 illustrated the worst case scenario for many platform workers, and even more so for women. Research by Caribou Digital and Qhala in partnership with Mastercard Foundation has shown that platform work for women <a href="http://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender">holds many tensions</a>, and this has been further heightened by the lack of a safety net during COVID-19. The myth of flexible work may in many cases be no more than cheap labour in disguise, and self employment a way for employers to shift responsibility to workers. This can impact women more so than men. COVID-19 also brought home the reality (perhaps obvious) that women still carry most of household duties while also working, another flip side of flexibility which puts more strain on women trying to combine both kinds of&nbsp;work.</p><p>Below, we distill our discussion into three tensions, three actions and the way forward on women and platform work, especially in emerging economies.</p> The tensions of formal, flexible&nbsp;work <p>On the one hand, the formality of platforms was seen as a plus point. Being given an identity (e.g. a badge, a relationship) was something women valued, according to one platform provider. It had a similar appeal for the customer: “I think, people use a platform rather than go the traditional way for the responsibility a platform always takes. The way Uber verifies rides, indemnifies any problems users face and takes users’ feedback seriously…every platform should take the responsibility of ensuring a digital identity, verifying ID cards and including for finance”. However, too many restrictions have made platform work unfair. A <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/uber-made-big-promises-kenya-drivers-say-it-s-ruined-n1247964">report on Kenya</a>, for example, showed that drivers were “worse off” after the introduction of Uber. Platform lock-in can also be disadvantageous to the worker (for example, when a woman works across different companies or platforms… shouldn’t they be able to have ownership over their identity and ratings)?</p><p>Equally, in theory, platforms provide an opportunity for women’s emancipation, notably by providing “flexible” work, i.e. flexible hours, working from home etc. Yet, even pre-COVID,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/06/uber-rideshare-lyft-safety-crime"> many platforms fell short</a> of protecting their workers. Now, the flexibility benefits of platform work, especially for women, are being questioned, as a kind of “bogus self-employment”. From a gender perspective, real change is unclear. One participant stated that “platforms do nothing to change the gendered occupational segmentation that characterises offline labour markets around the&nbsp;world”.</p> Building identity…or having to fake&nbsp;it <p>What do platforms do regarding workers’ sense of identity? On the one hand, platforms provide a sense of identity and belonging: “helpers are motivated to work on HelloTask’s platforms because of the identity they get on our platform rather than working like a ghost.” On the other hand, workers can fake their identity to counter the racial or gender biases that exist on platforms. For example, some female workers in Kenya were adopting “white, male” identities to get (more) work, depending on the type of work. In some sectors, being a woman will be preferred, (e.g. beauticians, domestic work). So how much does one need to identify&nbsp;oneself?</p> Broad reach versus high-tech <p>Despite this significant opportunity for women’s emancipation mentioned above, how can we ensure we move beyond only higher skilled women having the opportunity for digital work? One study mentions the increasing integration of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7dUW9S519I&amp;amp%3Bfeature=youtu.be&amp;amp%3Bab_channel=DWMImpact">social commerce for female-headed small and medium enterprises</a>. However at the same time the risk of “too much tech” was brought forward — with a large part of potential gig workers (the “<a href="https://migrationology.com/jua-kali-kenyan-informal-labor-sector/">jua kali</a>” type workers, as described in Kenya’s informal economy) not being digitised, not having smartphones let alone computers.<a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/digital-gender-divide-wont-close-itself-heres-why"> Women are particularly affected by the digital ga</a>p, often only accessing feature phones and either unable to participate or participating through intermediaries, for example giving someone else’s contact number or bank account for payment, which increases the risk of dependence.</p> What are the priority actions and who is responsible for&nbsp;them? <p>Making platforms accessible to all — including the lower income and often unemployed communities, especially women was one of the key points. How to ensure that inclusion and who is responsible for it is a harder “hot potato” question. We agreed that platforms had a significant role to play, in some cases along with funders/investors, regulators/policy bodies, workers themselves and workers’ organisations.</p> More feature phone integration <p>One way of encouraging scale and inclusion is by integrating basic feature phone access to platform services. For example HelloTask used IVR to connect with domestic workers when there is a job for them as they rarely had smartphones. Similarly, using SMS and USSD services is key to ensuring platforms reach all workers — including at the last mile. However, there was skepticism on interest and investor funding on this: “I wonder what chances you’d get in 2020 at getting funding for an SMS-based service when most money seems to be drawn to the web and&nbsp;apps”.</p> Address analogue gaps such as&nbsp;ID <p>Women are particularly at risk of not having their own ID credentials resorting to their family’s ID (often father/brother) which raises a first question as to whether platforms can change the existing informal power relationships or do they leave them unchanged. Intertwined with ID requirements are payments and financial inclusion as not having an ID may often lead women to being financially excluded. Platforms’ payments structures <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02681102.2020.1818544">often do not favour workers</a>: “wage management and payment processes are set up for the convenience of the “employers” who are upper/middle class clients.” This not only limits access but also impacts on other issues such as credit scoring or financial independence. Platforms and digital financial service providers could push for these types of processes to be put in&nbsp;place.</p> Invest in education and&nbsp;training <p>Education and training of workers is required to ensure that they can fully leverage the opportunities platforms provide — especially in order to get more skilled and better paid gig work online. Currently, to fill the existing training and knowledge gaps, workers organically regroup on social media platforms to create self-help groups. However this may not be sufficient and women may not have the time or possibility to join these groups in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>Platforms seem to take on the responsibility of trust in the worker for the customer’s sake (e.g. vetting a domestic helper) but not necessarily being responsible for the worker’s health and safety or their training: “platforms avoid training as it can be used for a claim that they have misclassified independent contractors as employees/workers…this is why algorithmic control is preferred to explicit methods of control / direction / training in many&nbsp;cases”.</p> The way&nbsp;forward <p>As a group, we agreed that all stakeholders had a responsibility, especially platforms themselves — be it in training or security. Platform work should not just be work but meaningful and dignified work. This is obviously not just an emerging markets issue. Governments around the world — the Canadian government was mentioned as an example — and regulators do not always seem to know what to do as this is still a nascent area. As a whole, we could devise metrics on women’s inclusion and safety on platforms (see the work of the <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/">Fairwork Foundation</a> for example). One suggestion was that: “development agencies and investors could play the role of the regulator to ensure certain metrics are met when it comes to ensuring gender parity”. <a href="https://www.foodstersunited.ca/">Worker rights movements or organisations</a>, women’s rights bodies and unions could exert pressure. Private bodies such as <a href="http://perks.gg">Perks</a> could also create sustainable models for gig workers’ benefits for safety nets and guidance on how to ensure that platforms provide decent work to workers, in particular women. In short, there is still much work to be done on women and platform work worldwide, including in emerging&nbsp;markets.</p> Participants   Anjali Banthia,&nbsp;Tala  Dr. Jamie Woodcock, Open University, <a href="https://www.jamiewoodcock.net/">https://www.jamiewoodcock.net</a>  Jessica Colaço, Brave Venture&nbsp;Labs  Dr. Kathi Kitner, Payments, Google  Katie Highet, FinEquity, convened by&nbsp;CGAP  Ken Banks,&nbsp;Yoti  Mahmudul Hasan Likhon, HelloTask  Rani Deshpande, CGAP  Shikoh Gitau,&nbsp;Qhala  Shirley Mburu, BFA&nbsp;Global  Shyam Krishna, Royal Holloway, University of&nbsp;London  Dr. Tricia Williams, Mastercard Foundation  <p>Other participants chose to remain anonymous</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/female-livelihoods-in-the-gig-economy-tensions-and-opportunities-f14982b6aaad">Female livelihoods in the gig economy: tensions and opportunities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>*SATIRE WARNING*</p>
      
<p>Everyone likes a good hacker flick. And ever since Mr Robot wrapped up there’s been a void in quality infosec dramas.</p>
      
<p>The good news is January 2021 is shaping up to be a strong month for cybersecurity rom-coms and hacker action movies. Here’s a peek at what’s coming to Hulu throughout the month of January.</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
<p>Passwords on a Plane <br>An FBI agent boards a flight from Boston to San Francisco, escorting the country’s most wanted script kiddie. As he tries to connect to the $49 WiFi, our hero finds out the hardcoded password has been changed – and no one knows what it is. Panic ensues at 30,000 feet as hundreds of Bay Area residents become suddenly unable to access Slack or Gmail. Can they band together to crack one WiFi password?</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
<p>13 Going On 30 Character Passwords <br>In this feel-good fairy tale, a teenage security engineer dreams about starting a company to eliminate passwords. Suddenly, her secret desire becomes a reality and she is transformed into a 30-year-old Cybersecurity CEO. But entrepreneurship, with its own set of growing pains, isn’t as easy as it sounds…</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
<p>Locked Up<br>Some guy forgets his laptop password. This Seth Rogen classic needs no introduction.</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
<p>Crazy Rich Vendors <br>A CISO is eager to accompany her best friend, a startup founder, to the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/apj">RSA Conference in Singapore</a>. She’s also shocked to learn that his company is worth billions, and he has spent the entire marketing budget on the event. Thrown into the chaos of the world’s biggest security conference, the two of them must fight through family, friends, and founders to prove that it’s worth spending $5,000,000 on a booth.</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
<p>Mission Impossible: Password Protocol <br>Blamed for a phishing email attack on the Kremlin, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team are disavowed by their top software reseller. Forced to go “off the grid” — Hunt must somehow clear their name and prevent another large-scale password reset. You won’t believe the twist in this Oscar-nominated thriller. </p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
<p>Not Another Hacker Movie <br>An aspiring DevOps engineer who wears paint-splattered overalls is outcast by her peers for rebelling against the use of Kubernetes. The team that brought you American Spy is back with this lighthearted comedy and a large array of zany takes on cybersecurity!&nbsp;</p>

  <p>So here’s the story. A nation-state attacks a technology company, leveraging a backdoor in a piece of software to infect computers. Then using the infected machines as jumping-off points to move laterally across what was previously thought to be a secure network, the threat actors take aim at targets of interest to the U.S. government. You may think I am talking about the SolarWinds hack. In fact, I am talking about the 2009 attacks on Google and at least 20 other technology companies commonly known as <a href="https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/operation-aurora">Operation Aurora</a>.</p>

<p>Operation Aurora exposed what many of us already knew – that securing the perimeter of a network through firewalls left the heart of the network vulnerable. A single compromised node on a secure network can put all protected resources at risk, especially when faced with the reality that it’s a challenge to secure every endpoint. Google published an approach that would address this, known as BeyondCorp. It moved the perimeter from the edge of the network to each application and treated every application as unprotected, as if it were connected directly to the internet and needed to be secured with authentication and authorization. BeyondCorp assumes that no user or device can be trusted until it has been evaluated. This approach is better known as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a>, or what Gartner calls CARTA (Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment).&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is so much we still don’t know about this latest attack and the damage it has done, but what we do know is chilling. Nation-state hackers, believed by experts to be from Russia, used SolarWinds’ build system to infiltrate their digital supply chain, which was used to deliver software updates. They then distributed a “security update'' that included a backdoor. A follow-on “security update” leveraged the backdoor to add a malicious payload to a select group of targets. Once those devices were compromised, they were used to deliver additional malware and move laterally across the network to attack other systems.</p>

<p>It’s easy to hear the echoes of these two attacks over a decade apart. It shows us that history repeats itself and will continue to if we don’t break the cycle. Cybercriminals exposed more than <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/2020-consumer-identity-breach-report">5 billion records in 2019</a>, costing U.S. organizations over $1.2 trillion. It also shows us that many of the answers to this challenge exist today.</p>

<p>With more than 20 years of industry experience, I look at most things through an identity lens. When you spend years using hammers, a lot of things look like nails. However, the reality is that some problems are uniquely nail shaped. That is why I see a layered, identity-centric approach that builds on the principles of Zero Trust and BeyondCorp as our best answer to prevent malicious actors from obtaining the initial foothold within an environment as well as reducing the possibility of further lateral attacks. With this model, you can:</p>

  Minimize attack surface by leveraging modern Privileged Access Management (PAM) and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance and administration (IGA</a>) techniques. This means enlisting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to understand and manage appropriate levels of access. By limiting users’ access to the bare minimum needed to do their jobs, risk can be dramatically reduced. According to our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-consumer-identity-breach-report-us-breaches-cost-over-18-trillion">2020 ForgeRock Consumer Identity Breach Report</a>, unauthorized access was the most common attack vector used in 2019, responsible for 40% of all breaches. 
	 Monitor user and device behavior to create a baseline for “normal” behavior so that anomalous and risky behaviors can be flagged and analyzed quickly and at scale. This is often referred to as user and entity behavioral analysis (UEBA) and is another opportunity to enlist the help of AI and ML. These behavioral changes may be subtle – for instance accessing systems that aren’t typically accessed, logging in at times that don’t make sense, or moving more data than usual. They can also be distinctive at the technology layer by requiring automation and AI to define, and make visible such as logging in from multiple IP's with disparate geographical locations. If an organization understands how a user or device typically behaves, they can quickly address a compromised system before the threat can move laterally across a secure network, dramatically reducing the risk of this type of attack. 
	 It may be cliché to say that identity is the new perimeter, but if the perimeter moves to each application, the existence of a firewall becomes moot. Scalable technology that can continually validate device posture, user authorization, and authentication is a game changer to preventing a compromised device or user from doing damage via lateral attack. 
	 A compromised system is a perfect place to steal usernames and passwords – those credentials can be used to access and attack other systems. This is why <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless</a> and multi-factor authentication (MFA) can eliminate a massive attack vector leveraged in lateral attacks.&nbsp; 
 <p>There is no silver bullet to solving these problems, and hackers will continue to get more sophisticated. However, the recommendation represents concrete steps that CISOs and other security executives can take to mitigate risks. When we encounter a problem, it is human nature to try to find a new tool to deal with it. But sometimes, the tool has been there all along (or for about ten years).</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>Attending AWS re:Invent is always an exceptional experience and, despite it being virtual, this year was no different. As usual, there were the expected announcements of bigger better and faster services and components. AWS always shows a remarkable level of innovation with many more announcements than it is practical to cover comprehensively. Therefore, in this blog, I will focus on what I think are some of the highlights in the areas of hybrid IT, edge computing, machine learning as well as security and compliance.</p>
<p>There is an old adage – “Keep it Simple Stupid” and this is excellent advice. In his keynote, Andy Jassy described the need for organization to avoid complexity in order to achieve agility. This is the thinking that lies behind how AWS is evolving its services towards platforms focussed on simplifying the solutions to real-world problems. Jassy also described how he believes the definition of the hybrid cloud needs to be rethought.</p>
 Hybrid IT 
<p>What now exists in most organizations is a complex mixture of IT services some delivered on-premises and some delivered through the cloud. This is currently defined as hybrid IT.</p>
<p>However, there is now an increase in computing outside of the data centre and at the edge where much of the useful data exists. In addition, advanced networking capabilities provided by technologies like 5G will increase access to this data as well as augment the possibilities for remote control and automation.</p>
<p>In his keynote, Jassy stated that people have become too settled on the definition of hybrid as meaning on-premises plus cloud. AWS’s vision is that there are now so many IT components outside of the data centre, in offices, factories, on ships and elsewhere that cloud plus the edge will become the dominant elements in the future IT infrastructure. This is a vision for clouds of things being the infrastructure for the organization of tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, managing and securing this increasingly complex set of services, upon which the world has now become dependent, are now the critical factor. Just consider the impact of the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55299779">short Google outage</a> with people complaining that they could not switch the lights on in their home.</p>
 Edge Computing 
<p>Given the importance placed on this area by Jassy, there were several announcements.</p>
<p>Like other vendors, AWS offers a “cloud in a box” which the customer can deploy wherever it is needed. There may be several reasons that customers choose this including proximity to data, compliance related to service/data location, and network latency. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/1u-2u/">AWS announced that AWS Outposts will be offered in 2 new sizes</a>, including a smaller size in 2 flavours Graviton / Intel.</p>
<p>AWS says that they now have thousands of customers using this. One key benefit of this product is that it enables the full range of Machine Learning services close to where they may be needed. Since most of this is managed by AWS, it effectively extends the cloud to wherever it is located. However, beware - this introduces some extra customer responsibilities – for physical security, power and local infrastructure as shown in figure 1. It therefore adds a little more complexity to the already complex hybrid management challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Customer responsibilities for IaaS and Cloud on Premises</p>
<p>IoT is an important element of AWS’s vision of this new hybrid IT environment and there were several announcements in this area. AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-iot-greengrass-2-0-provides-open-source-edge-runtime-capabilities-building-operating-iot-device-software/">IoT Greengrass release 2.0 is now available</a> - this provides an open-source edge runtime, which includes a set of pre-built software components, tools for local software development, and new features for managing device software on large fleets of devices.</p>
<p>Another area is integration with 5G to achieve very low network latency. AWS achieves this through what they call “Local Zones”. Here AWS infrastructure is deployed closer to large population, industry, and IT centres where no AWS region exists. &nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/announcing-preview-of-aws-local-zones-in-boston-houston-and-miami/">AWS announced a preview of AWS Local Zones</a> in Boston, Houston, and Miami, with plans to launch 12 additional AWS Local Zones throughout 2021 in key metro areas in the United States including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York. There are currently no plans for these in Europe.</p>
<p>5G is not the only communication type supported. AWS also announced AWS IoT Core for <a href="https://lora-alliance.org/">LoRaWAN</a>, a fully managed capability that allows AWS IoT Core customers to connect and manage wireless devices that use low-power long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) connectivity with the AWS cloud. It enables them to set up a private LoRaWAN network by connecting their own LoRaWAN devices and gateways to the AWS cloud - without developing or operating a LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS).</p>
 Industrial Edge 
<p>AWS says that their innovation always follows customer demands and so it is interesting to note how AWS is expanding their services with a focus on an industrial plant.</p>
<p>AWS announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/announcing-amazon-lookout-for-equipment-a-service-which-detects-abnormal-equipment-behavior-and-enable-predictive-maintenance/">Amazon Lookout for Equipment</a>, a service which provides a way for customers with existing sensors on their industrial equipment, to send their sensor data to AWS to build machine learning models and return predictions to detect abnormal equipment behaviour. This enables predictive maintenance that allows them to act before machine failures occur and avoid unplanned downtime.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-announces-amazon-lookout-for-vision-to-automate-quality-inspection/">Amazon Lookout for Vision</a> is a new machine learning service to find visual defects in industrial products, accurately and at scale. It uses computer vision to identify missing components in products, damage to vehicles or structures, irregularities in production lines, and even minuscule defects in silicon wafers — or any other physical item where quality is important.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/announcing-aws-iot-sitewise-edge-preview/">AWS announced AWS IoT SiteWise Edge (Preview)</a>, a new feature of AWS IoT SiteWise providing software that runs on-premises at industrial sites and makes it easy to collect, process, and monitor equipment data locally before sending the data to AWS Cloud destinations.</p>
 Machine Learning 
<p>In line with AWS’s intentions to make it simpler to use their services, several new useful tools have now been now fully integrated into Amazon SageMaker.</p>
<p>One interesting example is the announcement of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/detect-bias-in-ml-models-and-explain-model-behavior-with-amazon-sagemaker-clarify/">Amazon SageMaker Clarify</a> to help machine learning developers achieve greater visibility into their training data and models so they can identify and limit bias and explain predictions.</p>
<p>Training machine learning models is hard because a neural network does not provide an explanation of why a conclusion was reached. In addition, this also makes it difficult to ensure that the neural network has not been trained on biased data. There are mathematical models from game theory that can help in this area – notably the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value">Shapely values</a> that help to show the relative contribution made by different elements. The challenge is that some of the tools available are not robust or well-integrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Amazon SageMaker Clarify provides an integrated approach to detect potential bias during data preparation, after training, and in the deployed model by examining attributes specified. SageMaker Clarify also includes feature importance graphs that help to explain model predictions and produces reports that can be used to identify issues with the model that can then be corrected.</p>
 Security and Compliance 
<p>Stephen Schmidt AWS CISO in his keynote reviewed the AWS security capabilities that customers had found most impactful during 2020. Top of this list was <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/s3_detection.html">Amazon Guard Duty S3 Protection</a>. This emphasizes the importance organizations place on taking care of their data how the first sign of a cyber-attack is often unusual access to data.</p>
<p>While AWS take great care to secure the service that they deliver organizations still have concerns over how they can prove that their use of the service meets their security objectives and compliance obligations.</p>
<p>This often involves manually collecting and collating evidence from multiple sources to respond to queries from internal and external auditors. To simplify this process AWS announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-announces-aws-audit-manager/">AWS Audit Manager</a>.</p>
<p>This is a new service that helps to continuously audit AWS usage to assess risk and to demonstrate compliance with regulations and industry standards. It automates the collection of evidence on whether the controls are operating and effective. It includes predefined templates for common compliance needs such as CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).</p>
<p>It is expected that internal and external auditors will be the main users of this service.</p>
 My Opinion 
<p>AWS has a unique approach to innovation with a very strong focus on providing what the customer wants. Accepting the need for simplification in the complex world of IT services is very welcome and the announcements show how AWS is achieving this for its platform.</p>
<p>AWS’s alternative vision for the hybrid cloud recognises that the future of the IoT is inescapably linked with the cloud. The IoT will actually become the clouds of things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, while it is right to emphasize this aspect of hybrid IT for the future, today many organizations are struggling today with the problems of securing and managing their mixture of SaaS, IaaS and on-premises services and a solution to this problem is urgently needed.</p>
<p>The release of AWS SageMaker Clarify provides a useful out of the box solution for some of the current challenges of bias and explanation related to machine learning. However, while it provides a robust implementation of the state of the art in this area, it does not provide a revolutionary solution.</p>
<p>AWS Audit Manager will provide welcome capabilities for organizations to reduce the costs of demonstrating the effectiveness of their AWS controls and how these are meeting their compliance obligations. The challenges of doing this for the whole heterogeneous IT stack involved in many business-critical applications remain to be solved.</p>

 What is a JWT? 
 
 
<p>A JWT is a structured security token format used to encode JSON data. The main reason to use JWT is to exchange JSON data in a way that can be cryptographically verified. There are two types of JWTs:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>JSON Web Signature (JWS)</p>
 
 
<p>JSON Web Encryption (JWE)</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The data in a JWS is public—meaning anyone with the token can read the data—whereas a JWE is encrypted and private.  To read data contained within a JWE, you need both the token and a secret key.</p>
 
 
<p>When you use a JWT, it’s usually a JWS. The 'S' (the signature) is the important part and allows the token to be validated.  For the rest of this post, I will talk about the JWS format and walk through decoding an example JWT.</p>
 
 
 
 
 How JWTs Are Used 
 
 
<p>OAuth 2.0 identity providers (IdP) commonly use JWTs for <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/">access tokens</a>. You may have seen an HTTP request with an authorization header that looks like this:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSm9lIENvZGVyIn0.5dlp7GmziL2QS06sZgK4mtaqv0_xX4oFUuTDh1zHK4U</code> 
 
 
 






JWT access tokens are NOT part of the OAuth 2.0 specification, but almost all IdPs support them.



 
 
<p>Using a JWT (actually a JWS) allows the token to be validated locally, without making an HTTP request back to the IdP, thereby increasing your application’s performance.  Applications can make use of data inside the token, further reducing expensive HTTP calls and database lookups.</p>
 
 
 
 
 JWT Structure 
 
 
<p>A JWS (the most common type of JWT) contains three parts separated by a dot (<code>.</code>). The first two parts (the "header" and "payload") are Base64-URL encoded JSON, and the third is a cryptographic signature.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s look at an example JWT:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSm9lIENvZGVyIn0.5dlp7GmziL2QS06sZgK4mtaqv0_xX4oFUuTDh1zHK4U</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Breaking this down into the individual sections we have:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9 # header
.
eyJuYW1lIjoiSm9lIENvZGVyIn0 # payload
.
5dlp7GmziL2QS06sZgK4mtaqv0_xX4oFUuTDh1zHK4U #signature</code> 
 
 
 






If you have a JWT with more than three sections, it’s probably a JWE.



 
 
<p>Next, each of the first two sections are base64-url decoded:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{"alg":"HS256"} # header
.
{"name":"Joe Coder"} # payload
.
5dlp7GmziL2QS06sZgK4mtaqv0_xX4oFUuTDh1zHK4U #signature</code> 
 
 
 






On macOS  (with "coreutils" installed), you can base64-url decode the strings on the command line with: <code>echo eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9 | gbasenc -d --base64url</code>



 
 
<p>The last section in the JWT, the signature, is also base64-url encoded, but it’s just binary data; if you try to decode it, you will end up with non-displayable characters:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>��i�i�￹�￹KN�f￹�￹֪�O�_￹R��￹\�+￹</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can use a tool like <code>hexdump</code> to view the signatures content:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>$ echo "5dlp7GmziL2QS06sZgK4mtaqv0_xX4oFUuTDh1zHK4U=" | gbasenc -d --base64url | hexdump

0000000 e5 d9 69 ec 69 b3 88 bd 90 4b 4e ac 66 02 b8 9a
0000010 d6 aa bf 4f f1 5f 8a 05 52 e4 c3 87 5c c7 2b 85</code> 
 
 
 
 JWT Claims 
 
<p>Once you start using JWTs you start hearing the word "claim" everywhere. A JWT claim is a key/value pair in a JSON object.  In the example above, <code>"name": "Joe Coder"</code>, the claim key is <code>name</code> and the value is <code>Joe Coder</code>. The value of a claim can be any JSON object.</p>
 
 
<p>There are three types of claims: "registered," "public," and "private." You can find the list of registered and public claims in the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml#claims">official IANA Registry</a>.  You can also add any other custom claim to a JWT; these are known as "private claims."</p>
 
 






When using private claims, watch out for name collisions with the official claims.



 
 
<p>The use of registered claims is optional, but when they are present, they MUST be validated.  For example, a JWT may contain date-time fields that describe when the token is valid.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Issued At (<code>iat</code>) - The time the JWT was created</p>
 
 
<p>Expiration Time (<code>exp</code>) - The time at which the JWT is no longer valid</p>
 
 
<p>Not Before (<code>nfb</code>) - The earliest time the JWT would be valid</p>
 
 
 
 






Timestamps are "seconds since the epoch" integer format. JWT libraries usually add up to a few minutes of leeway to these values to account for clock skew between systems.



 
 
 
 JWT Header 
 
<p>The header of a JWT contains information about how the token was created.  In my example, the "algorithm" (<code>alg</code>) claim is set to <code>HS256</code>, which specifies the hashing algorithm HMAC SHA-256 is used to generate or validate the signature.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
  "alg": "HS256"
}</code> 
 
 
 






A JWT signature can be disabled by setting the algorithm claim to <code>none</code>. Using the <code>none</code> algorithm should be avoided; see the <a>Problems with JWT</a> section below.



 
 
 
 JWT Signature 
 
<p>The JWT specifications list a few different signing algorithms; each of these algorithms works slightly different. For simplicity’s sake, there are two types of algorithms:
- HMAC based shared secret, these all start with the prefix <code>HS</code>, which stands for HMAC SHA)
- Public key pair (either RSA or ECDSA keys)</p>
 
 






Caution is needed when using a shared secret, as anyone with the secret can create (or forge) new JWTs. If you need to validate a JWT from an untrusted client (web-page, mobile app, etc.), use a public key pair instead.



 
 
<p>The JWT in this example (actually a JWS, remember the 'S' stands for "signature") uses the <code>HS256</code> algorithm.  To validate the JWS, calculate the HMAC of the first two parts of the token, then compare the output with the base64-url decoded signature.</p>
 
 
<p>On the command line, you can use <code>openssl</code> to check the signature:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>echo -n 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSm9lIENvZGVyIn0' | \
openssl dgst -sha256 -macopt hexkey:${secret_key_in_hex} -mac hmac -binary | \
gbasenc --base64url | sed 's/=//'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If the output matches the original signature block, the signature is valid.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Problems with JWTs 
 
 
<p>Fully validating a JWT is MUCH more complex than running a couple CLI commands. There are many edge cases and exploits; you should ALWAYS use a trusted JWT library and keep it up to date.</p>
 
 






Visit <a href="https://token.dev">token.dev</a> to debug JWTs from within your browser!



 
 
<p>One of the biggest problems with the JWT, is the signature verification to be disabled by setting the algorithm header claim to <code>none</code>. Many JWT library vulnerabilities have been related to the <code>none</code> algorithm.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJuYW1lIjoiSm9lIENvZGVyIn0.</code> 
 
 
 
<p>When base64-url decoded this JWT contains the same information as the original example (minus the signature):</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{"alg":"none"}
.
{"name":"Joe Coder"}
.</code> 
 
 
 
<p>There is nothing secure about this example because it’s missing the signature; it cannot be cryptographically verified.</p>
 
 






Avoid using the <code>none</code> algorithm.  When possible, configure your JWT library to only allow a specific list of algorithms.



 
 
 
 
 Learn More About JWT 
 
 
<p>When used correctly, JWT can help with both authorization and transferring data between two parties.  As with all security topics, it’s not a generic solution; deciding to use JWTs is often a security vs. performance trade-off.  Validating a token locally does NOT check if it has been revoked, e.g., a user has logged out or has been deleted. Keeping the life span of the token short (by setting the "expiration" claim) can help mitigate the risk.</p>

In four different IAM future scenarios, which can be viewed separately, we will understand how life under total surveillance feels for Julia. In times where identity chaos prevails, we can see what it means when Julia can no longer be sure about her digital identity, with only her physical identity being certain. In a world dominated by mega corporations Julia‘s experiences with her employer show us the far-reaching significance and influence such corporations have gained in relation to IAM.

<p>Digital transformation is everywhere. It is used to describe so many things that it risks losing its meaning, and with it, the potential for a common approach to supporting it in pursuit of equitable, sustainable development. We’re sharing this blog, then, as part of defining this important area.</p><p>Digital transformation should include both the processes and outcomes of mindful, intentional, and shapeable efforts that lead to intended, prosocial effects. Definitions of digital transformation at the firm level tend to focus on existing or new business models. For McKinsey, it is to “<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-transformation-improving-the-odds-of-success#">enable existing business models by integrating advanced technologies</a>,” while for Salesforce, it’s “<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/what-is-digital-transformation/">using digital technologies to create new — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences</a>.”</p><p>Definitions at the national level tend to take a broader perspective. The European Commission characterizes digital transformation as “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/policy/advanced-technologies_en">a fusion of advanced technologies and the integration of physical and digital systems</a>.” The OECD defines it as “t<a href="https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264312012-en">he economic and societal effects of digitization and digitalization</a>.” This is important; while the first three definitions focus on process, the last focuses on effects and the consequences of these significant changes.</p><p>Development-focused definitions emphasize this outcome-focused perspective but highlight challenges and risk. The Pathways Commission at Oxford University cautions that “<a href="https://bsg-pathwaystoprosperity.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/The_Digital_Roadmap.pdf">The use of digital technologies will not automatically lead to the inclusion of the poor and marginalized</a>.” UNCTAD points to the <a href="https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/der2019_en.pdf">challenge of measuring the broader national digital economy</a> and emphasizes how digital transformation is “<a href="https://unctad.org/topic/ecommerce-and-digital-economy/ungis-dialogue#:~:text=In%20this%20context%2C%20the%20United,UNGIS%20presents%20for%20more%20effective">highlighting the significant divides that exist.</a>” The United Nations Foundation Digital Impact Alliance, having reviewed over 30 frameworks, concludes that “<a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/accelerating-national-digital-transformation-announcing-the-first-in-dials-new-series-of-leadership-briefs/">more work is required to attempt an overarching articulation of the most important elements</a>” of digital transformation. This blog is a contribution to this continuing effort.</p><p>We believe that the emphasis on transformation as both process and effects is particularly important, especially as although digitization and digitalization are well underway, accelerated by the response to COVID-19 (remote working, payments, etc.), these are not inevitable processes. They are the results of human decisions. Similarly, the effects of these are not inevitable, either. We agree that technologies <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1940761.1940772">amplify</a> intent, and left unchecked, digital transformation may amplify the most powerful, strengthening autocracy and dystopia. With strategic engagement and clear intention, it is possible to build ethical and inclusive digital economies, societies, and politics that mitigate risk and prioritize protection.</p><p>Digital transformation that works for all requires values-based intentional focus on the promises of this new era and mindfulness to mitigate their perils. The following five considerations are insights that help us ensure we are intentional in our support to governments, donors, and other partners in their work to ensure digital transformation prioritizes people, protects fundamental rights, and promotes equality of opportunity.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/five-reflections-on-five-years-cc63120363d2">Digital transformation as development in a digital age</a>. Since we made this phrase central to our work in 2016, we’ve only become more convinced that while digital is fundamental to processes of change in politics, economy, and society, the emphasis needs to be not on digital but on the changes and developmental outcomes. It is vital to recognize that this is not simply focusing on technology to drive changes, and that there are particular characteristics and challenges to achieve developmental goals in a digital age. As we wrote for one donor, “Digital transformation introduces new risks as well as opportunities,” so building inclusive, ethical transformation demands engaging “<a href="https://link.medium.com/ZfiwxERgubb">with complex, nuanced concepts around agency, literacy, power, and structure in the digital&nbsp;age.</a>”  <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/five-reflections-on-five-years-cc63120363d2">Digital transformation requires an ecosystem approach</a>. Most digital development projects still exist in sectoral silos and/or are driven by a relentlessly optimistic approach to “connecting the last billion.” This is despite all the evidence pointing to the significant cross-cutting — both negative and positive — impacts of digital technologies on economies and societies as the excellent<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2016"> 2016 World Development Report</a> on “Digital Dividends” laid out. We have found it helpful to firstly define and bind <a href="https://www.digitaldevelopment.org/digital-ecosystems">digital ecosystems</a>, at the national or firm level, for example, and to engage at this level — for example, on mapping a <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/five-reflections-on-five-years-cc63120363d2">digital identity</a> or on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-57878-5_4">entrepreneurial ecosystems</a>. Although the map is not the territory, it is vital to know the terrain before plotting a course to successfully reach your&nbsp;goal.  Digital transformation must be inclusive, leave no one behind, and prioritize the protection of vulnerable communities. Otherwise, at best, it will leave them behind, or at worse, it will increase vulnerability and exclusion. The promise of digital transformation in terms of added value to government and the economy are increasingly recognized, but there is a growing realization of the harms these transformations can bring, particularly on the most vulnerable. We have found that for groups such as <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/report-launch-identity-at-the-margins-identification-systems-for-refugees-69466244fa62">refugees</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/why-is-id-important-for-women/home">women</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">informal, gig, and platform</a> workers, there are increased risks to privacy, personal protection, and secure jobs that enable social wellbeing — not forgetting the risks to <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/unbundling-the-imaginary-community-adf1eb7e5ea8">political process and social polarization</a>. In supporting clients to develop digital transformation strategies, we have emphasized the importance of incorporating “responsible digital” and “digital inclusion” as critical components of strategy to support ethical and inclusive digital transformation.  Digital transformation should be integrative, not additive. In our work with partners, we are often asked to develop a digital program — building a new team and developing a program of work. We have found that to effectively influence the arc of digital transformation, development outcomes can be better achieved if programs and organizations incorporate digital into existing teams, programs, and work. We advised on ways that <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-and-management-information-systems-for-humanitarian-and-social-protection-response-b1b25e5623a2">digital information systems might enable humanitarian to social protection transitions</a> while emphasizing protection and security. We worked with Oxfam to help their team conceptualize, develop, and sustain an <a href="https://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-approach/ict-in-programme]">approach that emphasized digital</a> technologies that “<a href="https://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-approach/ict-in-programme]">are not an end in themselves; but&nbsp;…integrated into existing programs</a>.”  Digital transformation requires leadership and ownership. All change is hard, and without leadership, it is often sidelined and withers. Efforts to direct digital transformation are no different, and require leadership to own and push for the changes that are required. Globally, efforts such as the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a> provide helpful normative framings. With national governments, we’ve found it to be critical to identify champions who take ownership and invest political capital in attaining success. However, champions cannot be isolated figures. One international development donor that we supported in developing a team of digital champions found they were unable to gain traction because they had no ownership over the processes they tried to influence.  <p>There are many different interests advancing the processes and effects of digital transformations, but for these to lead to inclusive development outcomes requires purposeful, intentional, and considered engagement. This will be particularly important as the challenges of equitable progress, social inclusion, and climate change place ever greater demands on the international community and its capacity to&nbsp;respond.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/transformation-in-a-digital-age-9068338fd778">Transformation in a Digital Age</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We invited everyone to join us for a Demo Day to learn about the company, meet the Fission team, and share everything we've built in the past year. We shared our technical building blocks and the roadmap that we have planned. We ended with demos of apps built on our platform so far.</p> Fission: Fast App Publishing Platform <p>Fission is building an app publishing platform that supports developers in building great apps, connecting to users, and getting app makers paid.</p><p>Rather than "just" being next-gen cloud infrastructure and technology that powers great apps, we're saying that the Fission platform will help developers reach their ultimate goal of building an app: having app users, and having those users support the app.</p><p>In short:</p> <p>🚢&nbsp;Ship Apps, 🗣&nbsp;Talk to Users, 💵&nbsp;Make Money</p> <p>Is that too bold or blunt? We are a platform that supports developers, and ensuring that digital makers are successful means that more great software can get built.</p><p>Here are some of the further themes, movements, and beliefs we're thinking about:</p> Open Collective <p>Fission is now a <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission">Fiscal Host on Open Collective</a>. We are doing this in order to work closely with open source developers that want to work together with their users to build and maintain apps sustainably over time.</p><p>We are also placing our own open source software on Open Collective, starting with Fission Drive.</p>Try <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission Drive »</a><p>The <a href="https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive/contribute/drive-23617">Drive+ membership tier</a> is an annual support tier that supports building out Drive and the associated Fission account. Backers get special badges on our Discord chat and Discourse forums, will have members-only access to communication channels, including voting on features and other opportunities. Drive+ members will also get a one year Fission Premium account when we launch support for it.</p><p>If you like what we're doing, and want to support more of it, <a href="https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive/contribute/drive-23617">sign up for Drive+ »</a></p><p>Thank you so much to <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1339652057049911296">Gyuri</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1339688618726584320">Helder</a>, <a href="https://brianginsburg.com/">Brian</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1339659752393961473?s=20">Omo Earth</a> team for being backers on the very first day. We appreciate your early support in this!</p> Full Demo Day Video <p>The full 2 hour video is split into chapters so you can jump to different sections. We'll be sharing smaller portions of the video after a little bit of editing.</p><p><a href="https://noti.st/events/n1BLwS/fission-demo-day-december-2020">Slides are available on Notist »</a></p> Open Source Collaboration <p>We are very proud of all the technical building blocks we've shipped so far, and have had some early discussions with other teams about adopting some of the protocols we've defined. During Demo Day, it was fantastic to hear that a lot of you want to get more involved!</p><p>We've scheduled a community kick off meeting to work on the WNFS Database layer for January 7th, 2021. <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/wnfs-db-api-aka-wndb-research-design-session/1335">Full details on the forum</a>, please <a href="https://airtable.com/shrKyfvfigz8PpNGV">RSVP » </a></p> <p>Thank you to everyone that joined us. It was great to see you and we really appreciate your interest and the excitement you showed. The team has put a lot of work into what we've shipped so far, and we can't wait to see what you build with Fission.</p><p>We shared and announced a lot during this one event, so we'll be posting more from the event over the next week. We wish everyone a restful time as we head into the winter holidays, and look forward to more in 2021!</p>

<p>Firstly, I hope you’re keeping well and looking forward to the holiday season. This has been a difficult year for many, but I’m pleased to say progress has continued unabated here at Nuggets. In fact, we’ve made some significant strides&nbsp;forward.</p><p>We’ve all been working remotely for the past 10 months, with no in-person events since early March. But everyone has adapted well, and the pandemic restrictions haven’t held us&nbsp;back.</p><p>Looking back at some of the highlights from the last 12 months, I’m extremely proud of what we’ve been able to achieve — and enormously excited for&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Here’s a quick&nbsp;recap…</p><p>Product</p>  Our big product news this year was the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nuggets-pay-id/id1216139887">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=life.nuggets.app">Android</a> releases across Europe in May, and shortly after in Australia. This was a huge step for us: making Nuggets available to any business that wants to protect its customer data. Now, anyone can enjoy the privacy, security and simplicity of&nbsp;Nuggets.  We also launched <a href="https://merchandise.nuggets.life/">our own demo store</a>, which allows businesses to test the platform in a live environment. Any business can download Nuggets and experience the onboarding, log in and payment flows — without sharing or storing their data. It gives potential partners a full overview of exactly how the platform works, and allows them to run through the user experience.  Our engineering team grew this year — and will again in 2021. As always, there’s been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes.The team has been hard at work on UI/UX, infrastructure and architecture updates, continually improving the platform’s resilience, robustness and functionality. This puts us in a great position for the exciting things we have lined up for&nbsp;2021.  In June we created a <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xeab7e907e01203bf0b823dbe135b151921b74568">liquidity pool for NUG on Uniswap</a>, meaning NUG is now available to swap with any other ERC20 token available on the platform.  <p>Partnerships and memberships</p>  We announced our commercial partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions in November, after working with them for some time. This is a big one. LexisNexis is one of the world’s largest protectors of private and confidential data, and one of the biggest risk and fraud companies in the world. And this partnership has huge, positive implications for us. Specifically, we’re working together to deliver self-sovereign digital identity (SSI) solutions for existing and prospective customers. <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/new-nuggets-partnership-with-lexisnexis-risk-solutions-769fa676de0">There’s more on this on Alastair’s blog</a>.  We joined the<a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/"> Open Identity Exchange</a> (OIX) earlier this year, complementing our existing membership of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>. Formed in 2010 to address the increasing challenges of building trust in online identity, OIX is uniquely dedicated to ID Trust. As a member, we’re collaborating on thought leadership initiatives and getting involved in sector-specific working groups. Fellow members include companies such as Barclays, Microsoft, LexisNexis and HSBC. We’ll also be able to support pilot projects, working alongside other members. For more on OIX, read <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/were-now-members-the-open-identity-exchange-89424eb77ad8">my blog from September</a>.  <p>Awards and recognition</p><p>We’ve done well on this score in the past, and thought last year would be hard to beat. Little did we know! We don’t celebrate these accolades just to show off — they’re important evidence of the impact we’re&nbsp;making.</p><p>Let’s start with the&nbsp;awards:</p>  Most recently, we won ‘<a href="https://www.emergingpaymentsawards.com/2020-winners">Best Use of Blockchain in Financial Services</a>’ at the Emerging Payments&nbsp;Awards  We won ‘<a href="https://www.retail-systems.com/awards/winners20.php">Mobile Innovation of the Year</a>’ at the Retail Systems Awards, and ‘<a href="https://www.payments-awards.com/awards/winners20.php">Security Innovation of the Year</a>’ at the Payments Awards — where we were nominated for five awards in&nbsp;total.  Nuggets also won the <a href="https://youtu.be/AemOOIByaQg">Women in Payments Unicorn Challenge</a>, where I got to showcase the platform to a panel of judges from Santander, JP Morgan and American Express. Competing against five other fintechs, we were especially proud to win both the main judges’ award and the audience choice&nbsp;award.  On a personal note, I was honoured to receive some individual awards this year, including <a href="https://techplaymakerawards.com/last-years-awards/seema-khinda-johnson">Entrepreneur of the Year at the Booking.com Technology Playmaker Awards</a>, and the <a href="https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2020/2020-female-fintech-competition-winner-announced-en-11710.htm">Female FinTech Competition 2020</a> held by Atos, Deutsche Bank, Google and TechQuartier.  <p>We were nominated for other awards&nbsp;too:</p>  We were named as one of the 10 Best Payments Startups globally in Efma-Capgemini’s Financial NewTech Challenge 2020  We were nominated for ‘Best Enterprise Security Product’ at Computing.co.uk’s Technology Product Awards, and were up for a Financial Services Forum’s Product and Service Innovation Award, in the Security&nbsp;category  <p>There was plenty of high-profile recognition for Nuggets&nbsp;too:</p>  We were named one of the ‘<a href="https://info.harringtonstarr.com/the-financial-technologist-tufwa-edition-2019-0">Most Influential Firms in Financial Technology for 2020</a>’ by Financial Technologist Magazine. Judges from EY and Lloyds Banking Group selected the shortlist based on innovation, growth, product and&nbsp;team.  We were listed in <a href="https://www.businesscloud.co.uk/100-fintech-disrupters-2">BusinessCloud’s 100 FinTech Disrupters</a>, at number 42. That put Nuggets alongside some of the UK’s most established names such as Revolut, Starling Bank, Monzo and Checkout.com  We were also included in the <a href="https://www.efma.com/assets/portals/fintech/FNT_Watchlist_banner_Final.pdf">Efma-Capgemini Global Financial NewTech 2020 Watchlist</a>. The list is made up of 100 Financial NewTechs that will help reshape financial services in&nbsp;2020.  Alastair and I appeared in the <a href="https://www.businessleader.co.uk/who-are-the-uks-top-32-fintech-leaders/97865">UK’s ‘Top 32’ fintech leaders</a> by Business Leader&nbsp;News  I was also named one of the <a href="https://www.paymentssource.com/list/the-most-influential-women-in-payments-2020">Most Influential Women in Payments 2020</a> by PaymentSource, and selected for the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/30-entrepreneurs-selected-for-female-founders-first-programme-by-barclays">Female Founders First programme</a>, created by Barclays and Techstars. Just two weeks ago, I made it onto the <a href="https://asiansintech.com/top-100-asian-stars-in-uk-tech-2020">Top 100 Asian Stars in UK Tech&nbsp;list</a>.  <p>Team</p>  Our sales team grew this year, and we were delighted to welcome Ben Geleit as Director of Partnerships and Alliances. Ben’s been driving all the end-to-end go-to-market activity and commercialisation. We’re now working through a number of great opportunities, and hope to reveal more in the new&nbsp;year.  <p>Events and&nbsp;media</p><p>We haven’t been to as many events as previous years — for obvious reasons! But we did manage to get to a few at the start of the&nbsp;year.</p>  I took part in a fireside chat as part of the European Women Payments Network Meetup, held at legal firm Allen and Overy’s offices in London in February.  In January, I was invited by MasterCard to speak at Paris FinTech Forum. I showcased Nuggets during a session entitled ‘Building trust in the future with…Data’.  I was also involved in a panel discussion at February’s Women in Identity Meetup, where the discussion focussed on ‘Diversity and Identity’.  Our last event before the lockdown was in March, when Alastair took to the stage at London Blockchain Week — twice! On Day One he was on a panel on Decentralised Finance. Day Two saw him discussing data sovereignty on the Decentralised Data Marketplace panel.  <p>Once again, there’s been a huge amount of media coverage throughout the year. We’ve been in titles like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-id-solution-aims-to-tackle-spike-in-delivery-fraud-amid-coronavirus-measures">CoinDesk</a>, <a href="https://www.retail-week.com/tech/seven-tech-innovations-to-help-run-stores-in-a-post-coronavirus-world/7034882.article?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT1RKaU1XWm1aak16Wm1KaiIsInQiOiJESkpXSkJtVlZxQjh6Mm5FcjFkaUNhWjVGbUVqVnMxbEY1VHlKWExEZWFRRHFPaFZWdjd0VVdtbTV5Rlp5K2FKaUFyU3AxMENhM0d1Z2U2a1pYWWlWY0FobVZlaFNXdjdMa1NuZmM0SWV5WlVOTE5aWEtpeXN0eFFuVVdMVmdyNSJ9&amp;authent=1">RetailWeek</a>, Cointelegraph (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-digital-id-putting-people-in-control-of-their-data">here</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bookingcoms-entrepreneur-of-the-year-talks-blockchain-and-women-in-tech?platform=hootsuite">here</a>), <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/how-biometrics-can-put-an-end-to-identity-theft">TechRadar</a>, <a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/the-era-of-cashlessness-is-here-are-we-prepared-for-the-change/">The Fintech Times</a>, <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/lexis-nexis-risk-explores-blockchain-identity-to-address-bank-fraud">Ledger Insights</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202005/nuggets-brings-biometrics-to-delivery-confirmation-as-industry-offers-solutions-for-new-working-normal">Biometric Update</a>, to name but a few. <a href="https://nuggets.life/media.html">Visit the Media page on our website</a> for a full list of this year’s coverage.</p><p>Alastair continued to publish his influential thought leadership articles on Forbes.

  <p>Nowadays, using a password for authentication is becoming less and less secure. Password attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and data breaches occur more frequently. <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>, the website where you can check if your account has been compromised in a data breach, contains more than 10 billion accounts and more than 600 million passwords. With <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/informationweek-home/password-reuse-abounds-new-survey-shows/d/d-id/1331689">62% of users reusing passwords</a>, a successful attack on one of the websites gives the attacker access to your accounts on other sites as well. What’s more, the Director of Identity Security at Microsoft warns that <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/your-pa-word-doesn-t-matter/ba-p/731984">long and complex passwords mostly don’t help either</a>. Using multi-factor authentication is one of the easiest ways to secure your account but is still suspectable to some types of attacks.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about how passwordless authentication works, why it is more secure, and how to implement passwordless authentication with WebAuthn in ASP.NET Core together with Okta.</p>

<p>To continue, you will need:</p>

 
   A basic knowledge of C# and JavaScript 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio 2019</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core">.NET Core 3.1 SDK</a> 
   Windows 10 Anniversary Update or newer and a computer with either a fingerprint reader, a Near-Infrared webcam, or a USB security key. 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
 

 Introduction to Passwordless Authentication with WebAuthn 

<p>The Web Authentication (also known as WebAuthn) is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> specification of an API that allows web applications creation and authentication using public-key cryptography instead of using passwords. The specification is the official web standard for passwordless login since March 2019 and <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=webauthn">is supported by all major desktop and mobile browsers</a>.</p>

<p>The web browser sits between two components that are outside the browser:</p>

 
   Relying Party—also known as a web server—is the web application that will use web authentication API to register and authenticate users. 
   Authenticators— are devices that can generate a cryptographic key pair and register it with the relying party. An authenticator can be a device with TouchID, FaceID, Windows Hello, or a USB or Bluetooth security key. 
 

<p>A web browser’s role is to exchange data between authenticators and relying parties, provide a user interface for authenticators if needed, and manage error handling.</p>

<p>When the authenticator generates a new private-public key pair for a website, the browser sends the public key and a random credential ID to the server, but the private key is stored securely on the user’s device. This makes passwordless authentication much more secure as there is no need to store or remember passwords anymore, and the public key is not secret and cannot be used without the corresponding private key.</p>

 Benefits of Passwordless Authentication with WebAuthn 

<p>Passwordless authentication has several key advantages:</p>

 
   Protection against phishing; if an attacker creates a fake login page, the user won’t be able to login because the keypair is scoped to the website’s origin. 
   Reduction of the impact of data breaches; if a data breach happens and an attacker steals public keys, they can’t authenticate without the private key. 
   Invulnerability to password attacks: With passwordless authentication, users can’t reuse passwords anymore, and user accounts aren’t susceptible to brute-force attacks either. 
 

 Setup Windows Hello for Fingerprint Authentication 

<p>Before I start the project, let’s set up fingerprint authentication with Windows Hello. Windows Hello requires Windows 10 Anniversary Update or newer, so make sure to update your Windows if you are using an older Windows version.</p>

<p>Click the Start menu, open Settings, click Accounts and click Sign-in Options.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then click on the Windows Hello Fingerprint, click Set up and click Get started On the next screen, swipe your finger to add your fingerprint.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, you are ready to add passwordless authentication to your web application.</p>

 Configure Passwordless Authentication in ASP.NET Core Web App 

<p>First, create a new ASP.NET Core project. Fire up Visual Studio and create a new project by clicking File&gt;New Project select ASP.NET Core Web Application, and click Next. Name the app OktaWebAuthn and click Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the next window, select Web Application (Model-View-Controller). Now, click Create, and Visual Studio will create a new ASP.NET Core web project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To enable passwordless authentication for the project, I will use <a href="https://github.com/abergs/fido2-net-lib">FIDO2 .NET Library</a>, so go ahead and add a NuGet package for it and Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Fido2.AspNet
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson --version 3.1.10
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>appsettings.json</code> file and add this section:</p>

   <code>  "fido2": {
    "serverDomain": "localhost",
    "origin": "https://localhost:44372",
    "timestampDriftTolerance": 300000
  }
</code>   

<p>Make sure that <code>Enable SSL</code> is checked and replace <code>44372</code> with the port number that your project is configured to use:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, open <code>Startup.cs</code> file and configure the FIDO2 .NET Library in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method:</p>

   <code>services.AddControllersWithViews().AddNewtonsoftJson();

services.AddFido2(options =&gt;
{
  options.ServerDomain = Configuration["fido2:serverDomain"];
  options.ServerName = "Okta WebAuthn Demo";
  options.Origin = Configuration["fido2:origin"];
  options.TimestampDriftTolerance = Configuration.GetValue&lt;int&gt;("fido2:timestampDriftTolerance");
});
</code>   

<p>Now, you are ready to add passwordless authentication to the project. The first step is to enable users to register a new user account using passwordless authentication.</p>

 Create User Accounts with Passwordless Authentication 

<p>Open the <code>_Layout.cshtml</code> file in <code>Views\Shared</code> folder and add the following before the <code>&lt;ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"&gt;</code> element:</p>

   <code>&lt;ul class="navbar-nav"&gt;
    @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" href="#"&gt;Hello, @User.Identity.Name&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Profile" id="profile-button"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    }
    else
    {
        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Register" id="register-button"&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignIn" id="login-button"&gt;Sign In&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    }
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>AccountController.cs</code> file in the <code>Controllers</code> folder, add <code>RegisterModel.cs</code> in the <code>Models</code> folder, and add <code>Register.cshtml</code> in the <code>Views\Account</code> folder:</p>

   <code>public class AccountController : Controller
{
    private readonly IFido2 fido2;

    public AccountController(IFido2 fido2)
    {
        this.fido2 = fido2;
    }

    public ActionResult Register()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
</code>   

   <code>@model RegisterModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Register";
}

&lt;h1&gt;@ViewData["Title"]&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;form method="post" id="register-form"&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Create a new account.&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;hr /&gt;
            &lt;div asp-validation-summary="All" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
                &lt;label asp-for="Email"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;input asp-for="Email" class="form-control" name="email" /&gt;
                &lt;span asp-validation-for="Email" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
                &lt;label asp-for="FirstName"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;input asp-for="FirstName" class="form-control" name="firstName" /&gt;
                &lt;span asp-validation-for="FirstName" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
                &lt;label asp-for="LastName"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;input asp-for="LastName" class="form-control" name="lastName" /&gt;
                &lt;span asp-validation-for="LastName" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" id="register"&gt;Register&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

@section Scripts {
    &lt;partial name="_ValidationScriptsPartial" /&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/helpers.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/passwordless.register.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
}
</code>   

   <code>public class RegisterModel
{
  [Required]
  [EmailAddress]
  [Display(Name = "Email")]
  public string Email { get; set; }

  [Required]
  [Display(Name = "First Name")]
  public string FirstName { get; set; }

  [Required]
  [Display(Name = "Last Name")]
  public string LastName { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>To create a new credential when the user registers, you need to call <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create"><code>navigator.credentials.create</code></a> JavaScript method. The <code>create()</code> method accepts a <code>PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</code> parameter with several required and optional fields that specify options for the requested credentials.</p>

<p>The required fields are:</p>

 
   <code>rp</code> - The relying party that requested credentials. 
   <code>user</code> - The user for which credentials are created. 
   <code>challenge</code> - A buffer of cryptographically random bytes that will be signed by the authenticator and sent back to the server to avoid replay attacks. 
   <code>pubKeyCredParams</code> - An array of algorithms that can be used for a cryptographic signature. 
 

<p>To generate these options, add a method to the <code>AccountController</code> class that looks like this:</p>

   <code>[HttpPost]
public ActionResult CredentialOptions([FromBody] RegisterModel model)
{
  var user = new Fido2User
  {
    DisplayName = $"{model.FirstName} {model.LastName}",
    Name = model.Email,
    Id = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(model.Email)
  };

  var options = fido2.RequestNewCredential(user, new List&lt;PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor&gt;());
 
  HttpContext.Session.SetString("fido2.attestationOptions", options.ToJson());

  return Json(options);
}
</code>   

<p>The method takes the user details, generates an options parameter, and returns it as a JSON object to the browser.</p>

<p>Finally, create <code>passwordless.register.js</code> in <code>wwwroot\js</code> folder that ties all the pieces together:</p>

   <code>document.getElementById('register-form').addEventListener('submit', handleRegisterSubmit);

async function handleRegisterSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    let email = this.email.value;
    let firstName = this.firstName.value;
    let lastName = this.lastName.value;

    var data = new FormData();

    data.append('username', email);
    data.append('firstName', firstName);
    data.append('lastName', lastName);

    // send to server for registering
    let credentialOptions;
    try 
    {
        credentialOptions = await fetchMakeCredentialOptions({ email: email, firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName });
    } 
    catch (e) 
    {
        console.error(e);
        alert("Something went really wrong");
        return;
    }

    if (credentialOptions.status !== "ok") 
    {
        alert(credentialOptions.errorMessage);
        return;
    }

    // Turn the challenge back into the accepted format of padded base64
    credentialOptions.challenge = coerceToArrayBuffer(credentialOptions.challenge);
    credentialOptions.user.id = coerceToArrayBuffer(credentialOptions.user.id);

    if (credentialOptions.authenticatorSelection.authenticatorAttachment === null) 
    {
        credentialOptions.authenticatorSelection.authenticatorAttachment = undefined;
    }

    let newCredential;
    try 
    {
        newCredential = await navigator.credentials.create({publicKey: credentialOptions});
    } catch (e) 
    {
        alert("Could not create credentials in browser.");
        return;
    }

    try 
    {
        await registerNewCredential(newCredential);
        window.location.replace("/Account/Signin");
    } catch (e) {
        alert("Could not register new credentials on server");
    }
}

async function fetchMakeCredentialOptions(formData) {
let response = await fetch('/Account/CredentialOptions', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(formData),
    headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });

  let data = await response.json();

  return data;
}


// This should be used to verify the auth data with the server
async function registerNewCredential(newCredential) {

    let attestationObject = new Uint8Array(newCredential.response.attestationObject);
    let clientDataJSON = new Uint8Array(newCredential.response.clientDataJSON);
    let rawId = new Uint8Array(newCredential.rawId);

    const data = {
        id: newCredential.id,
        rawId: coerceToBase64Url(rawId),
        type: newCredential.type,
        extensions: newCredential.getClientExtensionResults(),
        response: {
        AttestationObject: coerceToBase64Url(attestationObject),
        clientDataJson: coerceToBase64Url(clientDataJSON)
        }
    };

    let response;
    try {
            response = await registerCredentialWithServer(data);
        } catch (e) 
        {
            alert(e);
            return;
        }

  console.log("Credential Object", response);

  // show error
    if (response.status !== "ok") {
        alert(response.errorMessage);
        return;
    }

    alert("You've registered successfully.");
}

async function registerCredentialWithServer(formData) {

    let response = await fetch('/Account/SaveCredentials', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(formData),
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    });

    let data = await response.json();

    return data;
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the code and break down what it does. First, I register an event handler for the <code>sign-up</code> form. In the event handler, I call the <code>/Account/CredentialOptions</code> endpoint with the user data and use the resulting options to call the <code>navigator.credentials.create</code> method. After that, I send the generated credentials to the server by calling the <code>/Account/SaveCredentials</code> endpoint. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>The <code>SaveCredentials</code> endpoint doesn’t exist yet, but before I create that method, I will configure Okta as I will store user data and their credentials in Okta.</p>

 Store User and User’s Public Key in Okta 

<p>This tutorial will use Okta to store users and the public key of their credentials. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication, as well as all OpenID Connect flows out of the box—it can take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.</p>

<p>To get started, log in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer account</a> via the URL in the sign-up email to access your org’s portal dashboard. Once you log in, make sure to note your Org URL from the upper right corner of the screen:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> and log in to your Okta account with the <code>okta login</code> command. You can also sign up for a new account with the <code>okta start</code> command if you don’t already have an Okta account.</p>

<p>Now, create a custom field for storing the user’s public key. Go to Users in the menu, click Profile Editor, and click the Profile button next to the default Okta profile. Click Add Attribute, fill the <code>Add Attribute</code> form and click Save:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Do the same to add another attribute called <code>CredentialId</code>.</p>

<p>Next, go to API in the menu, click Tokens, and click the Create Token button. Enter the token name (I will use OktaWebAuthn) and click the Create Token button. Make sure you copy the token because you won’t be able to view it again:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Switch to Visual Studio, open the <code>appsettings.json</code> again, and add a section for Okta:</p>

   <code>"Okta": {
  "Domain": "",
  "ApiToken": "{yourToken}"
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, add a NuGet package for managing users in Okta:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.Sdk
</code>   

<p>Open the <code>AccountController</code> class and add the <code>SaveCredentials</code> method:</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;JsonResult&gt; SaveCredentials([FromBody] AuthenticatorAttestationRawResponse attestationResponse)
{
    try
    {
        var jsonOptions = HttpContext.Session.GetString("fido2.attestationOptions");
        var options = CredentialCreateOptions.FromJson(jsonOptions);

        var fidoCredentials = await fido2.MakeNewCredentialAsync(attestationResponse, options, IsCredentialUnique);

        var storedCredential = new StoredCredential{
            Descriptor = new PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor(fidoCredentials.Result.CredentialId),
            PublicKey = fidoCredentials.Result.PublicKey,
            UserHandle = fidoCredentials.Result.User.Id,
            SignatureCounter = fidoCredentials.Result.Counter,
            CredType = fidoCredentials.Result.CredType,
            RegDate = DateTime.Now,
            AaGuid = fidoCredentials.Result.Aaguid
        };

        var result = await oktaClient.Users.CreateUserAsync(new CreateUserWithoutCredentialsOptions
        {
            Profile = new UserProfile
            {
                Login = options.User.Name,
                Email = options.User.Name,
                DisplayName = options.User.DisplayName,
                ["CredentialId"] = Convert.ToBase64String(fidoCredentials.Result.CredentialId),
                ["PasswordlessPublicKey"] = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(storedCredential)
            }
        });

        return Json(fidoCredentials);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        return Json(new Fido2.CredentialMakeResult { Status = "error", ErrorMessage = e.Message });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>SaveCredentials</code> method accepts the public key object created by the authenticator, turns it into a credentials object for storing, and saves the user together with the credentials in Okta.</p>

<p>Now let’s see the app in action! Click F5 or use <code>dotnet run</code> to launch the app and click the Register menu item. Enter your email, personal details, and click the Register button. You should see a screen similar to this one:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scan your finger on the reader, and a new user will be saved in Okta with the public key corresponding to your passwordless credentials.</p>

<p>You can now register a user so let’s move on to signing in to passwordless accounts.</p>

 Authentication with WebAuthn 

<p>First, enable authentication using cookies in the project. Add the following in <code>ConfigureServices</code> method in <code>Startup</code> class:</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication("Cookie").AddCookie("Cookie");
</code>   

<p>Also in the <code>Configure</code> method:</p>

   <code>app.UseAuthentication();
</code>   

<p>Next, add <code>SignIn</code> method to the <code>AccountController</code></p>

   <code>public ActionResult SignIn()
{
  return View();
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, add a <code>SignIn.cshtml</code> in <code>Views\Account</code>:</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Sign In";
}

&lt;h1&gt;@ViewData["Title"]&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
    &lt;form method="post" id="signin-form"&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Sign in without password&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label for="email"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input id="email" class="form-control" name="email" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" id="register"&gt;Sign In&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

@section Scripts {
    &lt;script src="~/js/helpers.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/passwordless.login.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>Now, you are ready to add passwordless authentication. Login flow with passwordless authentication is similar to the registration flow. First, you need to initiate authentication for the user that wants to log in, and then use WebAuthn to facilitate the authentication process using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/get">navigator.credentials.get</a> method.</p>

<p>To create options for <code>navigator.credentials.get</code>, add a method in <code>AccountController</code> that will accept the user that initiated login and return corresponding options:</p>

   <code>[HttpPost]
public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; SignInOptions([FromForm] string username)
{
    try
    {
        var user = await oktaClient.Users.GetUserAsync(username);

        if (user == null)
        throw new ArgumentException("Username was not registered");

        var credential = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;StoredCredential&gt;(user.Profile["PasswordlessPublicKey"].ToString());

        var options = fido2.GetAssertionOptions(new List&lt;PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor&gt; { credential.Descriptor },
                                                UserVerificationRequirement.Discouraged);

        HttpContext.Session.SetString("fido2.assertionOptions", options.ToJson());

        return Json(options);
    }

    catch (Exception e)
    {
        return Json(new AssertionOptions { Status = "error", ErrorMessage = e.Message });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>SignInOptions</code> method fetches the user that is trying to sign in from Okta, creates options with the credentials that the user is allowed to use, and returns them as JSON to the caller.</p>

<p>Next, add the JavaScript code that will get the options and prompt the user for authentication. Create a new <code>passwordless.login.js</code> file in <code>wwwroot\js</code> and paste the following:</p>

   <code>document.getElementById('signin-form').addEventListener('submit', handleSignInSubmit);

async function handleSignInSubmit(event) 
{
    event.preventDefault();

    let username = this.email.value;

    var formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('username', username);

    let publicKeyOptions;
    try {
        var res = await fetch('/Account/SignInOptions', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData,
            headers: {
                'Accept': 'application/json'
            }
        });

        publicKeyOptions = await res.json();
    } catch (e) {
        alert("Request to server failed");
        return;
    }

    if (publicKeyOptions.status !== "ok") {
        alert(publicKeyOptions.errorMessage);
        return;
    }

    const challenge = publicKeyOptions.challenge.replace(/-/g, "+").replace(/_/g, "/");
    publicKeyOptions.challenge = Uint8Array.from(atob(challenge), c =&gt; c.charCodeAt(0));

    publicKeyOptions.allowCredentials.forEach(function (listItem) {
        var fixedId = listItem.id.replace(/\_/g, "/").replace(/\-/g, "+");
        listItem.id = Uint8Array.from(atob(fixedId), c =&gt; c.charCodeAt(0));
    });

    // ask browser for credentials (browser will ask connected authenticators)
    let credential;
    try {
        credential = await navigator.credentials.get({ publicKey: publicKeyOptions });

        try {
            await verifyAssertionWithServer(credential);
        } catch (e) {
            alert("Could not verify assertion");
        }
    } catch (err) {
        alert(err.message ? err.message : err);
    }
}

async function verifyAssertionWithServer(assertedCredential) 
{
    let authData = new Uint8Array(assertedCredential.response.authenticatorData);
    let clientDataJSON = new Uint8Array(assertedCredential.response.clientDataJSON);
    let rawId = new Uint8Array(assertedCredential.rawId);
    let sig = new Uint8Array(assertedCredential.response.signature);

    const data = {
        id: assertedCredential.id,
        rawId: coerceToBase64Url(rawId),
        type: assertedCredential.type,
        extensions: assertedCredential.getClientExtensionResults(),
        response: {
            authenticatorData: coerceToBase64Url(authData),
            clientDataJson: coerceToBase64Url(clientDataJSON),
            signature: coerceToBase64Url(sig)
        }
    };

    let response;
    try {
        let res = await fetch("/Account/SignIn", {
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify(data),
            headers: {
                'Accept': 'application/json',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        });

        response = await res.json();
    } catch (e) {
        alert("Request to server failed", e);
        throw e;
    }

    console.log("Assertion Object", response);

    if (response.status !== "ok") {
        alert(response.errorMessage);
        return;
    }

    window.location.href = "/Account/Profile";
}
</code>   

<p>The above code handles the sign-in button click, fetches options from the server, and prompts the user for passwordless authentication. When the user signs in, the credentials are sent to the server for validation. I will now add the method to accept the credentials and sign in the user:</p>

   <code>[HttpPost]
public async Task&lt;JsonResult&gt; SignIn([FromBody] AuthenticatorAssertionRawResponse clientResponse)
{
    try
    {
        var jsonOptions = HttpContext.Session.GetString("fido2.assertionOptions");
        var options = AssertionOptions.FromJson(jsonOptions);

        var user = await GetUserByCredentials(clientResponse.Id);

        var credential = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;StoredCredential&gt;(user.Profile["PasswordlessPublicKey"].ToString());

        var result = await fido2.MakeAssertionAsync(clientResponse, options, credential.PublicKey, credential.SignatureCounter,
                                                    args =&gt; Task.FromResult(credential.UserHandle.SequenceEqual(args.UserHandle)));

        await UpdateCounter(user, credential, result.Counter);

        var claims = new List&lt;Claim&gt;
        {
        new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, user.Profile.Email)
        };

        var claimsIdentity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims, CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

        await HttpContext.SignInAsync(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, new ClaimsPrincipal(claimsIdentity));

        return Json(result);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        return Json(new AssertionVerificationResult { Status = "error", ErrorMessage = e.Message });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the project again, click the Sign In in the menu, enter the email you signed up with, and click the Sign In button. You will see a prompt like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Swipe your finger, and you will be signed in and redirected to the profile page. To show the current user profile data, you can use the Okta .NET SDK to get the current user details and display them.</p>

<p>Add a <code>Profile</code> method with the following code:</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Profile()
{
  var subject = HttpContext.User.Claims.First(claim =&gt; claim.Type == ClaimTypes.Name).Value;
  var user = await oktaClient.Users.GetUserAsync(subject);
  return View(user);
}
</code>   

<p>Next, create the <code>Profile.cshtml</code> file in the <code>Views\Account</code> folder that looks like this:</p>

   <code>@model Okta.Sdk.IUser

@{
  ViewData["Title"] = "User Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;User Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;dl class="row"&gt;
    &lt;dt class = "col-sm-2"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.FirstName)
    &lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd class = "col-sm-10"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.FirstName)
    &lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt class = "col-sm-2"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.LastName)
    &lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd class = "col-sm-10"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.LastName)
    &lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt class = "col-sm-2"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.Email)
    &lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd class = "col-sm-10"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.Email)
    &lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a asp-action="EditProfile"&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>The view renders profile details such as the user’s first name and last name, email, city, and country code.</p>

<p>Rerun the app, click the Profile button, and you will see the details of the currently logged in user.</p>

<p>That’s it! You can register and sign with passwordless authentication and view the details of the current user.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you learned how to use WebAuthn in ASP.NET Core and Okta to make passwordless authentication more secure.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had a widespread effect on nearly every industry, and education has been no exception. While we recently explored the impact of Covid-19 on remote education in a recent whitepaper,&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/reports/learning-through-disruption-au10tix/">Learning Through Disruption: Digital Identity in Education</a>, we wanted to take a more in-depth look at how this shift has raised issues concerning the integrity of online testing and exams. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous testing conditions consisted of tens to hundreds of students sitting in one room at a time. With the pandemic, this is no longer a safe or viable option. Instead, institutions have begun partnering with companies that offer online proctoring software. These softwares implement tools such as webcams and microphones, facial recognition, and screen record to verify the test-taker’s identity. How can schools, colleges, and standardized testing boards verify that the test-takers sitting on the other side of the screen are who they say they are? How can test-takers prove their identities while maintaining privacy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Current State Analysis: Tech Stack Breakdown 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These solutions address two main issues: verifying the test-taker’s identity and preventing cheating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifying the Test-Taker’s Identity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure that test-takers are who they say they are, these softwares&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">require a scan of the individual’s ID</a> before the exam and use facial-recognition technology to match the face to the ID photo. Random scans are performed throughout the exam to ensure that the test-taker does not switch places with another person. Companies will also verify identity through a typing test. The test-taker is asked to type 140 words at the beginning of the semester and then perform the typing test before any exam. The speed and rhythms of the keystrokes are used to verify their identity, and any discrepancies are flagged for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">further inspection</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-Cheating Software Leveraging Behavioral Biometrics</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online proctoring services such as Proctorio and ProctorU implement a variety of security features to prevent cheating. They hire live proctors to watch test-takers’ faces and listen to them talk, and proctors can demand test-takers aim their cameras around the room to prove their honesty. ProctorU requires test-takers to show their ID cards, their rooms, and the surface of their desk before beginning the exam. During the exam, the proctor takes precautions to mitigate cheating, such as listening through the microphone, accessing the test-taker’s screen, and using the webcam to allow the video system to view the test-taker’s eye movements. If the system or proctor suspects cheating, the instance is flagged as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">a suspicious event</a>&nbsp;for further review or alerted to a specialist known as an “interventionist,” who can take action and enforce an academic penalty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The COVID-19 Shift and Concerns 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These softwares are not offering dramatically new technology, and before the pandemic, they were used in online-only classes. But in 2020, they have seen a boom in business as grade schools and standardized testing organizations pivot to maintain operations. According to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/05/11/online-proctoring-surging-during-covid-19">Educause poll</a>&nbsp;conducted in April of 2020, 54 percent of institutions had already begun using online or remote proctoring services. Another 23 percent were considering or planning to use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>As adoption skyrockets, data privacy now becomes a pressing concern. Students not previously familiar with such technology are experiencing a culture shock and raising&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecampusnews.com/2020/09/04/online-proctoring-keeps-remote-exams-secure-but-raises-privacy-questions/?all">questions regarding privacy rights</a>. Also, now that grade schools have moved online, more minors are using exam proctoring software, raising concerns about how their privacy rights should be protected.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond privacy concerns, comfort with the technology is another issue. Many test-takers have pointed out the “creepiness” and general “inhumanness” of being watched through a camera while taking a test, leading to increased anxiety and, therefore, lower performance. In fact, with ProctorU’s software, test-takers used to see the proctor watching them on their screen. Due to reported negative experiences, ProctorU&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">disabled that function</a>&nbsp;to increase the feeling of privacy, even though the proctor is still watching.&nbsp;Privacy is a crucial factor affecting comfort. If users are ensured that their recordings, face, and photos are securely protected, they will become more comfortable with the software, and subsequently, user adoption and success will increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Solution 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A clear solution is the implementation of a student digital identity. If schools issued their students a digital identity, it could be used to verify the student’s identity before they take an online exam. The idea of a digital student ID isn’t new; in 2018, edtech company Blackboard Inc.&nbsp;<a href="https://press.blackboard.com/2018-10-02-Blackboard-Announces-Support-for-Student-ID-Cards-on-iPhone-and-Apple-Watch">announced</a>&nbsp;Blackboard Mobile Credential support for Student ID cards in Apple Wallet, allowing students to use their phone as a mobile ID, becoming the first campus credential solution provider to offer NFC-enabled contactless mobile IDs for iPhone and Apple Watch. Over the past two years,&nbsp;<a href="https://dukecard.duke.edu/mobile-dukecard">Duke University</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://actcard.ua.edu/actioncardinapplewallet-gettingstarted/">University of Alabama</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ou.edu/soonercard/mobile">University of Oklahoma</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scu.edu/news-and-events/press-releases/2020/february-2020/santa-clara-university-offers-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-.html?#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif.%2C%20Feb,from%20the%20library%20and%20more.">Santa Clara University</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.temple.edu/news/2019-01-28/mobile-owlcard">Temple University</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2019/03/28/apple-wallet-homewood-campus-ids/">Johns Hopkins University</a> have given students the ability to use this solution.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier in 2020, campus card solutions provider Transact rolled out support for Android NFC student IDs, integrated with Google Pay, to <a href="https://www.nfcw.com/2020/05/19/366583/transact-rolls-out-android-nfc-student-ids-at-16-us-universities/">16 US universities</a>. This kind of student mobile identity also provides an extra level of security as it requires two-factor authentication on the device, keeping its credentials and information secure.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>OWI recommends taking the mobile student ID a step further. Not only could it provide the same uses as a physical ID, such as offering access to dorms and checking out library books, but it could also be expanded into other sectors such as student healthcare. Post-graduation, it could be updated to reflect alumni status and allow the option to offer alumni benefits. Employers can use this digital ID to quickly verify an applicant’s education credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of November 2020, Mastercard, Australia Post, and Deakin University are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.securitydocumentworld.com/article-details/i/16600/">moving toward</a>&nbsp;this solution. Students can create a digital identity in Australia Post’s Digital iD app and use it to gain access to Deakin University’s exam portal. Integrated into both organization’s platforms, Mastercard’s digital identity service “ID” successfully orchestrated the sharing of verified identity data between the two parties – sending only the specific personal information required to permit entry using its highly secure network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward, OWI believes that there is an opportunity to expand the mobile student ID’s functionality into verifying test-taker identity. Players in this space, whether new or established, must keep data privacy concerns at the forefront of their solutions. Ultimately, a digital student identity could address the issues of test-taker identity, and its uses could be expanded into a variety of sectors and span a lifetime.</p>

<p>This post was authored by Alexis Falquier, who helps lead the self-sovereign identity (SSI) initiative at GlobaliD.</p><p>Back in October, team GlobaliD attended the 31st biannual Internet Identity Workshop (IIW), the premier conference dedicated to building collaborative environments that foster the development of open standards around all things digital identity. According to legend, it’s the birthplace of&nbsp;SSI</p><p>On top of leading two sessions, we also unveiled our Dynamic Governance API. And as part of GlobaliD’s ongoing commitment toward open SSI standards, <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7">we open sourced our iOS and Android native Hyperledger Aries frameworks</a>.</p><p>With the year coming to a close, we wanted to look back at the conference and highlight some of the fascinating topics we came across and what we&nbsp;learned.</p><p>Disclaimer: This piece is a bit jargon heavy given the nature of the space. I’ve made my best attempt at making it as approachable as possible, but if you’re looking for a crash course on the basics of SSI, distributed identifiers (DID’s) and Verifiable Credentials, here’s some recommended reading:</p>  <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">What is self-sovereign identity?</a>  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">Multi-Source and Self-Sovereign Identity</a>  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity&nbsp;Systems</a>  <p>OK, without further adieu, here are some highlights from&nbsp;IIW:</p> Now KERI is my best&nbsp;friend <p>One of the hottest topics at IIW 31 — in part because of how much it offers — was our new friend KERI, which stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. It’s no trivial subject, to the point that Drummond Reed and Sam Smith (the creator of KERI) held three separate sessions dedicated to describing it at different levels — KERI for Muggles, KERI for mudbloods, and KERI for Wizards. I can tell you that even KERI for Muggles very much felt like a “Wizards” session but I will do my best to share what KERI is all&nbsp;about.</p><p>In its most fundamental sense, KERI is a Public Key Infrastructure or PKI. One of the foundational pieces of SSI is public/private key cryptography and its relationship with a decentralized identifier or DID. In other words, public key encryption makes SSI go round. KERI, then, is a new and fully decentralized PKI. You can see why all of this might be such a big&nbsp;deal.</p><p>Some of real-world benefits of KERI — and why it was incidentally the belle of the ball — as explained by Timothy Ruff, Sam Smith, and Drummond Reed during <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lpzYcPrIox9V4hERtn4Kcf7uq01OVU9u3PuVm1aYzR0/edit#slide=id.ga411be7e84_0_116">their muggle-friendly and all around more approachable KERI session at&nbsp;IIW</a>:</p><p>Independent and&nbsp;Portable</p><p>Distributed ledgers underpin many SSI solutions, but KERI is a highly portable public key infrastructure that does not necessitate their use. It is self sustained, and therefore every organization/individual is its own root of trust. It is not locked into one governance framework, network or ledger. It is truly decentralized.</p><p>Secure</p><p>KERI relies solely on cryptography as the means to prove the root of trust. What this means is that you can rotate the key without changing the identifier. You can pre-rotate future keys, safely store these, and — in the case that your current private key is compromised — you can use the pre-rotated keys to restore your identifier. To throw some more jargon at you, this pre rotation turns out is actually a post-quantum proof (secure against attacks with quantum computers) method of key security. In other words, it is future&nbsp;proof.</p><p>Delegatable</p><p>You can easily create keys and delegate them as needed. This creates the potential for any number of hierarchical architectures.</p><p>Scalable</p><p>Since KERI is self reliant it is extremely scalable, only limited by its hardware. Given its cryptographic nature, existing key management solutions can be&nbsp;used.</p><p>Private</p><p>The key logs are controlled by the organization/individual themselves. In some SSI solutions that rely on immutable ledgers privacy can become problematic in terms of GDPR, and the right to be forgotten. Since KERI is not reliant on ledgers this can be avoided all together.</p><p>Standard Adherent</p><p>Like many SSI solutions, KERI uses existing cryptography in new ways including W3C standards, DID’s and SSI Wallets. KERI follows open source standards and is fully auditable.</p><p>Sound good so far? If you’ve made it this far, here’s how KERI actually works at a very high&nbsp;level:</p>  KERI uses self certifying identifiers (SCID’s), which means that a specific identifier can prove to be the one and only identifier using cryptography alone. This is the pivotal piece of&nbsp;KERI.  KERI uses key event logs (also self certifying) which carry the history of the keys, such that if you ever need to rotate your key you can do so, sign it, log it, and prove that you control this new key via the event&nbsp;logs.  KERI uses “witnesses” that keep and sign a copy of your logs for added ‘evidence’ of your key ownership.  You can pre-rotate future keys, safely store the keys, log the pre-rotation, and when this key is needed you will be able to prove the key is yours and keep your identifier safe.  KERI is not attached to any one system, any system that can process data will be able to validate your identifier.  KERI allows for the creation of multiple identifiers that can be delegated, allowing for any complex hierarchy of identifiers and&nbsp;keys.  <p>If you feel like you still do not really get it, don’t worry, most of us didn’t either. One thing that isn’t hard to get is why KERI made such a big splash at the conference. These are still early days but the possibilities for KERI are vast and disruptive — it’s certainly one to keep an eye&nbsp;on.</p><p>If you’re feeling brave and are interested in learning more about the nitty gritty of KERI, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">here’s the 140-page white&nbsp;paper</a>.</p> Chained Credentials <p>Another compelling topic at IIW was chained credentials — the concept of linking two or more verifiable credentials with one another. The discussion focused less on the how but rather on the&nbsp;why.</p><p>At its most basic function, linking credentials makes sense in the same way that databases have relationships that link data from one table to another. You might have two credentials that work just fine on their own for a specific purpose, but attributing them together can provide broader significance.</p><p>A basic example of this would be having a credential of citizenship and a credential of residence — the link of which allows you to vote in local elections. Really, anytime you have a history of transactions such as supply chain, registries, etc., verifiable credentials add value. So rather than present use cases, I will focus on a few primary benefits.</p><p>Reputation</p><p>For Kiva’s Nathan George, their work with refugees led them toward the path of chained credentials. Since refugees often lack traditional forms of documentation and credentials, the concept of chained credentials opens up the possibility of building their reputation by allowing them to receive credentials that attest to their skills — whether by linking one with the next or by adding endorsements.</p><p>Proof of&nbsp;Linkage</p><p>Linked credentials would allow for proof of a larger scope of information without disclosure. If part of my verifiable credential is how it is linked to another, then I could disclose to a verifier the proof of linkage without disclosing the credential itself, thus demonstrating the reputability of my credential without actually disclosing it. If this proof of linkage also shows where the credential was linked from, I am able to show the provenance of truth. In other words, the source of the link can add to the validity of my credential.</p><p>Delegatable Credentials</p><p>Chained credentials are a core building block of delegatable credentials. In simple terms, a delegatable credential is one that proves the permission of an action by means of proving a link to the original credential that allows for that action. For example, if I lend my friend my car, I will delegate my car’s credential to them, in the case that they need to prove that they are allowed to drive it (or in the future, be able to start and drive it, period). For delegatable credentials to work, revocation is also needed — a topic for another day. The point being, linked credentials are a key part of the delegation process.</p><p>All in all, there are use cases abound — one reason why I’m so excited to see where people take the&nbsp;concept.</p> Guardianship (AKA Custodial Agents) <p>The topic of guardianship made an appearance in multiple sessions. For the purposes of this piece, I’ll focus on the one held by Ken Ebert and Sam&nbsp;Curren.</p><p>At first glance, you might think that this is about the legal role of guardianship when it comes to a person’s online identity, i.e. a parent being a guardian for a child’s digital presence until they turn 18. While that is an ever present topic at IIW and one that is always interesting to be part of, this discussion focused on guardianship in a technical sense.</p><p>This potential for confusion came up during the discussion and we ended up changing the phrase to custodial agents for semantic&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>A custodial agent is an agent that resides on a cloud infrastructure rather than on someone’s personal device. Therefore, their identity and wallet is being maintained by someone else. This is worth considering because in reality, there are people who cannot have an end agent, generally for the purposes of convenience and access. That might mean a web wallet interface for easy integration and adoption or simply because not everyone has a smartphone.</p><p>Since the agent is not on a personal device, this means that the keys are being managed by whoever manages the cloud infrastructure. Naturally, this adds a degree of centralization. (Someone on the discussion made the joke that here, SSI stands for Somewhat Sovereign Identity.) That’s true — to an extent. On the other hand, it’s important to solve for cases where the ideal scenario might not exist in the name of inclusivity.</p><p>The thing is, even though cloud hosted wallets inherently takes away some portability, we should focus on the potential benefits cloud-hosted wallets provide users over not having an SSI wallet at all. End users (for the most part) do not care what is happening in the background. They simply care how it affects their experience.</p><p>So while not not all the benefits of SSI come with cloud hosting, there’s enough upside that it would still make a significant impact.</p><p>This also puts the onus on cloud-hosted providers to maintain sovereignty of their users’ identity to the largest extent possible. Given that they inherently hold some fiduciary responsibility, we discussed ways in which cloud-hosted against could be architected that optimized for user sovereignty.</p><p>One of the first ideas brought up was the imposition of restrictions on what agents can do. Cloud-hosted providers should focus on and adhere to specific use cases. Furthermore — as to allow a user to move to a truly self-sovereign solution — the agent and the wallet should be de-coupled such that the user always has the option to retrieve their wallet and transfer it to an end agent. GlobaliD’s Dev Bharel also brought up the concept of “trusted execution environments” as a means to host an agent and wallet without requiring the ability to see any information transaction — including keys.</p><p>There’s still plenty of considerations to consider in the context of custodial agents, but many organizations along with GlobaliD are actively exploring options that promote inclusivity in the&nbsp;space.</p> Signing out <p>These are but a few of the notable highlights, but if you’re interested in reading more about any of these or any other session at this past IIW, the book of proceedings (which contains notes on each session) can be <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">found&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>It’s truly difficult to put into words the level of knowledge and ideas shared at each and every IIW, a conference that breeds innovation every time you attend. For us it’s a privilege and an opportunity to see how the world of online identity is evolving. So here’s to the next IIW, where we will eagerly see what is discussed and find what’s already been implemented — while also sharing some of our own progress along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Also, stay tuned for another follow up piece on the GlobaliD approach to Governance Frameworks.</p><p>The digital identity revolution is well underway, and here at GlobaliD, we’re proud to be apart of&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/what-we-learned-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-aebda1f49f3a">What we learned at the Internet Identity Workshop</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>Co-authored by <a href="https://medium.com/u/b3e0625479e">Mario Cardoso</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/e52c6099919c">Andre&nbsp;Rabello</a>.</blockquote><p>The Operations Tools team in <a href="https://medium.com/u/2714cdc6872a">Onfido</a> handles a lot of repositories. Being “the glue” for manual check processing, the domain is large and vast. Front-end projects were written in JavaScript and while there was some Flow types, they weren’t first-class citizens and were usually either old/unmaintained/wrong or simply&nbsp;missing.</p><p>Exactly because we have to context switch so much between different repos, strict types help immensely with code discovery and safety. When the interface between two unrelated files is typed and you only need to change a single one, you no longer need to read the other. As long as you don’t change the interface and type checking passes, you can be sure your code won’t&nbsp;break.</p><p>Thus began our journey to refactor our biggest and most frequently changed app, Ops Manager, a React front-end with a Node GraphQL server, into TypeScript.</p> The journey <p>To be fair, we had been writing new features in TypeScript for about a year, and sometimes refactoring a file or two. We were confident that a migration would be straightforward.</p> TS setup <p>Ideally you want an editor that integrates well with TypeScript so that you see red squiggly lines below errors and don’t have to watch the terminal, which makes fixing issues that much faster and&nbsp;easier.</p><p>We recommend using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS&nbsp;Code</a>.</p><p>Additionally, you should use a tsconfig to tell the compiler what to do in you project, specifically. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html">official docs</a> and the example&nbsp;below.</p><p>Depending on the bundler you use you will also need to setup TypeScript support. If you use <a href="https://parceljs.org/typeScript.html">Parcel</a> it works out of the box. If you use Webpack, like we still do, you can follow <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/">their&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Essentially all we did was remove babel completely, install the appropriate loader and add this single line to module.rules:</p><p>{ test: /\.tsx?$/, loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader' }</p> Start converting <p>First step, pick a file and replace its extension with&nbsp;.ts. You will immediately notice a bunch of tslint errors about missing types. Now the goal is to get rid of all the&nbsp;errors.</p> Imports <p>Let’s start with the beginning of the file that usually contains imports. We can split them in three different groups:</p>  imports from third party libraries;  imports from other project&nbsp;files;  type imports (in case you were using non-TS types, like&nbsp;Flow).   Import from 3rd-party libraries <p>In case the library doesn’t provide TS types along with code, you should install them from @types if they exist. <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">It’s a community managed repo</a> that has types for most common libraries in npm. For example if you use lodash, you can install TS types with npm i -D @types/lodash or yarn add -D <a href="http://twitter.com/types/lodash">@types/lodash</a></p><p>If the package is not popular enough to have @types, you have 3&nbsp;options:</p>  contribute to the community by submitting a Pull&nbsp;Request;  create a local&nbsp;.d.ts file that defines the&nbsp;module;  just use tsignore until there is&nbsp;one.  <p>Option 3 provides the least benefits, you just disable type checking for that library which defeats the&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>Option 2 is a nice temporary fix, for example: foo-library.d.ts</p> define 'foo-library' {<br>  function Foo(): string;<br>} <p>If you’re familiar with its API you can cover just the necessary cases for your code to function and be type checked&nbsp;:)</p> Import from project&nbsp;files <p>The simplest way is to use tsignore until it is converted to TS. Don’t forget to come back later and remove it once the imported file is converted. That way you can focus on one file at a time, but if some imported files are really easy and simple to convert you can also just go convert them first. That depends on complexity but generally we would have a more iterative/progressive approach and focus on a few files at a&nbsp;time.</p><p>Another option is to start inwards, from files that have no dependencies up the tree. That’s not always the best approach as you’ll change context/domain pretty frequently, but is definitely helpful for the “utils” kind of&nbsp;files.</p> Import types <p>In case your project is using Flow (we will not discuss whether you should or should not go from Flow to TS), you could find imports like import type FileName. In that scenario, just convert the Flow type to a TS compatible type and you can keep the import type&nbsp;. Depending on your build process and bundler, you should still use import type, it was introduced in TypeScript 3.8, you can read more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html">here</a>.</p> Auto-fixable issues <p>VS Code commonly suggests fixes for some tslint issues. Generally the suggestion is good enough and you can start with that, and later you can improve it. Examples of suggestions for types include “infer by usage”, where VS Code tries to infer the type of a variable based on how it is used. For example, it understands which arguments in a function are used inside it or which methods of an object are used (if you use a String.prototype method it suggests that the type of the argument should be string). You can usually accept the suggestion and if needed update it by giving it a name or adding missing types, and you could also extract it to its own type&nbsp;file.</p><p>Generally it works pretty well, just validate if it makes sense and improve it if you can. But that’s a great and helpful feature, specially when you are starting&nbsp;out.</p> From Flow to&nbsp;TS <p>That was our case, we were using Flow in most files. This definitely helped because we had already some knowledge about our types and the work was mostly about completing the missing types and converting to TS because the syntax is a bit different. Most types are pretty similar, like&nbsp;these:</p><p>Some are slightly different, like this function:</p> Different ways to&nbsp;type <p>In our case we were heavily influenced by the types written in Flow, but there are many ways to achieve the same goal. For example, the function above could be written in any of these 3&nbsp;ways:</p><p>There are also many TypeScript utility types that you can use, for example the Record&nbsp;type:</p><p>Your team might prefer a specific style, like inline types vs isolated files, but at the end of the day agree on some standards you all can abide by, and above all be consistent.</p> Any <p>You should almost never use any, it defeats the purpose of using TS. Always try defining the types, looking at how they are used and if you get stuck use tsignore until you figure it out. tsignore should be temporary and a reminder that you should come back later and fix it. That worked for us, we saw them as TODOs for later, and that helped us proceed and not get&nbsp;stuck.</p><p>In situations where you definitely don’t know the type, you can use unknown. You can read more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type">here</a>.</p> As any (casting) <p>In actual code, don’t do it. For tests however, it is very useful. Instead of polluting mock objects and stubs with useless data (for that specific test case), you can cast it to any, essentially disabling type checking, to provide the minimum necessary interface for the test&nbsp;case.</p><p>In the example below the type requires fullName, but we know that if a name exists in the object we won’t need the rest. In this test case, we can ignore fullName and disable type checking because we are sure of the consequence (for testing). Just remember to cast it as late as possible so you still have type check in your actual test&nbsp;code.</p> GraphQL types vs TypeScript types <p>As mentioned before one of the projects we were working was built with GraphQL so this could also help you introduce TypeScript in the sense that you already have to define types for your Schema (queries, mutations, subscriptions). At the same time be aware that the syntax is not exactly the same and could sometimes cause some confusion. But if you keep most of your GraphQL code in separated files it’s easier not to mix things and better organise you&nbsp;code.</p><p>As you can see shared types are easier to achieve in TypeScript than in GraphQL. Also the philosophy of null in each language are opposites (default nullable vs default defined).</p><p>You can also use the amazing <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com">GraphQL Code Generator</a> to create types for you automatically! We don’t yet use it but plan to in the&nbsp;future.</p> What we&nbsp;learned   Some Flow types were incorrect and caused bugs after the migration to TypeScript, which shows the importance of keeping types up to date. I’d argue it’s better not to have types than to have wrong types. Mostly it was arrays and objects which could be null but weren’t typed as&nbsp;such;  Several bad data paths were discovered and potential future bugs prevented, like nullish objects, empty arrays, bad tuples, loading and error&nbsp;states;  Writing types for a whole repo is repetitive, boring work. It’s also the fastest and surest way to understand all of its interconnections and intricacies;  As you migrate, you discover better patterns and solutions and will probably want to come back to earlier&nbsp;files;  Don’t try to convert many files at once, go one by one and use tsignore when importing other JS files so you can focus on one file at a&nbsp;time;  TS and JS files can co-exist so you can migrate progressively from easiest to hardest file and not block other changes in the&nbsp;process;  The benefit of having types is not obvious at first, when you only have a few TS files, but it becomes easier and a better Developer Experience as more files are converted, which is nice to keep you motivated.  <p>Having the entire project in TypeScript has some clear benefits, like being much easier to onboard, maintain and change with some confidence it won’t break (thanks to type checking).</p><p>Migrating an old repo to TypeScript, especially if it has some other form of types that aren’t all that precise, is arduous and time intensive work. Make sure to properly weigh the benefits for your team and to plan it out in advance. We chose a big-bang refactor, which worked well for the GraphQL server but not as great for the React app, as it introduced some issues and blocked other features until the whole thing was resolved (merging conflicts later would be a nightmare). Doing one module at a time would have been a better approach in our&nbsp;case.</p><p>If you decide you want TS in your repos too, good luck migrating and enjoy your improved Developer Experience!&nbsp;:D</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/@mariorcardoso">Mario Cardoso - Medium</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@andre.rabello">Andre Rabello - Medium</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/migrating-600-files-to-typescript-580440141c35">Migrating ~600 files to TypeScript</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Digitalization is an important topic in the insurance industry. However, according to a study by NTT Data, many insurers urgently need to catch up on their homework when it comes to digitalisation: the status and development of digitalization are measured and assessed by 12% of insurance companies (12%) according to clearly defined criteria. One in three companies (36%) does have various indicators in place that give an approximate picture of the state of digitalization. On the whole, however, the topic of ” digitalization ” is apparently still often diffuse, complex, and not very concrete. Around half (52%) lack a systematic measurement of the degree of digitalization.</p>
<p>API management as a key factor of digitalization.</p>
<p>New digital business models, changing user requirements, and the general shift towards fast and simple solutions are forcing new and established insurers alike to act. Many service providers have realized this business potential, and the market is flooded with API providers. Insurance companies are finding it increasingly difficult to keep an overview of external – but also internal – API-based services and their performance. Intelligent API management has thus become one of the central challenges of digitalization.</p>
<p>Syncier, a spin-off of Allianz in partnership with Microsoft, has recognized this problem: On the Syncier marketplace, digital services specifically relevant to the insurance industry are made available. These can then be integrated directly into insurers’ existing IT systems via API.</p>

 Ontology Partners With Litentry, Accelerating Adoption Of Its Decentralized Identity and Credit Scoring Solutions <p>Litentry’s Integration Of Ontology’s Bespoke Products Aims To Increase Adoption By 10K&nbsp;Users</p><p>Singapore — 16 December 2020 — In a bid to further the shared goal of bringing about greater data privacy and transparency, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, public blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with <a href="https://www.litentry.com/">Litentry</a>, a blockchain identity management layer based on the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>As part of the agreement, the two pioneers in decentralized identity and data management solutions will collaborate to integrate Ontology’s bespoke decentralized identity solution, DeID, and DDXF, Ontology’s decentralized data exchange and collaboration framework, into Litentry’s identity aggregation and computation system.</p><p>In line with this, Ontology will make its DeID solution, as well as its OScore, the company’s proprietary decentralized credit-rating system, available to Litentry for the integration with its DID aggregation technology to generate new use cases. Over time, the partnership will see Litentry build a cross-chain identity aggregator based on Polkadot, which includes a unique decentralized Web3.0 identity computation network and related tools. In joining forces, Ontology and Litentry are aiming to onboard 10,000 users to the DeID and OScore solutions, enriching aggregated Identities and targeting potential customers based in Europe, USA, Latin America and South East&nbsp;Asia.</p><p>Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, stated “The great synergy between Ontology and Litentry makes this partnership an obvious one. The need to bring about greater fairness, privacy and transparency when it comes to data is extremely important to both parties and our shared missions. Our team is excited to see this partnership come to fruition and to leverage our commonalities to accelerate the growth of both Ontology and Litentry. In particular, we are really happy to be furthering our relationship with the Polkadot ecosystem, having partnered with Patract Labs and Parity Technologies just last&nbsp;month.”</p><p>Fei Liu, CTO of Litentry said, “Ontology has made a great achievement in the development of decentralized identity solutions, and in particular decentralized credit scoring solutions — a timely solution in high demand given the industry’s current focus on DeFi. We are delighted to collaborate with Ontology to integrate these solutions and to work to increase user adoption of our products and services to create a fairer world when it comes to individuals and their&nbsp;data.”</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-litentry-accelerating-adoption-of-its-decentralized-identity-and-credit-95870de47ea3">Ontology Partners With Litentry, Accelerating Adoption Of Its Decentralized Identity and Credit…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>As <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-language-popularity-python-overtakes-java-as-rust-reaches-top-20/">Python grows in popularity</a>, the variety of high-quality frameworks available to developers has blossomed. In addition to steadfast options like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, there are many new options including <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>.</p>

<p>First released <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/releases?after=0.2.0">in late 2018</a>, FastAPI differentiates itself from other Python frameworks by offering a modern, fast, and succinct developer experience for building reliable <a>REST APIs</a>. While one of the newer open-source Python frameworks available, FastAPI has quickly gained a following with over <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi">22,000 stars on GitHub</a> and an active <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/">community of maintainers</a> working on the project.</p>

<p>In this post, you’ll learn more about FastAPI, and why it might be the right choice for your next project. You’ll see how to set up a new FastAPI project and use <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a> to secure the API.</p>

 What Sets FastAPI Apart? 

<p>Unlike many web frameworks, FastAPI is built to support REST APIs first. As <a href="https://w3-lab.com/web-development/single-page-applications-pros-2020/">single-page applications become increasingly common</a>, separate backends like those created with FastAPI are an essential part of web application architecture. With this in mind, FastAPI incorporates several features meant to support HTTP API-driven application development.</p>

<p>First, documentation is created for your application automatically. Using <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>, FastAPI generates clean, interactive documentation for your application. Later in this tutorial, you’ll see how you can use this documentation to test your API’s authorization functionality.</p>

<p>Next, FastAPI is, as its name suggests, <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/benchmarks/">fast</a>. Python has historically tended to be slower than Node or Go because of the blocking, synchronous nature of the language; in Python 3, the option to declare functions <code>async</code> changed that. Some older frameworks aren’t built to support asynchronous Python, but FastAPI does. It’s built on <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a>, a lightweight asynchronous Python server, and it takes advantage of modern features like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> to improve developer experience.</p>

<p>Another feature implemented by FastAPI, but not necessarily common in the Python ecosystem, is <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#dependency-injection">dependency injection</a>. The FastAPI framework uses type hints in your function signatures to find and inject the required dependencies. This allows you to write decoupled, reusable code, making unit testing much easier as dependencies can be swapped out at runtime.</p>

<p>Finally, while FastAPI comes with many of the features you would expect in a REST API framework (like <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#validation">data validation</a> and <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#security-and-authentication">authentication</a>), it lets you choose your ORM and database of choice. This means that FastAPI can work with your existing data models if you’re migrating from an existing Python application.</p>

<p>While FastAPI is an excellent option for building REST APIs in Python, it’s not perfect for every situation. If the system you’re building relies on Python 3.5 or any earlier Python framework, you won’t be able to use FastAPI. FastAPI also isn’t a great choice if you’re building a server-side web application that needs to display HTML, as it doesn’t include all the view helper functions that full-stack frameworks like Django do.</p>

<p>Now that you’re familiar with FastAPI at a high level, you’re ready to start building your first application. In the rest of this tutorial, you’ll see how to get started and secure your endpoints using Okta as your OAuth authorization server.</p>

 Building a New FastAPI Project 

<p>In this section, you’ll create a new FastAPI project and add a single, unprotected endpoint to your API.</p>

<p>Before you get started, make sure your computer has <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download">Python 3.6+ installed</a>. FastAPI uses the typing and asynchronous features in Python, so earlier versions of the language won’t run it.</p>

 Install FastAPI 

<p>Start by creating a new Python project and using pip to <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#installation">install FastAPI</a> and <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">Uvicorn</a> as your asynchronous server:</p>

   <code>pip install fastapi uvicorn
pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code>   

<p>The dependencies will be added to your requirements.txt file.</p>

 Create a New Endpoint 

<p>For this tutorial, you’ll use a single <code>main.py</code> file that contains all your routes. You can <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/">break this file up as your application grows</a>, but since you’ll just be adding a couple of endpoints, you don’t need to worry about that now.</p>

<p>Create the <code>main.py</code> file in your project’s root directory and add the following:</p>

   <code>from fastapi import FastAPI


app = FastAPI()


# Hello World route
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

</code>   

 Accessing Your API 

<p>When using FastAPI, there are two ways you can access your API. You can use an API explorer like <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>, or you can use FastAPI’s interactive documentation in your browser. This tutorial will focus on the latter.</p>

<p>To start your application, run the Uvicorn server:</p>

   <code>uvicorn main:app --reload
</code>   

<p>Then, open <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000</code> in your browser to see your “Hello, world” endpoint in action:</p>

<p></p>

<p>FastAPI’s interactive documentation is available at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>. Once you’re there, you’ll see details about each endpoint automatically. FastAPI uses type hints and context in your application to produce these docs on its own.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you’ve seen how easy it is to get started, you’re ready to build a more useful application. In the remainder of this tutorial, you’ll see how to create protected endpoints in FastAPI that use Okta as an authorization server.</p>

 Securing FastAPI with Okta 

<p>To demonstrate some of the more advanced features of the FastAPI framework, I’ll show you how to build a protected endpoint that uses <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-client-creds/overview/">the client credentials flow</a> to authorize access. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to enter your Okta client ID and secret into FastAPI’s interactive docs to get an access token. You’ll see how to validate this JWT access token remotely using Okta’s <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#introspect">introspect</a> endpoint and locally using the <a href="https://github.com/adithyasampatoor/okta_jwt">Okta JWT Python library</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to run the final application, <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-fastapi">the code is available on GitHub</a>, or you can follow along for step-by-step instructions.</p>

 Setting Up a New Application in Okta 

<p>Before you create any endpoints in your FastAPI application, you’ll need to create a new application in Okta and get your Authorization Server’s issuer URL and audience. As you go through these steps, add the Okta environment variables to a new file in your application called <code>.env</code>. You’ll see how to use these variables later in the tutorial.</p>

<p>To create a new server application, log in to your Okta account and go to Applications and click the Add Application button in the top left. Select Service, Machine-to-Machine, then click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter a name for your application and click Next again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from this page and add them to your FastAPI application’s <code>.env</code> file as <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET</code> respectively.</p>

<p>Your <code>.env</code> file should look like the example below, with your <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET</code> values filled out:</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Next, go to API &gt; Authorization Servers. Copy the Issuer URI and Audience, and add them as the <code>OKTA_ISSUER</code> and <code>OKTA_AUDIENCE</code> environment variables in your <code>.env</code> file.</p>

<p>Your <code>.env</code> file should now look something like this:</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=
OKTA_ISSUER="https://SOMETHING_HERE.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default"
OKTA_AUDIENCE="api://default"
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Now that you have your environment variables, you need to create a custom scope for your authorization server. Your FastAPI application will request a token with this scope. Click the pencil icon to edit the authorization server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Scopes tab and then the Add Scopes button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Give your scope a Name and Display phrase so you can identify it. I used <code>items</code> for the scope name since the example here is pretty generic, but it’s a good idea to be specific about the resources users will gain access to when requesting a scope.</p>

<p>Click Create when you’re finished.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you’ve created a new application, set up a custom scope, and set your environment variables, you’re ready to call the Okta authorization server from your FastAPI application.</p>

 Retrieving an Access Token in FastAPI 

<p>The client credentials authorization flow requires users to enter a client ID and secret. The authorization server will then return an access token that allows the user to access the API. When using Okta, you’ll call the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#token"><code>/token</code> endpoint</a>, passing your client ID and secret in as the authorization header.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/774">set FastAPI to call an external authentication endpoint like Okta’s</a>, but it requires a bit more custom code. Because the documentation’s API call originates from the browser, you also introduce further security considerations.</p>

<p>The easiest way to request an access token is to use the <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/">Python HTTPX library</a> to call the Okta <code>/token</code> endpoint from your API.</p>

<p>First, install HTTPX:</p>

   <code>pip install httpx
pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code>   

<p>Next, open your <code>main.py</code> file and add the following:</p>

   <code>from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, Request
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
import httpx
from starlette.config import Config


# Load environment variables
config = Config('.env')

app = FastAPI()

# Define the auth scheme and access token URL
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl='token')


# Call the Okta API to get an access token
def retrieve_token(authorization, issuer, scope='items'):
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'authorization': authorization,
        'cache-control': 'no-cache',
        'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    }
    data = {
        'grant_type': 'client_credentials',
        'scope': scope,
    }
    url = issuer + '/v1/token'

    response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

    if response.status_code == httpx.codes.OK:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=response.text)


# Get auth token endpoint
@app.post('/token')
def login(request: Request):
    return retrieve_token(
        request.headers['authorization'],
        config('OKTA_ISSUER'),
        'items'
    )
</code>   

<p>This creates a new endpoint (<code>/token</code>) in your FastAPI application that passes the request’s <code>Authorization</code> header on to your Okta authorization server. It also includes your custom scope (<code>'items'</code>).</p>

 Creating a Protected Endpoint 

<p>Now that you have an endpoint that generates a token, you are ready to create a new endpoint that checks the token before granting access.</p>

<p>Before you worry about token validation, create the new endpoint and <code>validate</code> function. You’ll add the logic to this function in the next step, but for testing purposes, you can simply return <code>True</code>.</p>

   <code>...
# Add these to your imports
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel

...

# Validate the token
def validate(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    # TODO: Add token validation logic
    return True


# Data model
class Item(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str


# Protected, get items route
@app.get('/items', response_model=List[Item])
def read_items(valid: bool = Depends(validate)):
    return [
        Item.parse_obj({'id': 1, 'name': 'red ball'}),
        Item.parse_obj({'id': 2, 'name': 'blue square'}),
        Item.parse_obj({'id': 3, 'name': 'purple ellipse'}),
    ]
</code>   

<p>The new <code>/items</code> endpoint includes a <code>response_model</code> definition. This allows FastAPI to generate documentation for your endpoint with a sample response. It uses FastAPI’s dependency injection pattern to call the <code>validate</code> function. In turn, that function injects the <code>oauth2_scheme</code>, which extracts the access token for you.</p>

<p>To view the interactive documentation, start the Uvicorn server (if you stopped it earlier), and go to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To test the authorization flow, click the grey lock in the top right corner of the endpoint. Enter your Okta client ID and secret (you can ignore the username and password fields) and click Authorize.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, click Try it out then Execute to call the endpoint. FastAPI’s documentation automatically stores and injects your access token. Because the <code>validate</code> function you created above never throws an exception, the API will show you the equivalent <code>curl</code> request and respond with the list of items.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you see how the interactive documentation is generated and how access tokens can be used, you are ready to implement token validation.</p>

 Validating Access Tokens Remotely 

<p>There are two ways to validate JWT access tokens generated by Okta. The first method you’ll see uses the Okta authorization server’s <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#introspect"><code>/inspect</code> endpoint</a> to check the token. The advantage of this method is that you will know if the token has been revoked; the downside is that it’s slower than validating the JWT locally.</p>

<p>To validate access tokens remotely, update your <code>validate</code> function, and add the following <code>validate_remotely</code> function:</p>

   <code>
def validate_remotely(token, issuer, clientId, clientSecret):
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'cache-control': 'no-cache',
        'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    }
    data = {
        'client_id': clientId,
        'client_secret': clientSecret,
        'token': token,
    }
    url = issuer + '/v1/introspect'

    response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

    return response.status_code == httpx.codes.OK and response.json()['active']


def validate(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    res = validate_remotely(
        token,
        config('OKTA_ISSUER'),
        config('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'),
        config('OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET')
    )

    if res:
        return True
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400)
</code>   

<p>Now, refresh the docs, generate an access token by entering your Okta client ID and secret again, and call the <code>/items</code> endpoint. You should see a <code>200 Success</code> response again with the items. This endpoint is now calling the Okta authorization server on every request.</p>

 Validating Access Tokens Locally 

<p>Because access tokens are generally short-lived (an hour by default), you might <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/go/overview/">prefer to validate the tokens locally</a>. This method is slightly less secure because you can’t be sure that the access token hasn’t been revoked remotely, but on the other hand, you don’t have to use your Okta client secret to validate the token locally. Finally, local validation is significantly faster because you don’t have to make a request to the Okta authorization server with every API call. You’ll have to decide which method is most appropriate for your application.</p>

<p>To validate the access token locally, install the <a href="https://github.com/adithyasampatoor/okta_jwt">Okta JWT Python package</a>:</p>

   <code>pip install okta_jwt
pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code>   

<p>Next, import the package’s <code>validate_token</code> function and update the <code>validate</code> function in your <code>main.py</code> file:</p>

   <code>...
from okta_jwt.jwt import validate_token as validate_locally

...

def validate(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    try:
        res = validate_locally(
            token,
            config('OKTA_ISSUER'),
            config('OKTA_AUDIENCE'),
            config('OKTA_CLIENT_ID')
        )
        return bool(res)
    except Exception:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403)
...
</code>   

<p>When you call the <code>/items</code> endpoint, the API will decode the JWT and validate it locally. The decoded JWTs are cached, so subsequent requests will be faster than the first one.</p>

 Learn More About Python and REST APIs 
<p>In this post, you’ve seen how to use FastAPI to build a REST API endpoint that uses an external authorization server to generate and validate access tokens. You’ve seen some of the key features of FastAPI in action, including dependency injection, the OpenAPI documentation, type hinting, and OAuth implementation.</p>

<p>FastAPI is a great option for building secure and performant backend systems. While there’s much more to building a robust production API, including testing, handling POST and PUT endpoints, and connecting to a database for persistence, I hope this tutorial helps you get started.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about FastAPI, I suggest the following resources:</p>

   CEO Perspective 

<p>In 2020 we witnessed radical changes in how we live, work and play, requiring all of us to embrace “remote everything.” The world’s reliance on digital access has never been more profound, and watching how our customers stepped up to new challenges to keep their virtual doors open has been inspiring.</p>

<p>Some of the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/our-customers">customer</a> stories I’ve heard this year stand out because of their massive scale and transformative effects. A luxury car maker was able to onboard 25 million new consumer and workforce applications in just seconds. A financial services customer was able to deploy the recent release of the ForgeRock platform in just 25% of the time that it took them to deploy earlier versions - and they did this using just half the number of resources previously required. And one of our major healthcare customers was able to identify 550,000 excess entitlements among 14.6 million assignments within three hours and reduce their cybersecurity risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The enhancements we made to the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> this year were incredible, and when combined with our commitment to customer success, it was truly a special year at ForgeRock. We hired nearly two hundred new ForgeRockers to the team, deepened relationships with our partners, onboarded exciting new customers like Calabrio and BTPN Bank, and grew existing relationships with Allianz, BMW, BBC, Verizon, Australian Securities Exchange and WW (Weight Watchers). And topping it off was industry recognition from three major industry analyst firms that named ForgeRock an <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">identity and access management</a> leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished together. Take a look at some of the highlights.&nbsp;</p>

 A Growing Presence in the Cloud&nbsp; 

<p>We made significant investments in the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> and our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-expands-leadership-team-extend-success-cloud-and-identity">Cloud Success </a>operational model, keeping our customers top of mind as we rolled out new features. We took configurability to the next level to enable customers to deliver superior omnichannel experiences to their users and secure all of their workforce and consumer identities. We introduced a one-subscription model to provide complete deployment flexibility in data centers, private clouds or public cloud. And, our full tenant isolation ensures that all customer data is stored separately so you can rest easy knowing that your data is safe and secure.</p>

 Platform Upgrades&nbsp; 

<p>We introduced one of our biggest <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> updates in company history. The addition of AI-driven intelligence in ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a> provides a deeper understanding of the risks associated with user access and reduces costs. We also introduced ForgeRock<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access"> </a><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access</a>, which helps customers create seamless and secure experiences that adapt to your users’ needs in real time. This new release also added <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">ForgeRock Go,</a> making passwords and usernames a thing of the past.&nbsp;</p>

 Expanding Our Partner Network&nbsp; 

<p>Our Trust Network continues to be one of our greatest assets as it has expanded to over 90 technology partners extending the value of the ForgeRock Identity Platform. Today nearly half of our new customers will leverage at least one <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">Trust Network</a> partner as part of their complete Identity Solution. Our partnership program gained momentum as we expanded relationships with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/partner/google-cloud">Google Cloud</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/partner/aws">AWS</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-joins-microsoft-intelligent-security-association">Microsoft</a>. In April, we joined the Google Cloud co-sell program and our Google Cloud marketplace listing, which will enable us to further expand our sales pipeline, is coming soon. We continued to expand our partnership with AWS as an advanced technology partner, and joined the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA) in September, providing an integration with Microsoft Cloud Security services to help reduce risk and strengthen compliance for our joint customers.</p>

 Corporate Updates 

<p>We’re excited to share that ForgeRock earned major recognition from top industry analysts this year. We’ve been named a leader in access management and customer identity and access management (CIAM) – by top <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports">analyst </a>firms. These analysts have highlighted our ability to provide exceptional digital experiences while meeting our customers’ requirements for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">privacy and compliance.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>ForgeRock also achieved an important milestone that put us one step closer to becoming one of the premier digital identity companies in the market. In April, we secured an additional $93.5 million in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/series-e-funding-marks-momentous-day-forgerock">Series E funding</a>&nbsp;led by Riverwood Capital, with our existing investors, Accel, Meritech Capital, Foundation Capital and KKR Growth also participating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want to thank all of you – our customers, partners and employees – for your support and hard work this year. As we move into 2021, we will continue to stay focused on our purpose: to help people simply and safely access the connected world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wish you a healthy, safe and joyful holiday season!</p>

 <p>Not having access to the Internet or <a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4241397">not knowing how to use digital tools is a handicap for nearly 17% of the French population</a>, according to a study by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE). This digital illiteracy particularly affects the most fragile populations and is closely linked to what is commonly known as the digital divide.</p>
<p>Although our uses, our administrative procedures and our relationships with others have never been as online as they are today, inequalities persist among the oldest people, those with fewer qualifications and those on modest incomes. However, digital technology is not intended to aggravate inequalities and must not become an obstacle to integration into today's society but, on the contrary, a valuable aid. A few months ago, <a href="http://www.cemea.asso.fr/">CEMÉA</a>, a group of associations and a major player in the popular education movement came knocking at the door of our cosy cloud to propose a project that has just been deployed...</p>
 Introduction 
<p>First of all, it is important to remind you that our mission at <a href="https://cozy.io/en/about/">Cozy Cloud</a> is to democratise the digital home with a simple tool for the technical reappropriation of its data.</p>
<p>Because we strongly believe that for a society to be democratic, individuals must control their personal data themselves, we have developed a personal data platform for a new approach to digital inclusion - a kind of new channel to create a real digital proximity with users, to empower them digitally.</p>
 Cozy and digital inclusion 
<p>By definition, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_num%C3%A9rique">digital inclusion</a> is a process that aims to make digital technology accessible to every individual and to provide them with the digital skills that will be a leverage for their social and economic inclusion.</p>
<p>This process includes the establishment of a set of policies and strategies that aim to lead to the creation of an "inclusive" information society, which can benefit everyone without excluding citizens from marginalised communities. These policies are developed taking into account the social and economic reality of individuals. They aim to put in place ways of overcoming digital exclusion in order to promote access for all. This can be done through access and education to tools, training and learning, etc., aiming at the autonomy of people in the use of new technologies. A nationwide plan has been deployed for <a href="https://www.cohesion-territoires.gouv.fr/inclusion-numerique-favoriser-lapprentissage-du-numerique-et-developper-les-usages">this purpose</a>.</p>
 La clé d'accès à mes droits" (The key to access my rights): Project by CEMEA in partnership with Cozy Cloud and with the support of Secours Populaire Français, Samu Social de Paris, AFNIC Foundation and Framasoft. 
<p>Today, access to rights requires a real mastery of the digital world (applying for benefits, updating CAF and RSA files, etc.). However, for many people, particularly the most vulnerable (young people who have dropped out of school, homeless people, asylum seekers, women victims of violence, etc.), this remains a complex task.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The project "The key to access my rights" consists of enabling people in a situation of fragility in their relationships or access to digital technology to regain their autonomy and pursue their emancipation while preserving their personal data, in order to strengthen their access to their social rights.</p>
<p>It is inspired by the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framakey">Framasoft's Framakey project</a>, i.e. a USB key containing the embedded applications (without any personal data being stored on it) enabling everyone to find their personal space simplified whatever the machine used.</p>
<p>Access to the key is completely secure. The helper's data is synchronised with an online personal space. In addition, this also serves as a portal to access various services. This object also symbolises the reappropriation of data belonging to people on the road to digital autonomy.</p>
<p>This project has been designed as a whole:</p>
 
 political (reappropriating one's rights, etc.), 
 technical (simplicity and data protection), 
 deontological (to put the accompanying persons in the right place by holding personal data), 
 educational (support the training of users and support staff in the use of the key), 
 partner (by associating field actors and users in the construction of the tool and support). 
 
<p>In addition, this project aims at decomplexifying the ubuesque situations in the accompaniment of people by professionals and/or volunteers (passwords entrusted to third parties in public digital spaces, non-disconnected transfers on public computers, sometimes very personal attachments present in the "download" folder of these same computers, etc.).</p>
<p>Moreover, it is complex and even almost impossible for vulnerable and sometimes homeless people to keep all the documents that enable them to assert their rights, or even simply "souvenirs" or personal objects such as a simple photograph.</p>
<p>Our administrative procedures are increasingly dematerialised and this results in risks, in particular the non-use of rights. Many people are no longer in a position to carry out their own procedures. As a result, many end up delegating their procedures to a third party so that they can continue to access their services and rights. This assistance sometimes turns into a real situation of interference, which is partially suffered.</p>
<p>It is therefore with great pride that <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy</a>, as a simplified personal space, complements this project with the Secours Populaire Français, the Samu Social de Paris, the CEMEA and the Afnic Foundation (French Association for Cooperative Internet Naming).</p>
 Relevance of the Cozy digital home 
<p>Managing online services is complicated: you have to manage your identities and passwords to connect to services that have become essential (CAF, RSA, Pôle emploi, Social Security, etc.), often from a mobile phone, find the website address, navigate the site to find the right information or fill in the right form.</p>
<p>To carry out their administrative procedures, individuals are confronted with a multitude of services and sometimes complex technologies. The digital home developed by <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy</a> simplifies these procedures.</p>
<p>Mon-domicile-num-rique](/en/content/images/2020/11/Mon-domicile-num-rique.png)</p>
<p>Cozy brings together several services (storage applications, bank aggregator, password, contact and photo manager) and data, simplifying usage with simple and easy to use features: direct links to share a folder or document, password management with automatic filling or generation of strong passwords, automatic online data retrieval with a single click, alerts and help with budget tracking.</p>
<p>All this in a context that places the individual truly in a "home" - a digital home, which he can keep beyond the initial provision, which he can move to...</p>
<p><a href="https://cozy.io/en/"></a></p>
 From assistance to autonomy 
<p>Cozy thus becomes an immediately operational solution to simplify the digital daily life of these people in a precarious situation and enable the effectiveness of aid by guaranteeing :</p>
<p>✓Easy access to the rights of the person receiving aid<br>
✓Facility and secure actions of those accompanying them<br>
✓Back up of passwords / identities of the person being helped<br>
✓all the personal data are secure (supporting documents, photo, contacts, bank details, etc.)</p>
 A frictionless and uncomplicated grip for both parties 
<p></p>
 
 
<p>The Cozy digital home then provides several services to the person being helped:</p>
 
 "My Accounts": direct access to their bank accounts, which allows them to monitor their cash inflows/outflows 
 "My Contacts" : directory of people to contact, in particular the carer and other people essential to the management of his administrative life. 
 "My Photos" : backup folder and organisation of your photos 
 "My Rights" : direct access to the website <a href="https://www.mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr/accueil/">https://www.mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr/accueil/</a> 
 "My Papers" : access to the backup of your identity papers and retrieve your pdf's, certificates and other documents automatically recovered without any action on your part thanks to connectors (for example Ameli and Impots.Gouv). 
 "My Notes": direct access to notes shared by the carer 
 "My Mails": direct access to your webmail (upcoming feature). 
 
 
 
<p>Each helped person (= new user with a personal cloud) is accompanied by a helper (= companion), trained and available to help him/her progress in the reappropriation of his/her data, papers and other necessary documents.</p>
 
 
<p>The person being helped has a USB key with which they can open their Cozy digital home from any PC. The content of this key will be systematically synchronised in the assisted person's digital home. The USB key symbolises physically the possession of their data (in addition, for some people concerned, the assurance that they no longer run the risk of losing a photo, letter, diploma, etc., the only witnesses to their story) even if they will obviously be kept in a cloud. The key is really only the simplified access key to one's personal space, inaccessible without a password. The browser - Firefox- is installed and configured on the key, so that the person being helped does not leave any personal data (cookie, browsing history, etc.) on the computer on which he or she inserts the key to access his or her personal space.<br>
In the event of loss or destruction of the key, it will nevertheless be very simple to reconstitute a new one from the data saved on the digital home.</p>
 
 
<p>The Pass extension, the password manager is already installed in the private Firefox browser available on the USB key. The person being helped thus federates and secures all their identities and passwords in their Cozy so that they do not lose them and are always at hand.</p>
 
 
<p>The Cozy of the person being helped thus becomes a place to share documents (via sharing often read-only in Drive) and help to recover passwords (if the carer needs to find this or that paper/lamp).</p>
 
 
<p>This is a paradigm shift for the person receiving assistance, who until now has been on the fringes of digital use and who, by reappropriating and controlling his data in his digital home, becomes a real player in his digital life and a citizen again.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We are convinced that our collective digital sovereignty will be the sum up of individual digital autonomies and it is by allowing each individual to control their data in a personal space to which they hold the key that we will achieve this. **At Cozy Cloud, we want the emancipation of each individual and not their manipulation or exclusion from society through digital technology.</p>
<p>A big thank you to the CEMEAs for having taken us on this adventure that gives a key back to those who need it.</p>

 🔄 Cozy Drive 
 Cozy Drive - synchronization application 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/releases/tag/v3.24.1">version 3.24</a> fixes some residual issues that occur in rare cases (especially when moving files under MacOS) and paves the way for the developments we have started to work on.</p>
 
 
<p>Under MacOS, we fixed a bug that prevented some successive moves of the same document, especially if the user has an HFS+ partition and there is an automatic change of the UTF-8 encoding of the path.</p>
 
 
<p>The permission to execute files under macOS and Linux is kept even when the file is also synchronized on a PC under Windows (which doesn't have this kind of permission).</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://cozy.io/en/download/"></a></p>
 
 
<p>When a local folder and a remote folder of the same name are linked together, the metadata of the remote folder is updated.</p>
 
 
<p>Storing the local metadata allows us to better detect when a remote change to a file has been saved but not applied to the local disk before a client restart. So we can now do without a backup copy to the local file trash when we decide to apply this remote change.</p>
 
 
<p>I can confirm that the features you are waiting for are under development and will arrive beginning 2021.</p>

 Cozy Drive - web 
<p>The sharing path has been completly reviewed and the team is working to make the experience as fluid as possible. Let's get down to the details:</p>
<p>✨ adding a preview link of the share directly in your Cozy if the Cozy of the sender knows the URL</p>
<p>✨ you can now find out if a folder or document you have shared has been viewed</p>
<p>✨ remove the share request step if the recipient URL is already known</p>
<p>✨ improvement of the sharing window with a separation between the upper part dedicated to sending by e-mail or contact and the lower part dedicated to sharing by link. This makes the modal more airy and clearer.</p>
<p>✨ appearance of a red badge in your Cozy on new shares you have not yet consulted</p>
<p>✨ the share link sent by email (or added in the Cozy) has been shortened</p>
<p>You can find the details of the possibilities on <a href="https://help.cozy.io/article/485-how-to-share-files-or-folders-with-your-cozy">our FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>By Simone Hill, Senior Manager, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Illustration by <a href="https://www.tiphughes.com/">Tiffany&nbsp;Hughes</a>.<p>In June, <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">Omidyar Network committed $500,000 to organizations fighting on the frontlines for racial justice</a> because we firmly believe that this work is core to our ability to create inclusive, equitable societies. While the funding is an essential step toward our vision, the way we invested was also critical to developing thoughtful partnerships with organizations already building or scaling innovations.</p><p>What does it mean to invest in justice? It begins with a clear-eyed recognition of the systemic racism that manifests within all of our systems to undermine the safety of Black and Brown people. Investing in justice means attacking the many resulting symptoms of white supremacy at their root by finding organizations working to innovate and advance holistic ways to create lasting change. It means being strategic and careful about ensuring that while we are looking for ways to address the wrongs that pervade our societies, we are not inadvertently causing more harm. With that, an awareness of our own limitations as a funder is required –– financial investments are a step at the beginning of a long-term journey towards holistic, strategic action. Finally, investing in justice means continuing to integrate racial justice with our firm-wide focus to reimagine systems: building an economy that works for all — an anti-racist economy is a <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">key pillar of our point of view</a>; realizing the promise of responsible technology; and fostering a more pluralistic society.</p><p>We searched around the country for Black-led organizations whose work combined economic, civic, or criminal justice reform with narrative shift or movement building towards racial justice. Among many organizations doing incredible work, the following five are achieving impact in ways that align with our current strategic focus.</p> Large Scale Change, Powered by Deep Networks: <a href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/centering-blackness-the-path-to-economic-liberation-for-all-f6c2c7398281">Centering Blackness Initiative</a> <p>Spearheaded by three dynamic women of color, the Insight Center for Community Economic Development has developed the <a href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/centering-blackness-the-path-to-economic-liberation-for-all-f6c2c7398281">Centering Blackness Initiative</a>; a lens to identify how and where economic policies, practices, and institutions harm Black&nbsp;people.</p>Graphic illustration from Insight Center’s Power Learning Community<p>A multi-pronged approach to systemic change, the Initiative is a new framework for examining and reimagining systems. It is accompanied by a set of tools, currently in development, to encourage multiracial, progressive organizations to adopt the framework. Not only will organizations be supported to develop new internal operations through this lens, but they can also adopt it for their policy advocacy campaigns.</p><p>Because narrative shift is a critical component of the Centering Blackness Initiative, the Insight Center has also launched the <a href="https://www.blackthoughtproject.com/">Black Thought Project</a> to create safe spaces in cities that center, celebrate, and protect Black thoughts and expression.</p>Black Thought Project installation <a href="http://www.blackthoughtproject.com/">www.blackthoughtproject.com</a> Systems Change in the Informal Economy: <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">Equity &amp; Transformation</a> <p>“Black informal workers are resilient and creative, and they have constructed an informal economy to acquire a means of subsistence,” — Richard Wallace, founder, and director of <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">Equity &amp; Transformation</a> (EAT).</p>(Right) Richard Wallace, Founder and director of&nbsp;EAT<p>Founded in 2018, EAT is the only organization in the United States, specifically focused on protecting and uplifting Black workers operating in the informal economy. Defined as a set of unregulated economic activities, the informal economy includes street vending, childcare, auto-mechanic, and moving services — activities which allow people who cannot find standard employment to make a living, but without the protection of formal labor standards.</p><p>While EAT’s work includes research and policy development to destigmatize the informal economy, the organization also educates workers about their protections. EAT spearheads and collaborates on campaigns across Chicago to improve the lives of Black workers in the informal economy. The Guaranteed Income Project, for instance, provides previously incarcerated individuals with $500 per month to help cover their bills, find homes, and ultimately, reduce recidivism.</p>EAT <a href="http://www.eatchicago.org/">www.eatchicago.org</a> Building Power through Black Leadership: <a href="https://www.jwj.org/our-work/absi">Advancing Black Strategists Initiative</a> <p>Black leadership is critical to the success of racial and economic justice movements, but while BIPOC are often the implementers of social change campaigns, they rarely drive the strategies that energize these movements. The <a href="https://www.jwj.org/our-work/absi">Advancing Black Strategists Initiative</a> (ABSI)—a joint project led by The Jobs With Justice Education Fund, in collaboration with the Black Worker Initiative at the Institute for Policy Studies and Morehouse College—is raising a cohort of Black economic-justice and labor-focused strategists to lead, develop, and advance policies and campaigns.</p><p>ABSI will provide the tools and knowledge to equip Black strategists to work from the strength of their lived experiences, to inspire participation and engagement around polices that center Black economic justice. As this new generation of Black leaders takes on bigger roles and builds and wields power across movements, they will ultimately strengthen Black institutions, advance economic democracy, and change the socio-economic conditions of the Black community.</p> Narrative Shift at the Intersection of Race and Technology: <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet&nbsp;Enquiry</a> <p>While technology permeates our everyday lives, it is another system where built-in white supremacy limits both usage and accessibility by Black&nbsp;people.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet Enquiry</a> (a newly-founded interdisciplinary research center at UCLA) aims to use art and storytelling to reimagine technology, and in the process, champion racial justice, reframe our understanding of the role of technology in our lives, and strengthen democracy by holding those who create unjust systems and technologies accountable.</p><p>Over the next year, artist-in-residence, film-maker <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7307049">Oge Egbounu</a>, will work alongside the center’s co-directors and racial justice lead, to translate the center’s work into cultural artifacts that can resonate with a broad audience. This project creates a unique opportunity to develop cultural artifacts grounded in the center’s research that can shift narratives for mass audiences and tech workers alike, to more intentionally use and create technology in ways that do not harm&nbsp;others.</p> A Clear Path Forward: <a href="https://m4bl.org/">Movement for Black&nbsp;Lives</a> <p><a href="https://m4bl.org/">Movement for Black Lives</a> has a courageous vision: a long-term plan to shift the consciousness toward racial reckoning, and an ability to chart a clear path towards their goal. Fiscally sponsored by the Common Counsel Foundation, the Movement for Black Lives’ Black Power Rising: Vision 2024 seeks to build the social, political, institutional, and collective power of Black people by harnessing the collective power and creativity of Black people. Grounded in Black culture, the initiative aims to bring an informed electorate to the table to drive anti-racist policy&nbsp;shifts.</p><p>This strategic five-year plan will guide the coalition’s programmatic and campaign efforts to build mass support for progressive policies that center the needs of Black people. A core part of this work will equip local leaders with tools and strategies to build power within and between their organizations, scale engagement around political participation, and attack white supremacy by ensuring political representation and leadership, especially in Black communities.</p>Illustration by <a href="https://www.tiphughes.com/">Tiffany&nbsp;Hughes</a>. Restorative Justice Requires Restorative Investment <p>Why invest specifically in narrative shifting, and power-building in the intersections between movements, institutions, and Black leadership? Why look for spaces that prioritize economic justice in underfunded regions? Because we believe that this is where organizations are creating innovative, holistic solutions to specific problems that will generate the most significant returns.</p><p>In the course of identifying these organizations, we collaborated with five of our sister organizations within <a href="https://www.omidyargroup.com/">The Omidyar Group</a> —<a href="https://democracyfund.org/"> Democracy Fund</a>, <a href="https://flourishventures.com/">Flourish</a>, <a href="https://humanityunited.org/">Humanity United</a>, <a href="https://www.imaginablefutures.com/">Imaginable Futures</a>, and <a href="https://luminategroup.com/">Luminate</a> — to jointly fund two regranting organizations focused on supporting grassroots racial justice groups. Emergent Fund (a fiscally sponsored project of Amalgamated Charitable Foundation) quickly moves no strings attached resources to communities of color under attack by federal policies and priorities. Liberated Capital Fund of the Decolonizing Wealth Project (fiscally sponsored by Allied Media Projects) provides unrestricted resources through a reparations model to Black and Indigenous-led organizations to shape a future where we can all heal from generations of colonial trauma. As a result of the substantial work we’ve seen around the country, we will have exceeded our initial goal and invested a total of $1,050,000.</p><p>We believe that these investments are a significant step towards creating the world we are advancing toward in our mission as an organization. But this is only a first step. We are committed to building true partnerships with these organizations, putting our relevant resources at their disposal, and amplifying their work to a broader audience of both practitioners and funders. Investing in justice means much more than dollars; it is a whole-hearted commitment by our institution.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/an-investment-in-justice-bad462284f27">An Investment in Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Luxembourg, December 16, 2020 — <a href="http://cbinsights.com">CB Insights</a> today named Tokeny Solutions in its inaugural <a href="http://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/blockchain-technology-companies">Blockchain 50 ranking</a>, a list of the top private companies applying or analyzing blockchain technology to solve business or consumer problems across various industries.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with Blockdata, the 2020 Blockchain 50 cohort includes companies from all around the globe across varying investment stages of development, from early-stage startups to well-funded unicorns.</p>

		 
	 
    Blockchain moved from possible to practical in 2020 as evidenced by the enterprise adoption we tracked. At the same time, the blockchain company ecosystem also became more crowded, creating noise and uncertainty for enterprises as they evaluate vendors and partners. The Blockchain 50, which we've created in conjunction with Blockdata, was born out of a desire to reduce that uncertainty and recognize the pioneering companies using the blockchain.  Anand SanwalCB Insights CEO     <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/blockchain-technology-companies/"> </a>     This inaugural class of the Blockchain 50 is tackling a range of use cases across trade finance, capital markets, exchanges and more and are being used by banks, governments and major retailers. We’re excited to see the impact the Blockchain 50 will have on industries as their solutions are deployed and to see the continued evolution of blockchain technology as it matures.  Anand SanwalCB Insights CEO       2020 has been a year where blockchain has made some important steps in becoming a reputable and accepted piece of technology. The digital assets industry has grown phenomenally. CBDCs have manifested on the agendas of major governments, regulations have progressed and there have been more security token issuances, particularly in real estate. All of this has only fuelled interest in security tokens, and many now see the path to private market liquidity. We are pleased to have further recognition in this vision by the CB Insights Blokchcain 50 and are excited to be included in such an impressive cohort of companies.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions    
	 
		 
			<p>Tokeny Solutions marked some important industry milestones in 2020. It was a year in which they accelerated private market adoption; they tokenized a total of $27bn in asset value, were selected by the government of Monaco as its tokenization platform and teamed up with the major banks in France to explore the use of a digital currency. Through the institutional-grade T-REX protocol, they are bringing genuine asset transferability to private markets, an industry that has always been starved of liquidity.</p>
<p>Through an evidence-based approach, the CB Insights research team, in collaboration with Blockdata, selected the Blockchain 50 from thousands of applications and nominees, based on factors including patent activity, business relations, investor profiles, news sentiment analysis, proprietary Mosaic scores, market potential, competitive landscape, team strength, and tech novelty.</p>
<p>Quick facts on the 2020 Blockchain 50:</p>
 
 The 2020 Blockchain 50 companies have raised over $3B in aggregate equity funding across 110+ deals since 2017. 
 The list includes five unicorns (companies valued at or above $1B). 
 While the majority of the companies are based in North America, 40% of the 2020 Blockchain 50 winners are based outside the United States, in countries such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland and Luxembourg. 
 Blockchain Capital, Castle Island Ventures, Kinetic Capital, Pantera Capital, and Valar Ventures are the most active venture investors in the Blockchain 50, with 5 investments each since 2017. 
 

		 
	 
   
	 
		 
			 About Tokeny Solutions 
<p>Tokeny Solutions allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny Solutions enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments.</p>
<p>The multi-award winning firm is the leading tokenization platform and the creator of the T-REX, the institutional-grade security token protocol. The Luxembourg-based company works with its strategic shareholder Euronext to bring next-generation of infrastructure to the private markets industry.</p>

<p>A blog by MyLife Digital’s Managing Director, Jay Cromack</p>

<p>We are living in a world of surveillance capitalism. From our shopping habits to our fitness routines, even health apps holding our prescription history are becoming more intensely tracked by technology. Globally, we now have some of the strictest privacy and data protection laws, yet many of the technologies in place today appear to be too complex for regulators to enforce against [1]. This ultimately creates an ever-increasing gap between what we can do with data and what we should do with data. It is essential for the sake of building trust with consumers that organisations now go beyond what they can legally do and adopt ethical frameworks for the use of people’s data. As I like to say, if you can’t explain it to your grandma without it sounding creepy you probably shouldn’t be doing it, and therefore ethical frameworks will bridge this gap between the ‘getting away with it’ implementers and the ‘doing it right’ winners!</p>

<p>As consumers become more aware of this increased surveillance, data ethics will continue to grow in strategic importance because it can help to build trust. As highlighted in the recent paper from the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), ethics is now three times more important to company trust than competence. They also unearthed that trusted companies grow faster and an increase of 1% in brand trust translates to 3% growth in value [2].</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn that members of the WFA are now looking beyond their own organisations to the industry as a whole for solutions. They realise they must hold their suppliers and partners to account for high standards of ethics and transparency in data. This will hopefully see the end of the opaque, invisible processing activities the MarTech and AdTech world have relied on so heavily for the past decade.</p>

<p>At MyLife Digital we have spent the last 5 years building a personal data infrastructure to connect an individual to the data an organisation collects and holds about them.&nbsp; We enable organisations to be transparent with individuals across all their consumer touchpoints and empower them to make decisions over how their data can and can’t be used, who it can be shared with, and capture preferences to better inform personalisation and experiences. Our infrastructure then orchestrates those consents, permissions, and preferences across all data using services and applications. And to grow trust and demonstrate accountability the platform maintains a fully auditable record available to both the organisation and the consumer via a simple Privacy UX dashboard.</p>

 Voting just got a whole more&nbsp;secure. <p>The two blockchain companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding and entered into a technological partnership. As part of the deal, the companies will share their tech experience and vision, provide mutual consulting on their blockchain solutions, and jointly develop and integrate related technologies.</p><p>The parties are especially interested in applying the <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">Decentralized Identity Solution (DeID)</a> developed by Ontology, in a <a href="https://we.vote/">blockchain-based e-voting system</a> recently launched by Waves Enterprise.</p><p>Voting technologies similar to those used in Waves Enterprise’s online voting service were tested and applied in an e-voting system developed for the Russian Central Election Commission by Rostelecom and Waves Enterprise during the single voting day in the Russian Federation, when more than 30,000 people took part in voting. This system employed the Russian unified identification and authentication system to identify users, which is centralized and not available to corporate users.</p><p>User authentication and identification are weak points of any e-voting system, even if it is fully implemented on a blockchain and utilizes advanced encryption. Together, the companies will explore how to integrate DID technologies into the voting service so that corporate users can seamlessly use and benefit from a fully decentralized approach.</p><p>“To implement and launch the voting process in some types of legal entities, we need to integrate our e-voting platform with KYC service providers, since trusted user authentication and verification is an essential requirement. Ontology DeID is a promising product that can help reach these goals. Therefore, we are focused on mutually beneficial cooperation and deep integration of our products.’’ — said Artem Kalikhov, CPO at Waves Enterprise.</p><p>Ontology’s founder, Li Jun, said: “Voting is a new and profound application for identity verification and privacy. It is one area that Ontology is excited to integrate with, as our DeID can do wonders to ensure that the identities and data of people who vote are not only protected, but also verified — a central issue facing many elections around the world. We look forward to deeper partnerships with Waves Enterprise, and hope that our technologies can work well together!”</p><p>About Waves Enterprise</p><p><a href="https://wavesenterprise.com">Waves Enterprise</a> — is an enterprise-grade blockchain platform for building fault-tolerant digital infrastructures. It combines both public and private networks as a hybrid solution, offering a high degree of data privacy and throughput, configurable encryption that can be tailored to local standards, and language-agnostic containerized smart contracts.</p><p>Waves Enterprise is one of the leaders in the market of corporate blockchain platforms. It has been used to implement projects for major Russian companies and government organizations in various industries: the national e-voting system, fintech services, trusted document management, supply chain management systems, and other solutions with high infrastructure security requirements.</p><p>Learn more at <a href="https://wavesenterprise.com">https://wavesenterprise.com</a> and <a href="https://we.vote">https://we.vote</a></p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/waves-enterprise-partners-up-with-ontology-to-integrate-decentralized-id-into-its-e-voting-service-19b9e375b68c">Waves Enterprise partners up with Ontology to integrate decentralized ID into its e-voting service.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>As the buzz around Artificial Intelligence has increased, so have the issues around trust. There is an increasing polarisation in the discourse around AI, ADS and automation. So what can you do as a tech leader or employee in a company utilising tech, to build trust? Or much more to the point, what can you do to become trustworthy?</p>
<p>An important step is to communicate honestly with your customers and stakeholders about the technology you use. However too often organisations fall at the first hurdle due to the damaging visual misrepresentations of AI that accompany their written communications, promotional material or media coverage. This session investigates the way that organisations and the media represent AI through images, and what this says about what they and customers expect and understand about the benefits of technology. We look at how this exposes the broader implications of anthropomorphising technology, and how to deal with describing the role of humans and human agency in your solutions.</p>
<p>As well as exploring how public perceptions of AI will shape the risks and opportunities faced by your organisation, you will leave this session with some practical suggestions on earning and building trust in your AI solutions, and helping to imagine a more positive AI future.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybernetixworld2020_2020_11_25_cetin_duarte"></a>

<p><a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC) is a hugely popular user authentication and identity protocol on the web today. It enables relying parties to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience.</p><p>In typical deployments of OpenID Connect today, in order for a user to be able to exercise the identity they have with a relying party, the relying party must be in direct contact with what’s known as the OpenID Provider (OP). OpenID Providers are responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties. This effectively means that an OpenID Provider is the Identity Provider (IdP) of the&nbsp;user.</p>In today’s OpenID Connect implementations, the Identity Provider mediates on behalf of the&nbsp;user<p>It’s the reason we often see buttons that say “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook” during the login journey in an application or service. The website or application you want to use must first authenticate who you are with a provider like Google or Facebook which controls and manages that identity on your behalf. In this context we can think of the IdP as the “man in the middle.” This relationship prevents users from having a portable digital identity which they can use across different contexts and denies users any practical control over their identity. It also makes it incredibly easy for IdPs like Google or Facebook to track what users are doing, because the “man in the middle” can gather metadata about user behavior with little agency over how this identity data is shared and&nbsp;used.</p><p>In order to allow users to have practical control over their identity, we need a new approach.</p><p>Introducing <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, an extension to OpenID Connect which enables the end-user to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a digital wallet. This specification defines how an OpenID Provider can be extended beyond being the provider of simple identity assertions into being the provider of credentials, effectively turning these Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p>OIDC Credential Provider allows the user to manage their own credentials<p>To maximize the reuse of existing infrastructure that’s deployed today, OIDC Credential Provider extends the core OpenID Connect protocol, maintaining the original design and intent of OIDC while enhancing it without breaking any of its assumptions or requirements.</p><p>Instead of using OIDC to provide simple identity assertions directly to the relying party, we can leverage OIDC to offer a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) which is cryptographically bound to a digital wallet of the end-users choice. The digital wallet plays the role of the OpenID Client application which is responsible for interacting with the OpenID Provider and manages the cryptographic key material (both public and private keys) used to prove ownership of the credential. The credentials issued to the wallet are re-provable and reusable for the purposes of authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-related information by providers and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the user-controlled “wallet” layer between issuers and relying&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Essentially, a wallet makes a request to an OpenID provider in order to obtain a credential, and then receives the credential back into their wallet so they can later use it to prove their identity to relying parties. The interaction consists of three main&nbsp;steps:</p>  The Client sends a signed credential request to the OpenID Provider with their public&nbsp;key  The OpenID Provider authenticates and authorizes the End-User to access the credential  The OpenID Provider responds to the Client with the issued&nbsp;VC  <p>In this new flow, the credential request extends the typical OpenID Connect request in that it expresses the intent to ask for something beyond the identity token of a typical OIDC flow. Practically, what this means is that the client uses a newly defined scope to indicate the intent of the request. The Client also extends the standard OIDC Request object to add cryptographic key material and proof of possession of that key material so that the credential can be bound to the wallet requesting it. Though the credential can be bound to a public key by default, it can also support different binding mechanisms, e.g. the credential can optionally be bound to a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifer</a> (DID). In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user.</p><p>The request can also indicate the format of the requested credential and even ask for specific claims present within the credential. This is designed to allow multiple credential formats to be used within the OIDC&nbsp;flow.</p><p>On the provider side, OpenID Connect Providers are able to advertise which capabilities they support within the OIDC ecosystem using OpenID Connect Provider Metadata. This approach extends the metadata to support additional fields that express support for binding to DIDs, for issuing VCs, and advertising which <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a>, credential formats, credentials, and claims they are offering. This information can be utilized by the end-user’s digital wallet to help the user understand whether or not they wish to proceed with a credential request.</p><p>In order to create a way for the wallet or client to connect to the OpenID Provider, the spec also defines a URL which functions as a Credential Offer that the client can invoke in order to retrieve and understand the types of credential being offered by the provider. The client registers the ‘openid’ URI scheme in order to be able to understand and render the offer to the user so they can make an informed decision.</p><p>The sum of these changes means that OpenID Connect can allow users to have a portable digital identity credential that’s actually under their control, creating an opportunity for greater agency in digital interactions as well as preventing identity providers from being able to easily track user behavior. The OpenID Connect Credential Provider <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">specification</a> is in the process of being contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item at the A/B Working Group, where it will continue to be developed by the community behind OpenID&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>MATTR is pleased to announce that our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/extensions/oidc-bridge">OIDC Bridge Platform Extension</a> now uses OIDC Credential Provider under the hood to facilitate issuing credentials with OpenID Connect. OIDC Bridge hides the complexity associated with setting up infrastructure for credential issuance and simply requires configuration of a standard OpenID Provider. We also simplify the process of verifying credentials issued over OIDC Credential Provider by allowing the wallet to respond to requests, present credentials, and prove ownership and integrity of their credentials via&nbsp;OIDC.</p>OIDC Bridge is an Extension to the MATTR&nbsp;Platform<p>This new set of capabilities allows OpenID Providers greater flexibility around which claims end up in a credential, and allows for the support of many different credential types with a straight-forward authentication journey for end-users.</p><p>Our Mobile Wallet supports the ability to invoke credential offers using OIDC Credential Provider as well as creating credential requests and receiving credentials from an OpenID Provider.</p><p>To find out more, check out our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">tutorials</a> on MATTR Learn, read the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">spec</a>, or watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2WPwotNArI">recording</a> of our presentation on this spec from the recent Internet Identity Workshop.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">Introducing OIDC Credential Provider</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How do we build a world we’ve never seen before? We must change who drives the&nbsp;future. Illustration by Superside<p>By Eshanthi Ranasinghe and David Hsu, Exploration &amp; Future Sensing, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Every day we take steps which carry our attitudes and assumptions about the future. Our steps can be fearful and cautious. They can also be bold leaps made out of clear-eyed hope and raw necessity.</p><p>In this year of concurrent crises and collapses, when many ways forward seem possible, the challenge is to critically discern between pathways which wind up leading back to a broken “normal” and pathways which lead us into a future we have never seen before — one that is more equitable, just, and beautiful.<br> <br>At Omidyar Network, this kind of discernment is vital to our mission of <a href="https://omidyar.com/#focusareas">reimagining systems that shape our daily lives</a>: building an economy that works for all, realizing the promise of responsible technology, and fostering a more pluralistic society. We launched the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/exploration-and-future-sensing-ac4ef4ae302e">Exploration &amp; Future Sensing</a> unit in 2019 to help achieve this mission. Building upon years of prior experimentation, the unit peers beyond what we know and see today by scanning for signals of change, investigating emerging trends, using scenarios to shake old patterns of thinking, and activating new collaborations. <br> <br>Much of our exploration revolves around the question: When uncertainty abounds, how do we move beyond our own biases and blind spots to build a world we’ve never seen before? <br> <br>The short answer is that we turn to community. We must center people with experience living in between worlds, or on the margins, who have honed an extraordinary capacity for imagining and building futures that are more beautiful and resilient. They’re people who have crossed cultures, borders, and identities. They have learned to live in the future and navigate its uncertain terrain often out of necessity.</p><blockquote>When uncertainty abounds, how do we move beyond our own biases and blind spots to build a world we’ve never seen before? We turn to community. We must center people with experience living in between worlds or on the margins, who have honed an extraordinary capacity for imagining and building futures that are more beautiful and resilient.</blockquote><p>In the process of engaging with a variety of foresight methods, creative approaches, and practitioner communities, we’re finding a growing group of partners and collaborators who embody a new wave of future thinking for social change. Their talent for exploring alternative futures comes from asking not just what the future could hold but also who thrives in it and how we will take action to get there together. Instead of simply extrapolating from existing systems, these alternative futurists are rooted in transformative visions of equity, access, belonging, and justice.<br> <br>It’s never been more critical to support and partner with people who are thinking more courageously and hopefully about the future. Here are four such efforts Omidyar Network Exploration &amp; Future Sensing is honored to&nbsp;support.</p> Radical Imagination with Angela Glover Blackwell <p>This podcast is a window to a more equitable future where guaranteed income, reparations, and open borders, are real possibilities.</p><p>Angela Glover Blackwell doesn’t call herself a futurist. She doesn’t issue forecasts about what 2030 and 2050 will hold. Instead, she has a remarkable track record of sensing what we need today to achieve a more equitable tomorrow, and telling stories that invite more people into that new world of possibility. After founding and leading <a href="https://www.policylink.org/">PolicyLink</a> for the past 20 years, Angela launched the <a href="https://radicalimagination.us/">Radical Imagination</a> podcast. Now entering its third season, Angela features bold innovators who remind us that change is already happening. Past episodes include conversations with Chief August Creppel on climate migration; Mélisande Short-Colomb and Ana Lucia Araujo on reparations; Walidah Imarisha on storytelling and organizing; and Tiq Milan on&nbsp;gender.</p>Angela Glover Blackwell, <a href="https://www.policylink.org/">PolicyLink</a> Founder-in-Residence and host of the <a href="https://radicalimagination.us/">Radical Imagination</a> podcast.<p>The podcast has grown as a beacon this year. “We all need the hope that comes from two things,” Angela says in one episode. “First, envisioning our way out of this pandemic; and second, seeing ourselves emerge with the collective resolve and communal spirit to create a better society than the one we had when COVID-19 hit. A society that rejects fear, divisiveness, and the perverse idea that greed will save us. A society in which we all stand together and take care of one another. This isn’t daydreaming, it’s radical imagination.”</p><blockquote>“We all need the hope that comes from two things.

This isn’t daydreaming, it’s radical imagination.” — Angela Glover Blackwell</blockquote> Next Generation Foresight Practitioners <p>This network of younger future-alert activists aims to influence how foresight is done…and by&nbsp;whom.</p>The<a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/"> Next Generation Foresight Practitioners</a> Program at <a href="https://soif.org.uk/">School of International Futures</a> released their “<a href="https://soif.org.uk/blog/ngfp-futures-manifesto-covid-19/">Futures Manifesto</a>” amidst the pandemic.<p>Foresight, the practice of investigating the future, has traditionally been dominated by a relatively small group of practitioners in Western countries with long careers in foresight methodologies. The <a href="https://soif.org.uk/">School of International Futures</a>, founded by Cat Tully, is addressing this imbalance with the <a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/">Next Generation Foresight Practitioners</a> (NGFP) Program, which believes that foresight empowers all changemakers to build a better future. The program supports emerging voices across underrepresented geographies with a fellowship award; connects them to a network of future-alert activists spanning 68 countries; and amplifies their influence by partnering with critical decision-making institutions.</p><p>For example, NGFP worked on a project this year helping the World Health Organization’s Western Pacific Regional Office to identify younger people’s visions and priorities for the future beyond COVID-19. As Pupul Bisht, NGFP’s Creative Lead and Network Weaver (winner of an inaugural award in 2018), explains, “We believe that when it comes to thinking about post-pandemic futures, supporting bottom-up agenda setting is critical.”</p> Guild of Future Architects <p>This cross-disciplinary community is remixing the art and science of collaboration to build tomorrow’s systems.</p><p>What would a water cooler for a different kind of future thinking look like? That’s one of the questions that spurred Sharon Chang to create <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a>, led by Executive Director Kamal Sinclair. Unlike how future thinking is tethered to commercial or geopolitical objectives, Guild of Future Architects seeks to “make the world more beautiful for more people” and intentionally nurtures collaborations across a diverse array of disciplines to get there. Founding members include artists, technologists, writers, as well as practitioners in health, economics, and urban planning.</p><a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a> members Madebo Fatunde and Thomas DeBass hatching early concepts for Institute of African&nbsp;Futures.<p>At a recent event, teams engaged virtual audiences around <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/shared-futures/profiles">Shared Futures</a> projects incubated by the Guild, including Embodied Intelligence, a framework to help people reclaim physical agency in the age of technology and surveillance; Abundant Health, a model of health care that empowers communities to restore wellness; Institute for African Futures, a dream tank for the future of the African continent; and The Gift, a multimedia experience bridging astrophysics and social transformation. All four prototypes pointed to a future that doesn’t see today’s limitations.</p> Comuzi <p>This design studio believes minority communities must have power to shape emerging AI and algorithmic systems before harm is&nbsp;done.</p><a href="https://www.comuzi.xyz/info.html">COMUZI</a>’s Akil Benjamin, Richard Fagbolagun, and Alex<br> Fefegha.<p>Who gets to shape the future? London-based for-profit design studio <a href="https://www.comuzi.xyz/index.html">COMUZI</a> believes in a more democratic vision where minority voices have the power to influence emerging algorithmic systems rather than being erased by them. Leveraging backgrounds at the nexus of technology, design, and social justice, COMUZI’s project “Beyond Tools of Resistance” will engage community members to prototype tools for holding governments and corporations accountable as AI innovations rapidly reshape how economic safety nets, health services, and transportation systems work. <br> <br>That people should have influence over these systems should not be a radical idea, but when it comes to historically marginalized communities having that power, this thinking is often far outside of the proverbial box. “The process of petitioning and pressuring government officials for change can be very fragmented. It usually takes a moment to infringe the rights of minority voices and many months or years to seek justice,“ COMUZI’s Akil Benjamin notes. “With AI this problem increases tenfold, but imagine if communities had modern tools to accelerate or even get ahead of this process. That’s what we’re aiming to&nbsp;create.”</p><p>The Radical Imagination podcast (powered by PolicyLink), Next Generation Foresight Practitioners (program of School of International Futures), Guild of Future Architects, and COMUZI are grantees of Omidyar Network’s <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/explorations/home">Exploration &amp; Future Sensing</a>&nbsp;unit.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/listening-to-the-future-5d709ea30d7d">Listening to the Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The GiD Report#139 — The landmark antitrust case against FB, Visa + Circle/USDC is a big&nbsp;deal <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-138-the-age-of-antitrust-stripe-is-windows-for-fintech-b5dcfbf5da5d">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Well — a LOT went down this last&nbsp;week:</p>  The landmark antitrust case against&nbsp;FB  Don’t expect it to be a&nbsp;panacea  Why the real solution is always innovation/competition  Visa + Circle’s stablecoin USDC is a big&nbsp;deal  Why porn is suddenly taking identity so seriously  This week in credentials  Stuff happens   1. Make no mistake, last week’s lawsuits against Facebook were a landmark moment in American antitrust history. <p>As Greg Kidd noted, this is “the big&nbsp;one.”</p><p>It’s been a long time coming—and how quickly the tide has turned. Not five years ago, Big Tech was still the bell of the ball. Today, you’d be hard pressed to find a Facebook defender. Regulators have turned — both federal and state. So have the public at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Last week’s lawsuits included not only the FTC but also now 48 state attorney generals. In a time of intense social and political division, such comprehensive consensus speaks&nbsp;volumes.</p><p>As Kara Swisher opined, Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/opinion/facebook-antitrust-ftc.html">has become a&nbsp;menace</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-e9f50136-c3c3-49f4-a786-7adb44ce3e8e.html">the latest from&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Both the Federal Trade Commission and the states want to break up Facebook, not just reform its practices. This wasn’t a given, or inevitable. The FTC also wants the court to require Facebook to seek approval for future acquisitions, going beyond what’s already required under&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook’s moves to freeze out competitors raised antitrust alarms. The FTC argues that Facebook limited third-party software developers’ access to its platform in anticompetitive ways and cut off firms it perceived as&nbsp;threats.</blockquote><blockquote>Privacy, regulators now say, is a competition concern. The states’ lawsuit mentions privacy dozens of times, arguing that Facebook surveils its users and that its monopolistic practices have reduced the “quality and variety of privacy options and content” available to the public. The states also argue that WhatsApp started as a privacy-focused app and Facebook has slowly eroded its privacy protections.</blockquote><p>Also, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-ftc-facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-is-important-2020-12">BI</a>:</p><blockquote>What the lawsuits really represent, experts said, is an indication that the government will no longer look the other way when it comes to how Facebook operates.</blockquote><blockquote>“Every acquisition they try to make from here on will be met with such a level of inspection and skepticism associated with it,” one expert told Business&nbsp;Insider.</blockquote><p>Notable that this stance is not just limited to Big Tech and Facebook if the ongoing Visa/Plaid situation is any indication.</p><p>Greg outlined his take on Twitter. On <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1337458090036215808">the lawsuits</a>:</p><p>You can and do need to turn back the clock when it comes to anti-competitive behavior that destroys #innovation and user rights to their own&nbsp;data.</p>Photo: Anthony&nbsp;Quintano<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1337798851676184577">Facebook and&nbsp;privacy</a>:</p><blockquote>#Facebook’s pattern of bogus privacy claims are simply a cover for a pattern of anti-competitive behavior and misuse of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (#CFAA).” Users should be able to view their own data however they see fit to authorize.</blockquote><p>The thing is — this fight isn’t new nor are Facebook’s anti-competitive tactics, of which those who have been on the short end of the sticks have been keenly aware, as Greg&nbsp;points:</p><blockquote>46 states are now following up on the same grounds as our portfolio company</blockquote><blockquote>@LenddoEFL — which sued #Facebook over anti-competitive blocks to #API access that deny users access to and control of their own data. Original filing: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4otqucr">https://tinyurl.com/y4otqucr</a></blockquote><p>Of course, those at the short end of the stick continue to expand in numbers. <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-end-of-the-facebook-crime-spree?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzEzNiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MjQxODIyMDUsIl8iOiJRd3ZzbCIsImlhdCI6MTYwNzYwNzY2NiwiZXhwIjoxNjA3NjExMjY2LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTE1MjQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.q1ETVKKVDGsLqOK5u02PwT43TUuO7R4kGQZSEHX43aY">Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>So what changed? Well, we made the case for the rule of law. Many people were involved, like Jeff Chester, who opposed the Instagram and WhatsApp mergers at the time. The list of people who sought to address the harms of Facebook grew every year I was paying attention, and I started paying attention closely in 2013. Just in terms of what we did and Facebook’s reaction, we wrote, researched, and advocated against monopolization, and Facebook in particular. For one shareholder meeting, we hired an airplane to draw in in the sky outside of Facebook’s shareholder the slogan “You broke democracy.”</blockquote><blockquote>In response, Facebook hired a company to investigate us, and then tried to smear us in the press as anti-semites in an attempt to undermine our arguments. We were no strangers to retribution by powerful monopolists, and we aren’t the only ones that Facebook sought to target. I suspect they regularly go after many people. I mean, just before the election, Facebook sued NYU researchers trying to study how its political ad targeting worked after its ad archive ‘accidentally’ malfunctioned. This kind of dirty stuff is routine, it’s a business in Washington, D.C., and increasingly Brussels. It’s the crust of corruption protecting the slime of monopoly.</blockquote> 2. But don’t get it twisted. It would be naive to assume antitrust regulation to be some sort of panacea to widespread problems that the Facebook monopoly symbolizes. <p>For one, experts <a href="http://4ce3e8e.html">question the long term effectiveness</a> of legal action on its&nbsp;own:</p><blockquote>The FTC and states have to prove that rejecting Facebook’s acquisitions would have made life better for consumers and increased industry competition — a tough case to make, legal experts told&nbsp;Axios.</blockquote><blockquote>The court will be looking at whether the acquisition of WhatsApp, for instance, was lawful when it occurred in 2012, not whether it would be lawful now, said Kristen Limarzi, a partner at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher and former chief of the appellate section of the DOJ antitrust division.</blockquote><blockquote>One hurdle for the FTC is “that they reviewed the transaction and cleared it,” she said. “Their suit depends on admitting they made a mistake in&nbsp;2012.”</blockquote><blockquote>It’s not common for the FTC to try to undo previous acquisitions, but it has happened, said Jeffrey Jacobovitz, a partner at Arnall Golden Gregory and former antitrust attorney at the FTC. He called the FTC suit “super aggressive.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-ftc-facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-is-important-2020-12">And</a>:</p><blockquote>Wall Street analysts told Business Insider’s Martin Coulter that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-antitrust-lawsuits-wall-street-breakup-instagram-whatsapp-2020-12?r=kc-sub">the lawsuit might not actually have legs to hold up in court</a>, and a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp is unlikely to happen, Lightman&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“If you break them up now, are you going to give them a refund check?” Lightman said. There are so many integrated assets, from engineers and executives to user data, so the question is how does that even begin to be unraveled, according to Lightman.</blockquote><blockquote>Experts said what the lawsuit really represents is being part of a series of governmental actions signaling the broader consensus that the industry needs oversight.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s time to take all of these companies seriously, both in terms of the incredible benefits they’ve provided to our economy, to the marketplace of ideas and to our personal lives, but also the problems that they pose for those same things,” Dinielli&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Rather than the end, it’s just the beginning.</p> 3. Instead these latest actions serve as one part of a multi-pronged campaign. Another prong will be innovation and competition. <p>Like Matt Stoller, I also started paying attention to Facebook nearly a decade ago when I was still covering Wall Street and Big Tech for VICE/Motherboard (before setting my sights on a nascent thing called Bitcoin). That beat eventually culminated into <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pggg3z/what-happened-to-the-facebook-killer-it-s-complicated">an investigative longread about Diaspora</a> (an open source, decentralized social network), at the time, the most successful Kickstarter project on the platform.</p><p>Even as early as 2010, Facebook had already soiled its reputation:</p><blockquote>Since it launched, as Facebook made tweaks to privacy settings — with the presumption that privacy standards were changing — users were largely kept out of the loop, learning of privacy abuses after the fact. They were like the proverbial frog in the pot of water, slowly coming to a boil. The frog jumps out if the heat’s turned up too fast. But if it’s turned up gradually, the frog never notices, and stays in the water until it boils. Except the anecdote is fallacious. Most of the time, the frog&nbsp;notices.</blockquote><blockquote>In February of 2010, at the height of Facebook’s run-in with the public’s trust, a law professor named Eben Moglen delivered a public lecture at NYU titled “Freedom in the Cloud.” “The human race has susceptibility to harm, but Mr. Zuckerberg has attained an unenviable record: he has done more harm to the human race than anybody else his age,” Moglen declared, and outlined the dubious contract the connected world was entering into with Facebook. “Namely, ‘I will give you free web hosting and some PHP doodads and you get spying for free all the time.’ And it works. That’s the sad part, it&nbsp;works.”</blockquote><p>Enter Diaspora:</p><blockquote>The idea was simple. Build a decentralized, open source version of Facebook for the Freedom Box. Own your data. Own your social network. No Mark Zuckerberg. No need for real names. Just the people. Hoping to raise some funds for what was supposed to be a summer distraction, the team posted their idea on then little-known microfinance site, Kickstarter, with an unfussy target of $10,000. They called it Diaspora*, which fit the project’s decentralizing aims nicely. From the Greek διασπορά, “scattering, dispersion,” it’s “the movement, migration, or scattering of people away from an established or ancestral homeland” or “people dispersed by whatever cause to more than one location.”</blockquote><p>TL;DR — Diaspora didn’t work out (in tragic fashion). Here’s what Bram Cohen, creator of BitTorrent, told me at the&nbsp;time:</p><blockquote>To Cohen, guru of p2p, Diaspora isn’t just cumbersome: it’s deeply flawed. And it’s not something we really need at the moment. “There may be room for a form of social networking somewhere between email and Facebook,” he wrote in an email. “It can’t just be a verbatim copy of Facebook though, it would need some rethinking.” And a big part of it is timing. All of this is relatively brand new and a solution like Facebook in its current form still has much to offer. “I think it’s a good idea to wait for things to get more mature before trying to build something less&nbsp;agile.”</blockquote><p>And that’s essentially how things played out. Facebook’s centralized and integrated approach to the world still had much to offer — and when its influence started to wane, they deftly picked up the hottest new kids on the block in Instagram and WhatsApp, extending its ascent and&nbsp;power.</p><p>As Bram keenly pointed out, Diaspora was ahead of its time. A lot has happened since then. The Facebook platform, IG and WhatsApp in tow, is fully matured. We’ve seen the rise of Bitcoin and crypto and blockchain — open source, decentralized projects with builtin mechanisms for financing and consequently, economic sustainability.</p><p>Which brings us to the next prong.

Speaking of Facebook and Diem, Visa moving into the stablecoin space with the help of Circle is a big&nbsp;deal. <p>First <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/12/02/visa-partners-with-ethereum-digital-dollar-startup-that-raised-271-million/?sh=3af6d3e44b1f">the news from&nbsp;Forbes</a>:</p><blockquote>Credit card giant Visa today announced it is connecting its global payments network of 60 million merchants to the U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC) developed by Circle Internet Financial on the ethereum blockchain. The digital currency is now valued at $2.9&nbsp;billion.</blockquote><blockquote>While Visa itself won’t custody the digital currency, effective immediately, the partnership will see Circle working with Visa to help select Visa credit card issuers start integrating the USDC software into their platforms and send and receive USDC payments. Circle itself is also going through the same Fast Track program. In turn, businesses will eventually be able to send international USDC payments to any business supported by Visa, and after those funds are converted to the national currency, spend them anywhere that accepts&nbsp;Visa.</blockquote><p>How Visa sees&nbsp;it:</p><blockquote>“We continue to think of Visa as a network of networks,” says Sheffield, a five-year veteran of Visa, who took over as head of crypto last June. “Blockchain networks and stablecoins, like USDC, are just additional networks. So we think that there’s a significant value that Visa can provide to our clients, enabling them to access them and enabling them to spend at our merchants.”</blockquote><p>Why it’s a big&nbsp;deal:</p><blockquote>Visa estimates that $120 trillion in payments annually are made using checks and instant wire transfers, costing as much as $50 each, regardless of the size of the transaction. Since USDC settles on the ethereum blockchain, transactions can close in a little a[s] 20 seconds and, importantly, can be done for nearly free, Visa believes its vast array of merchants could choose to use this nearly instant alternative form of payment. “We worked closely with digital currency wallets to issue Visa credentials,” says Sheffield. “And helping them receive USDC payouts can add additional value for&nbsp;them.”</blockquote><p>Moreover, the move essentially creates a direct connection between Visa and the crypto universe with Circle’s USDC serving as a bridge — no doubt a savvy move by all parties involved, one that could also have a huge impact on the continued mainstreaming of Bitcoin et.&nbsp;al.</p><p>Keep an eye on this&nbsp;space.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> + <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>— <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/12/02/visa-partners-with-ethereum-digital-dollar-startup-that-raised-271-million/?sh=77358bc84b1f">Visa Partners With Ethereum Digital-Dollar Startup That Raised $271&nbsp;Million</a>  <p>Also in&nbsp;crypto:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/kiwipete">/kiwipete</a> + <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>: <a href="https://event.webinarjam.com/replay/101/vo5y0t1mtl1b8zi6pk">Dave Schwartz on XRP: Remodelling the future of&nbsp;finance</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-criminals-idUSKBN28J1IX">Criminals getting smarter in use of digital currencies to launder&nbsp;money</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/87175/bitpay-bitcoin-bank-occ-filing">Bitcoin payments startup BitPay wants to create a national bank in&nbsp;Georgia</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/cenbanks-digital-idUSKBN28K1NI">Central banks split on role of private sector in payments — survey</a>  <a href="https://blockfi.com/fidelity-digital-assets-adds-collateral-agent-capabilities-custody-for-bitcoin-pledged-on-loans-financed-by-blockfi">Fidelity Digital Assets Adds Collateral Agent Capabilities for BlockFi&nbsp;Loans</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a>— <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-lawmakers-tell-mnuchin-to-back-off-from-potential-crypto-wallet-regs">Lawmakers Urge Mnuchin to End Rumored Wallet Rules — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microstrategy-raising-another-400m-btc">A De Facto ETF?

			<p>Luxembourg, December 2020 – With <a href="http://www.digibrixx.lu">Digibrixx</a>, blockchain technology makes its entry into the property investment market in Luxembourg. Developed by Property Token, the Digibrixx brand is a solution enabling anyone wishing to invest in property in Luxembourg to purchase digital bricks backed up by real, solid bricks and mortar. The project has been made compliant thanks to the T-REX protocol and the solutions provided by <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny Solutions</a>.</p>
 The benefits of digitalisation 
<p>Digibrixx breaks a property down into small digital bricks (or tokens). An investor can then buy one or more of those bricks for a few thousand euros. In other words, Digibrixx democratises property investment, making it accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Digibrixx brings simplicity, ease and flexibility. The investor has no need to involve their bank, get tied up in red tape with the authorities or have to keep monitoring their property. It is managed by a professional throughout the whole process. The administrative costs borne by the investor are therefore also reduced.</p>
 For all investors 
<p>Given how flexible and accessible Digibrixx is in financial terms, this investment is aimed at all people who want to invest in bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>It could be an attractive option for someone near the border who wants to invest in Luxembourg and take advantage of its dynamic property market, while at the same time ensuring they do not need to dip into their borrowing facilities to finance the purchase of a home of their own.<br>
Digibrixx is also aimed at anyone seeking to diversify their assets, but keep a large degree of agility and freedom for manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Digibrixx also offers a suitable investment solution for self workers who want to invest in property but sometimes face obstacles because of the employed banks’ requirements when it comes to borrowing, given their employment status.</p>
 How does Digibrixx work? 
<p>When they visit the Digibrixx site, investors can learn about the different investment projects in which they have an opportunity to invest.</p>
<p>Those projects are owned by developers who offer serious guarantees and who have chosen to sell one or another of their property projects via the Digibrixx brand. Assets are automatically audited and selected by Digibrixx experts, who have a background in immovable property.</p>
<p>Transparency is essential. Each project is covered by a detailed presentation. The percentage of funding already raised is automatically stated and an estimate of the annual performance is given.</p>

		 
	 
    If the investor is interested, all they need to do is click on the subscription form for their chosen project. They will then be put in touch with the developer, who will remain their direct contact person. They are also put in touch with BIL, Banque Internationale à Luxembourg, Digibrixx’s financial partner, which is responsible for issuing digital title deeds, otherwise known as tokens  Cyril LamorletteChartered Accountant &amp; Audit Partner    
	 
		 
			<p>Investments are therefore appropriate, secure and transparent. </p>

		 
	 
    Tokenization activity has continued to surge in Luxembourg since the regulation has become clearer. Real estate is a key driver in this space because lower ticket sizes can be offered, opening up new investor segments. We’re pleased to provide the technological pieces to this innovative project and help provide new pathways for investment. We believe Digibrixx will act as a precursor to many more like minded projects.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions    
	 
		 
			 What project, and what will the returns be like? 
<p>The money gathered by the developer is used to create leverage and finance the property operation. The investor therefore sees an immediate growth in their return. The process also provides an additional security guarantee for the investor: the developer, too, invests in the project, as does the bank which grants a loan.</p>

		 
	 
    The approved property projects offer real potential in terms of return on investment. They may be commercial premises, residential or garages  Laurent OlmedoAdministrator at Digibrixx    
	 
		 
			<p>During the investment period the building is constructed and put up for rent. At the end of that period, which is specified straight away, the subscriber recovers their initial investment, the capital gain on the sale of the property, and their share of the rental income, minus the charges and fees relating to the Digibrixx programme.</p>
<p>Risk is weighted because Digibrixx is based on an existing property asset, and the Luxembourg market cannot collapse overnight. Over the past decade it has actually proved its resilience through a steady continuously upward trend. But, as with any investment, there is an element of risk.</p>
 Toward a digital exchange platform 
<p>Digibrixx has already launched its first property investment project. The entry price was voluntarily set at 10,000 euros to attract qualified investors.</p>
<p>The ambition is quickly to roll out offers aimed at the “general public”, allowing property investments in the Grand Duchy amounting to a few thousand euros, or just a few hundred.</p>
<p>Digibrixx is also considering the rollout of an online trading platform which will allow investors to sell, buy or even exchange their tokens with total freedom and ease. That innovation will be launched once the legal and regulatory frameworks governing digital assets in Luxembourg and Europe (security<br>
tokens) allow.</p>
<p>But, right now, Digibrixx falls within a well-defined legal framework based on a securitisation vehicle governed by a Luxembourg law dated 22 March 2004.</p>

			 About Tokeny Solutions 
<p>Tokeny Solutions allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny Solutions enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments.</p>
<p>Tokeny Solutions is the leader in its field and in 2019 they were included in KPMG’s top 100 FinTechs globally, awarded Luxembourg’s FinTech of the year and raised €5mn in funding from the leading pan-european exchange, Euronext.</p>

 As more businesses in Europe move to adopt multi-factor solutions that comply with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), we thought we’d explain what strong authentication actually&nbsp;is. <p>To give a little background, financial institutions and e-commerce platforms in Europe must change how they authenticate users by the 1st January 2021 under the revised <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en">Payments Services Directive</a> (PSD2). This change has been driven by a sharp rise in <a href="https://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/is-the-payments-market-ready-for-sca/">fraud and identity&nbsp;theft</a>.</p><p>So as Europe gets ready to adopt strong customer authentication (SCA) solutions that are compliant with PSD2&nbsp;, we thought we’d cut through the noise to give you a clear breakdown on what strong authentication actually&nbsp;is.</p><p>To put it simply, strong authentication is achieved when solutions combine at least two mutually-independent authentication factors (keep reading to learn more about the three factors), to confirm a user’s identity and grant access to private accounts, systems and&nbsp;data.</p> Combating the password&nbsp;threat <p>Passwords are still clinging onto their place as the number one means of verifying a user’s identity online, but are they still sufficient in protecting users from threats? With the volume of digital accounts each user has (and by result number of passwords they have to keep safe), alongside a steady increase in <a href="https://www.securelink.com/blog/81-hacking-related-breaches-leverage-compromised-credentials/">hacking attacks and data breaches caused by compromised credentials</a> — it’s safe to say passwords have lost their intuitiveness and effectiveness when it comes to mitigating unauthorized access.</p> What is multi-factor authentication? <p>Solutions providing multi-factor authentication (MFA) combine at least two independent authentication challenges in order to provide a solution that is more resilient to threats and account takeovers.</p> Multi-factor authentication solutions integrate at least two of the below challenge factors: The 3 authentication challenge factors — knowledge (verifying something the user knows), possession (verifying something the user has), inherence (verifying something the user&nbsp;is). 1. Knowledge challenges <p>Knowledge challenges verify that a user knows something that no one else does. Common examples are passwords and PINs. In reality, passwords and PINs are readily shared and compromised — making knowledge based challenges one of the least reliable methods for verifying a user’s identity&nbsp;online.</p> 2. Possession challenges <p>Possession challenges verify that the user has something in their possession that no one else does. In the context of consumer authentication, proving a user has possession of something is usually done by delivering one-time passwords via push notifications or SMS to a user’s trusted device or phone number. In the workforce, employees could be given swipe-cards or USB&nbsp;tokens.</p> 3. Inherence challenges <p>Inherence challenges verify that a user is something. Essentially this is verifying the unique characteristics and traits of an individual by way of biometric sensors.</p><p>Having two mutually-independent factors enhances security by enabling an additional security layer. This means that even if one factor is compromised, private accounts, systems and data are all theoretically still protected, so long as the second factor hasn’t also been compromised.</p> A real-world example for multi-factor authentication is the usage of credit-card (something the user has) with a PIN code (something the user&nbsp;knows).  MFA vs strong customer authentication (SCA) <p>The European Central Bank takes security one step further and says that to enable strong authentication, at least one of the authentication factors must be non-reusable.</p><p>A common example of a non-reusable authentication challenge is a one-time authentication code sent to a user’s device, for example a push-notification or SMS-token.</p><p>One-time codes are by nature less likely to be compromised, making the challenge response more resilient to threats, however, <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252476811/Four-fifths-of-SIM-swap-fraud-attempts-succeed">with four out of five SIM swapping attacks being successful, one-time codes are not without&nbsp;risk.</a></p><p>Rather than verifying a user’s identity based on something they know or possess, inherence challenges authenticate users by validating something the user&nbsp;is.</p> The benefits of biometrics for&nbsp;SCA <p>The benefit of authenticating users via their biometrics is that biometrics are much harder for an attacker to steal or&nbsp;fake.</p> This is especially true when solutions take a multi-modal approach to biometrics. <p>Multimodal biometrics are when a user is authenticated via both physical and behavioral traits unique to them, essentially a form of biometric two-factor authentication.</p><p>An example would be if a solution verified a user’s unique facial measurements (using facial recognition technology), alongside their unique keystroke dynamics (the way they interact with their&nbsp;device).</p><p>Because of their layered approach, multi-modal biometrics can give companies extremely high assurance that a user is who they claim to be online, without disrupting the user-journey or adding undue complexity.</p> Strong authentication = seamless&nbsp;login  At Keyless we combine inherence and possession factors to provide fast, secure, user-friendly authentication that is resilient to common threats including phishing, credential stuffing and SIM-swapping attacks.  1. Our first factor is inherence (something the user&nbsp;is) <p>We leverage multi-modal biometrics, combined with advanced liveness detection and anti-spoofing technology, to verify that a user is who they say they are, both at the point of authentication and continuously as they user accesses private systems and accounts. The intuitiveness offered by multimodal biometrics allows our clients to strengthen access control security, without jeopardizing on productivity or user-experience.</p> 2. Our second factor is possession (something the user possesses) <p>We use device-identity verification to ensure that each authentication request is launched from a user’s trusted device without needing to send a push-notification to the user’s device. The combination of inherence and possession factors allows for seamless, strong authentication that is resilient to a wide range of threats facing enterprises, while also being intuitive to the user, and minimally disruptive to workflow.</p> Implementing Strong Authentication <p>The deadline for financial institutions and e-commerce platforms in Europe to implement SCA is fast approaching.</p><p>When executed properly, strong authentication should not disrupt the user-experience or make authentication more challenging for the user. Instead, strong authentication should enhance employee and customer experiences while protecting your company from privacy and security&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Keyless passwordless solutions are PSD2 compliant and designed to seamlessly integrate with existing security and identity management infrastructure, so that you can quickly deploy biometric-enabled passwordless solutions to your remote workforce and&nbsp;users.</p> Interested in how Keyless can help you achieve SCA compliance&nbsp;?

  <p>If 2020 taught the world nothing else, organizations learned the vital importance of adapting to disruption. When COVID-19 halted supply chains and countries around the world phased in and out of various lockdown procedures, organizations needed to quickly shift gears to survive.</p>
<p>To meet the challenges of today’s world, organizations must improve the resilience and sustainability of their application platforms and architectures to continuously evolve to meet business needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Application leaders should focus on optimizing and refining application delivery to make it repeatable, effective and efficient</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Optimizing application delivery has always been about continual evolution, but to implement digital transformations, modernize existing applications and innovate, skills in distributed architecture, integration patterns and cloud platform technologies are critical.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“Sustainable application delivery requires architecture and platforms with effective governance, architectural dexterity and relevant skills,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/54513/Brad-Dayley">Brad Dayley</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>In the coming year, application leaders should focus on optimizing and refining application delivery to make it repeatable, effective and efficient. The key is implementing continuous learning, with a focus on:</p>
 
 Strong agile architecture: Does your organization have the skills to enable delivery of components of the application (such as individual apps, APIs and services) at independent cadences and using optimal technologies? 
 DevOps: Can your application technical professionals implement an operation and effective tool chain that supports continuous integration and continuous delivery? 
 Cloud-native skills: Is your team able to design, architect, integrate and operate applications that are ready to deploy and operate in a cloud environment? 
 
<p>With a foundation in these areas, application technical professionals can make realistic and pragmatic assessments of new architecture and integration technologies, platforms and patterns as they emerge.</p>
<p>But much more is needed to ensure your organization is sufficiently flexible and adaptable to meet new challenges in the future.</p>
 Adapt and modernize application architecture 
<p>Changing user needs, customer expectations, business models, processes and application delivery requirements are intrinsic challenges of running a business. Yet the COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the need for change.</p>
<p>Application architects and delivery teams with the appropriate skills and technologies in place have been able to step up, adapt and support their organizations to meet those significant challenges and weather the storm.</p>
<p>Conversely, lack of skills has inhibited application delivery professionals from making needed transitions to meet business needs, accelerate delivery cadence, optimize costs and scale applications to meet accelerated requirements.</p>
 Prioritize skills 
<p>With skills in place for agile architecture, DevOps and cloud-native, organizations should then prioritize skills based on real business and application needs. To determine the additional skills needed based on the real impact to your business, ask these questions:</p>
 
 Is this a skill that has already been identified by my organization as critical? 
 Is this a skill in which we are currently deficient on my team or within my organization? 
 How will I apply this skill in my current role? 
 Will this skill enable me to expand my current role in the products I am working on? 
 Is this skill required for future modernization/innovation efforts that have been approved and are underway in my organization? 
 Look for strong and clear “yes” answers to these questions. Avoid skills for which there is uncertainty. 
 
 Gain experience and knowledge 
<p>Successfully learning skills means balancing knowledge and experience. Gaining too much knowledge is dangerous because you know how to do things without the experience to understand when and why to do them. At the same time, trying to learn a skill solely through experience is painful.</p>
<p>Depending on the skill and individual learning style, many learning activities are available, such as tutorials, online courses, bootcamps, conferences, proofs of concept (POCs), book clubs and lunch-and-learns. Look for those opportunities within your organization and utilize them. When they don’t exist, take the initiative and start one when appropriate. However, always prioritize those activities that provide practical experience and enable you to gain both knowledge and experience. Some examples include:</p>
 
 Communities of practice 
 POCs/prototypes 
 Paired (programming, design, architecture) 
 Team rotation/sharing 
 
<p>These types of activities tend to provide multiple benefits to application architecture and integration professionals. They enable you to focus on real-world problems; they integrate into your normal workflow so you don’t need to set aside learning time; and the outcomes are often used in production applications.</p>
 Culture of continuous learning 
<p>The most successful organizations encourage and support a culture of continuous learning and allow technical professionals the time and opportunities to learn new skills. A culture of continuous learning is one where multiple activities are available for individuals to increase their skills.</p>
<p>Application architecture and integration professionals contribute to this culture by participating in available activities and taking the initiative to create, start or encourage activities. To overcome any barriers to justifying the time and effort to learn new skills, define valuable and measurable outcomes from your learning activities.</p>
<p>Dedicate time to develop soft skills (e.g., time management and listening) as well as technical skills.</p>

					 <p>Our mission is to make the world more accessible through <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). But to do that, we first are making SSI more accessible to the world. We strive to consistently remove barriers to entry to getting started with SSI. About a year ago, we became <a href="https://trinsic.id/launch/">the first SSI vendor in the world</a> to host a free, production-ready platform for issuing and verifying credentials. Since then, we’ve grown into a community of hundreds of developers who trust Trinsic enough to build their SSI solutions on our platform. Today, we’re excited to release the next generation of <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the simplest tool for verifiable credential exchange, Trinsic Studio was originally designed to help developers get started with Trinsic’s <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">powerful APIs</a> in less than 5 minutes. The release of Trinsic Studio 2.0 only enhances and increases our ability to meet that goal. The Studio also serves as the mechanism through which our users manage their API keys and subscription.</p>

					 <p>As a part of the launch of the new Studio, we announce changes to our pricing model that make SSI more accessible than ever.</p>

					 <p>In line with our values, for the last year we’ve charged based on a metric called “DIDComm” which is any interaction between two participants in an SSI ecosystem. Despite its imperfections, this model was well-received due to the fact that our subscribers only had to worry and estimate one value (DIDComm), and they could build in the usage-based pricing into the pricing model they charge their customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, DIDComm is an unfamiliar term and requires deep technical knowledge of SSI protocols and accurate forecasting of usage in order to correctly model pricing. Throughout our platform, we strive to abstract these complexities away into the simplest possible experience for our users—so it didn’t make sense to expose the complexity through our pricing model.</p>

					 <p>With Trinsic Studio 2.0, we’ve implemented a pricing model that keeps all the benefits of our former DIDComm-based pricing model but removes the complexity. Going forward, Trinsic will charge based on&nbsp;credential exchange. That means we’ll charge for:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Credentials issued  Credentials verified  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simple.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The subscription plans will remain the same; the Developer plan for just starting out and the Production plan for when you are ready to go to production or get additional support.

					 <p>This release was about more than a simple glow-up—the Trinsic Studio has been completely rewritten based on a more scalable architecture. With world-class Blazor architect&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StevenTCramer">Steve Cramer</a>&nbsp;at the helm, we migrated the Studio from server-side rendering to client-side via WASM. More to come in another blog if you’re interested in going deeper; but the end result is that pages load 2x faster. You can now start to issue a credential in the time it used to take to load the page!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of Trinsic’s value propositions is that we abstract away the low-level SSI protocols so that developers can focus on their use case. Another is that Trinsic is continually adopting SSI standards and new technologies as they mature. Therefore, a flexible architecture that’s easily extensible was an important design decision. Shipping new features on Studio 2.0 takes our developers, on average, 4x less time than it took on the original Trinsic Studio. Plus, we have integrated end-to-end testing that should prevent bugs from sneaking in and speeding up our time to release. So not only will we move even faster in our development, but we’ll be more flexible to evolve with the SSI space as it advances over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See below for an example; you can create a Verification Template in the new studio in the time it would take you to simply load the verifications page in the previous studio.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					Previous Studio lacked performance.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					New Studio loads pages at least 2x faster.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Other changes 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In addition to simplifying pricing, UI, and performance, we’re introducing a couple of other important changes. See the feature breakdown on our <a href="https://trinsic.id/pricing/">pricing page</a> for more detail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Support: We’re launching an exclusive community where members receive early access to features, co-marketing opportunities, and a dedicated support channel. Available for our Production subscribers.  Documentation: All of the content on our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">documentation site</a> will continue to be available free to all subscription levels. We don’t believe in restricting content behind a paywall unless it is client-specific.  Organizations &amp; Cloud Wallets: Organizations (institutional agents) and cloud wallets (“custodial” cloud-hosted end-user agents) will be limited based on the subscription tier.

					 <p>It’s amazing to look back and see how much Trinsic Studio has evolved since we first launched. We are thankful to all of our users and their feedback which continually inspires us to develop the best and simplest developer tools for self-sovereign identity. With the release of Trinsic Studio 2.0, verifiable credentials exchange has never been more accessible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking to build an SSI solution or integrate SSI into your existing solution, <a href="https://trinsic.studio/">sign up for a free Trinsic Studio account</a> today, and see how easy it is to get started with SSI.</p>

  <p>Digital transformation has made it imperative for application leaders to find effective ways to modernize legacy systems. The biggest challenge? Knowing the risk-to-reward ratio before acting.</p>
<p>“For many organizations, legacy systems are seen as holding back the business initiatives and business processes that rely on them,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/52795/Stefan-Van-Der-Zijden">Stefan Van Der Zijden</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “When a tipping point is reached, application leaders must look to application modernization to help remove the obstacles.”</p>
<p>The Gartner three-step evaluation process provides direction in determining how to approach application modernization. The best approach depends on the problem that needs to be solved.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 STEP 1: Evaluate legacy systems using six drivers 
<p>There are six main drivers for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/key-strategies-for-cost-optimization-in-application-design-and-development/">application</a> modernization. These are the issues, concerns or impediments that have been created by the legacy application as a result of its technology, architecture or functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three of these drivers come from a business perspective — business fit, business value and agility. If the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-evaluate-an-application-integration-platform-infographic/">legacy application</a> is not meeting the new requirements imposed by digital business, it needs to be modernized to fit properly, and should be upgraded to provide greater business value. Applications that lack the agility to keep pace with the demands of digital business may be a cost or risk liability.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/key-strategies-for-cost-optimization-in-application-design-and-development/">Key Strategies for Cost Optimization in Application Design and Development</a></p>
 
<p>The three other drivers come from the IT perspective, and involve cost, complexity and risk. If the total cost of ownership is too high, the technology too complex, or security, compliance, support or scalability are being compromised, it’s time to modernize.</p>
<p>The best modernization opportunities are those with multiple drivers from both a business and an IT perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 STEP 2: Evaluate modernization 
<p>Once the opportunity is selected and the problem is identified, look at modernization options. Gartner has ranked seven options by ease of implementation (the easier it is, the less risk and impact it will have on the system and the business processes; the harder, the more risk and impact it will have.)</p>
 
 Encapsulate. Leverage and extend the application features by encapsulating its data and functions, making them available as services via an API. 
 Rehost. Redeploy the application component to other infrastructure (physical, virtual or cloud) without modifying its code, features or functions. 
 Replatform. Migrate to a new runtime platform, making minimal changes to the code, but not the code structure, features or functions. 
 Refactor. Restructure and optimize the existing code (although not its external behavior) to remove technical debt and improve nonfunctional attributes. 
 Rearchitect. Materially alter the code to shift it to a new application architecture and exploit new and better capabilities.&nbsp; 
 Rebuild. Redesign or rewrite the application component from scratch while preserving its scope and specifications. 
 Replace. Eliminate the former application component altogether and replace it, considering new requirements and needs at the same time. 
 
 STEP 3: Choose the modernization approach with highest effect and value 
<p>Finally, choose the modernization approach that will have the highest effect and value to your organization by mapping the seven modernization options in terms of their effect on technology, architecture, functionality, cost and risk.</p>
<p>Ultimately, modernizing legacy<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/its-time-to-disrupt-the-application-organization/"> applications</a> means choosing between rearchitecting, rebuilding or replacing. Rearchitecting has medium costs and risks, whereas rebuilding or replacing provides best results with higher costs and risks. The key is to weigh all options to help identify the extent to which each will have the desired effect — with the minimum effort and maximum positive impact.</p>

<p>Red Hat surprised the open source world with its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/centos-shifts-from-red-hat-unbranded-to-red-hat-beta/">announcment</a> that it is pulling the plug on CENTOS. But should anyone be surprised? At the end of the day, why does it make sense to offer a product that undermines your business model? On the one hand, you have a huge investment in Red Hat Enterprise Linux that generates a ton of revenue. On the other hand, you have an underfunded effort working on an open source project that generates no revenue. You don’t need an MBA to figure out what the smart financial decision is here.</p>
<p>But is there an analogy that relates to identity and access management? Is there a product where IBM has a huge investment in an another profitable product, where a little under-financed open source project undermines the business model? Hmmm, what about <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/verify-access">IBM Security Verify Access</a> and Keycloak? </p>
<p>The writing is on the wall. Keycloak makes no business sense. IBM doesn’t need two access management platforms. The current IBM access management platform has more features that are valuable to businesses. It has more integrations with current IBM products. It has more documentation, “red books”, training, engineers–more of just about everything else you’d want for a product.</p>
<p>It’s just a matter of time before we see a similar “surprise” announcement for Keycloak. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons we moved the core Gluu software to the <a href="https://jans.io">Janssen Project</a>. When one company controls the destiny of a project, the project’s fate is subject to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that may befall that one company. Enlightened despotism is efficient. But it is not democratic. At Gluu, we have moved to consensus based governance to ensure that whatever happens to Gluu, the project will survive. We didn’t spend the last 10 years building an open source identity distribution to see some bean counters decide to change the license and close the repository.</p>
<p>Janssen is just getting started. In 2021 we’re going to work hard to fill in the gaps to make it a world class, cloud-native identity platform. Heed the writing on the wall. Ditch Keycloak, and join us!</p>

<p>By Subhashish Bhadra, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Regulators, governments, and courts have struggled to catch up with today’s rapid technological progress. That’s why Omidyar Network is exploring what it takes to reimagine our institutions.</p><p>Circa 2011, the internet was hailed as a bastion of freedom. A man in Egypt even named his newborn daughter “Facebook,” in honor of the pivotal role the social media company played in the Arab&nbsp;Spring.</p><p>Today, countries in the Global South have a litany of complaints against tech companies: privacy breaches, domestic tax evasion, inadequate content moderation, lack of free speech online, data extraction to outside the country, and much more. So, what’s changed since 2011? And why didn’t we see this&nbsp;coming?</p><p>Technology has evolved in ways we didn’t imagine, so we didn’t plan and prepare accordingly. Tech has transformed into new business lines, using the data at its disposal to create sprawling commercial empires. It has permeated governments, with law enforcement using facial recognition and other surveillance technologies. And it has fell into the hands of bad actors who used AI, for example, to create deep fake pornography.</p><p>Governments, courts, and regulators — the institutions we created to protect us — have failed to catch up; oftentimes they simply lacked the tools to counter these new&nbsp;threats.</p><p>We must catch up and look ahead. Omidyar Network believes we must reboot our institutions to set them up for success in the data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Many consequences of technological progress are unknown — and will remain so for years to come. Therefore, our institutions need to serve as “safety valves” that can identify and act as soon as harms become evident. Western democracies took centuries to develop such institutions for the industrial age; we don’t have that luxury for this digital era. Our institutions need to either move fast or risk undermining digital progress by exacerbating digital&nbsp;harms.</p><p>We have urgent concerns that public and private tech implementers must address now — like misinformation and privacy — but we must proverbially walk and chew gum at the same time. We need to tackle the immediate needs while building robust institutions for the long-term. The latter is critically important for three reasons. First, technology will keep throwing new challenges at us and we shouldn’t always be playing catch up. We need to get ahead of the curve and tackle issues in their infancy. When institutions like Parliament and courts work well, they provide forums for individuals to question how tech is rolled out. Second, most of today’s solutions originate in the US and Europe, but the same solutions may play out differently in different socio-economic contexts. Citizens need forums in which they can discuss what is best suited for them, rather than have a solution thrust from the Global North. Third, it is not just where we land that matters, but also how we get there. The path countries take on tech needs to be based on democratic norms and a respect for constitutional principles like individual liberty and non-discrimination. Those that don’t will risk being unsustainable because of possible tech lash by the people or&nbsp;courts.</p><p>That’s the “easy” part. The more difficult question is where to even start. Here’s the approach Omidyar Network is experimenting with:</p><p>We are seeking to better understand the existing laws and institutions, and how they are performing, including the entire mosaic required for a thriving digital economy: data protection, competition, taxation, transparency, cybersecurity, speech regulation, consumer protection, and more. Many of the underlying principles are context-agnostic, although their application to a country requires nuance and caution. To help guide our learning, we have commissioned multiple cross-country analyses of data protection <a href="https://omidyar.com/data-protection-and-digital-infrastructure-before-during-and-after-a-pandemic-2/">laws</a>. We have also recently funded the <a href="https://africafoicentre.org/">Africa Freedom of Information Centre</a> in Uganda to evaluate whether open contracting norms are applied effectively to government procurement of tech systems. We are curious about issues surrounding surveillance and online free&nbsp;speech.</p><p>Concurrently, we are exploring ways to strengthen the capacity of institutions that uphold these laws. Across the globe, we see that regulators struggle with low budgets and headcounts, wait for years for cases to wend their way through the courts, and for governments to belatedly apply ineffective band-aids on issues that require fundamental re-thinking. As such, we are working in different institutional contexts to understand which types of capacity-building efforts are most effective. For example, we recently funded the <a href="https://digitalrightslawyers.org/who-we-are/#:~:text=Digital%20Rights%20Lawyers%20Initiative%20is,exercisable%20in%20the%20digital%20space.">Digital Rights Lawyers Initiative</a> in Nigeria to train lawyers in digital rights litigation in the hopes it will improve the quality of technology rulings.</p><p>Finally, we are supporting digital rights organizations throughout Africa to act as checks on technological excesses of both governments and corporations. We partnered with the <a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/">Next Generation of African Foresight Practitioners at the School of International Futures</a> to generate a set of insights, signals, and scenarios that look out to 2030, and explore their implications for African institutions.</p><p>Our hope is that these investments will help us — and our many partners — answer critical questions: Which laws do we need? Which institutions can uphold them? And how can we hold institutions accountable?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/institutions-matter-60c819d32e2a">Institutions Matter</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 <p>For this tutorial, we will be referring to Alice Smith who is a recent graduate of Faber College. Alice is looking to apply for a job at ACME Corp. and has started the process of filling out the company’s online application form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In previous “how to” posts, we walked through the scenarios of 1) Faber College <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">issuing Alice a university diploma</a> in the form of a verifiable credential and 2) Alice <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-create-connections-in-trinsic-studio/">creating a connection</a> with ACME Corp. to securely begin applying for a job online. If you have not already completed these steps, we suggest you go back and complete those steps before continuing with the tutorial below.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Log in to Trinsic Studio 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>To do so, go to <a href="https://trinsic.studio/login">https://trinsic.studio/login</a>. If you do not have a Trinsic Studio account, you can create one for free at <a href="https://trinsic.studio/">https://trinsic.studio/</a>. As mentioned above, you will need to complete the tutorials for <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">issuing credentials</a> and <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-create-connections-in-trinsic-studio/">creating connections</a> in Trinsic Studio before moving forward.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create a verification template 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Before Alice can fill out an online job application from ACME Corp., the company must create one. Let’s assume that ACME Corp. wants to request the following information in the application:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  First Name  Last Name  Degree  Year  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because ACME Corp. wants to ensure the legitimacy of an applicant’s responses, the information listed above must come from a valid college diploma. So let’s get started creating the verification template.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, get the Schema ID for the transcript. To do so:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  First, click on the Faber College organization card on the dashboard screen.  Click on the “Credentials” tab.  Copy the “Schema ID” from the College Diploma credential template.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now create the job application template:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Return to the dashboard screen and click on the ACME Corp. organization card.  Click on the “Verifications” tab, and click the “+ Template” button.  Name the verification “Job Application”.  Now we are going to set the policies. Policies are a way to specify what data to request from a digital wallet. Click on the “+ Policy” dropdown, and you will see that there are two types of Policies—”Predicate” and “Attribute”. Select “Attribute”.  Enter “Diploma Verification” as the policy name.  In the “Select Credential Template” dropdown, select “Define Custom Attributes”.  In the “Define Attributes” text box, enter the attribute names exactly as they appear in the credential template that you created for Faber College. So we will write in First Name, Last Name, Degree, and Year.  In the “Credential Restrictions” dropdown, select “Schema ID” and paste the transcript schema ID into the text box that appears. This is so that only credentials issued from the template you created previously will pass the verification.  Click the “Save Policy” button and wait a few seconds for the template to be saved.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Send a verification request 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now that ACME Corp. has set up its verification template, it can send its verification to Alice!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As ACME Corp.:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  In the “Verifications” tab, locate the verification template you’ll use to request a verification from Alice. Click on the “Request” button which corresponds to this template.  In the list of “Send verification request via options”, select the “Connection” option.  Click on the connection you’ve made for Alice.  Click “Send Request”.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now as Alice:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Your Trinsic Wallet should get a push notification for the verification request from your ACME Corp. connection.  From your home screen, select the verification request to respond. Once you’ve opened it, you can customize the information you share if you have more than one credential that can satisfy the request. In this case, we do not.  If the information looks correct, press&nbsp;“Present”.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>And just like that, Alice has securely sent ACME Corp. the information it asked for in the online job application.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					In the Trinsic Wallet, a verification request notification will appear.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					Once the user clicks on the verification request, the user can see what the verifier is asking for along with the information the user will be sending to the verifier.

Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> What is the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy? <p>Bruce simplifies Web3 for us: Web3 denotes the fact that you are working on technologies that are decentralized. In the world of Web3 — smart contracts, the code, the tokens — they all run on substrates that can’t be stopped by people or central intermediaries.</p><p>As a group, people can determine the direction of the platform and the infrastructure. But it’s a very hard coordination problem and there needs to be a democratic process in order to make changes on that. This makes Web3 resilient and robust for putting many of the concepts of value on top because by using that, as a substrate. You can start to give people, companies, individuals, back control of things that they value, whether it’s their identity, intellectual property, their money, land titles, whatever is the value that we, as humans have, can now live on that substrate.</p><p>We as individuals can control data using a private key, an ethereum address, a Bitcoin address — these types of things. This is what signifies Web3 as opposed to something like Web 2, which is the rise of the Internet platforms — it was where you have a central database, where your private information is vacuumed up, where governments are the sole authority for issuing identity, or privileges, etc. You have large multinational companies that have almost more power than governments in some ways, and having this rich database that you actually kind of have to trust that they’re handling.</p><p>“We’re seeing that there are these hacks of governments, Internet companies, banks that hold the customer data — be it with identity or money. The difference between Web 2 and Web 3, philosophically is that instead of trusting somebody else, you hold your things of value with important records. You put it on the substrate and control that. You have to question what is the right structure for holding value and managing governments, managing your society, depending on the state of the technology and the state of the people,” he&nbsp;says.</p> Data Sovereignty, DeFi and Government control of&nbsp;data <p>If a government wants something, they can still take it, but the power of Web 3 is that — it has to be something very specific. Instead of going to a bank and seizing the bank and all their assets, now they’d have to go to each one of us individually, knock on the doors and ask for those private keys. This constraints the power. The overreach of government is pervasive, regardless of which government and with Web3 technologies that overreached are now constrained back to perhaps a more natural agreement that citizens would agree&nbsp;to.</p><p>We asked Bruce what is the term he would give for decentralized finance, the new way of controlling your&nbsp;data:</p><p>“I call it a ‘new data economy’, rivaling other sectors like land and property, or the corporation and all these innovations of humanity. I think data itself will become an economy as big as these. I can break it down into two parts: First is can I truly control my data? And then when I do share it, is it safe? Do I feel comfortable? Can I maintain a certain amount of privacy? That’s one set, just control. The second set is: What is my data&nbsp;worth?”</p><p>We haven’t had enough trading on data. Or if we have had trades, it’s held by a very small group of people who know what the data is worth. So we don’t really have a price. These are the two things that we need to unlock the data&nbsp;economy:</p>  To have the tools available to unlock the data while giving each individual control and the comfort to&nbsp;share.  We need to find a way to price the data so that once you’ve priced something, then you can start layering on the various tools like securitization, collateralization, lending, insurance etc on data. These are the two&nbsp;pillars.   Ocean V3 and The New Data&nbsp;Economy <p>Bruce talks about how Ocean spent the first few years thinking about the first problem that existed. How do you share data securely? It basically comes down to access control and Ocean uses blockchain and all the capabilities within blockchain for access control. If you trigger a smart contract correctly, then it will give you access to this resource. That’s what Ocean does, it solves that first problem. That was our first release V1 and&nbsp;V2.</p><p>“Ocean V1 was just about access control, V2 was this concept of computer data, where we acknowledge that data is heavy. It never wants to move. It wants to stay exactly where it’s sitting because that’s the safest place it is. And then you bring an algorithm, to compute to process that data, and then the algorithm just leaves with the data with the results and not the data. And Ocean V3 is solving the second problem, which is the financialization of it and it is the concept of data tokens, where every dataset is encapsulated in a token — both the value of the token and the&nbsp;access.”</p><p>It’s this kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:</a> you can use this data token both for accessing data, but it also represents the value. This interesting approach has now spawned in the Ocean market. “We released Ocean V3 recently, but it’s now spawned a very vibrant ecosystem of people who are scouting for data, who are assessing the value of data as well as people who are essentially doing prediction markets, another word could be speculating on the value of that data. And it’s exciting, we have already 500 datasets, there’s 2 million Ocean locked up in the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>.”</p><p>The interesting part is that the community is figuring out how to price&nbsp;data.</p><p>“We’re seeing that when a new dataset comes out — within one or two hours, the price stabilizes, normally taking no more than six hours now. Because of this datatoken concept on the Ocean Market, you can now price data, and the market will tell you it’s real value. This is a huge innovation because the more datasets we get onto the market, the better it will be for analysing this data and more sophisticated the players will become in pricing that data faster and faster. That’s how markets form. So that solves the second problem we now have using Web 3 technologies, like automated market makers, ERC-20 tokens, the ethereum network, we have the ability to price data and give access control securely. I think that’s revolutionary.”</p> Main players in the Data market: Publishers, consumers, and the ‘stakers’ <p>You could call the data marketplace a three-sided market. If you look at a traditional company like Airbnb: you have Airbnb as the platform provider, and then you have the people who put up the capacity such as the rooms, the other people who are the consumers, the visitors. In Ocean Market, you have a third player. You’ll have the publisher, the consumer, the AI researcher. The publisher is an individual company. On top of that, you’re going to have the staker. This is the person who participates in a prediction market and helps give that data asset a price signal and can speculate on the value and make gains or losses, depending on whether or not their bet is correct how good their analysis tools are. So in Ocean Market, you have three players, you have the publishers, the consumers and the&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>“ I’ve had a lot of conversations with companies who have reached out to us who are interested in Ocean Market. The response has been great, surprisingly great. We’ve realized with the design of the market, you don’t actually don’t need incentives from the project just to publish your dataset. If you are a data hunter and you find a valuable dataset — you publish or help that publisher publish it. Then you stake on it and you’re the winner. You’re either the first or the second staker on that&nbsp;data.”</p> Final Thoughts <p>“I think that we as humans are really bad at understanding the concept of exponential, whether it’s for investing or technological progress. We’re on an exponential curve and now with crypto and blockchain, we brought finance onto an exponential curve. We’re bringing data onto an exponential curve at the pace of innovation,” says&nbsp;Bruce.</p><p>He concludes by quoting Ocean Co-Founder Trent McConaghy. “ He told me very early on when we were kind of throwing ideas around in 2013 or 2014. Trent said ‘One thing I’ve learned is that anything that touches Moore’s Law starts to assume the characteristics of Moore’s law, which is exponential growth.’ That’s what we’re doing, we’re putting a data economy on an exponential curve.”</p><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topic discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>1:18 — 4:57 The journey of Bruce Pon (Founder, Ocean Protocol) from banker to data&nbsp;banker</p><p>4:57 — 8:00 What is&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>8:30 — 11:57 Is data sovereignty real sovereignty?

  <p>New business opportunities require agility from application portfolios. Yet many businesses today are limited in their ability to adapt, often due to their application portfolios being bloated, difficult to change and aligned to the strategy of the past.</p>
<p>Enter the composable business.</p>
<p>A composable business is an organization that delivers business outcomes and rapidly adapts to business change. Think of it as building blocks made from applications to be assembled and rearranged as needed.</p>
<p>“Application leaders are in a unique position to support digital transformation, as the ability to adapt and change applications in the portfolio is central to delivering on the composable business,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/36581">Dennis Gaughan</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>To deliver the future strategy of the organization, application leaders must modernize the application portfolio to ensure it operates at the pace of business change.</p>
 Develop a vision for the composable business 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable/">The composable business</a> will manifest in different ways for different organizations, based on business strategy dynamics and the competitive nature of the market. A critical first step to support this vision is to define what the composable business will look like over the long term.</p>
<p>Ask key questions to help the organization understand the broader market and technology impacts that will inform and influence the composable business, such as:</p>
 
 How will the markets we operate in evolve over the next three to five years, and how will that change the competitive landscape? 
 How does our business strategy and operational structure need to change to reflect the changing market dynamics? 
 What new business models are we pursuing? What new markets do we plan to penetrate? 
 In which areas can we gain competitive advantage by developing capabilities in-house, rather than buying standard capabilities from vendors? 
 
<p>Once a set of longer-term goals have been established based on the current technology landscape and architecture, begin to define the organization’s roadmap to the composable business.</p>
<p>Essential elements of the roadmap include:</p>
 
 A clearly defined set of business outcomes 
 A plan for modernizing the existing application state 
 A vendor strategy 
 A target architecture 
 A plan for adapting the application delivery model 
 A powerful integration platform strategy 
 A mechanism for measuring the realization of business outcomes 
 A risk analysis and mitigation strategy

 Begin the architecture evolution toward PBCs 
<p>Application leaders can support composability through the assembly and combination of application building blocks, also known as packaged business capabilities (PBCs). PBCs deliver more unique and customized application experiences to users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dynamic experience of the composable business will become the prevailing architecture, integration and delivery model for software innovation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PBCs can be sourced from third parties or <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/key-strategies-for-cost-optimization-in-application-design-and-development/">composed internally</a>. They are assembled using their APIs and event streams to create application experiences that are intuitive and can be tailored to individual needs or preferences. This new portfolio is grounded in a mesh app and service architecture (MASA). It defines a new set of application capabilities that can be combined and recombined as business needs shift.</p>
<p>The transition to the composable business is gradual. Over time, more PBC-centric applications will be available from software vendors and marketplaces, and legacy applications will be modernized toward the PBC model. The dynamic experience of the composable business will become the prevailing architecture, integration and delivery model for software innovation.</p>

 ONCHAINID Notifications 
<p>Once an investor updates any of the personal information linked to their ONCHAINID profile, all the relevant parties that have previously KYC’ed the individual will be automatically alerted with a notification. </p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in November 2020.</p>   
	 
		 
			 Why is ONCHAINID Notification important? 
<p>Issuers who are issuing financial instruments have an obligation to identify their investors and confirm their eligibility for the instrument in question. As you know, our products support the issuers in those processes when they issue digital securities.</p>
<p>However, while an investor might be KYC’ed and qualified to subscribe in a security token at its issuance, their status in that respect might evolve and change during their period of holding. As a result, the issuer is required to KYC their investors on a regular basis or possibly whenever their investor’s personal information (e.g. country of residence) changes.</p>
 How does it work? 
<p>So far, for securities issued in traditional private markets, the process of keeping track of these changes in the status and information related to investors is generally quite a heavy, manual and lengthy process. Each counterparty is notified individually, if at all, creating significant risk exposure for issuers.</p>
<p>ONCHAINID Notifications brings efficiency to this process through the use of blockchain identities. Once an investor updates any of the personal information linked to their ONCHAINID profile, all the relevant parties that have previously KYC’ed the individual will be automatically alerted with a notification. The investor does not need to inform all issuers (or their Agent) of those changes. Consequently, as issuers have the most up-to-date information on their investors, they can act with the utmost confidence their investors remain eligible for their token.</p>
 What does it offer to issuers? 

		 
	 
    <p>Assurance their investor data is up to date at all times</p>       <p>The ability to implement automation</p>       <p>A faster and more efficient compliance process</p>

  <p>Country leadership teams carry significant responsibility for both regional sales achievement and in-country operations in support of the local customer base. But the pandemic has sparked massive disruption to regional markets.</p>
<p>Country managers are now increasingly concerned about customer churn. At headquarters, global executive teams share the same worry: 50% of C-suite execs in companies with more than $100 million in revenue are very concerned about customer churn caused by the economic disruption related to COVID-19, according to the Gartner 2020 Technology Marketing Benchmarks Survey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Market conditions and depressed demand make it imperative to focus on retaining the business you have in hand</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the 2020 Tech Marketing Benchmarks survey did not find that technology marketers share this level of concern. In fact, only 29% of technology marketers reported they are “very concerned” with customer churn.</p>
 [swg_ad id="37599"] 
<p>The disconnect is because marketing teams are still held accountable for driving new business leads into the sales pipeline. The metrics by which<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-market-to-b2b-technology-buyers/"> marketing</a> is measured lag behind reality — the same survey revealed that only 33% of respondents had changed their marketing KPIs in response to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/create-contingency-plans-for-events-canceled-due-to-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>And metrics drive behavior. Only 42% of respondents had taken steps to increase resources for customer retention and expansion as a result of COVID-19 between April and July of 2020.</p>
<p>Although country leadership teams should have goals that focus on new customer acquisition, market conditions and depressed demand make it imperative to focus on retaining the business you have in hand as well.</p>

<p>Drive customer touchpoints at scale through “tech touch” — a programmatic cadence of content, programs and events offered through digital channels</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond just churn prevention, country leadership teams must seize the opportunity to shift attention and resources to focus on expansion within the customer base — which may offer the biggest revenue “opportunity” right now — especially as new prospect acquisition slows.</p>
<p>To do this, country leadership teams should encourage partnership between technology marketers and customer success teams. Marketing should collaborate closely with customer success to design digital outreach throughout the customers’ owning journey to accelerate adoption and customer time to value, both of which will head off churn risk. In times of uncertainty, customer success resources are stretched thin and struggle to scale across the entire customer base.</p>
<p>Marketing can drive customer touchpoints at scale through “tech touch” — a programmatic cadence of content, programs and events offered through digital channels that proactively guide them to success and complement human-powered interactions.</p>
<p>Country leadership must recognize that marketing has a crucial role to play with existing customer <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-product-management-drives-tech-firm-growth/">retention and growth</a> and enable adjustments to marketing KPIs based on the fact that business conditions have changed drastically.</p>
<p>Not making this shift is a missed opportunity to help protect and generate revenue growth by driving expansion within current accounts. If country managers are depending on a global/corporate marketing organization, it is vital they make the case for customer-focused marketing resources for their region.</p>

<p>Om burgers met een laag inkomen en een chronische ziekte of beperkingen te ondersteunen, bieden ruim 300 gemeenten in Nederland een collectieve zorgverzekering aan: de Gemeentepolis.&nbsp; Deze kan via Gezondverzekerd.nl worden aangevraagd. Dankzij de premium licentie van Gezondverzekerd.nl (BS&amp;F) kan de benodigde informatie voor deze aanvragen vanaf nu makkelijk en veilig worden aangeleverd met behulp van de Ockto-app.</p>



<p>Snelle en veilige beoordeling van aanvragen<br>Aan het aanvragen van een Gemeentepolis zijn een aantal voorwaarden verbonden. Zo is deze collectieve zorgverzekering inkomensafhankelijk. Voorheen werden alle benodigde gegevens handmatig gecontroleerd in de Backofficeapplicatie van Gezondverzekerd.nl. Een tijdrovend proces, waarbij communicatie en documenten via post en e-mail werden verstuurd. Door het gebruik van Ockto in het inventarisatieproces kunnen gemeenteambtenaren nu sneller beoordelen of iemand recht heeft op de Gemeentepolis.</p>



<p>Wanneer iemand een aanvraag doet voor de Gemeentepolis wordt hem of haar vanaf nu gevraagd om de benodigde gegevens aan te leveren via de Ockto-app. Met de app worden, na inlog met DigiD de benodigde gegevens opgehaald bij overheidsportalen zoals de Belastingdienst en het UWV. Deze brondata wordt na goedkeuring verstuurd naar de Backofficeapplicatie van Gezondverzekerd.nl. Daar kan de gemeente vervolgens beoordelen of deze persoon, op basis van zijn of haar inkomens- en/of vermogenssituatie, in aanmerking komt voor een Gemeentepolis.</p>



<p>Auke Dirkmaat, Ockto: “We zijn zeer verheugd te zien dat men dit aanvraagtraject door gebruik van de Ockto-app een stuk zelfstandiger doorloopt. Het gemak van de app en de gegevens in één keer goed aangeleverd zorgen voor een aanzienlijke verbetering van dit proces.”</p>



<p>Hertoetsing en snel uitsluitsel<br>Ook kan Ockto worden ingezet bij de hertoetsing van alle burgers die al onder de Gemeentepolis vallen. Gegevens van de Belastingdienst en het UWV kunnen eenvoudig worden aangeleverd. Na het goedkeuren van de aanvraag of hertoetsing wordt er automatisch een beschikking gestuurd naar de burger.</p>



<p>Dit scheelt veel tijd en ook de burger weet snel waar hij of zij aan toe is. Daarnaast kunnen onterechte polissen sneller worden geïdentificeerd. “Het gebruik van Ockto maakt de beoordeling van een aanvraag niet alleen makkelijker voor de gemeente, ook de burger heeft sneller uitsluitsel”, meent Niek Wezenberg, manager bij BS&amp;F.</p>



<p>Over BS&amp;F &amp; de Gemeentepolis<br>De Gemeentepolis is een&nbsp;collectieve verzekering voor mensen met een&nbsp;laag inkomen en mensen met een chronische ziekte of beperking. Deze zorgverzekering wordt aangeboden door ruim 300 gemeenten via Gezondverzekerd.nl. In Nederland bieden bijna alle gemeenten een Gemeentepolis aan.</p>



<p>Bureau BS&amp;F ondersteunt overheden, zorgverzekeraars, zorgaanbieders, patiëntenorganisaties en belangenorganisaties bij het versterken van sociaal beleid, het realiseren van toegang tot zorg en het ondersteunen van kwetsbare mensen. Bijvoorbeeld door het opzetten en beheren van het platform Gezondverzekerd.nl</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/reinwarth">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>Since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, the use of language in public life, in the press, and in everyday life has changed. Terms that were formerly confined to the circles directly affected by them are now much more common. For example, every informed and responsible citizen is now familiar with specific terms from epidemiology and immunology such as “reproduction number” and “herd immunity”.</p>
<p>Another term that has risen to prominence since the beginning of the crisis is “first-line worker”. These workers literally work on the front line. They are often found in retail and hospitality. But this way of working is also prevalent in the manufacturing industry and in customer service. And the current health crisis is rightly drawing attention to the many different types of first-line workers in the healthcare sector.</p>
<p>Whether a doctor or nurse, restaurant server or supermarket employee, whether a specialist in multi-shift operation at the robotized production line of an industrial enterprise or a short-term employee in a promotional campaign in a consumer electronics store, first-line workers all have one thing in common: They all need technical access to corporate resources and most of them use shared devices. In other words, devices that are used by several users one after another or in rotation.</p>
 Balancing efficiency and user experience with security and compliance 
<p>Fast logon and fast user switching (using authentication mechanisms such as RFID chip or biometrics), secure access to all data and systems needed in the current context, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and secure, reliable logoff are essential for first-line workers. The example of a nurse working in shifts who needs immediate yet secure access to patient data in a medical emergency shows how important this can be.</p>
<p>First-line workers were around before the pandemic and there are a lot more than expected. Managing them properly is essential. But while <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/modernizing-iam-solutions-leveraging-new-operating-models-with-the-kuppingercole-identity-fabric">traditional enterprise IAM</a> (Identity and Access Management) is often largely mature in many companies for conventional working models, the specific requirements of these ways of working are sometimes insufficiently covered. The consequences are obvious: lack of efficiency, inadequate security, violation of compliance, but also dissatisfaction and frustration among those affected. The current crisis is putting a spotlight on these issues, highlighting the scale of the challenge and the need for appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>Addressing the topic of first-line workers properly entails a variety of technologies, concepts, and products. These need to be combined to aggregate all the necessary information to enable workers to access whatever resources they need quickly and efficiently. This includes the management of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lc80063">employee identities and authorizations</a>, management of devices, Single Sign-On and Single Sign Off, adaptive and risk-oriented authentication, and proper and fast <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/bc80201">access to all necessary, often critical resources</a>. If the concept of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/search?q=zero+trust&amp;f=r&amp;s=d">Zero Trust Infrastructures</a> comes to mind, you are on the right track.</p>
 Connecting and enabling first line workers 
<p>Appropriate IAM concepts are necessary and essential, but without a comprehensive overall architecture model they cannot solve this problem on their own. The <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lb80204">KuppingerCole Identity Fabric</a>, however, is designed as an overarching paradigm for the design of service-oriented architectures to enable efficient and secure access by all users to all relevant resources. And it integrates identity and access into company-wide infrastructures both for the respective core business and for security, governance, and compliance.</p>
<p>On this basis, the required functionalities can be identified and defined with regard to usability, efficiency, and applicable policies. These well-defined services, which reflect the individual requirements of an organization and its specific first-line workers, enable the right software components to be selected. This includes end-point management, dynamic authorization management, and access management along with multi-factor authentication and others depending on the individual challenges. These building blocks can then be deployed and orchestrated wherever they are needed.</p>
<p>However, it must also be pointed out that technology is not the only obstacle. A common cause of problems in deploying such solutions are the highly unattractive licensing schemes used by many IAM system vendors when it comes to technical offerings for first-line workers. This is what makes it difficult to quickly extend IAM to this user group.</p>
 First-line workers deserve better (including user experience and security) 
<p>The current crisis, new and changing requirements in different industries, but also the preparation for upcoming crises and challenges, require us to provide both stable and agile architectures that support all work models in our organizations. The KuppingerCole Identity Fabric as a concept for key cybersecurity infrastructures in modern, hybrid IT environments allows us to meet today's requirements and the demands of the future. This applies especially to the continually changing way in which our employees, partners and customers communicate with each other and interact with company resources.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding specific requirements for access by first-line workers or generally regarding the management and monitoring of access in our fragmented work environments, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:mr@kuppingercole.com?subject=Managing%20First%20Line%20Workers%20-%20Let%20us%20talk">me</a> or <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/contact">us</a>. First-line workers deserve good and efficient tools, and their organization should provide them with the appropriate level of security and compliance.</p>

<p>By now, you’ve probably read the announcement about the creation of the <a href="https://jans.io">Janssen Project</a> at the <a href="https://linuxfoundation.org">Linux Foundation</a>. This was the culmination of many months of collaborative planning–we started in early March 2020, before the pandemic. You may be wondering, why did we do it? What does it mean for Gluu? Following is a discussion of some of the thoughts behind the decision. </p>
 Doubling Down on Open Source 
<p>I’m a big fan of open source software development. But does it make sense to launch a business around an open source project? And if so, what is the best way to do it? To answer these questions, in 2018 I launched a podcast called <a href="https://opensourceunderdogs.com">Open Source Underdogs</a>. After publishing 55 episodes, I’m more convinced than ever that it makes sense for identity and access management software–an infrastructure based on open Internet standards–to leverage the open source development methodology. However, I also concluded that it was beneficial to make the boundary at Gluu more clear between what is open source, and what is commercial. Moving the project to the Linux Foundation helps to achieve this goal.  Companies or organizations can trust that the Janssen project will always be open source. And we’ll do our best to make sure that the community is vibrant enough to drive Janssen to maintain a leadership position among identity and access management platforms. </p>
 Better Code 
<p>The paramount goal at Gluu is to write the best open source identity platform in the world.  Increasing the transparency of the development process, aligning with the <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>, and adopting other best practices in the development of our software–out in the open–will help us improve the quality of the software. Yes we could do this on our own. But collaborative project governance will help to keep us focused on the things that are important. </p>
 Innovation 
<p>Digital identity and security are evolving as rapidly as the devices we use, and the weaknesses hackers seek to exploit.  Gluu Server 4.2 is already the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">most certified</a> OpenID Connect provider currently available. The <a href="https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-auth-server">Janssen Authorization Server</a>, a fork of Gluu Server 4.2, is starting from an advanced position. But this battle is not won. Victory will require a long sustained effort of many years. Innovation is the essential complement to quality. The open source development methodology results in faster innovation for core infrastructure. But simply changing the license on your software is not enough! To put a project into a higher gear, you need to engage the community. We’re hoping that the move to Janssen will more effectively accomplish this.</p>
 Community Governance 
<p>For the last ten years, the project has been governed through the equivalent of enlightened despotism. This made sense because the goals of the project, and the business goals of Gluu were roughly aligned.  However, for the long-term benefit of the project, we need to democratize. Other people and organizations who invest in the project should have a say in the direction of the project. The Technical Steering Committee is defined by the <a href="https://github.com/JanssenProject/home/blob/main/community/charter.md">Project Charter</a> to provide this governance. </p>
 Developer Engagement 
<p>The launch of the Janssen project is an opportunity for us to become more responsive to the needs of the developer community. How we build the software needs to become a more open and collaborative process. It’s going to take some work to get there, but we’re committed to make it happen. We plan to make more developer friendly choices. If you have any ideas for how to do this, please share! </p>
 Ecosystem 
<p>When it comes to the development of core infrastructure software, no company is an island. A group of organizations with an aligned economic interest provide a solid foundation to sustain an open source project in the long term.  Gluu will continue its mission to productize open source software, making it more consumable by enterprises. The Janssen project software is the critical component of that offering.  But other companies can develop a commercial value proposition that aligns with their business goals.  The more companies that have a stake in the success of Janssen, the better.</p>
 Cloud Native 
<p>Companies always have to look out for disruptive technologies. Cloud native is the most disruptive infrastructure technology since virtualization.  By nature and doctrines, the cloud native community prefers open source components. So if we want to position Janssen as the ideal authentication and authorization component of a cloud native stack, it has to be open source. And to the extent that moving the project to the Linux Foundation strengthens Janssen’s position as an open source platform, it helps us build trust with the cloud native community. At the same time, we have to recognize that there are still organizations that are not ready to make this leap. So while we are “all in” on cloud native, we also want to provide a bridge to get to the other side of the river. Janssen will implement cloud native design principles–many of which make sense intrinsically, no matter what kind of infrastructure you’re running. But at the same time, we are not dogmatic about how organizations can use the software. </p>
 Gluu 5 
<p>With the introduction of Janssen, the line between open source and Gluu becomes more clear. Gluu Server 5 will be introduced in the first quarter of 2021. This gives us an opportunity to do something we’ve been trying to do for many years: move to an open core business model, where a vendor adds value on top of an open source software distribution.  Gluu Server 5 will be the first Gluu distribution to feature the Janssen Auth-Server as the core security engine. It will also feature a new and improved admin web interface. The Gluu management team believes that licensing this new distribution will greatly improve monetization, which will result in more budget for open source research and development.  We will continue to patch Gluu Server 4.2.x until it’s end-of-life in December 2022. </p>
 Gluu Cloud 
<p>Janssen’s focus on cloud native design principles will come in handy, as Gluu is planning to launch a single-tenant hosted service called “Gluu Cloud.” People have been asking us to launch a hosted service for years. It’s not that we weren’t listening. Sometimes it just takes a while to act on all these good ideas. One of the benefits of launching Gluu Cloud is that the experience we gain will have a positive feedback loop for cloud native features in Janssen. Hopefully other vendors around the world will also launch a similar service in their markets–and join the Janssen Project!  Using the cloud native stack, and the new Janssen <a href="https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-config-api">config-api</a>, hosted providers can now automate the entire auth-server provisioning process, and build their own business specific, branded interfaces.  Look for Gluu Cloud Q2 2021.</p>
 Janssen VIP Support 
<p>Some current or future Gluu customers may not want to move to the commercially licensed Gluu Server 5. They may want to stick with the freedom afforded by the permissive license of an open source distribution.  The good news is that Gluu has got your back. We will continue to offer a VIP support package (for the Janssen distribution) so you can open private issues in our support forums, get an SLA on the response to support issues (e.g. one hour for severity one), communicate on our Rocket chat channels, and schedule ad hoc Zoom calls. </p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Here at Gluu we are grateful to the Linux Foundation for helping us to launch Janssen. It’s been a lot of work! I truly believe that by making the software more open, we’ll both have a more positive impact in the world, and that we’ll achieve Gluu’s growth objectives.

<p><a href="http://streetcred.id">Streetcred ID</a> is thrilled to announce we have joined the <a href="http://www.sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a> Network as a Steward. As a Sovrin Steward, Streetcred ID will collaborate with the <a href="http://sovrin.org/stewards">75+ other Stewards</a> who maintain the integrity of the Sovrin&nbsp;Network.</p><p>It isn’t a secret that trust on the internet is broken. There isn’t a way to prove who you are, claims about a product, or even exchange verified personal information online in a privacy-preserving and secure way — until now. With the advent of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and the Sovrin Network, individuals, organizations, and connected things can exchange digital identity credentials with the assurance that they are in control of their personal data, not a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>But the Sovrin Network is more than this. It is an identity metasystem that allows for ad hoc workflows and processes, making ‘identity’ in the digital world function, for the first time, similarly to the way it does in the physical world. Streetcred provides the best way to integrate the Sovrin metasystem into any application, allowing for flexibility of integration into any workflows and/or processes.</p><p>Sovrin Stewards play an important role in the maintenance and governance of the Sovrin Network which includes running the network’s validator nodes. The diversity among the Stewards — their geographic location, industry, and type of organization — ensures the Sovrin Network is not controlled by any one institution, government, or industry.</p><p>“The individuals that make up the Streetcred ID team include some of the earliest advocates of the Sovrin Network,” says Heather Dahl, Executive Director &amp; CEO of Sovrin Foundation. “The Streetcred team has been influential in providing significant code contributions to the Sovrin and SSI communities, and we are thrilled to include them as one of the Sovrin Stewards.”</p><p>Besides the contribution of core infrastructure to the Sovrin Network, we believe other contributions are vital to the growth of the self-sovereign identity community as well. In addition to the open-source code contributions Streetcred is known for, we are allocating resources to standards development, governance working groups, and other task&nbsp;forces.</p><p>We are a team of passionate self-sovereign identity advocates who believe that decentralized identity technology should be extremely easy to integrate into any application. It started back in 2018 when our CTO Tomislav Markovski built the Agent Framework (<a href="https://medium.com/streetcred-id/agentframework-for-net-joins-hyperledger-aries-14aba357da41">recently contributed</a> to the Hyperledger Aries project) which quickly became one of the most popular ways to build SSI agents. And we’re excited to share what we’re working on next, which we believe will become the most popular way to build SSI agents going forward! Stay&nbsp;tuned…</p><p>About Streetcred ID</p><p>Streetcred ID partners with innovators around the world to help them easily and rapidly integrate decentralized identity into any application. Run by a team of experts in self-sovereign digital identity, Streetcred’s unique combination of developer tools and advisory is trusted by industries from rural farming to global banks alike.

<p>Before the word ‘elephant’ was broadly used, how would one describe the big, leathery&nbsp;animal?</p>Source: J. Himmelfarb (artist G. Renee&nbsp;Guzlas)<p>Each of these people call the elephant something different because they each have a different perspective. When you think about it, an elephant really is like a big wall with a snake and spears coming out of its face, trees for legs, and a rope-like tail. Without a concise name for the sum of its parts, its meaning can be communicated, although imperfectly, by a description of each part individually¹.</p>The most reproduced cartoon in the history of the New&nbsp;Yorker.<p>Similarly, there is a new category of technology and business solutions that seeks to solve the proverbial “dog on the internet” identity problem for individuals, organizations, and connected devices. Most often called ‘SSI’ (for ‘self-sovereign identity’) or ‘decentralized identity’, these terms are often used in the same way ‘elephant’ is used — with a wealth of meaning and nuance not apparent to beginners. A review of the different terms used to reference SSI provides a helpful introduction.</p> Naming the&nbsp;Category <p>‘SSI’ is the noun I’m using throughout this post to reference this new category of solutions, although there are three primary candidates used in the market today, each with a different emphasis.</p> Self-sovereign identity <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a movement that claims digital identity should be just as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation. SSI is the combination of decentralized identity and trust over IP (both defined below) but also encompasses other technologies and business solutions to enable its purpose. ‘Self-sovereign identity’ was the first category-defining term to catch on, and therefore the most widely used today. But the first terms to catch on are not always the best nor the longest-lasting; groups at industry conferences² have even convened to try to come up with an alternative to ‘SSI’, to no avail. <a href="http://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> is a nonprofit that champions this name with its mission “identity for&nbsp;all”.</p><p>Many governments, actual sovereigns (noun), strongly dislike the term ‘sovereign’ (adjective). Businesses seeking to sell SSI solutions to governments often steer clear as well. While the name ‘SSI’ does a good job at describing the human application and aspiration of decentralized identity technologies, it isn’t clear to most people how B2B and IoT use cases fit in this framework. Finally, I’ve <a href="https://medium.com/@rileyparkerhughes/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">spoken before</a> about how the term is too tightly associated with the blockchain world.</p><p>Some of the problems associated with the word ‘sovereign’ could go away if ‘SSI’ becomes the de facto term as I’m using it throughout this post. As identity expert Drummond Reed frequently points out, we use acronyms every day whose full names we don’t know — ATM, SMS, HTTP, ROTC, AIDS, OTC, FAQ or even GEICO or AT&amp;T, for example (if you knew the full names for all of those, kudos&nbsp;😊).</p> Decentralized identity <p>‘Decentralized identity’ is the second most-used term to describe the category. Decentralized identity’s emphasis is much more technical in nature and seems to focus on traditional IAM use cases. <a href="http://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) is the primary industry association &amp; standards body championing this&nbsp;term.</p><p>The word ‘decentralized’ can feel a bit vague because it describes what SSI is not (ie, not centralized) but doesn’t explain what it is. For that reason, one needs to explain the benefits of decentralization separately:</p>  Locus of control: Accessing data from centralized databases, as occurs with other identity tech, requires access and permission from the database administrator — not necessarily consent from the subject of the data. Thus, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/software-vendor-says-data-breach-exposed-nearly-28-million-texas-drivers-license-records/ar-BB1b022l">data breaches</a> and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dmv-drivers-license-data-database-integrity-department-motor-vehicles-1458141">misuse of data</a> have led to people demanding <a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/01/21/we-need-to-own-our-data-as-a-human-right-and-be-compensated-for-it">ownership of their data</a>. With SSI, the data subject is the one with control to consent to sharing of their&nbsp;data.  Autonomy: As companies die and policies change, it’s helpful to avoid single points of failure. SSI wallets are transportable between different vendors, avoiding vendor lock-in. More on autonomy <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">here</a> and wallet portability <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">here</a>.  Public key infrastructure (PKI): Much of SSI hinges on public/private key cryptography. Trust in traditional PKI systems is rooted in certificate authorities. Identifiers are rented out by ICANN via the DNS system — a costly and centralized approach to PKI. Blockchains and other technologies enable decentralized PKI upon which SSI can be&nbsp;built.  <p>On one hand, ‘decentralized identity’ doesn’t capture the ideals of autonomy and existence that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">this blog post</a> and much of the industry appreciates about the term ‘self-sovereign’. On the other hand, organizations and connected devices don’t have their own autonomy — they must be controlled by people — so ‘decentralized identity’ may be a better fit for those use cases. In addition, while SSI decentralizes power associated with identity, it centralizes the storage and access to it (in a digital wallet instead of various databases across the web), which may make ‘decentralized’ a confusing word from a user experience perspective.</p> Trust over&nbsp;IP <p>Trust over IP (ToIP) is the newest term used to describe the category. It’s less focused on the traditional authentication/access management/directory services definition of digital identity and more focused on trustable data/credentials. This is a more attractive term than ‘sovereign’ for governments; John Jordan, ED of Trust Services for the government of British Columbia, coined the term and is the current leader of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a>, which focuses on building governance frameworks for trust ecosystems.</p><p>Just like ‘Voice over IP’ (VoIP) standardized a way to securely relay audio over the internet, so too does ‘Trust over IP’ seek to standardize a way to share trustable data over the internet. But the word ‘trust’ is fraught with baggage in today’s society and has caused pushback from the identity community and beyond. It’s too early to tell whether the term ‘ToIP’ will catch on more broadly and how the market will&nbsp;react.</p> Other terms for&nbsp;SSI <p>In addition to the category-defining names above, you may hear this technology referred to in a number of other, more niche ways. Like the elephant example I opened this post with, each of the following names refers to a specific characteristic of SSI which, taken together, give us a more complete&nbsp;picture.</p>The term used sometimes depends on which role’s perspective is being considered, as well as with whom that participant is interacting. Portable identity <p>SSI enables data portability, which has led to it sometimes being called ‘portable identity’. Portable comes from the Latin portare meaning carry, which is also behind the word transport or port. It really means that you can take something from one place or context to&nbsp;another.</p><p>Our real-world identity is portable. I can take my driver’s license from the DMV and the context of public roadways to the financial sector and get access to banking services. I can take my university transcript from the education domain to an employer to show my qualifications for a job. SSI makes this possible online. Issuers of credentials, in my experience, feel this dynamic most strongly; after all, anything they issue can be taken and shared with other parties by the holder if they so&nbsp;choose.</p> Multi-source identity <p>My physical, leather wallet has several credentials inside from a number of different sources. The SSI wallet on my phone is the same way; any number of organizations can issue credentials to it. I can then share information from any combination of them to prove things about myself; thus the identity I’m presenting can be comprised of multiple&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Despite its strengths, multi-source identity falls short of describing some of the other important properties of SSI. For example, a Facebook Wallet or other proprietary, centralized system could be used as the basis for a multi-source identity system that provides virtually no autonomy or control to the end-user³. For more on how ‘multi-source’ relates to ‘self-sovereign’, check out a great blog post<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Self-managed credentials <p>While ‘multi-source’ describes how credentials get into a wallet, ‘self-managed’ alludes to how credentials are controlled, stored, and shared. This shouldn’t imply that each end-user must hold their own keys or worry about storing their credentials locally — they could theoretically contract that out to a vendor or configure some AI to assist — but it does mean that the end-user is the one in the driver’s&nbsp;seat.</p><p>You may see ‘self-owned identity’ used instead of ‘self-managed’, but you won’t see that from me or most of my peers. Although many of the implications of ‘self-owned’ (possession, control, accountability) are common with ‘self-managed’ or ‘self-controlled’, the legal construct of ‘ownership’ (property rights, right to sell, exclusivity, etc) is a dangerous one in relation to identity⁴. Because of these nuances, ‘self-managed’ and its variations aren’t widely&nbsp;used.</p> User-controlled proofs <p>The term ‘user-controlled proofs’ is a yet unadopted term coined by Kim Cameron, author of <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">“The Laws of Digital Identity”</a>, seeking to be a bit more technically accurate than terms like ‘self-sovereign’. Indeed, in an SSI model, people not only collect credentials from multiple sources, but also share information from those credentials in the form of a ‘proof’. Those proofs can be verified independently, virtually, and instantly by anyone they’re shared with. While a verifier can specify their requirements in a request to a user, the user has control of whether and how they&nbsp;respond.</p><p>User-controlled proofs is a good term to describe the holder’s perspective of the interaction they have with the verifier. However it’s quite technical and would likely face adoption challenges when presented to the average identity&nbsp;holder⁵.</p> LESS Identity <p>Recently coined by <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/less-identity-65f65d87f56b">Tim Bouma</a>, Legally-enabled Self-sovereign (LESS) Identity <a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/can-less-be-more/">stands in contrast</a> to the ‘crypto-anarchist’ notion of a trustless self-sovereign identity⁶. LESS implies that the identity presented to a verifier is backed by a legal framework. Perhaps it’s a credential issued by a government or regulated institution. Or maybe there’s an existing legal framework that’s represented with a credential.</p><p>LESS enables verifiers to build trust beyond just the cryptographic assurance of a credential’s validity. Much of the work of the ToIP Foundation on governance frameworks is seeking to reinforce this notion. All of the projects I’m aware of with real traction are LESS identity.</p> Life-like identity <p>In <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">Trinsic’s introductory SSI post</a>, I explain how real-world human identity is the combination of intrinsic (Who am I? How do I identify myself?) and extrinsic (How does the state identify me? What does my university say that I have achieved?) factors. Because that’s how the real-world works, I love the name ‘life-like identity’ to describe SSI. To drive the point home, continue that logical train of thought to ‘login with Google’. Wouldn’t it be weird if instead of buying from a store directly, there was a Google representative at every register who authenticated you and mediated the transaction? Especially if they were also recording everything you say and do and sending it back to their boss to be reviewed and analyzed. That would never fly in the real world. And I don’t think it’ll be the norm online anymore in 10 years&nbsp;either.</p><p>Life-like identity is unfortunately not widely-used, but in many ways, it is a good umbrella term for everything else we’ve talked about in this post. This is really what we’re trying to create with this technology; solutions that respect human dignity in the interactions they have daily, just like exist in person. For more on this term, check out<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml"> this&nbsp;post</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>‘Self-sovereign identity’ is an imperfect name for an imperfect, but rapidly growing and promising new category of technology and business solutions. I think it’s the best term on the table; but ultimately, the way to refer to the category will be defined over time as the dust settles through real-world deployments. The name that will emerge will likely not be the first one, but the one with the least negative baggage that balances being specific to the technology but broad enough to encompass all its variations.</p><p>Taken collectively, each of the names listed in this post overlap with others in interesting ways, creating a more full picture of SSI. For example, could you have SSI without multi-source identity? Or without user-controlled proofs? Could this system ever work unless it was legally-enabled? And if we succeed at adopting SSI ubiquitously but it doesn’t bring more autonomy and dignity to our interactions online as we do in real life, did we really&nbsp;succeed?</p><p>If you enjoyed this post, reach out to me on LinkedIn and check out <a href="http://www.trinsic.id">Trinsic</a>, the easiest way to get started with&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>Thanks to Lynn Nichols, Anna Johnson, Phil Windley, Kaliya Young, Juan Caballero, Timothy Ruff, and Josh Welty for giving input on this&nbsp;post.</p><p>Footnotes</p>  The elephant example is fun, but this phenomenon isn’t just found in cartoons; examples are also found throughout the world. Look at religions for example. The central figure of Christianity is called a variety of names in the Bible, including Savior, Son of God, Shepherd, Messiah, and more. These names each communicate different aspects of the meaning assigned to the 5-letter word ‘Jesus’. In Islam, God is believed to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Islam">99&nbsp;names</a>.  <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">IIW 30</a>, book of proceedings, page 275 for notes on the discussion  Of course, Facebook could also build a wallet that supported individual privacy and autonomy if they wanted to! They’re just the boogyman for this&nbsp;example.  I own my car, so I can legally sell it (or parts of it) or rent it out in exchange for money. Can I sell my identity? Or rent out my driver’s license? No, I can’t. Nor should I be able to; identity and personal data are not property to be bargained with, but an intrinsic part of the self. Bodily autonomy is a closer metaphor for credentials than property ownership. Can you legally chop off and sell your arm? No, but you still generally have autonomy to act of your own volition with regard to your own body. So you don’t own your body; you use it, control it, etc. — likewise for your identity. For a better analysis on this, see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/06/26/why-data-ownership-is-the-wrong-approach-to-protecting-privacy/">here</a>.  One objection some people take to this term is the word ‘user’ which is seen in some circles as objectifying or dehumanizing. “Only two industries have users, drugs and tech,” so the saying goes. On the other hand, I’m using a keyboard to type this sentence. Any word has baggage if you look at it too&nbsp;closely.  In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzM_Brpk95E&amp;t=2352s">talk early this year</a>, Christopher Allen urges the community to keep the trustless identity in mind to keep in mind for more vulnerable populations who are disenfranchised by the legal regimes of which they’re a&nbsp;part.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/ssi-has-an-identity-problem-10b6f0617597">SSI has an Identity Problem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic">Trinsic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Given the interest blockchain has garnered over the last several years, claiming other things are more interesting is not an insignificant statement. And yet it’s true; as useful as blockchain is for SSI, it’s nowhere near as interesting as:</p>  The impact on the&nbsp;internet  The benefits of technical standards  The economic opportunity for early innovators  <p>At the end of this post, I’ll explain what blockchain is useful for, and how it catalyzed SSI.</p> The Impact on the&nbsp;Internet <p>Self-sovereign identity is a movement based on the premise that digital identity should be as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation.</p><p>Think of self-sovereign identity like a coin with a philosophical premise on each&nbsp;side.</p>  Intrinsic identity: As humans, we have an existence, dignity, worth, and an identity independently of anyone or anything. We have agency to act for ourselves to be who we&nbsp;are.  Extrinsic identity: We live not independently, but in the presence of other people, organizations, things, cultures, and environments with which we must interact to get along in the world. Some degree of trust is a prerequisite to interaction, and identification is a prerequisite of trust. Therefore, we need identification to get along in the&nbsp;world.  <p>Like the serfs of medieval Europe who depended on their feudal lords for existence, we too have relied on technology monoliths to provide our digital existence. Eventually, the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance"> Renaissance</a> broke down feudal structures and gave way to an ever-more egalitarian society. Likewise, self-sovereign identity gives people an independent digital existence wherein they have complete agency, and outside of which they negotiate as peers. In an age when<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322620145_Data_is_power_Towards_additional_guidance_on_profiling_and_automated_decision-making_in_the_GDPR"> data is power</a>, this is more important than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>For example, imagine a world where your physical wallet isn’t held by you, but by a corporation; using a card, license, or other document would require authentication and permission from that company. A representative from that company would need to be present everywhere you want to use your wallet, from traffic stops to bars, from your school library to the TSA, and everything in between. While this might sound ludicrous at first glance, this is the way we live online right now, and it’s the reason big tech is boiling in antitrust hot&nbsp;water.</p>Wallet by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@emkal?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Emil Kalibradov</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>Because we control our own real-world identity, we can independently engage in transactions with peers. With sufficient paper documents, ability to travel, and legal protections, just about anything I’m eligible for is accessible to me¹. This is the kind of place the internet can become, too, but with added privacy and convenience superpowers. It’s hard to overstate the impact of this change, and surely it will evolve in ways we can’t predict. But like the Renaissance’s effect in the West, SSI will surely empower people everywhere² and make the internet a better&nbsp;place.</p> The benefits of technical standards <p>Technical standards unlock vast amounts of value when adopted. Take the Bluetooth standard for example. How many different kinds of headsets, speakers, and connected devices have been created because of bluetooth? Bluetooth created a marketplace for cordless, connected devices, giving consumers choice of product and preventing a single monopoly from forming. We can also look at the SMTP standard that allows email to be sent to and from any number of different email providers. It’s hard to imagine the world without these and many more important standards.</p>Bluetooth devices by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Brett Jordan</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>Historically there’s been no standard way to exercise one’s extrinsic identity online. Think about it: How would you prove your legal name online? Or that you live at a certain place or graduated from a certain school? Or even that you’re a human? This is precisely the purpose of a new standard: verifiable credentials. But beyond providing a standardized way to prove things online, verifiable credentials actually have the potential to revolutionize the exchange of data globally, between all kinds of stakeholders.</p><p>In his recent piece on how verifiable credentials are really more like verifiable containers, <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">Timothy Ruff explains</a> how shipping containers standardized a container that could transfer seamlessly from boat to train to truck which reduced shipping costs astronomically (ie, interoperability between vehicles). Verifiable credentials promise to bring as revolutionary a transformation to the data economy as shipping containers brought to logistics. The sources, subjects, and recipients of data in an ecosystem enjoy interoperability and avoid being locked in to a particular vendor or&nbsp;process.</p><p>Standards always take some time to catch on, but when the infrastructure investments and adoption mechanisms reach their inflection point, there will be an explosion in innovation and adoption, which is the third awesome thing about self-sovereign identity.</p> The economic opportunity <p>Suppose you wanted to engage in a digital transaction wherein you’ll receive some special service if you can prove that you’re a veteran. How would you do it? The time and effort required to come up with such a proof, and the work by the counterparty to verify your claim is legitimate, are considered transaction costs. If transaction costs are greater than the perceived benefit of the service, the transaction will never be completed. But if transaction costs can be reduced, transactions will increase commensurately.</p><p>This is what happened to the ride-hailing industry when Uber &amp; Lyft entered the market. In 2010, taxis and limos controlled a $4.4B market in the USA. Uber entered the market to accomplish one purpose: reduce transaction costs to hail a ride. Uber made it easier to find a ride, increased the trust in the driver, made fares transparent/upfront, and took care of the payment, all of which reduced the transaction costs for getting from point A to point B. By 2019, the ride hailing industry exploded to a $44B industry — a 10x increase in total market size, just by reducing the costs to transact in that&nbsp;market³.</p><p>Likewise, when it’s easy to prove things about yourself and verify things about others, the already massive <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/identity-verification-market-worth--12-8-billion-by-2024--exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-300849572.html">$6B</a> identity verification market and <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/identity-and-access-management-iam#:~:text=The%20global%20Identity%20and%20Access,13.1%25%20from%202019%20to%202025.">$10B</a> identity &amp; access management market will explode into massive, multi-hundred billion dollar ecosystems.</p> Network effects <p>But the truly incredible opportunity lies in a little-understood theory about network effects. Network effects are typically understood as the increased network value provided to its participants as the number of participants increases.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law"> Metcalfe’s law</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%27s_law"> Reed’s law</a>, and other theories seek to explain this mathematically.</p><p>Dr. Sam Smith wrote a tremendous<a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586"> paper</a> that takes this analysis to another level; when two separate networks can cooperate, the combination of the two networks can be greater than the sum of each. In other words, if the networks can share a common utility, the growth of one network benefits the other. Let’s look at an example of&nbsp;this.</p><p>In the early days of the internet, the growth of<a href="http://match.com"> </a>Match.com, WebMD, and Yahoo contributed to the growth of Amazon. Why? Because Amazon’s biggest barrier to growth wasn’t the supply of books, but the number of people who were online⁴. As more users accrued to<a href="http://match.com"> </a>Match.com, many of those users would also end up browsing Amazon. The growth of one network (Match.com) contributed to the growth of another network (Amazon) because they share common utilities (internet connection, personal computer, etc.). And as the networks of each application grew, the underlying protocol network (the internet) grew as well, which caused new applications to appear. This is the power of building on a protocol with common utilities.</p>Applications grow as the underlying utilities are adopted and visa-versa<p>What this means for innovators</p><p>Any products that are built on top of SSI protocols today will gain value in two&nbsp;ways:</p>  Growth of the product&nbsp;itself  Growth of other&nbsp;products  <p>That means if you’re building an SSI app to optimize food supply chains, your app will benefit from the efforts of companies building more secure medical records management, and that will benefit from improved KYC in financial services, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Your business will grow just because it exists provided other businesses are built on SSI. The time to build the world’s next billion-dollar companies is now.<a href="http://trinsic.id"> Trinsic</a> is the best platform to get you started fast &amp; scale with&nbsp;you.</p> So How About Blockchain? <p>Blockchain is just a technology. Technology is not interesting in and of itself because it is a means to an end — the interesting question will always be what does this technology enable me to&nbsp;do.</p> What does blockchain do in&nbsp;SSI? <p>In well-architected self-sovereign identity architectures like <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a> and <a href="https://veres.one/">Veres One</a>, the blockchain is used primarily as a decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) for identifying credential issuers. Thoughtful skeptics point out that existing PKI systems could be substituted, and blockchain could be removed altogether — which is true. In fact, in a former <a href="https://medium.com/@rileyparkerhughes/immunity-passports-and-verifiable-credentials-a-response-to-critiques-142499fba4fb">blog post</a>, I explained:</p><blockquote>…the traditional DNS system complete with certificate authorities and ICANN could accomplish much of what is done with decentralized identifiers and the blockchain. But that infrastructure is decades old and comes with its own cost, scalability, performance, privacy, data protection, and governance implications. Using DIDs on a blockchain comes with a different set of trade-offs.</blockquote><p>Implementers can make their own decisions on tech stacks, and there is a reason so many choose DIDs. So the blockchain gives us useful functionality, but isn’t necessary for&nbsp;SSI.</p> So why the blockchain reputation? <p>I think there are three primary reasons why self-sovereign identity has a reputation for being tightly coupled with the blockchain/cryptocurrency community.</p>  Similar language: If cryptocurrencies give individuals control over their cash, rather than central banks (and their inflationary tendencies), SSI gives individuals control over their data, rather than big tech companies (and their surveillance tendencies). Because the problems are similar, the language is&nbsp;similar.  Confused projects: There are projects that call themselves SSI, but wouldn’t be considered so by SSI gurus because they centralize too much power or data in the hands of one organization (or one blockchain), put encrypted personal data onto the blockchain, etc. Many of these projects, although surely launched with good intent, could actually do much more harm than good by creating the ultimate public surveillance system.  Blockchain as fundraising mechanism: Self-sovereign identity really started picking up steam at the same time the ICO boom of 2016 was happening. Some SSI companies, including Civic, Evernym, and a long tail of other projects, raised tens of millions through ICOs, which married these parts of the SSI space to the crypto world. Although sometimes damaged by reputational and legal troubles, these firms have been able to spend large sums of money to develop pieces of SSI infrastructure that wouldn’t exist without&nbsp;them.   Blockchain’s most important contribution <p>As SSI technology and policy thinking has evolved over the last five years, so too has the role of the blockchain. With innovations in DID methods (peer DIDs especially), KERI, JSON-LD, etc. we take for granted the small role blockchain need play in SSI&nbsp;today.</p><p>I want to conclude by saying that blockchain’s contribution to SSI is immeasurably large but not because of its merits as a technology. Rather, blockchain reopened the identity conversation again, giving people hope in a better internet. Specifically, as co-founder of the Internet Identity Workshop and author of the book on digital identity Phil Windley put&nbsp;it:</p><blockquote>“Blockchain convinced many people, myself included, that decentralized identity was possible and practical. There was suddenly hope for a path to human dignity&nbsp;online.”</blockquote><p>So while blockchain’s relevance today is much less than it once was, its impact persists. We wouldn’t be talking about the impact on the internet, the standards, or the economic opportunity if it weren’t for blockchain. And now, with adoption all over the world, decentralized identity now seems inevitable.</p><p>Thanks to Phil Windley, Timothy Ruff, Anna Johnson, Juan Cabarello, and Kaliya Young for reading drafts &amp; giving feedback.</p><p>To learn more about Verifiable Credentials, visit <a href="http://trinsic.id">Trinsic</a>, the world’s most advanced SSI platform, built specifically for developers.</p>  For simplicity, this sentence assumes away complexities that reduce in-person accessibility for many people (ie., prejudice).  Advancements in guardianship, custodianship, and other accessibility-focused tech will make this statement more true over time. We should be careful to design for <a href="https://trinsic.id/digital-inclusion-covid-19-leaving-no-one-behind/">inclusion</a> while recognizing that <a href="https://thisisamos.com/2020/05/08/who-does-it-leave-out/">all technology excludes&nbsp;someone</a>.  To some degree, part of Uber’s ability to reduce costs was its ability to sidestep labor, licensing, and other regulations. I’m not trying to make a statement here about whether the ways they’ve reduced costs are ethical or not, as it’s still very much <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/uber-and-lyfts-california-labor-law-battle-is-far-from-over.html">unfolding</a>. I’m simply saying that the action of reducing transaction costs creates market&nbsp;value.  Many people, especially in my generation, take “being online” for granted. But think about all the inertia involved in getting a personal computer, buying internet from your cable company, downloading a browser, figuring out how to use it,&nbsp;etc.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">Blockchain is the Least Interesting Thing About Self-sovereign Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic">Trinsic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-ethical-data-collection-during-pandemics/">The pandemic</a> has accelerated the need for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-trends-in-data-and-analytics-for-2020/">data and analytics</a> leaders to deliver data and analytics insight faster, with higher quality and resiliency in the face of constant change.

<blockquote>
<p>The point of DataOps is to change how people collaborate around data and how it is used in the organization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, data and analytics leaders are increasingly applying DataOps techniques that provide a more agile and collaborative approach to building and managing data pipelines.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 What is DataOps? 
<p>Gartner defines DataOps as a collaborative data management practice focused on improving the communication, integration and automation of data flows between data managers and data consumers across an organization.</p>
<p>“The point of DataOps is to change how people collaborate around data and how it is used in the organization,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18810">Ted Friedman</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use DataOps to link “Can we do this?” to “How do we provide an optimized, governed data-driven product</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Rather than simply throwing data over the virtual wall, where it becomes someone else’s problem, the development of data pipelines and products becomes a collaborative exercise with a shared understanding of the value proposition.”</p>
 Successful DataOps practices 
<p>To implement DataOps successfully, data and analytics leaders must align DataOps with how data is consumed, rather than how it is created in their organization.</p>
<p>If those leaders adapt DataOps to three core value propositions, they will derive maximum value from data.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz0wNjkwNDI3MjMzZjgxMWViOTc1NTFkNGYxNTQ1MzFhZQ=="></a></p>
 
 Adapt your DataOps strategy to a utility value proposition by treating data as a utility that focuses on removing silos and manual effort when accessing and managing data. As such, data and analytics is readily available to all key roles. Because there are many relevant roles and not a single owner of the data, assign a data product manager to ensure data consumers’ needs are being met. 
 Use DataOps to support data’s use as a business enabler. For this value proposition, data and analytics supports specific use cases such as fraud detection, analysis of supply chain optimization or<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/data-sharing-is-a-business-necessity-to-accelerate-digital-business/"> interenterprise data sharing</a>. DataOps must drive collaboration with the business-unit stakeholders who are the customers for a specific product serving their use case. 
 Support the data and analytics driver value proposition. Use data and analytics to create new products and services, generate new revenue streams or enter new markets. For example, an idea for a new connected product emerges from your lab and must evolve into a production quality product for use by your customers. Use DataOps to link “Can we do this?” to “How do we provide an optimized, governed data-driven product to our consumers?” 
 
<p>The question you may have is, “Which type of DataOps value proposition is most relevant for my organization?” There is no single answer. Every business will have all three, either in a centralized or decentralized deployment model.</p>
<p>Delivering DataOps using each value proposition will foster collaboration between stakeholders and data implementers delivering the right value proposition with the right data at the right time.</p>

 The GiD Report#138 — The age of antitrust, Stripe is Windows for&nbsp;fintech <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-137-video-and-groups-rule-the-roost-post-covid-112a1d2870ac">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Three emerging narratives for this week — the building momentum around antitrust, crypto rising, and building fintech shovels for a COVID-accelerated digital&nbsp;reality:</p>  The age of antitrust  Crypto rising  Ben Thompson: Stripe is Windows for&nbsp;fintech  Aaron Schwartz hacker law revised + digital services&nbsp;tax  Tweet of the week: SSI is a 3-sided&nbsp;market  Stuff happens   1. The gravity, pull, and sway of large, powerful corporations has always been a reality — but today, we find ourselves at a point in the cycle where there seems to be a general consensus that it’s time for a correction. We’re seeing it in Big Tech (as we saw it with Too Big to Fail during the last financial crisis). We’re seeing it in payments Visa (and on the other side of the coin, the rise of&nbsp;crypto). <p>The pull of that gravity is often subtle early on, its impact only clear through hindsight — particularly around metrics concerning competition and innovation. But the stakes have never been&nbsp;higher.</p>“The Bosses of the Senate”&nbsp;(1889)<p>One example is Slack being bought out by Salesforce in response to competition from Microsoft (and Teams), the OG Big Tech antitrust case.</p><p>There’s also the recent news of Google and firing of a prominent AI ethics researcher is another reminder of that fact. Google, given its resources, expertise, and business alignment, is a leader in AI tech. They’re also known for a historically academic culture within the&nbsp;firm.</p><p>Sometimes, however, those two forces are in conflict. Sometimes business wins over academics. The fear, of course, is that the weight will continue to shift toward business. After all, we’re talking about a company that is taking a pivotal role in defining our AI&nbsp;future.</p><p>The waters are further muddied when plenty of voices believe that company is also a monopoly.</p><p>In that sense, antitrust isn’t just about taking down big and powerful companies. It’s about creating an environment, incentive structure and competitive landscape whereby society can evolve in ways we collectively believe best — rather than ways that benefit said companies at the expense of our&nbsp;future.</p><p>And so today, where seeing these little skirmishes across industries and across borders and across realities.</p><p>For instance, Facebook trying to take ownership over&nbsp;VR:</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/facebook-accused-of-squeezing-rival-startups-in-virtual-reality">Facebook Accused of Squeezing Rival Startups in Virtual&nbsp;Reality</a>  <p>Rulemakers waving Section 230 around as a&nbsp;threat:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/senators-offer-slip-section-230-changes-defense-bill-a09f3428-ce5f-468c-8127-5fc413c996a7.html">Senators offer to slip Section 230 changes into defense&nbsp;bill</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-defense-spending-social-media-inhofe-7db847bb-76fc-41a7-afc8-b87e84c9faa2.html">Senate Armed Services chair dismisses Trump threat to veto defense&nbsp;bill</a>  <p>Europe’s continued efforts to keep Big Tech in&nbsp;check:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-tech-giants-face-tighter-regulation-in-europe-11606991401">U.S. Tech Giants Face Tighter Regulation in&nbsp;Europe</a>  <p>The Dutch taking on Apple&nbsp;Pay:</p>  <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/04/apple-pay-iphone-dutch-antitrust/">Apple Pay limitations spark Dutch antitrust probe</a>  <p>And the DOJ’s ongoing battle with&nbsp;Visa:</p>  <a href="https://www.paymentssource.com/news/visa-defends-plaid-deal-to-doj-asserting-datas-vital-new-role-in-payments">Visa defends Plaid deal to DOJ, asserting data’s vital new role in&nbsp;payments</a>  <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata-4426a038-52b9-4b5d-923a-bc49e3f2551f.html">Axios on&nbsp;Visa</a>:</p><blockquote>Companies have two basic choices when faced with an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department: Fight or flee. Visa plans to&nbsp;fight.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: The credit card giant filed its legal response to DOJ’s efforts to block its $5.3 billion purchase of fintech “connector” company Plaid. Its primary arguments are that regulators gerrymandered an industry definition and conjured competition.</blockquote><blockquote>Industry: The DOJ believes that Visa is a monopolist in the online debit card space, arguing that its market share exceeds 70%. Visa doesn’t dispute that figure, but instead argues it’s arbitrary.</blockquote>  Visa claims that the relevant industry is online payments, which would include not just online debit, but also credit cards and services like Apple Pay. Or at least would include other methods of direct debit from bank accounts, such as PayPal and using routing numbers to satisfy utility bills,&nbsp;etc.  Also worth noting is that Visa’s overall debit card market share drops to 60%+ when in-person purchases are included (it increases for online since few e-commerce merchants accept PIN&nbsp;cards).  <blockquote>Competition: The DOJ argues that Plaid could become a major competitor in the online debit space, and that Visa’s acquisition is designed to extinguish that nascent&nbsp;threat.</blockquote><p>Imagine for a second that Facebook wasn’t allowed to take over Instagram and later WhatsApp (and in turn use Instagram to try and crush Snapchat). Imagine for a second that all of those platforms were independent companies today.

<p>New Janssen Project seeks to build the world’s fastest and most comprehensive cloud native identity and access management software platform</p>
<p>San Francisco, Calif., December 8, 2020 – The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, today announced the Janssen Project, a cloud native identity and access management software platform that prioritizes security and performance for our digital society. Janssen is based on the Gluu Server and benefits from a rich set of signing and encryption functionalities. Engineers from IDEMIA, F5, BioID, Couchbase and Gluu will make up the Technical Steering Committee.</p>
<p>Online trust is a fundamental challenge to our digital society. The Internet has connected us. But at the same time, it has undermined trust. Digital identity starts with a connection between a person and a digital device. Identity software conveys the integrity of that connection from the user’s device to a complex web of backend services. Solving the challenge of digital identity is foundational to achieving trustworthy online security.</p>
<p>While other identity and access management platforms exist, the Janssen Project seeks to tackle the most challenging security and performance requirements. Based on the latest code that powers the Gluu Server–which has passed more <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID self-certification tests</a> then any other platform–Janssen starts with a rich set of signing and encryption functionality that can be used for high assurance transactions. Having shown throughput of <a href="https://www.gluu.org/resources/documents/articles/billion-authentications-per-day-2/">more than one billion authentications per day</a>, the software can also handle the most demanding requirements for concurrency thanks to Kubernetes auto-scaling and advances in persistence.</p>
<p>“Trust and security are not competitive advantages–no one wins in an insecure society with low trust,” said Mike Schwartz, Chair of the Janssen Project Technical Steering Committee. “In the world of software, nothing builds trust like the open source development methodology. For organizations who cannot outsource trust, the Janssen Project strives to bring transparency, best practices and collective governance to the long term maintenance of this important effort. The Linux Foundation provides the neutral and proven forum for organizations to collaborate on this work.”</p>
<p>The Gluu engineering teams chose the Linux Foundation to host this community because of the Foundation’s priority of transparency in the development process and its formal framework for governance to facilitate collaboration among commercial partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New digital identity challenges arise constantly, and new standards are developed to address them.&nbsp; Open source ecosystems are an engine for innovation to filter and adapt to changing requirements. The Janssen Project Technical Steering Committee (“TSC”) will help govern priorities according to the<a href="https://github.com/JanssenProject/home/blob/main/community/charter.md"> charter.</a>&nbsp; The initial TSC includes:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Michael Schwartz, TSC Chair, CEO Gluu 
 Rajesh Bavanantham, Domain Architect at F5 Networks/NGiNX 
 Rod Boothby, Head of Digital Trust at Santander 
 Will Cayo, Director of Software Engineering at IDEMIA Digital Labs

<p>Supporting Comments</p>
<p>BioID</p>
<p>“BioID’s biometric authentication service provides GDPR compliant, device independent, 3D liveness detection and facial recognition APIs, supported out-of-the-box by the Janssen project. Exposing BioID’s capabilities via OpenID Connect makes sense in many cases, especially as part of the rollout for a large organization.&nbsp; The availability of a high quality open source implementation of OpenID Connect gives us more options to build products and to expand the options for our customers to deploy our technology,” said Alexander Werner, Software Engineer at BioID.</p>
<p>Couchbase</p>
<p>“The Couchbase database is supported today in the Janssen project for both caching and persistence. This makes sense given the distributed, elastic, in-memory requirements for a multi-cloud, hyper-scale identity service. Contributing to this project aligns with our goal to advance open source infrastructure software that results in more options for the Couchbase community,” said Ian McCloy, Principal Product Manager at Couchbase.</p>
<p>F5</p>
<p>“It’s an immense pleasure to join the Janssen Project, as it’s aimed to improve the performance, reliability and security on OAuth2 Components that are similar to NGINX Principles. Being part of Linux Foundation, the Janssen Project will be well governed and evolve with the open source community to achieve its goals,” said Rajesh Bavanantham, F5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IDEMIA</p>
<p>“I have been a part of the Gluu community for many years. I’m excited to see the project moving to the Linux Foundation where we can collaborate with an even larger ecosystem of individuals and companies,” said Will Cayo, IDEMIA.</p>
<p>About the Linux Foundation</p>
<p>Founded in 2000, the Linux Foundation is supported by more than 1,500 members and is the world’s leading home for collaboration on open source software, open standards, open data, and open hardware. Linux Foundation’s projects are critical to the world’s infrastructure including Linux, Kubernetes, Node.js, and more.&nbsp; The Linux Foundation’s methodology focuses on leveraging best practices and addressing the needs of contributors, users and solution providers to create sustainable models for open collaboration.

  <p>There’s never been a time when application leaders haven’t been under pressure to reduce costs and optimize spending. COVID-19 has only increased this pressure, as <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">organizations have accelerated digitalization</a> to maintain a viable, virtual business presence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investment in new application development is 17% of the total IT spend</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even so, some practical steps can be taken to help ensure that costs are kept in check — especially at the design and development stages of an application’s life cycle.</p>
<p>In many ways, the development stage is a natural place to first seek cost-cutting. “Investment in new application development is 17% of the total IT spend, making it a fruitful place to look for opportunities to cut costs, optimize spend or improve value,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/92082">Akis Sklavounakis</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>Gartner has identified four ways to cut costs and optimize spend during these critical stages.</p>
 Expand the talent pool 
<p>It’s always a challenge to find top development talent, especially if the search is limited to local talent only. But the COVID-19 lockdown highlighted recruitment possibilities to include a remote workforce.</p>
<p>A Gartner survey of 127 company leaders showed that 82% of respondents intend to permit remote working some of the time, and 47% intend to allow employees to work remotely full-time from now on. The fact is, a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/master-a-distributed-workforce-for-digital-transformation/">“talent anywhere” approach</a> is fast becoming the norm, and is likely to remain so long after the pandemic.</p>
<p>At the same time, application leaders are also harnessing the work of end users outside the IT function. This growing pool of citizen developers and business technologists can help build or customize data and technology solutions, while saving on IT costs.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/its-time-to-disrupt-the-application-organization/">It's Time to Disrupt the Application Organization</a></p>
 Accelerate the transformation to agile 
<p>The ability for organizations to rapidly adapt to the changes brought on by the pandemic have been remarkable. Organizations found that they had to<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-become-an-agile-superhero/"> accelerate agile</a> transformation plans and actions in order to be successful with digital business.</p>
<p>With a more agile operating model, time-to-value can be shortened, teams can more readily reprioritize activities and deliverables, and bureaucracy can be minimized by employing short-term incremental and iterative planning.</p>
 Reduce upfront application development costs with cloud 
<p>By using <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/software-as-a-service-saas">software-as-a-service (SaaS)</a> for commodity business functions such as human resources management, finance and procurement, organizations can reduce upfront costs significantly.</p>
<p>Additionally, by using <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas">infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)</a> instead of on-premises hardware, cloud-based development tools instead of licensed tools, and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/platform-as-a-service-paas">platform-as-a-service (PaaS)</a> application runtimes instead of licensed ones, application leaders can drive further cost reductions.</p>
 Lower total cost of ownership (TCO) with efficient application design for maintainability and change 
<p>Taking the long view of an application life cycle will help provide insight into the true costs of maintaining and managing a solution. With TCO as a key criterion, all direct and indirect costs for the lifetime of an application are taken into consideration. These include recurring, nonrecurring, future and go-live costs.</p>
<p>At the same time, incentivize development teams to “design for change,” and better manage technical debt throughout the application life cycle. The result is that application development teams will seek ways to design for long-term supportability, maintainability, reliability and scalability.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 brings higher demand for new application services as organizations accelerate digitalization while recovering and renewing their products and services,” Sklavounakis says. The key is to employ tactics that combine near-term savings with strategic long-term savings in application design and development.</p>

					 <p>In a <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-standards/">previous post</a>, we discussed Trinsic’s commitment to making sure our platform is based on the most recent <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a> standards. Because of that commitment, solutions built with Trinsic will always be interoperable and untethered from vendor lock-in. We implement those standards through open source codebases which power everything we do at Trinsic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The SSI industry is growing quickly in quantity and quality of use cases, and so too are SSI-related codebases. Since this is an introductory post, we do not intend to provide an exhaustive list of all the SSI open source codebases. Instead we hope to list three main “categories” of tried-and-true open source codebases that are maintained by the SSI developer community.</p>

					 <p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> is an open source community hosted by the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a> that acts as a greenhouse for cross-industry, blockchain-based projects. There are three projects within Hyperledger that directly relate to SSI—Aries, Indy, and Ursa. The Trinsic platform is built upon these codebases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperledger Aries</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aries was created out of the Hyperledger Indy community due to a need for open source agents. The vision for Aries is that it’s a ledger-agnostic toolkit for managing verifiable credentials. A complete summary of Aries codebases can be found in the Hyperledger GitHub repository, but we’ll highlight a few here:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Aries Framework .NET: Trinsic’s entire product stack is based on <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>—a mature codebase for building interoperable, SSI agents that run on all platforms (cloud, mobile, IoT, etc.). Trinsic <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/agentframework-for-net-joins-hyperledger-aries-14aba357da41">developed the framework</a> and now <a href="https://trinsic.id/aries-openapi/">continues to maintain it</a> alongside the contributions of many other developers and vendors.  Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py): Similar to Aries Framework .NET, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">ACA-Py</a> is a mature codebase for building SSI agents, although it’s unable to be used in mobile environments. It’s maintained by the Government of British Columbia, Canada and a large community of developers.  Aries Framework Go: Another mature Aries initiative, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go">the Go codebase</a> leverages Hyperledger Fabric, not Indy, for its public key infrastructure.  Aries RFCs: The <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Aries RFCs</a> specify the protocols Aries agents will run. <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-commitment-to-interoperability-ahead-of-iiw/">Interoperability profiles</a> are based off a combination of several RFCs that must be proven to be interoperable with one another.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperledger Indy &amp; Ursa</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk">Hyperledger Indy</a> is a blockchain purpose-built for decentralized identity. It was the first production-grade SSI solution which is still run by <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a> today in a production network by nodes around the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a> is a library of cryptography-related code so that all Hyperledger projects can leverage existing, proven libraries. The cryptography required for <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proofs</a> lives in this codebase.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Whether you’re a fan of MySQL or not, you cannot dispute the fact that it is <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking">the world’s most popular open-source database</a> by a large margin (incidentally, it’s also the second most popular database ever, behind only its owner Oracle’s flagship commercial product). 25 years after its inception, MySQL has evolved into an essential and truly ubiquitous component of every web application stack and cloud platform. Even though some database experts might frown upon it for lacking “enterprise capabilities”, it is widely used by the largest enterprises around the world, like Facebook, YouTube, or Siemens.</p>
<p>However, while MySQL is widely used for transactional processing (OLTP), its ability to perform analytical processing (OLAP) is quite limited. Because the database engine lacks certain optimization functions crucial for running queries on aggregated data, its performance on OLAP workloads is underwhelming at best. For years, the only option MySQL users had was to export their transactional data into a different database system optimized for analytics and run their queries there. Well, not anymore!</p>
 MySQL and analytics: the holy grail for developers! 
<p>Last week, Oracle has announced MySQL Database Service <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/mysql-analytics-engine.html">Analytics Engine</a>, a new incarnation of Oracle’s managed MySQL cloud service that’s optimized for high-performance analytics workloads. According to the company’s benchmarks, the new service can run typical analytical queries up to 400 times faster than “vanilla” MySQL.</p>
<p>Based on in-memory hybrid columnar technology (which sounds a lot like the stuff Oracle has already implemented in their commercial database), the engine is designed to directly access the transactional data from a MySQL database, create its in-memory representation optimized for OLAP processing and execute analytic queries, returning the results through the familiar MySQL programming interfaces. The engine supports near-linear scaling to a massive number of cores and thus can turn a MySQL database into a large and efficient data warehouse in the cloud.</p>
<p>Oracle is certainly not the first database vendor to take a popular open-source database engine and build an extended ecosystem around it. After all, AWS, its biggest competitor, has been doing similar things with its DBaaS services for years. Oracle’s latest offering however has a big and rather unique advantage: the OLTP and OLAP processing operates on the same data held within the same single database instance and all query optimization and execution is handled by the database core completely transparently. To a user or developer, the new OLAP-capable database looks and behaves exactly like a normal MySQL instance.</p>
 Less obvious benefits 
<p>Above anything else, this means that there is no need to create a separate copy of data for analytics, thus reducing the overall complexity and costs and increasing performance. A big part of Oracle’s presentation was devoted to direct comparisons to AWS’s Aurora and Redshift services, with both costs and performance ending up in Oracle’s favor.</p>
<p>As an analyst primarily focusing on cybersecurity, however, I was more impressed by the potential security and compliance benefits of an integrated OLTP/OLAP solution. Since the data (which for many types of transactional workloads is quite sensitive, containing personal, financial, and other regulated information) no longer needs to move between disparate data stores, this dramatically decreases the risks to its integrity and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Keeping the data in one place improves your company’s security posture, and in the end, helps avoid a data breach or compliance fine – and the best part is that it’s all just a free bonus to having much better data analytics.</p>
 So, where is the catch? 
<p>Doesn’t it somehow sound too good to be true? Surely there must be a catch? Well, the most obvious one is that Oracle’s solution does not extend the core MySQL engine; instead, it’s designed as an add-on service running on its own specialized infrastructure that integrates with Oracle’s managed MySQL service behind the scenes. Of course, it’s fully managed and thus transparent to users, but unfortunately, it means that the solution will remain an Oracle Cloud exclusive.</p>
<p>Of course, in Oracle’s case, being cloud-exclusive still means you can get the same service as a part of the company’s Cloud@Customer private cloud offering. Besides, the company’s announced the ability to replicate any on-prem MySQL instance to Oracle Cloud to enable transparent high-performance analytics on your legacy data. How is this replication supposed to handle data desensitization (anonymization) to ensure compliance with GDPR and similar regulations is still open, however…</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/meet-the-next-generation-oracle">earlier blog posts</a>, it took Oracle years to figure out a proper cloud strategy: instead of trying to beat the competitors on their terms, the company should focus on its unique differentiators and their added value for Oracle cloud customers. MySQL Analytics Engine is definitely one of those services no other CSP is currently able to offer, and while cost reduction is still a major factor, security and compliance should be considered as well. Incidentally, KuppingerCole is planning to publish a new edition of our <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc79015/database-and-big-data-security/">Leadership Compass on Database and Big Data Security</a> soon.

<p>Munich, Luxembourg, December 8th, 2020 – <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a> a leading provider for Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions,&nbsp;receives&nbsp;€15 million growth funding from European Investment Bank. Funds will support IDnow’s research and development and international expansion. Financing by EU bank is provided under Investment Plan for Europe.</p>
<p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) will provide €15&nbsp;million of growth funding to the German identity verification platform IDnow. IDnow is an expert in secure, remote auto and video identification and electronic signature services. This enables companies to acquire customers and manage transactions faster and easier, while complying with know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. The investment will primarily support IDnow’s research and development (R&amp;D) activities as well as its international growth.</p>
<p>This operation is part of the European Growth Finance Facility (EGFF), a product under the guarantee scheme of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI). The EGFF is designed to address quasi-equity gaps linked to structural market failures across the European Union in the provision of adequate risk capital to late-stage, venture-backed companies. Such European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and mid-caps often suffer from systemic shortages of large, non-dilutive financing options for growth investments, both tangible and intangible. The benefit of EFSI in this specific case is the clear enhancement of the risk capacity of the Bank.</p>
<p>EFSI is the central pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe under which the EIB and the European Commission are working together as strategic partners and the EIB’s financing operations are boosting the competitiveness of the European economy. It is accompanied by the advisory service, the European Investment Advisory Hub, which enables public and private project operators to structure their investment projects more professionally.</p>
<p>EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle, who is responsible for EFSI and the bank´s operations in Germany, said: “IDnow, a first-time borrower for the Bank, depends on significant R&amp;D and marketing investments related to commercialisation. The transaction is an excellent example of how the EU bank, with the support of the Investment Plan for Europe, can facilitate the development of innovaton, in particular in sensitive policy areas such as anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and cybersecurity, which are of utmost importance for the European Union and its economy.”</p>
<p>European Commissioner for the Economy, Paolo Gentiloni, said: “As ever more of our interactions move online, it’s more important than ever that we strengthen data security and fraud prevention. And it’s right that the Investment Plan for Europe contributes to those efforts. This support for German platform IDnow will enable it to expand its services for digital identity verification of customers and business partners alike. We are investing in a safer online business environment, an objective of our digital finance strategy.”</p>
<p>CFO of IDnow Joe Lichtenberger said: “IDnow has experienced overwhelming demand for its verification-as-a-service across multiple industries and countries, with COVID-19 significantly increasing the need for digital services. The flexible financing structure from the EIB will allow us to accelerate our investment in developing the platform to capitalise on these opportunities. The EIB is an ideal partner to support us in becoming Europe’s leading provider in identity verification.”</p>

 With the Senior Tech Lead of Decentralized Identity (DeID) Solution — Hu&nbsp;Ning <p>Ontology has always focused on creating a sustainable and effective method for implementing decentralized identity solutions in real enterprise case studies. This was highlighted by a recent event hosted by CAICT on “Blockchain: Connecting the Future — Digital Identity &amp; Decentralized Identifiers,” where our very own Decentralized Identity Senior Tech Lead, Hu Ning gave a keynote speech outlining how ONT ID works, as well as how multiple layers of trust are required amongst users, systems and organizations, before rounding things off with a few case studies. As with most large scale blockchain events, Hu Ning wasn’t the only expert there as several other DID experts from W3C, DIF, EEA, Consensys, Spherity and Evernym gave informative addresses as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Below is a quick&nbsp;recap:</p> How ONT ID&nbsp;Works <p>Hu Ning opened the keynote with a brief outline of the technical infrastructure which powers ONT ID and the Ontology blockchain. Including how it identifies and connects people with their data to create and enable a self-sovereign digital identity. Your ONT ID also communicates with other DIDs registered in other blockchains and systems, since it was all developed under the guidance of the W3C DID standard. This makes ONT ID part of the core Ontology solution as it provides transparency and ease of use combined security and credibility as its main features. All trust based technologies are closely connected to identity as their core, and DID is also adopted and connected across multiple ecosystems including BTC, ETH, NEO, and Chainlink.</p><p>Taking it a step further, ONT ID is really the underlying framework for a much anticipated addition, the OScore — a fully digitalized credit scoring system based on your history of asset transactions and holdings. The OScore will allow users to interact with each other on-chain based on both on-chain and off-chain assets histories, while lowering collateral requirements and interest&nbsp;rates!</p> Multi-Dimensional Trust <p>Up next, Hu Ning elaborated on the trust requirement that ONT ID solves from all sides. This includes the trust between decentralized applications, as well as businesses and users — not to mention everything in&nbsp;between.</p><p>One of the goals with ONT ID is to help users find and manage their social networks &amp; their web-apps, based on multidimensional trust endorsement. Another key area Hu Ning highlighted was the difference between Semantic, Syntactical and Object Abstraction Interoperability and how to build systems between for framework of operation, ultimately leading to&nbsp;trust.</p> Case Studies <p>To round things off, Hu Ning dove into two case studies, as well as possible applications in the medical and manufacturing industry. One that was recently completed with Daimler Mobility, and the other with&nbsp;OpenKG.</p><p>For Daimler Mobility, the Ontology team helped build a “Welcome Home” app on the MoveX platform. Through ONT ID, users were able to obtain and control the data for any Daimler vehicle on the road, and transfer these preferences into a new vehicle when they switched. Not only that, but all the data points including possible claims, wear and tear, and lighting choices were all recorded on the blockchain, binded with a user’s ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Other case studies, such as in the healthcare system were also introduced by Hu Ning. Given recent outbreaks, a more decentralized, robust healthcare system where a user’s health records were not only available, but also protected, would be invaluable. A user would be able to go into the hospital, and ensure that they only share relevant data with the clinician, while locking that data and granting access to insurance data when paying for the hospital visit. That way, not only can health practitioners rely on more accurate and immutable data, but patients can also feel more assured that something as private as your health records are protected and decentralized.</p><p>Hu Ning also discussed Ontology’s provision of full tech support for Open KG, an open-source data sharing platform to record knowledge schema on the blockchain, further empowering the knowledge industry with blockchain technology.</p><p>To wrap things up, Hu Ning summarized “Ontology will continue to dive into the research and development of blockchain technology as well as the optimization of core performances of the platform. This will provide blockchain solutions for enterprises, and bring highly efficient and easy-to-use development tools for developers. The ultimate goal is to let every blockchain user own their own data and apply credit technology and solutions to all types of industries, further promoting trust collaboration in our&nbsp;society”</p><p>These are the types of case studies that demonstrate not just applicable, but much needed decentralized identities such as ONT ID. At the end of the day, the blockchain was designed to give users more control and privacy over their own data — something ONT ID contributes towards in a big&nbsp;step.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/recapping-the-link-to-the-future-event-with-china-blockchain-dialogues-5263c68c5e76">Recapping the “Blockchain: Connecting the Future” Event hosted by CAICT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Social commerce and e-commerce: Not enough&nbsp;orders  Conversations with Africa’s platform&nbsp;sellers <p>These conversations took place between March, 2020 and September, 2020</p><p>Social commerce and e-commerce are increasingly becoming popular for young people running micro and small businesses to sell anything&nbsp;online.</p><p>While e-commerce platforms such as Jumia and Jiji were intentionally designed to help African micro-entrepreneurs sell online, selling on Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Twitter are becoming the norm in Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and&nbsp;Ghana.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has presented several new challenges that are now threatening the existence of many of these small home-based businesses.</p><p>A <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlobalStateofSmallBusinessReport.pdf">Facebook/World Bank survey</a> on the global impact of COVID-19 on small businesses was released in July. According to the report, 62% of microbusinesses generated lower sales in the previous 30 days compared to the same period in 2019, and approximately 30% of microbusinesses had been forced to close at the time of the survey, with female-led ones more affected.</p>Olive, a social commerce&nbsp;seller<p>Of the eight platform sellers I spoke to, five of the six women use social media exclusively to sell their products. They said it is more cost-effective than e-commerce websites that charge monthly subscription fees.</p><p>When Uganda went into lockdown on March 28 after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Olive’s shop in downtown Kampala was forced to close. She hoped she’d be able to sustain her business, selling African print hoodies and headwraps, via her Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Instagram channels. However, with people locked indoors and the increased uncertainty about the future, her online customers also decreased.</p><blockquote>“Online sales were reduced by 60% in March, to 40% in April to 0% in May,” Olive said last&nbsp;June.</blockquote><p>Olive decided to add masks with matching headbands to her product line, but most of her fabric was locked up in the shop so she couldn’t accumulate stock.</p><p>“However much I could still do business online, I couldn’t access my materials,” she&nbsp;said.</p>Olive’s hood collection<p>By September, most businesses in Uganda had been allowed to open. With fewer sales over the last months and less revenue, however, Olive was faced with rent arrears on the shop that she couldn’t pay. She took out a loan to pay some of the rent and is now considering finding a more affordable location for her shop. A few orders had started coming in by September. However, “I can’t take my things out of the shop until the arrears are paid,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>In Nigeria, 21-year-old Tosin’s shoe and handbag online business was thriving at the beginning of the pandemic.</p><p>“Most people were at home on their phones. I ran targeted ads and started getting customers. I reached many people and in March, April and May, I made some money,” she said in June. All that changed between June and September.</p>Tosin’s Instagram page<p>She thinks it is because there are now more businesses online and the competition is high. “The market is saturated. There are many people selling bags and shoes. We are all selling the same thing,” she said, adding that the last time she sold anything was in&nbsp;July.</p><p>Things were even tougher for Dorcas, 41, a baker in Kenya who lost most of her cake orders in June because people could no longer host events or gatherings. Dorcus relies on WhatsApp, Facebook, and logistic platforms to conduct most of her business as she is homebound due to suffering from&nbsp;lupus.</p><p>With no sales coming in, Dorcas had to get creative to diversify her source of income. She created a WhatsApp-based marketplace that brought together potential customers and anyone selling goods and services in the community where she lives. Even though her efforts to turn it into a revenue stream have so far been unsuccessful, she is glad she is helping people in her community to generate income this way. As she waits for her cake business to pick up, Dorcas is now selling shoes for children and teenagers online.</p><blockquote>“This has picked up more than the cake business. I am using Facebook, Facebook groups, Instagram, and WhatsApp groups. Every day I post in 20 different groups,” Dorcas told me in September.</blockquote>Dorcas E-commerce <p>Edwin, 20, in Nigeria and Robert, 30, in Kenya are both e-commerce sellers on Jiji and Jumia, respectively. They both faced serious stock issues at the beginning of the pandemic as borders closed, which affected the import of merchandise from China — solar products for Edwin and phones for&nbsp;Robert.</p><p>In June, Robert was only able to get half of the stock he usually gets and his sales also suffered.</p><blockquote>“People are not purchasing. They are at home and not getting any money. They would rather not spend the little they have on phones,” he said in&nbsp;June.</blockquote><p>In September, Robert told me that he plans to add health and beauty products to his catalogue so he can earn&nbsp;more.</p>Robert<p>Edwin registered a 10% increase in his business online in June but by September, his sales also went down, forcing him to rethink the monthly subscription fee he paid to Jiji. Customers are slowly coming back, but to his physical shop in a market in Abuja, not online. Most of his customers, he says, prefer to see the goods before they buy. He is looking forward to making more sales during the festive season. “It’s when people buy a lot and lighting is a priority for comfort,” he told me in September. However, he added that the dollar rate has left the Naira weaker, making importation of products more expensive.</p>Edwin<p>Damilola, 29, who sells mannequins, salon equipment, and fashion accessories on Jiji, Konga, and Jumia in Nigeria, completely closed her shop in May. She didn’t have that much stock and struggled to import it from abroad. She opened her shop again after two months, but by September, the depreciation of the Naira against the dollar had forced her to increase the price of her products — a challenge to her business as most people could barely afford to buy non-essential items.</p><p>In Uganda, Gloria, 32, co-founder of House of Penda that sells fashion accessories on social media, is also hoping that the festive season will revive the business. Few sales over the last several months left both Gloria and her co-founder demotivated, pushing them to close shop in September and rethink strategy.</p>Gloria, co-founder, House of&nbsp;Penda<blockquote>“For Christmas, we are looking at ways of repackaging our products. We’re going to have gift boxes with a mix of products,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>House of Penda is now planning to enter partnerships with other women-led businesses to sell combined products throughout the festive&nbsp;season.</p><p>It remains to be seen if the festive season will indeed bring a much-anticipated relief.</p><p>The workers and sellers whose real names and/or photos are used in our blogs consented to their use. <br>These conversations were conducted with support from the<a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/"> Mastercard Foundation</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/social-commerce-and-e-commerce-not-enough-orders-conversations-with-africas-platform-sellers-a9e1963ddd91">Social commerce and e-commerce: Not enough orders — Conversations with Africa’s platform sellers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Tough gigs: On-demand labour and freelancing  Conversations with Africa’s platform&nbsp;workers <p>These conversations took place between March, 2020 and September, 2020</p><p><a href="https://lynk.co.ke/">Lynk</a> is an on-demand local labour platform in Kenya, through which plumbers, painters, cleaners, carpenters and many other professionals secure paid&nbsp;work.</p>Stanley<p>When COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Stanley, a cleaner on the platform knew that his work days were numbered. The offices he, and many others on the platform, regularly clean had closed. Even homes were no longer accessible. “Clients are too conscious and everybody is afraid to offer us jobs to clean their homes or offices,” Stanley told me in&nbsp;June.</p><p>Stanley was part of an incubation program at Lynk, where workers were provided with a monthly salary and upskilling opportunities. In April, due to the high costs associated with the incubation program, Lynk transitioned workers out of these programs and into independent contractor roles. However for Stanley, not only did his incubation program end, but all cleaning services were discontinued on the platform due to lack of demand. Short-term relief came for Stanley when Lynk secured a contract with <a href="https://www.safehandskenya.com/">Safe Hands Kenya</a> to disinfect the slums in Nairobi but that ended quickly and by July, there was no more&nbsp;work.</p><p>When COVID started, Lynk ensured that all pros — including Stanley — were compensated with one month of pay regardless of whether or not their clients continued to engage them. Stanley also received a recommendation letter from Lynk to help support him in his job&nbsp;search.</p><p>A father of two, Stanley, 34, was eventually forced to leave Nairobi and relocate to the village with his family. He sold some of his belongings including his phone, to afford the transport costs. He and his family now temporarily live with his mother in the village and his landlord has since put a padlock on their house back in the city due to rent arrears. The family, he says, will eventually have to return to the house in the city when the children resume school. Stanley now earns a living by collecting grass for cattle keepers, and is paid mostly in food. “If you are lucky, you get cash but it is also very little. It is KES150 (USD 1.4) for each time someone needs grass. I have about three clients,” he&nbsp;says.</p> Lynk’s support interventions <p>In addition to the one month pay, Lynk rolled out a number of interventions to help their workers weather the storm. Akinyi Ooko-Ombaka who heads the Lynk Academy told us the platform provided a monthly transport allowance of KES 30000 (USD 30) to each worker, distributed PPE, conducted multiple sensitization training and even reached out to partners for additional support. “BuildHer, one of our recruitment partners, provided food packages to all workers in our shop,” Akinyi told us. They also partnered with an organisation to provide cash transfers to their most vulnerable workers.</p><p>“While the impact of COVID is ubiquitous, workers on the platform have been affected differently not only based on their socio-economic status, but their trade. For instance we’ve seen significant growth in our Furniture segment whereas services like Beauty were the most hard hit. Even before COVID, informal workers were vulnerable COVID has forced us to think more deeply about supporting our workers to build resilience.” Akinyi&nbsp;said.</p> Freelancing Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@flysi3000?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Simon Abrams</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/remote-work-africa?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">&nbsp;Unsplash</a><p>While the COVID-19 pandemic popularised freelancing (self-employed workers who take on contracts from various companies) globally as more people went online to find jobs they could do remotely, the demand side didn’t increase fast enough to meet supply. According to a <a href="https://pubs.payoneer.com/docs/2020-gig-economy-index.pdf">survey</a> by Payoneer, a global company that provides financial services to freelancers, close to 32% of freelancers reported that demand had greatly decreased after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in&nbsp;March.</p><p>Only one out of the seven freelancers I spoke to in June was getting more work due to COVID-19. Ainomugisha, 27, a Ugandan professional content solutions provider, said the pandemic was a blessing in disguise.</p><p>“It has created a huge content gap that companies and publications world over are scrambling to fill with informative articles, essays, blog posts, newsletters, etc about COVID-19 for their respective audiences,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>But for the others, hours were reduced and some long-running contracts were ended prematurely. Kwesi, a 30-year-old Ghanian virtual assistant on Upwork and Fiverr said he lost a long-term contract after the company he was working for told him they were restructuring.</p><p>“My income has gone down by more than 50%,” Kwesi told me in June. When we spoke again in September, Kwesi had just found a job as a radio presenter and now commits less time to finding online&nbsp;gigs.</p><p>Other freelancers in Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana shared similar stories. Some thought that they were getting less work because of increased competition- that there were more people joining the platforms in search of work. Another global <a href="https://pubs.payoneer.com/images/the-state-of-freelancing-during-covid-19.pdf">Payoneer survey</a> reported that freelance marketplaces had seen a rapid growth in new freelancers joining the platforms.</p> Need for new&nbsp;skills <p>With more freetime on their hands the freelancers recognised the need to upgrade their skills in order to compete more favourably in a now crowded world of online&nbsp;work.</p><p>Ama (not real name), 36, an Upwork virtual assistant based in Ghana had been doing clerical work since she joined the platform in 2015. She was making up to $800 a month pre-Covid, but her income reduced to $300 in June after one of her main clients ended the contract because of COVID. She’s since received requests from clients asking if she has other skills like WordPress, database management or app development.</p><p>“Those skills are mostly requested by the clients as part of the virtual assistant job,” Ama said. She now plans to start a course on one of the three in January next&nbsp;year.</p><p>Carol (not real name), 26, a Ugandan on Upwork who conducts market research on products for companies that sell on Amazon is adding data visualization to her skillset so she can also get more&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>And Kelechi, 33, a market researcher also on Upwork, has enrolled in a digital marketing course on Udemy. While he still has a daytime office job, Kelechi is keen to make online freelancing his main source of income, and to do so he realises he needs to make sure he has a set of strong skills to stand out from the&nbsp;crowd.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/social-commerce-and-e-commerce-not-enough-orders-conversations-with-africas-platform-sellers-a9e1963ddd91">In the last blog, we share the stories of those who sell goods and services through marketplace websites like Jumia, Jiji, and on social&nbsp;media.</a></p><p>The workers and sellers whose real names and/or photos are used in our blogs consented to their use. <br>These conversations were conducted with support from the<a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/"> Mastercard Foundation</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/tough-gigs-on-demand-labour-and-freelancing-conversations-with-africas-platform-workers-d6d22b3c030d">Tough gigs: On-demand labour and freelancing — Conversations with Africa’s platform workers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

He started driving for Bolt just over a year ago. His plan was to make enough money to be able to continue his education beyond high school. He secured a car on hire purchase, and was paying it off weekly. All was going fairly well until the pandemic hit. Kwame went from making 25 trips per day, pre-COVID, to less than five. After paying the car rental fees and Bolt’s 25%, he earned 50–100 Ghana Cedis (USD 9–17) per day, far less than the 300 Ghana Cedis (USD 51) he was making daily&nbsp;before.</p><p>“I am working but I cannot even buy food.

It is just hard for me,” Kwame told me in&nbsp;June.</p><p>He was also forced to move in with his sister because he couldn’t afford his own rent anymore. “At least there is food there,” he&nbsp;said.</p>Michael is an Uber driver in Nairobi,&nbsp;Kenya<p>Michael, an Uber driver in Kenya, has a similar story. Fewer rides left him barely able to take care of his family of four. With kids stuck at home due to school closures, he was spending more on printing study materials and buying food for the family. To close the gap caused by his reduced income, Michael borrowed KES 4000 (USD 37) from TALA, a mobile loans company, in May. By September, he was still unable to pay it&nbsp;back.</p><p>In Uganda, Ismail, 27, an IT graduate, joined Uber in 2018 when he failed to find a job after graduation. His trips were halved to five a day at the beginning of the pandemic. When Uganda went into complete lockdown on March 28, Ismail was left with no work due to <a href="https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/president-museveni-bans-private-cars-declares-curfew--1883252">new regulation</a>s prohibiting anyone, apart from a few authorized drivers, from being on the&nbsp;road.</p><p>Motorcycle taxis (locally known as boda boda), however, were allowed to make deliveries, which meant that Bob, a Ugandan <a href="https://safeboda.com/ug/">SafeBoda</a> rider, could continue earning some money during the lockdown. But when restrictions on vehicle movement were lifted in June, and people began to do their own shopping, Bob was left with little to no business, with bans still on place on carrying passengers.</p>Photo/SafeBoda.com<p>Bob eventually quit SafeBoda because, he said, the rates are too low and “It doesn’t make financial sense to continue using the app given the current situation.” He now only serves a few of his long-time customers. He is also doing deliveries for an agro-seed company, which he says brings in a little more, especially now that it is planting season for the farmers. Between September and November, farmers order seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, and other products in preparation for the planting&nbsp;season.</p><p>However, if the Uganda government’s plan to ban boda bodas from the Kampala Central Business District comes to pass on November 1, Bob will be left with no work at&nbsp;all.</p> Pivoting to&nbsp;delivery <p>In Africa, as was the situation globally during the pandemic, most ride-hailing companies pivoted toward deliveries. Unfortunately, this didn’t bring in enough for the majority of the drivers and riders we spoke to. Only Geoffrey who rides for a logistics company in Kenya — Sendy — was lucky enough to make decent money when the company launched <a href="https://businesstoday.co.ke/sendy-launches-home-delivery-service/">SendyGo</a> in May, a home delivery option in Nairobi. But even then, this decent money, Geoffrey said, was just enough to cover his rent, food, and other essentials without leaving much for anything else, prompting him to borrow money to meet his other&nbsp;needs.</p>Geoffrey/Sendy<p>“The work has increased. When COVID started, there was a shock but now people have adapted. They now use SendyGo to help get food and essentials delivered to their home,” Geoffrey told me in June. In September, things were still going well for him. He had even managed to pay off 95% of a loan he had taken out in May from the Sendy SACCO, a savings scheme for the&nbsp;riders.</p>Samuel<p>However, for the two <a href="https://max.ng/">MAX.NG</a> riders in Lagos, Nigeria, Samuel and Muhammed, doing deliveries did not pick up or pay off. To make things worse, the Lagos State <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1797369/lagos-okada-ban-sparks-protests-hits-bike-hailing-startups/">government banned</a> okadas (motorcycle taxis) from operating in the city in February, right before the pandemic. Both riders said that the ban was worse than the pandemic as they were dependent on the little money they made from deliveries.</p><p>“You cannot make more than 4 or 5 trips. It is not the same as it was when we had passengers,” Samuel told me in&nbsp;June.</p> Platform responses <p>While Africa-based platforms like Sendy, SafeBoda, and MAX.NG <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-african-gig-workers-and-what-needs-to-be-done-97301">ensured</a> that the riders had the information, hand sanitizer, and masks to operate safely during the pandemic, global platforms like Uber and Bolt did little beyond providing health and safety information, the drivers said. Buying hand sanitizer and masks became an additional expense for those who were already making less&nbsp;money.</p>Photo/MAX.NG<p>Fairwork, which has kept a close eye on labor platforms and their COVID-19 policies, <a href="https://botpopuli.net/covid-19-gigwork-precarity-platforms">found</a> a glaring gap between policy and practice. For example, Fairwork found that while Uber announced it would provide financial support for 14 days to drivers who have been diagnosed, a small print in the policy noted that <a href="https://fair.work/wp-content/uploads/sites/97/2020/09/COVID-19-Report-September-2020.pdf">paid leave is “conditional on producing a sick note,”</a> something that many drivers find difficult to&nbsp;acquire.</p><p>For the Africa-based Uber and Bolt drivers I spoke to, they had little to no knowledge of such policies and didn’t know how they would get in touch with the companies if they got&nbsp;sick.</p><p>Ismail said Uber asked them to send photos of receipts when they buy masks and hand sanitizer, but he said it was a time-consuming process. He preferred that Uber give them the items with no such conditions.</p><p>“At the moment, there is no cost that is bearable. Even spending Shs 10,000 (USD 2.7) on hand sanitizer is too much for me,” Ismail&nbsp;said.</p><p>The drivers also said they expected Uber and Bolt to reduce their commission but that didn’t happen. Instead, in trying to woo customers, the companies reduced fares and gave discounts to customers, leaving the drivers with less income but still expecting them to remit the 25% commission daily.</p> Future of platform&nbsp;work <p>In September, things were looking up for both riders and drivers. Still, with continuing restrictions on people and businesses, no one was getting as many customers as they used to before the pandemic. Ongoing curfews in some countries like Uganda and Kenya have reduced the drivers’ working hours. “The problem is that there is curfew. Many of the clients were people who would go out on weekends,” Michael told me in September.</p><p>The increased cost of living, high fuel prices, weekly car rental fees, and increased expenditure at home have become the characteristics of everyday life for most of the drivers and&nbsp;riders.</p><p>The precarious nature of gig work, combined with rising unemployment in all four countries — Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda — is forcing platform workers to think of ways to depend less on what used to be a good enough source of income. Some are contemplating abandoning it altogether if the situation doesn’t change for the&nbsp;better.</p><p>Kwame is one of those already planning a way out. He has applied to join the army. “I’m already buying small things like boots and khakis,” he says. As Kwame waits for the phone call from the army, he says he will continue driving as it is his only source of income for&nbsp;now.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/tough-gigs-on-demand-labour-and-freelancing-conversations-with-africas-platform-workers-d6d22b3c030d">In the next blog, we share the stories of freelancers and on-demand laborers.</a></p><p>The workers and sellers whose real names and/or photos are used in our blogs consented to their use. <br>These conversations were conducted with support from the<a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/"> Mastercard Foundation</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/conversations-with-africas-platform-workers-on-ride-hailing-fewer-customers-less-income-49973f8f5e8e">Conversations with Africa’s platform workers on ride-hailing: fewer customers, less income</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As part of Caribou Digital’s ongoing focus on emerging platform livelihoods, and with the support of the <a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/">Mastercard Foundation</a>, we spoke to 30 young African platform workers in March, June, and September about the effects of the pandemic. These young men and women from Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana, the majority of whom are below 35 years old, make their living through digital platforms as ride-hailing drivers, delivery drivers, freelancers, e-commerce sellers, and on-demand laborers.</p><p>While pegged to the pandemic, these conversations bring out similar experiences — both positive and negative — captured within the <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">12 elements</a> of Caribou Digital’s recently published <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-3258b05aa83d">platform livelihoods framework</a>. Through this framework, we map several kinds of platform livelihoods, uncover trends and identify cross cutting issues, based on our own original research and that of the wider digital development community.</p><p>With high unemployment rates in all four countries, platforms offer opportunities and, more importantly, access to work and markets and earnings, as you will read in the three blogs that&nbsp;follow.</p><p>It is interesting to learn how these workers and sellers often engage with several platforms, “multihoming” and working fractionally across one to augment another. Some on Upwork, for example, advertise their services on social media. Similarly, those selling on e-commerce websites like Jumia, often advertise or use their personal networks on social media to market their physical&nbsp;shops.</p><p>Additionally, even though the platforms provide access to a wider market, this doesn’t always translate into enough earnings. COVID-19 has forced some ride-hailing and delivery drivers to look ‘off-platform’ to find more work. One driver in Kenya said he would start buying farm produce when he makes longer trips to the countryside. He would then sell this produce in the city. Another driver in Ghana said he is considering starting a fabric business for his wife and delivering to customers himself, in between&nbsp;rides.</p><p>For these youth, platforms have offered a first entry point into work, whether as drivers, freelancers, or micro-entrepreneurs. Students are taking up driving and engaging in social commerce to raise money to pay for their education and other necessities.</p><p>Another thing worth noting is that of the eight digital commerce sellers we spoke to, six are women; of these, five use social media exclusively to sell their products due to the low barriers to entry as compared to e-commerce. They make enough to pay for Facebook or Instagram Ads but do not want to be burdened with subscription fees charged by platforms like Jiji and&nbsp;Jumia.</p><p>Hidden hierarchies are visible in the ride-hailing business. Most drivers we spoke to don’t own the cars they are driving, so paying weekly rental fees takes a big chunk of their income. They are driving to own; they dream of owning a fleet of cars and being bosses&nbsp;someday.</p><p>However, with the disruption caused by the pandemic, which led to less earnings across the board, the workers and sellers were exposed to the precariousness of platform work. Some are contemplating finding “better paying” full-time jobs, some are thinking about quitting, while others have already left the platform. However for some, the options for finding work elsewhere remain few, and platforms continue to provide the lifeline they&nbsp;need.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/social-commerce-and-e-commerce-not-enough-orders-conversations-with-africas-platform-sellers-a9e1963ddd91">In</a> <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/tough-gigs-on-demand-labour-and-freelancing-conversations-with-africas-platform-workers-d6d22b3c030d">these</a> <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/conversations-with-africas-platform-workers-on-ride-hailing-fewer-customers-less-income-49973f8f5e8e">blogs</a> (listed below), we share the experience of some of the 30 platform workers and sellers, highlighting not only their struggles but also the ways they adapted to ride the pandemic wave — from<a href="https://www.transformationalupskilling.org/"> upskilling</a> and expanding product offerings, to finding innovative approaches to earn a&nbsp;living.</p><p>In January 2021, you will get a glimpse into the lives of 10 platform workers and sellers through our <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/video-storytelling-about-covid-19/">video storytelling project</a>. In a series of short self-shot videos, the platform workers and sellers will share their real-life experiences as digital laborers during the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/social-commerce-and-e-commerce-not-enough-orders-conversations-with-africas-platform-sellers-a9e1963ddd91">Social commerce and e-commerce: Not enough&nbsp;orders</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/conversations-with-africas-platform-workers-on-ride-hailing-fewer-customers-less-income-49973f8f5e8e">Ride-hailing: Fewer customers, less&nbsp;income</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/tough-gigs-on-demand-labour-and-freelancing-conversations-with-africas-platform-workers-d6d22b3c030d">Tough gigs: On-demand labour and freelancing</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/covid-19-and-the-platform-livelihoods-of-young-african-workers-f0b5efa1d9c">COVID-19 and the platform livelihoods of young African workers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>I’ve also seen less fortunate companies who have hit road blocks. </p>
      
<p>Despite having a strong desire to deploy next-gen security some organizations can’t seem to get out of their own way. Some developed massive RFI’s that went nowhere. Others had “passwordless initiatives” that began in 2018, got bogged down by identity orchestration projects, and are just now finally deploying 14-character complex passwords (seriously). </p>
      
<p>These unfortunate situations have some things in common. Here are the top 3 things we’ve seen get in the way of a passwordless deployment and how you can avoid them:</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 1. Expecting your Identity Provider to Get You There 
      
<p>If you think your incumbent Identity Provider (IdP) is going to eliminate all of your passwords, I’ve got news for you.</p>
      
<p>Legacy Identity Platforms were built on top of passwords and password-based MFA. While the IAM giants did an incredible job and revolutionized digital security, the elimination of passwords and shared secrets is not their core competency. In fact, authentication itself has always been an add-on feature for the IdP. There has been no need to invest significant resources in improving authentication. As a result, very little innovation has happened on that front.</p>
      
<p>Just look at the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for IAM. Why is the “Visionaries” quadrant empty? </p>
      
  
      
<p>The lack of focus and innovation is why we are seeing more and more businesses <a href="https://get.hypr.com/decoupling-authentication-from-identity">Decoupling Authentication from Identity</a>. After years of waiting for next-gen authentication to arrive and reading blog post after blog post about the benefits of passwordless, these customers are left scratching their heads when they realize their IdP is still using passwords… everywhere. </p>
      
<p>Fortunately, a growing number of organizations have wised up to <a href="https://www.hypr.com/comparing-passwordless-marketing-passwordless-mfa/">the differences between passwordless marketing and passwordless MFA</a>. Those who have succeeded at this mission are teams that realized that they cannot evolve beyond passwords if they simply rely on their incumbent Identity Providers.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 2. Letting Perfect Be the Enemy of Great 
      
<p>“We need everyone to be able to use the same authentication method everywhere, under all conditions, on day 1.” </p>
      
<p>This one-size-fits-all mindset often appears in large, complex organizations who are (rightfully) trying to eliminate passwords for all users. It is commendable to see project leaders striving to satisfy all use cases &amp; edge cases on day 1.</p>
      
<p>Unfortunately, carpet-bombing the password never works. The actual process is more like mowing a lawn, one section at a time, until all of the grass looks consistent.</p>
      
  
      
<p>For an enterprise, the Passwordless transformation is similar to a cloud transformation. It moves incrementally and addresses the needs of a diverse array of user devices, applications and edge cases. These variables manifest in a number of ways:</p>
      
  Users’ personal preferences will vary. Many people are glued to their smartphone. Some prefer to use their desktop for everything work-related.  Some users have an old phone, or no phone. Complex environments have widely different device populations and compliance requirements.  Highly regulated departments might disallow smartphones and require the use of a hardware security token.  And of course, many users simply do not want to carry another piece of hardware.  
      
<p>See why the one-size-fits all approach fails? Trying to solve every use case and edge case on day 1 is an absolutist pursuit of perfection.</p>
      
<p>These organizations take advantage of the various <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-login-methods/">passwordless login methods</a> that satisfy the needs of every situation. Your MFA strategy should allow for the use of <a href="https://www.hypr.com/mobile-initiated-authentication/">Mobile-initiated Authentication</a>, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/fido2-passwordless-yubikey-login/">FIDO2 Security Tokens</a>, and native authenticators such as Windows Hello:</p>
   




 
   
     
       
         
           
            
                       

                                   
              
                              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skprInx4tV4">
                  Play
                                      
                                  </a>
                           
          
                   
       
     
   
 
   
<p>The successful passwordless companies are those who focus on a progressive rollout as outlined in our <a href="https://www.hypr.com/password-elimination/">Free Guide to Password Elimination</a>.</p>
      
<p>Don’t let perfect be the enemy of great. Focus on mowing the password lawn.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 3. IT and Security Teams Who Are Not on the Same Page 
      
<p>The alignment of teams is critical to the success of a transformational project. Many IT initiatives have slowed down to a halt when departments don’t see eye to eye or have conflicting agendas. Any meaningful workforce transformation depends on your IT and Help desk becoming supportive champions of the project.</p>
      
<p>This is where my earlier point about emphasizing the “Why” comes into play. </p>
      
<p>Going passwordless brings a tremendous benefit in terms of user experience, increased security, and cost savings. These impacts are immediately felts across the organization as the drop in password-related support tickets improves the lives of IT, Help desk, and support teams. These groups are the foundation for any successful authentication initiative and they must understand why it is happening and how they can benefit.</p>
      
<p>The good news is Passwordless MFA has a habit of bringing departments together. Rarely do you see IT, InfoSec, Fraud, Compliance, and Line of Business teams come together with such a passion for a common goal. We have seen some of the most fragmented teams build long-lasting bonds over the success of a passwordless deployment. </p>
      
  
      
 To Get Rid of Passwords, You have to Think Like a Password 
      
<p>No, not really. But getting it right means adopting the passwordless mindset. Here is a summary of what the Passwordless Companies are doing:</p>
      
  Go passwordless on your terms. Don’t sit around waiting for your incumbent IAM provider to eliminate passwords (they won’t), and don’t let legacy vendors dictate <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-identity-management/">what passwordless identity should mean to you</a>.   Don’t let perfect be the enemy of great. Focus on quick wins with one user group at a time as you progress towards a passwordless state.  Align your teams towards a common goal. Passwordless MFA sells itself. Nobody wants to go back to passwords. Focus on why password elimination matters to your colleagues and it will naturally accelerate on its own.

  <p>By the end of 2023, more than 90% of infrastructure and operations (I&amp;O) organizations will have the majority of their staff working remotely. COVID-19 may have accelerated this trend, but it is also the result of the changing nature of infrastructure led by the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cloud-shift-impacts-all-it-markets/">shift to cloud </a>and edge.</p>
<p>“Trends like anywhere operations and core modernization have been moving to the forefront of the I&amp;O organization for years, but the pandemic rapidly accelerated them to the point where they’ll have a transformational impact in the near future,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/16025">Jeffrey Hewitt</a>, Research VP, Gartner.</p>
<p>Here are the six key trends that will impact I&amp;O in the next 12 to 18 months and the steps that IT leaders can take to implement them.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 Trend No. 1: Anywhere operations 
<p>The shift to remote work has forced enterprises to realize the benefits of flexibility. It has also revealed that the traditional structured processes of I&amp;O make the enterprise fragile in the face of disruption.</p>
<p>I&amp;O must be able to support the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/master-a-distributed-workforce-for-digital-transformation/">distributed enterprise’s</a> operations while working from anywhere. In addition to providing more flexibility, anywhere operations benefits organizations by broadening the talent landscape, as I&amp;O teams are not tied to recruiting from a certain geographic location. However, this will require a cultural change, as it challenges the traditional thinking of providing infrastructure and supporting operations from one central location.</p>
<p>To enable anywhere operations, I&amp;O leaders should assess its feasibility for each business unit. Determine where remote working makes sense, and develop plans to enable these teams to dynamically work both on-site and remotely.</p>
 Trend No. 2: Optimal infrastructure 
<p>Optimal infrastructure shifts I&amp;O from “infrastructure and operations” to “integration and operations.” Different infrastructure choices, such as cloud, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/edge-computing">edge</a> or newer technologies like computational storage, may apply to different locations and workloads. It has become a key responsibility of I&amp;O to determine the infrastructure that is the best fit for each scenario.</p>
<p>This trend supports I&amp;O and business alignment by ensuring strong returns for infrastructure investment. I&amp;O leaders should take a business approach to optimal infrastructure, using a cost-benefit view to justify infrastructure choices and to build business cases for change. Consider risk-return ratios as part of any proposed change scenarios.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz05ODYxNTA0MjMzZWUxMWViODhjYzJmMGZiNGYxN2RkYw=="></a></p>
 Trend No. 3: Operational continuity 
<p>IT services must be continuous, regardless of external factors. This expectation changes the traditional role of IT operations, requiring an increased dependence on automation and zero- or minimal-touch maintenance. The benefits of this include increased efficiency, faster workload deployment, reduced costs and consistency across processes.</p>
<p>However, operational continuity also presents challenges, as it requires the introduction of new tools and processes, it may increase complexity and it can be difficult to justify to the business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take contingency planning to the next level by considering the impacts of worst-case scenarios</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To shift the IT organization toward operational continuity, identify continuity requirements based on business priorities and begin planning accordingly. Take contingency planning to the next level by considering the impacts of worst-case scenarios and what can be done to ensure that operations can continue in such a situation. If there are time pressures, or if the team does not have the skills to implement a solution, consider service-based solutions for disaster recovery.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/achieve-infrastructure-resilience-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/">Achieve Infrastructure Resilience During the Coronavirus Outbreak</a></p>
 Trend No. 4: Core modernization 
<p>Today, organizations are doing more to update and modernize their core infrastructures. This process helps minimize legacy drag, maximize efficiency and ensure resiliency as legacy infrastructure experts retire. It ensures infrastructure evolves in lockstep with <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-trends-drive-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2020/">emerging technologies</a>, becoming more flexible to respond to digital business needs.</p>
<p>Modernization is not only a technical decision. It requires funding, and therefore I&amp;O professionals must have business acumen to make the case for it. Work with application leaders to identify the areas where modernization will have the greatest impact, and ensure these areas align with business priorities. Implement a modernization plan with realistic timelines. New skills requirements should be part of that plan.</p>
 Trend No. 5: Distributed cloud 
<p>Distributed cloud is the decentralization of cloud resources. It enables flexibility in the enterprise’s physical location, while also reducing latency and shifting the burden of support to the cloud service provider. Each of the many different models of distributed cloud offer a variety of benefits.</p>
<p>Distributed cloud also comes with challenges, including complex deployment models and increased risk of lock-in and high costs, and it remains an immature market.</p>
<p>I&amp;O professionals should have distributed cloud on their radar as a trend to watch as it continues to mature and emerge as a preferred infrastructure model over the coming 12-18 months. Identify potential use cases, and plan how it could be integrated into the organization’s hybrid cloud environment.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-distributed-cloud/">The CIO's Guide to Distributed Cloud</a></p>
 Trend No. 6: Critical skills vs. critical roles 
<p>I&amp;O organizations are shifting to a focus on critical skills rather than critical roles. This helps reduce risk and increase resiliency, as multiple people have with the skills needed for business-critical tasks. It also helps I&amp;O teams to align budgets more closely with business needs and move away from territorial thinking to a more collaborative approach.</p>
<p>This trend will require a shift in recruitment tactics, forcing enterprises to have a longer-range view when hiring. Identify the skills gaps, using the aforementioned trends as a framework for the future competencies that will be needed. Train current employees in new skills where that will be sufficient, and hire new talent early when possible.</p>

					  Weinheim, Baden-Württemberg 04.12.2020. Heute Vormittag war es soweit, beim Get Started Gründerfrühstück des bitkom hatte ich die Ehre und das Vergnügen, in gemütlicher Runde mit Winfried Kretschmann, dem Ministerpräsidenten des Landes Baden-Württemberg, plaudern zu dürfen. <p>Moderiert von Jenny Boldt, bitkom, war außerdem der Unternehmerkollege Pascal Benoit, ENIT-Systems mit dabei. Zunächst drehte sich alles um Startup-Förderung am Standort Baden-Württemberg. Als im schönen Weinheim an der Bergstraße ansässiges Unternehmen muss ich sagen, dass wir uns in Baden-Württemberg wirklich wohl fühlen. Da wir ein 100 % digitales Produkt anbieten, ist für Mitarbeit, Zusammenarbeit mit Partnern und fachlichem Austausch aber eindeutig der Faktor Kompetenz für uns wichtiger als regionale Nähe. Trifft beides zusammen, wunderbar. Wir arbeiten – und das nicht nur aufgrund von Corona – überwiegend virtuell und weltweit vernetzt. Wobei comuny durchaus von regionaler Unterstützung profitiert hat: Anfang 2019 haben wir Up2B durchlaufen, den SAP-Accelerator der Region Mannheim, Heidelberg und Walldorf (<a href="https://up2b.io/">Up2B – Accelerator for IT Startups</a>) und auch zum Cyberforum in Karlsruhe (<a href="https://www.cyberforum.de/">CyberForum: Hightech.Unternehmer.Netzwerk.</a>) pflegen wir guten Kontakt.</p><p>Zur Bedeutung von Standort passt deshalb unser Credo: Virtuell agieren, hybrid Wirkung entfalten. Denn es wird immer stärker zu einer Verschmelzung von Online und Offline-Welt kommen.</p><p>Wir waren uns in der Runde einig, dass die Förderlandschaft für Wissenschaft und für die Entwicklung neuer Technologien gut aufgestellt ist. Nun bin ich eine Visionärin, die Technologie “nur” dazu nutzt, komplexe Probleme mit gesellschaftlicher Relevanz zu lösen. Technologie an sich birgt immer Chance wie auch Risiko – es ist an uns, Sinn und Nutzen ihres Einsatzes zu modellieren. Ich weiß wovon ich spreche, denn in den letzten 20 Jahren habe ich digitale Innovationen in der Gesundheitsbranche vorangetrieben. Hier kommt es entscheidend darauf an, welches Geschäftsmodell dahinter liegt. Idealerweise führt technische Innovation auch zu sozialer Innovation. Denn wohin wollen wir uns durch Digitalisierung transformieren? (Förder-)Politik hätte es in meinen Augen in der Hand, hier Gestalter klarer Ziele beim Einsatz von Technologie zu sein. Das ist für mich nachhaltige Technologie! Green-IT, ja auch. Stichwort: Daten nutzen ja – mit welcher Absicht? Zu wessen Vorteil? Ethik in künstlicher Intelligenz – Erkenntnisinteresse? Wer steuert wen? Deep Learning: Wer lernt eigentlich aus diesen Daten? Was wollen wir als Einzelner, als Unternehmen, als Gesellschaft, als Menschheit lernen?</p><p>Mir lag es deshalb am Herzen, folgenden Wunsch an Winfried Kretschmann zu richten: Es wäre großartig, wenn das Land stärker Startups fördert, deren digitale Geschäftsmodelle den gesellschaftlichen Fortschritt unterstützen. Die einen Beitrag dazu leisten, die digitale Kluft bei Bildung oder in der Gesundheitsversorgung zu verringern, die durch künstliche Intelligenz diskriminierungsfreier entscheiden als ein Mensch, die freie Datenflüsse und dezentrale Strukturen und damit eine Art Gewaltenteilung ermöglichen und die offen und nutzenstiftend sind für viele, weil sie Standards anwenden. Am Ende ist für unsere Demokratie und Freiheit entscheidend, dass Vielfalt am Markt erhalten bleibt. Dass sich coole Innovationen auch behaupten können. Ich gebe zu, dafür braucht es ausgeklügeltere Geschäftsmodelle. Aber das geht – und genau auf die wird es ankommen.</p><p>Immer wieder sprachen wir nämlich über Risiken von Startups und über mutige Entscheidungen. Ich meine: Wenn niemand mehr ins Risiko geht und den Mut zeigt, neue Lösungsräume zu erschließen, dann wird Innovation auf der Strecke bleiben.</p><p>Gerade das Land könnte sich hier protegierend und stärkend hinter die Modelle von frühen Startups stellen. Vielleicht sogar Spielregeln einbringen oder ausprobieren, damit Technologie für Menschen und die Gesellschaft positive Wirkung entfalten kann.</p><p>Winfried Kretschmann hat meinen Wunsch aufgegriffen und es selber zu Ende der Veranstaltung so formuliert: “Wir müssen es schaffen, dass wir vom verhindernden zum gestaltenden Datenschutz kommen. Wie macht man es so, dass man die Daten nutzen kann, ohne dass sie am Schluss missbraucht werden? Heute nutzen wir das Potenzial von Technologien nicht aus. Vielen Dank für den Wunsch, beides hinzubekommen, es zu nutzen und trotzdem aus niemandem einen gläsernen Menschen oder gläsernen Betrieb zu machen.”</p><p>Ich bin darüber sehr glücklich und danke Ihnen, lieber Herr Kretschmann, für diese Worte und den guten Austausch heute. Ich sage nur, Baden-Württemberg, Heimat von zahlreichen Hidden Champions.</p><p>#startups #dataeconomy #operator</p>

 Tokens Recovery 
<p>Through the T-REX protocol, control and compliance are added to the blockchain and in this case, if the tokens are lost, they can be easily recovered.</p>

			 Why Is Tokens Recovery Important? 
<p>According to a recent study (Chainanalysis), around 4 million bitcoins, approximately 20% of those in circulation today, have been lost since the invention of the crypto-currency. If a holder of Bitcoin loses their private keys and wallet-access credentials, the tokens are lost and cannot be recovered because bitcoin tokens are controlled by an algorithm, not by any identified and responsible party.</p>
<p>This highlights the stark difference between crypto-tokens and security tokens issued with the T-REX suite of smart contracts. Through the T-REX protocol, control and compliance are added to the blockchain and in this case, if the tokens are lost, they can be easily recovered.</p>
 How is this possible? 
<p>Through their digital investment passports ONCHAINID, investors can prove their identity to the issuer or their agent. After the identity is confirmed the Recovery function of the token smart contract is triggered under the full control of the Issuer and the lost tokens are transferred to the new wallet of the investor.</p>
 What does this mean? 
 
 Investors can self-custody their tokens without risk 
 Investors Recover lost tokens in minutes 
 Issuers can be sure the&nbsp; token’s compliance rules will continue to be enforced

   Why Tying the Knot Between IoT and Users Is a Three-Layer Wedding Cake

   Why Tying the Knot Between IoT and Users Is a Three-Layer Wedding Cake 

<p>Is your Internet of Things (IoT) project stuck in device registration mode with seemingly no way to get out? Or have you been able to “break out” to realize greater business value by “marrying” your IoT to your human user profiles?</p>

<p>Let me explain what I mean. When it comes to IoT strategies, too many organizations that I talk to are concerned about only finding, registering, securing, and then managing the lifecycle of their IoT devices (examples: door sensors, IP cameras, RFID equipment). This is a laudable goal to be sure. But they consider this a fait accompli. Game over. Next project.</p>

<p>But is this really the end state we should aspire to with our IoT projects? To merely discover and manage our devices? Or is there a higher business value for the&nbsp; organization?&nbsp;</p>

 A Three-Layer Wedding Cake&nbsp; 

<p>As you might suspect, I consider this&nbsp; to be an intermediate step towards a higher strategic goal. And that higher goal is joining and managing your devices together with the users who need to use them in order to have a “single pane” of intelligence and visibility that adds business context to every action that involves these devices and users. This will shatter your traditional IoT silos and lead to greater automation, intelligence gathering, and trust.</p>

<p>But I digress. Our new happy couple –<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot"> IoT</a> and our human user – are about to cut the cake! Here are the benefits they can expect from this compatible marriage.</p>

 First Layer: Automating Business Processes&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>The projections of IoT devices being added to our networks every day is simply staggering. According to <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45213219">IDC data</a>, there will be 41.6 billion connected IoT devices by 2025*.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s a mind boggling number that leads most IT professionals&nbsp; to immediately think about automation. How do you automate a tsunami of increasingly heterogeneous devices flooding your organization and give users timely access to the devices they need?</p>

<p>For starters, when you plan out your IoT strategy and you know which users need access to which IoT devices, you are in a perfect position to automate that access using some combination of rules-based and artificial intelligence (AI) methodology. The important thing is to start your IoT project with this holistic view to the future.</p>

<p>But there is more. Many IoT experts, including those at ForgeRock, envision a future where the combination of a user, a device, and an entity can actually unlock greater economic value for everyone in the chain, delivering a level of personalization and customization we’ve never seen before.</p>

<p>Here’s one common example. The scenarios most often discussed involve a patient (human) with a healthcare device (IoT) that informs a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/healthcare">healthcare</a> provider (entity) proactively about changes in the user’s condition. The measurable business value unlocked here: exceptional patient care and lower healthcare costs through early detection and treatment.</p>

<p>Another scenario is the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot/connected-car">connected car</a>. If you buy a car, you want to take care of it. Car manufacturers are banking on IoT to do that by alerting you to issues and where you can go to get them resolved. But they are going further, adding upgrade offers, facilitating bi-directional communications, safety notifications, and more. The measurable business value unlocked here is that loyal car buyers will stay with the same manufacturer for their next automobile purchase.</p>

<p>With all privacy and consent regulations being adhered to, an intelligent IoT system can provide a wealth of value-added services to the user.</p>

 Second Layer: Intelligence Gathering&nbsp; 

<p>What can your IoT devices tell you that would enable you to power your business forward? Quite a lot, in fact!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Devices vary, but even “dumb” IoT devices give you online/offline status. More intelligent ones provide data streams that are used to drive action, automate processes, and allow businesses to offer value added services. (See “First Layer: Automating Business Processes.”) These services are relevant for intelligence because the near real-time or real-time data they provide can be gathered to stop an attack, assess the risk of particular users, or even change the risk profile of a set of users requiring, for example, a greater level of authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But aggregating this data around your<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform"> identity platform</a> – as opposed to your security information and event management (SIEM) solution or security operations center (SOC) – is key. This is because the relationship data offered through a complete identity management view allows a complete 360-degree view of who these users are and how they are using IoT devices. Your organization can utilize additional insights to make business decisions for security, asset utilization, workforce staffing and more.</p>

 Third Layer: Trust in Your Devices&nbsp; 

<p>Trust is everything when it comes to IoT. A single breach of a single device in your organization can lead to catastrophic results.</p>

<p>On the other hand, having a reasonable assurance of&nbsp; security can lead to improved functioning in an organization. IoT devices can be managed as groups in the exact same way digital identities for human users are managed. This gives the IT department a single console to manage all digital identities in a consistent way. Identities for things are unique to each device and are anchored in a root certificate or any other identifier that allows the unique identification of devices. You know what users can have access to what devices and under what circumstances. Relationships among users, users and devices, and between devices are managed from a central console, making lifecycle management easy and robust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, we can allow user access by role. If you’re a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) technician, you can have access to certain restricted classes of devices (HVAC controllers, for example). Devices are treated as first-class digital identities and are allowed to act autonomously on their own behalf with fine-grained authorization sharing data only with authorized destinations or applications. We can enforce certain types of authentication and change it in an instant when the overall threat level rises (and make sure our users have pre-enrolled in methods to support step-up authentication). We can restrict access by time of day or day of week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Customized and relevant offerings make the difference between a world-class service and failure. Being able to scale such a process and potentially serve millions of users individually requires automated, data-driven decisions made in near real time. Device data is a key ingredient, but this data must be trustworthy and genuine. This drives the need for IoT to join together with human roles and profiles. To trust a device-user interaction, you must first identify the two to proceed with confidence.</p>

 You’re Cordially Invited 

<p>At ForgeRock, we’re already helping customers move beyond the first IoT level and prepare themselves for the connected IoT future. Our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/edge-security/identity-edge-controller">IoT Gateway and IoT software development kit (SDK) offerings</a> are helping customers gain control, secure devices, and pave the way to monetize, automate and streamline their businesses. Check us out at <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">https://www.forgerock.com/iot</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s wish our happy couple a long marriage. I’m looking forward to a toast, but I also know that a wedding is just the beginning – hopefully, the start of a very long, successful, and prosperous relationship! Hard work and partnering lie ahead. I wish you well on this journey!</p>

<p>I didn’t get the appeal of podcasts before I started listening to them, but now I’m hooked. There are so many podcasts out there – comedy podcasts, activity podcasts, political podcasts etc. – that there’s something to listen to for any situation. Of course, that’s a little overwhelming if you don’t know where to start, so it’s always helpful to get recommendations (see below!).</p>
<p>But why the hype? The main appeal for me is that I can listen anywhere on-demand – standing on a train, cooking, running – where reading wouldn’t be practical. Sure, music is good for that stuff too, but podcasts are way more absorbing and I feel like I’m multitasking by learning cool stuff while doing what I need to do. </p>
<p>I think podcasts work especially well for business topics, like identity, because there’s so much content out there to read – trust me, I’m an identity content writer. So sometimes you just reach a limit as to what you can take in that way, and switching to this format stops my eyes going blurry 😵.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity 
<p>In around May 2019, we decided to launch our very own podcast, Let’s Talk About Digital Identity (LTADI). The idea was for our brilliant host, Oscar Santolalla, to interview an identity management leader in every episode, providing a platform for others to learn from their deep knowledge of the industry. 18 months on, I’m so happy to have published 33 episodes with amazing guests, with lots more exciting episodes on the way. Huge thank you to all participants!!!</p>
<p>Our guests hail from fourteen countries, from where Ubisecure has its roots in Finland, to Kenya, to New Zealand. They cover all kinds of identity topics – national and international identity schemes, public and private sector identity solutions, the future of digital identity, and lots more. I hope that we can continue to expand the diversity of our guests and their areas of expertise to provide a platform for global, thought (and action) provoking views of our industry. We love learning from every guest that joins the show, and know that our listeners love it too.</p>

  <p>In the words of Charles Darwin, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but rather the one most adaptable to change.”</p>
<p>A fundamental change is coming in the way businesses compose and consume software. This future relies on applications that can be assembled, reassembled and easily extended, in what’s known as the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable/">composable business</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest challenge application leaders face as they move to the composable business will be changing their organization’s culture</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Applications are the core of composable business, yet the application organization as it currently stands isn’t well-positioned to deliver on this promise. The application team is often centrally located and hierarchically structured, making it too slow and disconnected from the business it supports,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/7328">Matthew Hotle</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>This disconnect presents an opportunity for application leaders to help transform their organization for the future of composable business. Here’s how application leaders can build an adaptive approach to governance, funding, culture and organization design.</p>
 Go where the applications are 
<p>Many companies discourage any diffusion of application delivery, fearing a lack of governance or loss of control. However, such diffusion helps the organization redefine the boundaries of their control-oriented structure and move toward a composable business.</p>
<p>Actively work with the CIO and line-of-business leaders to encourage application development and delivery to be done where it’s the most optimal.</p>
 Deliver software via multidisciplinary teams 
<p>In enterprises that have begun the transition to composable business, software delivery is often done by “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-become-an-agile-superhero/">agile</a>” or “fusion” teams. These teams are staffed by individuals with both technology and business skill sets, and they benefit from having members with diverse personal and professional backgrounds.</p>
<p>Gartner research has found that such teams deliver business outcomes 20% faster than their peers. This multidisciplinary approach promotes a flexible and adaptable organizational structure.</p>
 Flatten the organizational structure 
<p>The shift to composable business presents an opportunity to reduce several layers of management, as teams are empowered to be more autonomous. Leading enterprises that have already begun this shift have teams organized around flexible and fluid management structures, not just formal reporting relationships.</p>
<p>However, many enterprises aren’t ready to fully overhaul established hierarchical structures. They are not comfortable with self-management, and still look for a single person to be held accountable for the team’s activities.</p>
<p>Application leaders in these organizations must begin to enable more autonomy on their teams. Build trust with senior leaders by piloting teams of individuals with both the right skill sets and the right culture to be autonomous.</p>
 Establish an adaptive governance framework 
<p>The distributed application function should be treated as an ecosystem. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/it-governance">Governance</a> provides connective tissue for the ecosystem by defining who has the right to make decisions, such as who is responsible for specific applications or who has the right to build, buy or compose a new application.</p>
<p>This ensures that individual contributors do not optimize their own work to the detriment of the entire ecosystem. The application organization of the future must democratize these decisions via an adaptive governance framework. This framework ensures that decisions are made where it’s most appropriate for them to be made.</p>
 Align funding to applications and products 
<p>In the composable business, each application function owns its own budget and dictates the order in which it delivers its roadmaps. The function also owns how it reports business outcomes and business values.</p>
<p>To achieve this, enterprises must change their funding processes from centrally held “governance boards” to distributing funds to product lines and product managers. These product managers can then make decisions as to how they will spend those funds and achieve intended business outcomes.</p>
<p>Democratization of the governance and funding process is crucial in enabling the application ecosystem to be adaptive, flexible and focused on delivering business value faster.</p>
 Understand and adapt culture 
<p>The biggest challenge application leaders face as they move to the composable business will be changing their <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/accelerate-digital-transformation-by-hacking-your-io-culture/">organization’s culture</a>. In conjunction with the CIO and other leaders, the application leader must first identify what the current culture is, create a vision for what it should be in the future and lead by example to form the new culture.</p>
<p>The high-powered teams that are essential to composable business require two key cultural principles:</p>
 
 Trust. Most leadership models are focused on the premise that the “higher” you are in an organization, the more trustworthy your decisions are. To truly democratize decision-making processes, this can’t be the case. Leaders must trust their employees, and employees must trust their leaders. 
 Accountability.&nbsp;To be trusted, people must be accountable. They need to believe in doing the right thing for their business. Accountability here doesn’t flow top down (“I want to hold you accountable”), but through the organization (“I am accountable to you”). 
 
<p>Using this framework, application leaders can work with senior business leadership to ensure that the application function is focused on providing the best experience that drives business results. Then, they must create an environment that empowers employees to form high-performing teams that are capable of delivering those business results.</p>

  <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to drive organizations to look for ways to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-ways-to-quickly-reduce-it-costs/">reduce spending</a>, projects that focus on cost optimization and operational efficiency will be less affected than those that focus on transformative impacts. IoT is generally an early-stage project that is counted as discretionary spending or represents an area of large capex, so it is particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Through 2020, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-cios-can-achieve-digital-business-transformation-in-healthcare/">healthcare IoT</a> will be the only sector that sees double-digit growth in IoT investments. Short-term investments by healthcare providers will focus on combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The expansion of crisis hospital capacity and equipment in temporary facilities, increased demand for ventilators and investment in <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/analysts-answer-how-will-coronavirus-impact-technology-investment-across-verticals/">telemedicine </a>to reduce the spread of infection are causing a temporary increase in IoT device sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz00ZWRmNzQ0YjMyZTQxMWViOGFhZGExYjUyMWU1ZWJlNQ=="></a></p>
<p>Telemedicine initiatives are likely to continue post-pandemic, and healthcare provider CIOs will need to develop <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-need-for-ai-governance-in-healthcare/">long-term plans</a> to identify which virtual care solutions improve patient experience, optimize costs and better manage the health of populations overall.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-succeed-in-healthcare-digital-transformation/">How Healthcare Providers Can Succeed in Digital Transformation</a></p>
<p>The most imminent need for healthcare is to expand capacity by adding more ventilators and patient monitors, many of which are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lessons-from-iot-early-adopters/">IoT-enabled</a> by default. To reduce the burden on healthcare centers, providers are investing in remote patient-monitoring solutions by adding the management, tracking and alerting of medical devices, such as those that monitor blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate. These solutions will allow patients to be monitored in their home environments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other verticals that have high IoT demand, such as automotive or manufacturing, will be hit harder by the crisis and will postpone some of their IoT transformation initiatives and production volumes due to revenue constraints.</p>
<p>This will impact not only product leaders’ immediate initiatives, but also their strategies for the next three to five years. But during the recovery, companies will invest in automation to protect themselves against future shocks.</p>

 Polkadot Decoded Recap — Li Jun’s&nbsp;Keynote  A quick recap of our Founder’s keynote speech on DeID, DeFi, and&nbsp;OScore <p>With Covid-19 keeping more and more of us indoors, we are turning to digital means as a method to keep us closer and to host tech conferences as we would’ve back in the days when the gathering was permitted. Nonetheless, the Polkadot Decoded event was a smashing success, regardless of it being held virtually. For this year’s event, our Founder Li Jun was cordially invited to give a keynote speech on Ontology’s current developments, specifically centered around DeID, DeFi &amp; OScore. Here’s a&nbsp;recap:</p><p>Li Jun opened, by stating how Ontology’s decentralized identity protocol &amp; decentralized data protocol will help build new trust collaboration between Ontology and the Polkadot Network before diving into ONT ID. Our decentralized identity protocol works for other blockchains such as Ethereum as well. This cross-chain feature allows users to control their accounts, wallet &amp; digital assets address — as well as traditional information like bank accounts and social&nbsp;media.</p><p>According to Li Jun, since you already manage your own identity, it is easier to perform data collaboration based on DDXF— so that no single platform controls your data. All personal data, value, and privacy will be controlled by yourself.</p><p>This includes our OScore, the first on-chain credit score based on Ontology’s data protocols. It accumulates different on-chain data points and information based on different blockchains, including Polkadot in the near future. The integration with different chains for both OScore and decentralized identity is the next phase, as we will build on our current collection of partners including Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, TRON, and Polkadot.</p><p>Succeeding the outline of cross-chain integration, Li Jun introduced a real use case for how DeID could work with Daimler Mobility’s “Welcome Home”&nbsp;feature.</p><p>When users use the car, they have control over any kind of data during usage. This data can then be used to buy insurance at a discount, for example, while being completely controlled by the user. It is important to note that no centralized party controls the data. While Daimler is in the auto sector, Li Jun highlighted that this can be used for other industries as well. In addition, other sets of data can be digitalized and rebuilt in a decentralized form as well, allowing every user to manage and own their&nbsp;data.</p><p>A short break was granted while a feature video of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPfxQfNlGY4">Drive With Ontology</a>” played&nbsp;next.</p><p>Credit Components &amp;&nbsp;DeFi</p><p>After the video, Li Jun shifted his attention to how staking is currently done in decentralized finance, which is based on how much you stake, rather than your reputation or your credit. This is not like traditional finance. In addition, a key point of highlight from Li Jun is that credit can accelerate the asset digitalization in blockchain — such as equity, real estate, and other physical goods. But by doing so, how can we confirm these assets are real, in addition to their ownership? Well, this would be something that decentralized identity would be able to solve with its flexible protocol to link to many different rules, laws, and offline requirements in order to verify the digitization of&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The final part of the keynote posed the question of how to create a link between traditional finance and DeFi. In reality, everything that we do online in the DeFi space can be also done with offline, traditional financial systems. According to Li Jun, Financial institutions shouldn’t have control over building your data, your credit, or any other part of your identity — rather, they should merely only have access to it when you grant it. The identity should be built by yourself, in a decentralized format.</p><p>To round off the keynote, Li Jun introduced the <a href="https://wing.finance">Wing Platform</a> — a decentralized lending platform that is built based on the vision we’ve highlighted above. With a combination of decentralized identity and credit lending, Wing has an opportunity to be an industry leader in the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/polkadot-decoded-recap-li-juns-keynote-4fba0dc6aaa7">Polkadot Decoded Recap — Li Jun’s Keynote</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 Decentralized identity use case spotlight: Supply chains 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  One of the most successful applications of blockchain technology has been to the management of supply chains, making it possible to create a tamper-proof history of source, custody, alteration, and authenticity. But what role, if any, can decentralized identity play in making this technology even more useful?  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Digital identity is a core aspect of global supply chain management</p>
<p>Each point in a supply chain process involves the identity of a person, object, or entity. For example, that could be the farmer, the truck driver, the truck, the warehouse, the grocer, or the end consumer. Like any other transactional system, the verification of each identity in the chain is critical for a smooth, secure, and transparent operation. A blockchain without an identity component may only log information pertaining to the object, but lack the capability to verify the identities of the players involved throughout the process. This leads to information gaps, only giving companies and consumers a partial picture of what’s really going on.</p>
<p>As supply chains become more global and complex, the amount of risk involved grows. Companies are increasingly being held liable for the actions of 3rd parties associated with them, introducing a whole new component of risk that a company needs to mitigate. With the introduction of KYS (know your supplier) regulation in recent years, companies can incur major penalties for unknowingly having sanctioned parties participating in their upstream. Without the means to verify supply chain participants, companies risk dealing with sanctioned organizations and paying a hefty price.</p>
<p>Identity verification is no longer just a convenience; it’s essential.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity, which also depends on a blockchain, is a natural extension to the technology as it’s used. Based on the principle of immutability, it makes it possible for companies to prove, via a distributed ledger, the authenticity of goods as well as the identities of those that handled them, mitigating risk and providing for more transparency.</p>
<p>Simply put, you can’t create a secure supply chain without addressing identity challenges.</p>
<p>Identity means transparency in a supply chain</p>
<p>When it comes to achieving corporate social responsibility goals, decentralized identity technology enables companies to walk the talk. In recent years, younger demographics have flexed their purchasing power by actively seeking brands with ethical and sustainable supply chains, demanding higher transparency and accountability. Many companies pledge to only work with suppliers who meet stringent specifications.</p>
<p>A major challenge that many companies face, however, is their inability to have a clear, complete picture of their own supply chain. A company might be able to confidently attest that its tier 1 suppliers are making good on their ethical commitments to workers and processes, yet have no insight into the conditions of their suppliers’ suppliers, and so on. Nestle, for example, has struggled for decades to eradicate child labor from their cocoa supply chain. While many sociopolitical factors feed into this issue, the lack of visibility into their upstream suppliers is a glaring one. The further upstream the supplier, the harder it is for a distributor to manage how things are done.</p>
<p>Depending on the relationship, supplier and vendor information often goes undisclosed for strategic or competitive reasons, and this creates the conditions where environmental and labor transgressions can flourish. Retailers might vow to eliminate such practices from their supply chains, but be unable to identify and root out the bad actors. How can a company know its suppliers are ethically compliant if they don’t even know who they are?</p>
<p>With decentralized identity, companies are able to verify certain characteristics of their suppliers (i.e. ethical compliance, safety records, vendor scorecards, etc.) without relinquishing private and competitive information, thus raising the bar for all participants in the chain.</p>
<p>These verifiable attributes, connected to the supplier’s digital identity, are immutable and tamper proof. This capability holds suppliers and distributors to a higher standard, and eliminates empty corporate promises.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials reduce cost of supplier vetting and onboarding</p>
<p>A key function of a company’s supply chain department is supplier management. Companies invest a significant amount of time and effort into managing their supplier partnerships, performing background, compliance, and quality checks to ensure their ability to reliably deliver. Large companies, like Apple or Microsoft, deal with thousands of suppliers who have been rigorously vetted and selected. Vetting and onboarding suppliers can be an arduous process, sometimes taking several months for a single supplier to be properly investigated and verified. Especially in volatile times where supply chains expand and contract on a whim, the ability to rapidly vet, onboard, or change suppliers is critical.</p>
<p>In a decentralized identity system, a supplier can be issued a “trusted supplier credential” that is recognized within a given ecosystem, and allows them to prove to potential customers that they comply with a certain set of required industry standards. This credential can help suppliers stand out in a competitive bidding pool, signalling to prospective buyers that they have been pre-vetted and verified. Procurement departments would be drawn to trusted, credentialed suppliers because the amount of effort and time required to onboard them would be greatly reduced. Adding verifiable credentials to supply chain blockchains is transformational, and creates value for manufacturers, vendors, and consumers alike.</p>
<p>At Indicio, we’ve worked hard to develop the ecosystem that makes these capabilities possible. Want to learn how this technology can be integrated into your current supply chain system? Drop us a line and let’s talk!</p>

<p>Over the past few years, Civic has been proud to support our customers in reducing fraud, achieving compliance and onboarding customers quickly. And, during that time we have learned a lot more about our customers’ needs, which has directed our product evolution. Today, we’re proud to introduce our new <a href="https://www.civic.com/identity-verification">Identity Verification by Civic</a>. We’ve completely revamped our identity technology on the front end for businesses, so that installing and managing identification is easy, and businesses can get up and running quickly. And, our service is even more flexible with a pay-as-you-go option.</p>



<p>In the era of lockdowns, commerce has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE70hvI5OOgcDKrNMVXXC4Kl3trZQY6v07FvLWneccoUdQVN2DaSac4yVR6PuXAzn_h2UfRsADSUtl-BcuBWiS7xA8q-lFanqKRbb8g5QLr3n1GcscuusCxDYJcNw6HpFtMSNUvOTg6c-2oaP04LXNknoVEOQBrEepzoSmO8dkQd">accelerated its shift</a> from brick-and-mortar stores to digital shopping. At the same time, new regulation addressing fraud is driving business compliance in the cryptocurrency space. With these tectonic shifts underway, identity verification has never been more important. Businesses need technology solutions that protect them from fraud, maintain compliance and their customers’ privacy all while creating scalable environments.</p>



<p>Identity verification has always been our core mission at Civic. We believe that everyone should have a digital identity they own and control. When people and businesses have more control over the information they transact with, safer platforms can be created for everyone.</p>



<p>Advanced Technology for Business</p>



<p>Identity Verification by Civic has been completely redesigned for simplicity, making it easy to implement for any ecommerce use case. A streamlined experience means your business can more effectively use our industry-leading technology.</p>



<p>With identity verification support for more than 195 countries, Civic can support your business globally. Trust is the essential ingredient when it comes to transacting safely. That’s why we’ve invested in the biometric and liveness verification, which provides a less than one percent false rejection rate. This means that no matter where you do your business, commerce with your customers is GDPR, CCPA and HIPAA compliant.</p>



<p>Civic offers Identity Verification in two easy ways. You may integrate it with your existing app or website, or use our stand-alone app, which assumes management of personally identifiable information. For your customers, participation is as simple as downloading the app on their mobile phones and taking just a couple minutes to complete enrollment.</p>



<p>Powered by patented technology</p>



<p>Civic leverages patented blockchain technology, which allows businesses to authenticate users in real time without storing their data. Consumers benefit from having more control over their own information, knowing that their data cannot be stored by the identity-requesting businesses. At the core of the system is an identity network based on verified trust, making it safer and easier to exchange information between multiple parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Easy customer experience</p>



<p>Identity Verification for your customers is available through Civic Wallet on both <a href="https://l.civic.com/dCNNHJi4ibb">iOS</a> and <a href="https://l.civic.com/ROeFwIo4ibb">Android</a>. Civic Wallet offers a privacy-focused experience and the ability to add cryptocurrency and health status information. Customer sign-up takes just a few minutes and customers can start using Identity Verification by Civic right away.</p>

<p>In recent years, Cybercrime accelerated drastically and has become a business on its own. The amount of financial damage cyber fraud could cause is considered to be trillions of dollars in 2021.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Due to COVID-19, user behavior has changed, and digitization has taken a tremendous speed – unfortunately, so has cyber fraud. One problem with doing business over the internet is not being able to identify the users and their intention. To deal with this problem, measures have been taken against fraud actions in most countries with strict KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. Just earlier this year, the European Union’s fifth Anti-Money-Laundering Directive has come into force this year to fight against money laundering and bring more transparency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, identity fraud attempts have shown a massive increase since the first lockdown earlier this year. In the new IDnow Security Report, you will find a detailed information of the most common types of identity fraud, which countries are the main targets of fraud attacks, and how companies can mitigate cyber fraud.</p>
<blockquote><p>Read IDnow’s recently published <a href="https://www.idnow.io/security-report/">Security Report</a> to learn more.</p></blockquote>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Ivanti has completed its acquisition of MobileIron and Pulse Secure. Ivanti, headquartered in Salt Lake City, had its roots in desktop management (LANDESK), evolved into endpoint and patch management, and had added full IT asset, service, and workspace management, as well as IAM capabilities.</p>
<p>Though headquartered in North America, Ivanti had already become a global IT solutions provider. Pulse Secure, a strong secure access vendor, was spun-out from Juniper Networks in 2014. MobileIron was dedicated to mobile device management, mobile security, and authentication since it was established in 2009. Both Pulse Secure and MobileIron are global companies, with strong partner networks in both NA and the EU. Both had sizable shares of their market segments, including many enterprise customers.</p>
<p></p>
 Deal merges Zero Trust capabilities 
<p>This pair of acquisitions will result in a merger of capabilities that are central to the Zero Trust paradigm that prevails in IAM and cybersecurity today. Zero Trust, at its base, is granular authentication and contextual authorization for every request in an environment, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid, with runtime evaluation of user/device/app/data attributes against access control policies. It is the embodiment of the principle of least privilege.</p>
<p>These acquisitions bring together UEM and device security, VPN and ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access), and strong MFA. Each of these functions is essential for moving to a true ZTNA. Moreover, with the increased need for long term remote working and partnerships, consolidating secure mobile authentication and access control with VPN and comprehensive UEM will be a benefit to current customers. It will present an appealing alternative to additional enterprise and SMB prospects that are looking to improve security posture and user experiences.</p>
<p></p>
 No single product achieves 100% Zero Trust 
<p>While no single product or suite can make an organization fully “Zero Trust”, the move by Ivanti to pick up MobileIron and Pulse Secure should make it easier for this combination to satisfy larger subsets of business and security requirements related to Zero Trust.</p>
<p>Each company’s products have strengths that complement the others. There are some overlaps in their product offerings, and as usual in such situations, there will likely be some de-duplication of functions in their solution roadmaps. KuppingerCole has reported on these vendors previously and will follow upcoming developments in this space.</p>

On the one hand, the rapid growth of data comes from the demand side, the demand for DAI continues to grow due to liquidity mining and rising market trends; on the other hand, it also comes from the supply side, the debt ceiling of ETH-A has been raised to $490 million. The USDC-A debt ceiling has also reached $485 million, and the utilization rate has exceeded 80%. USDC locked in the Maker Protocol has accounted for 13% of the total supply of USDC. In contrast, the contribution of newly-added collateral to the generation of DAI is limited. Since October, the total contribution of newly-added collateral assets COMP, LRC, LINK, BAL, YFI, GUSD to DAI is $26.30 million, accounting for 2.5% of the total, except for YFI, only 0.5%(Data source: <a href="https://daistats.com/">https://daistats.com</a>).</p> Circle announced a high-yield savings plan, up to&nbsp;10.75% <p>On November 5, 2020, Circle officially <a href="https://twitter.com/circlepay/status/1324413482662592512">announced</a> that it would provide USDC current and regular savings plans.

According to relevant sources, only one stablecoin fully secured by US dollars will be launched initially, but other currencies and combination stablecoins will be launched later.<br>Three informants said that the specific launch date of Libra would depend on when the project is approved by the FINMA to provide payment services, but it may be January next year at the earliest. The FINMA said it would not comment on the application of&nbsp;Libra.</p> 3. Stablecoins accelerate the pace of outside the cryptocurrency market <p>The acceleration of stablecoins outside the cryptocurrency market has not only attracted the attention of more countries or international regulatory agencies but also gradually expanded application scenarios. In November, Circle announced the use of USDC to assist medical staff in Venezuela, showing that the application of stablecoins is not only limited to the world of cryptography. After the European Commission, the G20 joint FSB, and the International Monetary Fund successively released their regulatory reports on stablecoin in October, the UK Treasury Department stated that it would develop a regulatory framework for stablecoin, and the BIS also issued a supervision report of stablecoin.</p> Circle used USDC to assist Venezuelan medical&nbsp;staff <p>In November, the supply of USDC has reached $3 billion, and its application scope is gradually integrated with the real world. According to <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-partners-with-bolivarian-republic-of-venezuela-and-airtm-to-deliver-aid-to-venezuelans-using-usdc">Circle’s official website</a>, Circle has cooperated with local governments and <a href="https://www.chainnews.com/projects/airtm.htm">AirTM</a>, the financial platform to allocate funds to COVID-19 health care workers in South American countries, and this process is completed through USDC.<br>According to the <a href="https://www.chainnews.com/news/985851000440.htm">ChainNews</a>, the specific process can be simplified as follows: the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve released funds to Guaidó’s government account in a U.S. bank, the Guaidó government used these funds to mint USDC, and send them to Airtm, the Dollar-denominated blockchain payment platform, then distributed in the form of AirUSD to the accounts of Venezuelan medical staffs, who can withdraw to local bank accounts.</p> The UK Treasury Department will develop the stablecoin regulatory framework <p>In a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-sets-out-ambition-for-future-of-uk-financial-services">statement</a> issued by the UK Treasury Department on November 9, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sunak stated that after the UK leaves the European Union, the government’s attitude to financial services would be guided by the most productive and innovative industries. Financial Services in the UK should ‘leading the global dialogue on new technologies such as stablecoins and CBDC’, which will consolidate the leading position of the UK in the field of financial technology.<br>The statement mentioned that new technologies such as stablecoins might change the way people store and trade currencies, making payments cheaper and more convenient. To realize the potential value of stablecoins and manage the risks of consumers and financial stability, the government will propose regulatory measures for related stablecoin programs to ensure that they meet the minimum requirements for payment&nbsp;methods.</p> The BIS released a stablecoin report detailing risks, opportunities, and supervision <p>The BIS released <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work905.htm">a stablecoin report</a> on November 24-’Stablecoins: Risks, Opportunities, and Supervision’, detailing the potential role of stablecoins and their implications for regulation. The report outlined the market development of existing stablecoins and described their potential to embed powerful currency tools in the digital environment, and argued that stablecoins were designed to challenge existing e-commerce digital payment methods, including traditional bank payments, credit cards, and electronic wallets, etc. At the same time, stablecoins, especially the Libra project led by Facebook, also pose a challenge to the global financial system. The report analyzed and discussed the Libra project and related regulatory solutions, believed that the regulation of stablecoins should be based on the many conveniences it might provide, rather than being limited to the existing regulatory framework, and that the implementation of ‘embedded regulation’ could be considered, that is, directly embedding regulatory requirements into the implementation of a ‘global stablecoin’ system.</p> Tips <p>This is what we’re sharing in this MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report, welcome to stay tuned for follow-up crypto stablecoin reports.

<p>What a difference a year makes. At this point last year, who knew how the world would change in the face of a pandemic that would shift the way we conduct business and interact with loved ones and coworkers, alike. What we’ve seen in the digital identity space, though, is constant revolution and adaptation. With these breakthroughs and shifts in technology, insights and discoveries, along with consolidation, OWI has remained a valued source of information and aid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>With that in mind, OWI has also made sure its services shift to remain ahead of the changing digital identity landscape. As we build a nexus of insight and data for the entire industry, we also have developed a number of key ways to provide deeper access, resources, and networking.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of guidance across industries and markets focused on growth strategy and transaction services has become increasingly vital to digital identity, both now and into a post COVID-19 world. It’s with that realization that we developed the <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/sab-announcement/">Senior Advisory Board</a>, which includes a group of executives with decades of experience in the digital space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the board, we’ve also welcomed <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/team-member/tushyati-maudgalya/">Tushyati Maudgalya</a>, former business consultant at McKinsey and BCG, as Managing Director of our advisory services, and <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/team-member/justin-jarae/">Justin Jarae</a>, former Senior Solutions Architect and Business Automation Practice Lead at Red Hat, as Chief Technology Officer. These moves empower the advice and guidance we can provide both our customers and the industry at large. It’s also a strategy steeped in technology, as we seek to unify advisory services with technology tools to ensure guidance has the support and reliability modern organizations expect in all areas of the business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, one of the best ways to move the industry forward is by fostering growth among entrepreneurs and new talent. These leaders need three things: funding, access to data, and guidance. To tackle the funding challenges, we’ve partnered with OWI Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm focused solely on digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To meet the other two needs – information and guidance – OWI launched the <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/distil">Digital Identity Standards, Technology, and Innovation Lab (DISTIL)</a>. The DISTIL community will convene through groups, classes, and networking opportunities via our new Immersive Experience Lab, Startup Accelerator Program, Working Groups, and Roundtables. To kick DISTIL off, we will convene the first Startup Accelerator Program on April 5, 2021. Applications will open in January with selected entrepreneurs to meet for a 12-week program with OWI Ventures, which also provides them with access to a community of over 300 digital identity experts and proprietary information through the Immersive Experience Lab. The selected startups will receive funding through OWI Ventures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More information on how to sign up for this extraordinary opportunity, as well as details on the various aspects of DISTIL, will become available in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These, again, are all ways we will look to support our clients and industry moving forward. And as the next year comes, and certainly new surprises await, we will ensure we continue to shift no matter what lies ahead.&nbsp;</p>

   Cybernetix Is What Makes Things Move, From Production to Modern 5G Based Public Infrastructures 
<p></p>
<p>Cybernetix is not a new discipline. However, it appears being more important than ever before. It is ubiquitous when it comes to AI (Artificial Intelligence). And when AI meets industrial IoT (Internet of Things) and OT (Operational Technology) , it is about the cybernetic model. In contrast to past times, it is about hundreds of signals per second per thing, device, and machine, which needs to be processed and used for optimization. No way doing so without AI.</p>
<p>When looking at public infrastructures such as the ones making connected vehicles drive without (too many, too severe) accidents, when it comes to smart services (cities, utilities,…), it all is about immense amounts of signals that need to be delivered (5G) and stored (blockchains and beyond, e.g. IOTA), and processed (AI again).</p>
<p>All with security in mind, in the context of users and their settings, their consent, their preferences.</p>
<p>Fast and efficient, without too much of latency.</p>
<p>Cybernetix brings together all these technical evolutions that are discussed today.</p>
<p>In his talk, Martin Kuppinger will look at how all this is connected and why we need taking a broader perspective, beyond single innovations, towards what makes the modern world move: Cybernetix.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybernetixworld2020_2020_11_25_kuppinger"></a>

  <p>Congratulations. Your AI business case is crisp; you already have a data strategy in place; your proof-of-concept looks and feels great; you have the right talent to build the AI product or service which will push your organisation directly into the digital age. Sounds familiar? It is at this stage where most organisations give up on the AI initiatives due to lack of value creation. Why is that, one might ask? The business case was already locked, among other aspects, where's the problem at? One word: Production. AI products and services are notoriously different in terms of production than any other SW, and traditional workflows do not work anymore. This is what we are going to talk about. I will share my vision, blue print and personal stories across telecom, manufacturing and automotive industries, including both corporate and start-up experiences. I will tell you how to go from a shiny proof-of-concept to AI production systems, what challenges we faced, and the best practices to avoid the pitfalls.<br>Key takeaways: 1) Vision and strategy to create value out of AI - The last mile<br>2) How to go from a shiny proof-of-concept to AI production systems<br>3) AI production challenges and pitfalls<br>4) Multi-industry use cases across corporate and start-up ecosystems</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybernetixworld2020_2020_11_25_rafique"></a>

<p>PRESS RELEASE</p>
<p>November 18, 2020 <br>
Victoria, British Columbia—Plurilock Security Inc. (TSXV: PLUR) (“Plurilock” or the “Company”), an innovative cybersecurity company which provides frictionless and continuous authentication with machine learning and behavioral biometrics, today announced the launch of a new collaboration with prominent open source identity and access management (IAM) software vendor, Gluu, Inc.</p>
<p>In collaborating together, Plurilock will gain the ability to offer solutions which support Gluu’s cutting-edge IAM platform and Gluu gains the ability to offer Plurilock’s AI-driven invisible MFA and continuous authentication technologies.</p>

					 <p>In <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI), the securest way to share, issue, and verify credentials between two parties is to create a ‘connection‘ between them. When you create a connection, you create a secure, peer-to-peer communication channel between you and the other party. Through that communication channel, you can exchange credentials and messages to another party without the fear of man-in-the-middle or other attacks. To learn more about how connections in SSI work, check out our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/make-connections">documentation</a> on the subject.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this blog post, we will explain how to create connections in Trinsic Studio. Throughout the steps below, we will be referring to a fictitious person, Alice Smith, who is a recent graduate of Faber College and is applying for a job. Alice has <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">already received her digital diploma</a> in the form of a verifiable credential and is wanting to apply to work for a company called ACME Corp. In order to start the online job application, Alice must first make a connection with ACME Corp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow the steps below to learn how to create connections in Trinsic Studio!</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Sign up for a free Trinsic Studio account 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>To do so, go to <a href="https://trinsic.studio/">https://trinsic.studio/</a> and follow the instructions on the screen.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create an Organization 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Before Alice can create a connection with ACME Corp., ACME Corp. must exist as an Organization in Trinsic Studio. So let’s do that real quick!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Click on the “+Organization” button on the dashboard screen.  Create an Organization called ACME Corp. Feel free to upload a logo if you would like. For the Preferred Network drop-down, make sure you are on Sovrin Staging for this walkthrough. Click “Continue to Review”.  After making sure all the information is correct, click “Confirm”.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now that ACME Corp. is an Organization in Trinsic Studio, Alice can make a connection with it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create a connection 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>But in order for Alice to create a connection, ACME Corp. must first send Alice a connection invitation. Connection invitations are most commonly sent through QR codes or deep links. For our story, ACME Corp. might embed the QR code in Alice’s online job application or send her an email containing the code. Below are the steps that ACME Corp. would follow to create the connection invitation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  As ACME Corp. in Trinsic Studio, go to the “Connections” tab and click the “+ Invite Connection” button.  You should see a QR code appear in the panel. You can scan the QR code, send it via email to someone, or copy the URL.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now, as Alice:<br><br></p>  Download the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streetcred-identity-agent/id1475160728">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.streetcred.apps.mobile">Android</a>. Use the Trinsic Wallet to scan the QR code.  When the connection invitation shows up in the wallet, tap&nbsp;Accept. And the connection will be added to your wallet.  <p>Alice has now created a connection with ACME Corp. which she and ACME Corp. can use to securely share, issue, and verify credentials between each other as Alice fills out the job application.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					In the Trinsic Wallet, click the "Scan Code" button to scan a QR code.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					Once a connection invitation has been received, the user has the option to accept or reject the connection invitation.

<p>Ascertia, the company behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.signinghub.com/">SigningHub</a>&nbsp;(the e-document signing and management service) announced that the October 2020 release now supports Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) inclusion and display for signatures created by LEI-enabled Qualified Digital Certificates.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Where a certificate used for document signing has a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) set as an extension, the LEI information now appears in the signature verification dialog in SigningHub. The LEI information in the verification dialog also provides a link to the LEI information at the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).”<br>
Victoria Allen,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.signinghub.com/signinghub-v7.7.9-release">SigningHub v7.7.9 release announcement</a></p></blockquote>
<p>An example of an e-document signed by an LEI-enabled Qualified Digital Certificate. Clicking on the LEI Number allows the relying party to view the Legal Entity identity record at the Global LEI System public database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are LEIs? 
<p>LEIs are unique 20 digit codes representing an organisation’s identity. LEIs are validated by a small number of accredited LEI Issuers (like Ubisecure via our <a href="https://rapidlei.com">RapidLEI</a> service) and then centrally registered in the Global LEI System (GLEIS) database.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why does embedding an LEI matter? 
<p>The LEI is standardised across all jurisdictions. It is endorsed by the G20 and the Financial Stability Board and regulated by the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF). It is essentially the only truly standardised global organisation identifier.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for a legal entity to change its legal name or address, to go out of business, or to change ownership. Such changes need to be understood by parties relying on the identity information.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the LEI code is a live, permanent reference to an organisation’s identity record – a record that includes any historical changes to the identity data itself. LEI data is publicly available and a record of changes are maintained and freely accessible to all relying parties. The LEI ensures that any entity or service that has reliance on the record has the critical ability to see both currently validated identity data and review historical changes.</p>
<p>When embedded within a digital signature, thanks to the signature’s timestamp, the relying party has the ability to verify the signer’s organisation identity at the exact point the signature was created. Because the LEI record maintains a full history of changes, the relying party also has full traceability of the organisation from that point of signing onwards should there have been any changes to the LEI record.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The LEI record for UK-based “Ubisecure Limited” – including display of the current data and record change history such as change to legal names, addresses etc.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Digital Signature + Live Data + Historical Changes 
<p>The ability to combine live data with a historical reference offers traceability and visibility advantages over the static identity data usually embedded within digital certificates and digital signatures. When relying on such a system, being able to include a signature with live identity data and access to a history of changes is the equivalent to having your cake and eating it! The best of all worlds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to embed your LEI 
<p>To embed an organisation’s LEI into the signature, the enterprise must use an&nbsp;<a href="https://rapidlei.com/lei-marketplace/">LEI-enabled Qualified Digital Certificate</a>&nbsp;such as those issued by FirmaPro. Because both the LEI and the Certificate holder’s right to include the LEI is validated, the inclusion of the LEI in the document’s digital signatures further enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the document and its author. It also ensures signed documents meet the new European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) regulation for documents regulated by the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inclusion of LEIs in digital signatures is excellent news for users of SigningHub, as well as anyone relying on the signatures a SigningHub user has embedded into their document.</p>

<p>By Wafa-Ben Hassine, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>I believe it can. And it must. As a human rights attorney, I come at this issue thinking about people&nbsp;first.</p><p>Whether its messaging a family member asking them to bring home a loaf of bread, or discussing next year’s business strategy with a colleague, secure encryption ensures we can have private conversations and guarantees the integrity of our communication. Users’ quick adoption of encrypted, private messaging speaks volumes of its importance: billions of users worldwide use encrypted messaging on a daily basis as an indispensable tool in their livelihoods.</p><p>While the examples above are innocuous, we know that encrypted messaging platforms can also be used for more nefarious purposes. And with these platforms’ breadth, reach, and the undetectable nature of the content of conversations, we are deeply concerned about the harms that their deployment creates. Examples include <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44856910">lynch mobs in India</a>, <a href="https://mediaengagement.org/research/encrypted-propaganda/">widespread disinformation</a> on the coronavirus pandemic in Mexico and the US, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/whatsapp-skewed-brazilian-election-showing-social-medias-danger-to-democracy">swaying election results</a> in Brazil, facilitating global <a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2019/9/13/20863489/encryption-stanford-conference-facebook-ncmec-ghq">child abuse</a>, and providing white supremacists the channels needed to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/karstenschmehl/whatsapp-groups-nazi-symbol-stickers-germany">spread Nazi propaganda</a> in Germany and the&nbsp;US.</p><p>But we can’t just blame encryption for these harms. Encryption is universally regarded as a <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&amp;id=p::usmarcdef_0000246527&amp;file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_832e8e2a-88a0-4df2-a332-c945a30d9f8f%3F_%3D246527eng.pdf&amp;locale=en&amp;multi=true&amp;ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000246527/PDF/246527eng.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A145%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C0%5D">prerequisite for the exercise of rights</a> like freedom of expression, and freedom to privacy online. It is a means to a fundamental end. With the Internet increasingly permeating every aspect of our lives, encryption is a technology that will not and should not go away anytime soon. Health and financial institutions also utilize encryption to ensure that individuals’ personal information is safe from identity theft and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>We need to disrupt the status quo that materially benefits the large tech companies that provide these platforms (often for free), who then turn a blind eye to the harms they can cause. Researchers, civil society groups, and governments should be able to have select information on how the technology is operated and used — e.g. market sizes based on geography, metadata about how information travels, peak use and dynamics, etc. — all appropriately aggregated so as to protect individual privacy — so they can better understand the nature, type and impact of these harms, and ultimately, help propose ways to fix them. And tech platforms who provide these services should be ultimately accountable for ensuring their safety and&nbsp;quality.</p><p>I joined Omidyar Network to lead and support the type of work that can change that status quo. Our goal is to work with our partners to advance a robust, evidence-driven, and sensible public conversation that ensures encrypted messaging is safe, trustworthy, inclusive, and doesn’t sacrifice encryption and privacy. One that, based on my professional background, respects and upholds human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>To do that, we must start by envisioning the kind of messaging we want to see. The debate around whether we should, or should not encrypt, is a non-starter. Instead, we should ask: What kind of information do researchers need to help understand and prevent some of the issues we see? What pressure points can we identify to tilt the balance with policymakers? What does accountability look like in an encrypted ecosystem that in some instances, verifiably led to rampant organized disinformation and propaganda campaigns? What can different stakeholders do to stop the exploitation of technological gains benefitting privacy?</p><p>Answers to these questions will help us collectively conceive of more effective ways to mitigate any harmful byproducts of private, secure messaging, and begin to truly enjoy all that it has to&nbsp;offer.</p><p>As social activist and author Alice Walker said: “Look closely at the present you are constructing: it should look like the future you are dreaming.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/can-encrypted-messaging-be-safe-inclusive-and-respect-human-rights-f8ad28e53443">Can Encrypted Messaging Be Safe, Inclusive, and Respect Human Rights?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/">CIOs and IT leaders</a> now enjoy a deeper, two-way relationship with the business as a result of the changing business needs spurred by COVID-19. They are educating senior stakeholders on the value of IT, especially during times of crisis, and assuming leadership of higher-impact initiatives.</p>
<p>On the flip side, business leaders are also assuming more accountability for IT projects. The enterprise’s path to the future runs through IT, and boards and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-ways-cios-can-help-ceos-restore-growth/">CEOs </a>know it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of applications depends on the collaboration between IT and business units</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These new realities illustrate how traditional boundaries between business and IT are becoming increasingly blurred. After all, a composable enterprise is only possible when business capabilities are assembled and combined to meet changing business needs.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>This is especially true among application leaders: The future of applications depends on the collaboration between IT and business units.</p>
<p>As business leadership takes a more strategic role in sourcing, procuring, implementing, delivering and maintaining applications, application leaders must look to adopt a new, strategic approach to vision and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/future-proof-application-strategy/">strategy </a>that involves delivering a composable enterprise.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable/">The Future of Business Is Composable&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>A new Gartner survey reveals that most companies planning for the future of applications and composable enterprise are choosing to increase, rather than decrease, collaboration between central IT teams and lines of business (LOBs). This trend is further amplified by COVID-19 despite its financial and disruptive impact.</p>
<p>Here are three key take-aways for application leaders.</p>
 Collaboration between IT and business is instrumental to successful application delivery 
<p>Companies that succeed in digital business are rethinking the way they operate. Gartner research shows that effective organizations have set up “fusion teams” — multidisciplinary teams that blend technology and other types of domain expertise that are often designed to deliver products rather than projects.</p>
<p>This trend is consistent within application delivery, specifically, with 93% of survey respondents reporting moderate to comprehensive collaboration between central IT and other LOBs. Distributed, simultaneous digital business initiatives with broad-based involvement from both IT and LOBs yield better results than centralized, sequential approaches.</p>
<p>Fuse business and IT teams so that they have shared accountability for business outcomes by tying incentives and performance metrics to joint success criteria. Bring business-led IT out of the shadows by offering tiered engagement options for business partners who want to pursue their own technology initiatives. Taken together, these steps will accelerate digital business transformation.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/covid-19-accelerates-digital-strategy-initiatives/">COVID-19 Accelerates Digital Strategy Initiatives&nbsp;</a></p>
 Security, technology and integration are barriers to IT-business collaboration on application delivery 
<p>Even though IT-business collaboration is a growing and unstoppable force, it is not without its challenges. According to the survey results, security, technology and integration are the top three barriers to collaborations between LOBs and IT on application delivery.</p>
<p>“The increasing replacement of operational technology infrastructure with IT systems is opening new vulnerabilities and risks,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/56819">Saniye Alaybeyi</a>, Sr Director Analyst, Gartner. “As remote, cross-functional work rises, so too does the use of collaboration technology, which is not always met with employee satisfaction.”</p>
<p>Suggested recommendations for application leaders to tackle each barrier include:</p>
 
 Security: Create a single security governance structure to support both IT and LOB domains, and balance their requirements. 
 Technology: Address deployment challenges to ensure better visibility and connectivity between employees. 
 Integration: Address integration challenges using the most suitable integration products, including but not limited to enterprise service bus (ESB), integration <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/information-platform-as-a-service-ipaas">platform as a service (iPaaS)</a> and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/robotic-process-automation-rpa">robotic process automation (RPA).</a> 
 
 COVID-19 is likely to increase IT-business collaboration 
<p>The strength of IT’s connections with LOB stakeholders and the capacity for innovation with new solutions are fundamental to the reactivation of the economy, and indeed for the survival of many organizations during and after COVID-19.</p>
<p>A significant number of respondents (64%) indicate that IT leaders are collaborating more with their LOB counterparts during the COVID-19 crisis. In contrast, only 20% of respondents indicate they are experiencing or expect to experience reduced IT-business collaboration.</p>
<p>Gartner recommends leveraging the closeness that COVID-19 is driving. Continued digital transformation is best accomplished when technical and business values are considered together.</p>
<p>“The success of the future of applications depends on organizations’ ability to bring business and IT together for collaborative and continuous creative work,” says Alaybeyi.</p>

<p>As
we transition further into the digital age, new digital tools are being piloted
to improve the interaction of citizens with their state. Where digitalisation
enables greater transparency for citizens, it also allows for better democratic
accountability. In our ongoing series on how technology could be used to make the state more efficient and more
democratic, in this session we looked at what has happened to the promise of
blockchain and the state. </p>



<p>Our
first speaker, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkossow/">Niklas
Kossow</a>, had
just submitted his doctoral thesis at the Hertie School in Berlin on the use of
digital technology in the fight against corruption. He looked in particular at
civil society efforts in Ukraine to digitise public procurement.</p>



<p>Niklas shared with us his
research findings on the question: “Digital tools in the fight against
corruption – can DLT help to lower corruption risks?”</p>



<p>Strategies on how to fight
corruption have been developed around the world. Among them, the digitalisation
of public administration has gained increasing popularity in recent years. This
approach is seen as a means to decrease the discretion of civil servants over
public funds and to increase transparency and data availability to support
public oversight. </p>



<p>In recent years, distributed
ledger technology has also sparked some hope in this context. With its emphasis
on transparency and accountability it was hoped DLT could become a widespread
anti-corruption technology. The reality, however, seems to be a bit more
nuanced: DLT can be used to lower corruption risks, but only in specific
contexts and when embedded in a wider anti-corruption strategy, was the
conclusion from Niklas’ research.</p>



<p>Moving from the Ukraine and
Germany, we then had a conversation with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolfrauschenbach/">Rolf Rauschenbach</a> &nbsp;from <a href="https://procivis.ch/">Procivis AG</a>, who is the co-author of a study just completed for the Canton of
Zurich on the use of blockchain technology and public administration in
Switzerland. </p>



<p>These are some of the issues
we discussed: How it came about that this study was commissioned, how the study
was structured and what its main findings were.</p>



<p>One chapter in the study
contained a summary of all existing government-related blockchain pilot
projects in Switzerland, representing a valuable snapshot of projects. Another
chapter approached the topic of blockchain and the state from a political
philosophy/political theory point of view. That chapter suggested that
blockchain and the theory of the ideal state were not compatible. Since we do
not live in the realm of the ideal or imaginary state, though, the study
proposed four areas where blockchain might still be of use to an efficient,
democratic state. </p>

<p>With the holiday season in full swing, many are traveling to spend it with family and friends – despite the continued rise in COVID-19 cases. This trend led OWI to analyze how COVID-driven individual identity initiatives have changed the identification processes for air travel passengers and what the lasting effect on the travel industry may be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Covid Takes a Toll 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The travel industry is one of the areas most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significantly lower number of travelers due to travel restrictions and general fear of overexposure to the virus. During the Monday and Sunday of the Thanksgiving holiday week, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/thanksgiving-air-travel-rises-to-pandemic-high-but-still-less-than-half-of-last-years-levels.html">1 million people</a>, which was the highest number since March 16 and 40 percent lower than the number of travelers during last year’s Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To travel safely, travelers should aim to minimize contact between different parties and the time spent in crowds. Travelers need to exchange information when they check-in, go through security, enter lounges, and purchase items inside the airport. Implementing a holistic digital identity for travelers, airlines, airport operators, and government agencies can make the journey more seamless, efficient, and secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Identity Takes Flight&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first implementation of a digital identity solution for travelers was electronic boarding passes, which have been successful due to the high adoption of mobile phones. An&nbsp;<a href="https://airlines.iata.org/sites/default/files/DAY%202.FINAL-6.pdf">IATA study</a>&nbsp;showed that 74 percent of passengers in 2017 used an electronic boarding pass on a smartphone. Furthermore, over the past years, there has been an increase in self-check-in solutions, minimizing interactions between travelers. By utilizing each of these solutions, travelers can have a check-in and pre-flight experience that’s nearly contact-free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second implementation of digital identity, which has not yet been widely adopted, is a digital ID. While travelers can use their mobile phones for their boarding passes, they must use a physical form of ID to verify their identity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Eighty-two percent of respondents in the same IATA study stated that they would be willing to use a digital passport in lieu of their current paper passport.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Need for Speed, Safety &amp; Spending 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, TSA serviced over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202008/tsa-to-stand-up-airport-digital-id-app-as-aviation-sector-deploys-biometrics-and-temperature-checks">2.5 million travelers</a>&nbsp;each day on average, and roughly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202008/tsa-to-stand-up-airport-digital-id-app-as-aviation-sector-deploys-biometrics-and-temperature-checks">600 people</a> were found without an acceptable form of ID. While manual checks are currently leveraged, this method can result in human error in an area that needs to provide the highest security possible. With a holistic digital identity solution, travelers can have a more seamless experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first digital identity solution for airport security was implemented by CLEAR, which provides identity verification and security checks with the implementation of their proprietary machines. Currently, there are other digital identity solutions in testing, such as the one provided by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/11/lufthansa-launches-star-alliance-biometrics/">Lufthansa</a>, which allows travelers to enroll their biometrics in an app and create a digital identity. With this app, travelers can pass through security checkpoints and boarding gates without removing their masks, creating a safe experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>American Airlines, Delta, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idemia.com/press-release/idemia-and-resa-airport-data-systems-were-chosen-vinci-airports-come-world-first-wholly-contactless-and-biometrics-based-passenger-experience-lyon-saint-exupery-airport-2020-10-05">IDEMIA</a>&nbsp;are also working to implement an interoperable biometric identity and identification platform for travelers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202011/delta-pilots-digital-id-in-detroit-cbp-biometric-arrival-expands-to-houston">In collaboration with the TSA</a>, Delta launched a new biometric identification program for domestic travelers that matches facial recognition with a digital ID using the traveler’s passport number and TSA PreCheck membership.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nfcw.com/2020/11/02/368994/american-airlines-pilots-mobile-digital-identity-system/">American Airlines</a>&nbsp;is trying to implement a Digital ID with the collaboration of <a href="http://airsidemobile.com">Airside</a>. Both initiatives are currently being put in specific locations and are available to travelers who create an account registering their biometrics and face-ID. In addition,&nbsp;<a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/11/27/covid-19-travel-airlines-hope-new-digital-health-passport-app-will-revive-international-travel/">IATA announced</a>&nbsp;the development of a health passport called “Travel Pass”, for travelers to record their PCR test results for countries require this information for entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, using both a digital identity and a digital boarding pass provides a seamless experience and reduces friction. Going through the TSA security lines at airports can be a burden for travelers as these lines are usually long, slow, and crowded. The average wait time for standard lanes is 30 minutes, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2019/01/15/tsa-statement-checkpoint-operations-january-15#:~:text=For%20questions%20about%20terminal%20closings,longer%20than%20usual%20wait%20times.">TSA</a>. These long wait times not only negatively affect travelers but also result in lost revenue for airports. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A study by NEC showed that an extra 10 minutes in security reduces average passenger retail spending in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nec.com/en/global/solutions/safety/resourcecenter/pdf/digital_identity.pdf">US airports by 30</a>&nbsp;percent. </p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering that customers need to verify themselves when purchasing items at the airport or entering lounges, the actual percentage could be even higher. These digital identity initiatives can reduce the amount of time that travelers are exposed to large crowds and maximize passenger retail spending.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 The OWI Analyst Take 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advent of COVID-19 has encouraged governments and private entities to push forward biometric-based digital identity products that consumers can leverage for frictionless travel. These are incredibly nascent — emerging just over the past few months and set to launch into the future — but OWI believes this to indicate an intersection between the growing ubiquity of mobile identity across all verticals, as well as the growth in enterprise adoption of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acuant.com/blog/the-face-of-travel-today-smart-airports-biometrics-epassports-and-defining-a-secure-identity-token/">different authentication modalities</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, OWI anticipates that as this trend persists — namely, as travelers digitize more and more of their touchpoints across the travel lifecycle — airports and airlines might benefit immensely from an ability to aggregate and analyze these new data trails, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iata.org/contentassets/c1258b62226b43a0a0f46ce27daf820b/ai-lab-ads18.pdf">improved machine learning capabilities for Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) channels</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 The GiD Report#137 — Video and Groups rule the roost post-COVID <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-136-apples-app-store-concession-filecoin-on-the-up-and-up-c94961d2a0fd">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Hope everyone in the U.S. had a nice Thanksgiving!</p><p>What we have this&nbsp;week:</p>  Understanding rumors of crypto wallet regulation +&nbsp;identity  COVID creds take center stage once&nbsp;again  Video and Groups are the 2 most important features in a post-COVID world  Stuff happens   1. The big news right before the holiday was a series of tweets by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on rumors of impending legislation from the Trump administration regarding crypto wallets and identity. <p>Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1331744884856741888?s=20">the tweetstorm</a>:</p><blockquote>Last week we heard rumors that the U.S. Treasury and Secretary Mnuchin were planning to rush out some new regulation regarding self-hosted crypto wallets before the end of his term. I’m concerned that this would have unintended side effects, and wanted to share those concerns.</blockquote><blockquote>For those who don’t know — self-hosted crypto wallets (also known as non-custodial wallets or self-custody wallets) are a type of software that lets individuals store and use their own cryptocurrency, instead of needing to rely on a third party financial institution.</blockquote><blockquote>Self-hosted crypto wallets are important, because they allow anyone to use this new technology to access basic financial services — just like anyone can use a computer or smartphone to access the open internet.</blockquote><blockquote>The open nature of cryptocurrency is what makes it a powerful tool for innovation, and it is what levels the playing field globally. It is what is fueling innovation, such as in Defi. It has the potential to bring down the cost of financial services, and improve accessibility.</blockquote><blockquote>This proposed regulation would, we think, require financial institutions like Coinbase to verify the recipient/owner of the self-hosted wallet, collecting identifying information on that party, before a withdrawal could be sent to that self-hosted wallet.</blockquote><p>Armstrong goes on to <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1331745196887867393">offer a bunch of arguments</a> as to why these rumored regulations would be damaging to the industry — outlining issues everywhere from merchant processing to&nbsp;defi.</p><p>From the regulator’s perspective, you can understand their intention. KYC and identity parameters are instrumental in the fight against issues like money laundering and terrorist financing. The concern is that these rules are being rushed through. As always, there is always the risk that well-intentioned regulations can have the unintended consequence of stymieing a virant, innovative and open&nbsp;system.</p><p>The big picture, however, is that such concerns will eventually need to be addressed in a smart way — one that effectively deals with malicious activity while preserving innovation and openness.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-regulations-industry-pros">Industry Pros Weigh In on Rumors of New Crypto Wallet Regs — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-ceo-trump-administration-may-rush-out-burdensome-crypto-wallet-rules">Coinbase CEO: Trump Administration May ‘Rush Out’ Burdensome Crypto Wallet Rules — CoinDesk</a>   2. With multiple vaccines on the way, the issue of COVID credentials is again taking centerstage. <p>The latest news is that anyone flying Qantas Airlines will <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-55048438">need to be vaccinated, according to chief Alan&nbsp;Joyce</a>.</p><p>It’s another topic that’s become heated in recent times for similar reasons to the one we addressed above. Ultimately, this is about finding smart approaches so that we can preserve individual rights to privacy and sovereignty while ensuring health and&nbsp;safety.</p><p>What’s super cool is that we have the means and the technology to achieve that now and there will be a big opportunity in 2021 to start flipping that narrative with new approaches (as many of the current critiques are based on the status&nbsp;quo).</p><p>It’s maybe no surprise that China is again taking the lead in this regard (like they are with central bank digital currencies). The Chinese Communist Party is uniquely positioned given the power they have over their populace and also differing value&nbsp;systems.</p><p>For other governments to follow, it also becomes a case of implementing new digital approaches without “becoming China.”</p><p>Here’s the latest, via Vadim — <a href="https://chengdu-expat.com/health-code-guidelines-for-chinas-major-cities/">a required app for travel within&nbsp;China</a>:</p><blockquote>Whilst COVID-19 is not longer a BIG risk in China, you still often need a city’s specific health code if you plan to travel in China. Here’s the health code guide for you to go to these locations in China:If your health code is Ok, traveling to these cities shouldn’t be a problem for you to visit. However, we do recommend you to check with your hotel in advance, as some restrict foreigners, and others (especially in smaller cities) require a recent COVID&nbsp;test.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>The Health Kit (Jiankang Bao) mini-program is now online! Foreign nationals may find the mini-program by typing in “Health Kit” in the WeChat or Alipay search bar and check your registered health status. The Health Kit serves as a reference for assessing your fitness for going back to work, entering/exiting public places, and other situations concerning COVID-19 prevention and&nbsp;control.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-55048438">Covid: Vaccination will be required to fly, says Qantas&nbsp;chief</a>  <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/527315-airlines-discussing-requiring-proof-of-covid-19-vaccination-for-air-travel">Airlines discussing requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for passengers: report</a>  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55039662">Covid-19: China pushes for QR code based global travel&nbsp;system</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/vs">/vs</a>— <a href="https://chengdu-expat.com/health-code-guidelines-for-chinas-major-cities/">Health Code Guidelines for China’s Major Cities | Chengdu-Expat.com</a>   3. The potential acquisition of Slack shows the importance of video and Groups post-COVID. Photo: Anna&nbsp;Schvets<p>Slack went public not too long ago but now might be getting swallowed up by Salesforce. The main reason? No&nbsp;video.</p><p>Here’s the&nbsp;WSJ:</p><blockquote>Microsoft has become a greater-than-anticipated threat to Slack, said Rishi Jaluria, an analyst for investment research firm D.A. Davidson &amp; Co. Slack, he said, “may be a little more vulnerable than we’d have expected since the pandemic.”</blockquote><blockquote>It didn’t have to be that way. Slack worked to add video features to its chat-based collaboration tool for years, acquiring Screenhero, a startup with a screen-sharing app, in&nbsp;2015.</blockquote><blockquote>Adding video features to Slack’s app proved difficult, said Jahanzeb Sherwani, Screenhero’s former chief executive, who left Slack in 2018. It took more than a year for the small team to launch the voice and video chat feature, much longer than the original estimate, he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>Slack launched video calling toward the end of 2016, and screen sharing became available in mid-2017, features that made up “Slack calls.” Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual&nbsp;meeting.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s not controversial to say that Slack calls wasn’t a top priority,” said Mr. Sherwani, who now has a new collaboration-tech startup, Screen&nbsp;Inc.</blockquote><p>Of course, one community app that’s shone despite the lack of video is Discord. The difference? Discord’s voice + groups feature makes it truly unique especially in a time when creating that more casual sense of hanging out comes at a premium with everyone locked&nbsp;down.</p><p>All of which gives you the sense that video and Groups are the two most important features in a post-COVID world.</p><p>Which brings us to the age old question.</p><p>Why not&nbsp;both?</p><p>BONUS:</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/slack-missed-out-on-the-pandemics-zoom-boom-leaving-it-vulnerable-11606478401">Slack Missed Out on the Pandemic’s Zoom Boom, Leaving It Vulnerable</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-addiction-bubble-b39a3693-6919-426e-b8d3-d8bf9644e0a4.html">The Facebook “addiction” label may blind us to actual solutions to social-media problems</a>   4.

<p>An article written by J Cromack, Managing Director at&nbsp;<a href="https://mylifedigital.co.uk/about-us/">MyLife Digital</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>Last Thursday I was part of a really interesting panel discussion at <a href="https://www.pro-manchester.co.uk/event/bee-more-the-creative-digital-conference-for-2020/">BEE More – The Creative &amp; Digital Conference for 2020,</a> organised by <a href="https://www.pro-manchester.co.uk/">pro-manchester.</a></p>



<p>We were discussing the pros and cons, opportunities, and threats of targeted marketing. Reflecting on our discussion I have pulled together the following thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The challenge for today’s marketer is really difficult.&nbsp; We live in a conflicting world where we expect organisations to send us information relevant to us but feel dissatisfied when we get bombarded with marketing communications at the wrong time.&nbsp; When we view applications such as Facebook to know what’s happening, stay in touch or use it as a business tool, we feel our privacy has been invaded when adverts pop up about something we only searched for on Google a few moments before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We live in a world where personal data has been misused, sold without our permission or just not looked after in the way we think it should be and with that comes a lack of trust that organisations are doing the right thing with our data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>80% of European consumers regardless of their age, are worried about sharing their data and many are not even aware why so much personal data is needed when logging onto things like websites, Wi-Fi, and applications. Well publicised breaches such as Cambridge Analytica via The Great Hack and programmes like the Social Dilemma have only enhanced consumer fears.</p>



<p>This is making us consumers savvier – 88% of people claim that transparency about how their data is collected and used is important when sharing their information with a company.</p>



<p>On the flip side, as individuals we want personalisation, we want to be empowered to choose when our data is used, how it is used, who it is shared with, and gain value in return. We want to be marketed to at the right time, in the right channel with products and services that interest us. To provide this level of personalisation, organisations need to collect more personal data and preferences about us. &nbsp; We want the best of both worlds, but organisations need to be held accountable to get the balance right when using our data. At MyLife Digital we call this state the Privacy Paradox. This is where data ethics come into play, to get that balance right. Data ethics is a hot topic currently as big brands and businesses begin to understand the murky, opaque world that exists across many technologies and platforms that process billions of data points every day relating to people’s data and sometimes their innermost secrets.</p>



<p>A really interesting quote from the recent Data Ethics – The Rise of Morality in Technology report by the World Federation of Advertisers stated; ‘While it may not be a silver bullet, data ethics is of strategic significance because it can help to build trust. Ethics is now three times more important to company trust than competence, and trusted companies grow faster. Europanel data confirms that trust and share move together: an increase of 1% in brand trust translates to 3% growth in value, with top tier brands growing faster in market penetration and volume share.</p>



<p>Personalisation is key to help brands and businesses deliver growth, but if the wrong assumptions and inferences are made based on segmentations then trust can be eroded, rather than loyalty built.</p>



<p>A great quote from Jane Wakely, Lead CMO at Mars, from the same report, highlights how seriously brands are starting to consider data ethics when it comes to using individual’s data to deliver more targeted ads and better experiences, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Any conversation around data needs to be human-centric, and for advertisers and marketers, it must have consumers at the heart. How we use data in these next few years will undoubtedly shape our future, and this power must be harnessed responsibly and legally. As a purpose-driven company whose Five Principles have guided our decisions for over a century, we know these values must apply to every facet of our business – that includes using data responsibly and grounding our relationships with consumers in transparency and trust.”</p>



<p>Action is already being taken and we will be moving away from tracker cookies/3rd party cookies as the main browsers will be blocking them and this will be a good start, but the cynic in me can’t help think the only players who will win from this is GAFA! &nbsp; New ethical solutions will be required and the team at MyLife Digital have a number of trust and value-enhancing solutions ready to go – just ask if you’d like more information.</p>



<p>Personalisation is important, but brands need to get the balance right by being more transparent and providing simple tools to empower consumers to make decisions about how their data can be used and even enrich it by stating their preferences – but just don’t ask for it all on day one, do it progressively and build that trust. </p>

<p>Discord is increasingly being used by a number of developer communities. New community server and announce channels are an opportunity for us to share interesting developer content.</p><p>Fission has already upgraded to being a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server">Community Server</a>. This means we get a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043913591">Welcome screen</a> with recommended channels, along with a few other features. </p><p>Here's Fission's Welcome screen:</p>Screenshot from the edit mode of Fission's Discord Welcome Screen<p>You can check out the <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Fission emoji filled server here »</a></p><blockquote>By the way, on the general topic of tools for developer communities, the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/slack-vs-discord-vs-discourse-the-best-tool-for-your-community-orbit-blog-may-2020/654">Orbit team wrote about Slack vs Discord vs Discourse</a> back in May. Fission uses Discord (obviously), but specifically we also use it for our private internal company discussions. And we have a <a href="https://talk.fission.codes">Discourse forum</a> that we use the same way, for both public community and internal communications.</blockquote> Announcement Channels <p>But the new thing for inter-connecting people are <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192">Announcement Channels</a>: you can post updates in your server to a special channel, which other people can "follow" so that the content automatically posts into their server channels.</p><p>Here's what the Fission announcements channel looks like, with a "follow" button at the top:</p>Here's the link to our <a href="https://discord.gg/JNg3McC6Ew">#fission-announce</a> channel<p>We've been posting about once per week, around new content, new releases, and upcoming events.</p><p>On the "follower" side, you can have the posts by published into a channel of your choosing. This could be a single "subscriptions" channel, or a dedicated #fission-is-cool channel, and it can be public or members only. You can also read the background on <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028384531-Channel-Following-FAQ">how to follow channels</a> (you'll need to be an admin on a server for this).</p> Share your announce channels: awesome-discord-announce <p>We've created the beginnings of an awesome-list on Github, <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/awesome-discord-announce">awesome-discord-announce</a>.</p><p>If you have a Discord server with an announce channel that covers technical topics – add it to the list!</p><p>And, as a thank you to Sindre Sorhus, creator of the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/">original Awesome list</a>, Fission has signed up to <a href="https://patreon.com/sindresorhus">support him on Patreon</a>.

					  Köln und Weinheim 30.11.2020. Wir haben es geschafft! ILG Accelerator Batch#20: Mission Completed. <p>Schöner kann man es wirklich nicht sagen  Alle im comuny Team sind stolz und voller Freude, dass wir dabei waren. Auserwählt, durchgewalkt, groß gemacht: Was war das für eine coole Reise in den letzten Monaten mit dem Team vom <a href="https://insurlab-germany.com/">InsurLab Germany</a>, den Corporates und den Mentoren und Coaches dort. Wir haben Corona getrotzt! Wir hatten Spaß! Und wir haben viel gelernt.</p><p>Gestartet im ersten Lockdown im April, als alles losging, und wir uns alle nicht kannten, geendet im zweiten Lockdown Ende November. Man muss schon verrückt genug sein und lieben, was man tut. An beidem mangelt es uns nicht.</p><p>Seitdem: Unzählige Stunden in Coachings, in Workshops, miteinander vor den Laptops gesessen und gesprochen, diskutiert, intensiv gearbeitet, uns gegenseitig Feedback gegeben, Insights über die Versicherungsbranche gewonnen und unzählige Ratschläge bekommen, wie wir unser Geschäft noch erfolgreicher aufstellen. Denn nicht nur die Versicherer beobachten in diesem Accelerator die vielversprechendsten Startups der Szene. comuny hatte sich Anfang 2020 aus über 100 Startups in einer internationalen Auslese unter die letzten 17 gepitcht. Jetzt sind wir sind ready!</p><p>Wir haben einen weiteren spannenden Sprung hingelegt und sagen dem ganzen Team des InsurLab Germany ein herzliches Dankeschön für eure super Unterstützung! Unser Dank geht außerdem an unseren persönlichen Mentor, Dr. Gunther Schwarz, geschäftsführender Gesellschafter Bernotat &amp; Cie und Mitgründer InsurLab Germany e.V., es war uns eine große Freude mit dir, danke für alles.</p><p>#insuringdigitalhealth #ehealth #comuny #eIdentität #MyDataOperator #NewDataEconomy #NewGovernance #event #future-of-trust</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zur <a href="https://insurlab-germany.com/de/batch-20/">Liste der Startups im Batch</a></p><p><a href="https://insurlab-germany.com/de/ueber-uns/">Informationen über das InsurLab Germany und das Accelerator Programm</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>

 A grants DAO curated by the Ocean community, for growth &amp; long-term sustainability  Introduction <p>Hello Oceaners!</p><p>Ocean has been following a journey to full decentralization since its inception several years ago. We’re pleased to announce a key piece of that puzzle: community-led funding in the form of a grants DAO that we call <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki">OceanDAO</a>. It closes the loop on a “snowball effect” feedback cycle where the health of OCEAN and the Ocean ecosystem rises as the usage of Ocean goes up. We call this the “Web3 Sustainability Loop”; <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">this blog post</a> has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Today we’re pleased to announce the release of OceanDAO, and its first funding&nbsp;cycle.</p><blockquote>OceanDAO is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community.</blockquote><p>OceanDAO is a great way to get involved:</p>  As a project: If you’re looking for funding to build something, do outreach, or unlock&nbsp;data  As a curator: If you’re an OCEAN holder &amp; want to help steer the future of Ocean, you can make an impact by learning about proposals and&nbsp;voting.   Highlights <p>OceanDAO Funding Round 1 has these actions and&nbsp;dates:</p><p>🐡 Project proposals — post a proposal following <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Grant-Proposal-Template">this template</a>, to <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/">OceanDAO Discourse</a>.</p>  Proposals open on November 30th at 12:00 pm&nbsp;GMT  Proposals deadline on December 14th at 23:59&nbsp;GMT  <p>🐟 Discussion — at <a href="https://discord.gg/uvyQFWGBn8">OceanDAO Discord</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Town-Hall">Town&nbsp;Halls</a></p><p>🐬 Voting — vote on <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Snapshot</a>. 1 OCEAN = 1&nbsp;vote.</p>  Voting opens December 15th at 12:00 pm&nbsp;GMT  Voting ends December 21st at 23:59&nbsp;GMT  <p>🐙 Grants — Each winning project will receive 10000 OCEAN from OceanDAO. There will be 5 winners: the top 5 highest voted proposals.</p>  Funds will be disbursed to grantees within 24 hours after voting&nbsp;ends.   Future Funding&nbsp;Rounds <p>OceanDAO future Funding Rounds 2, 3, 4 etc are planned monthly, starting in February&nbsp;2021:</p>  Project proposals — due by 23:59 GMT on the 1st day of the&nbsp;month.  Voting — closes 23:59 GMT on 4th day of the&nbsp;month.  Funding — funds will be disbursed within 24 hours after voting&nbsp;ends.  There may be variations in: amount of funding, # teams funded, and action steps themselves.  <p>The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki">OceanDAO wiki</a> has the links and up-to-date information you will need, to participate as a project team member or as a community curator.</p> Project Types <p>OceanDAO funding is for projects of these&nbsp;types:</p>  Build / improve applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Outreach / community (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleash data  Build / improve core Ocean&nbsp;software   Project Criteria <p>When proposing a project, these are the two criteria to keep in consideration: (1) ROI towards growth (2) aligned with Ocean mission. Projects that fail (2) will not be considered for voting. Once voting opens, only criterion (1) remains. Let’s elaborate!</p><p>Criterion (1). On average, value added to the Ocean ecosystem must exceed the grant value&nbsp;spent.</p>  That is, the average “return on investment” (ROI) must be &gt; 1.0. Value added by a project is hard to know in advance. Some will fail; others will succeed and bring 10x value. But this must hold true on average across projects.  Motivation: We want a “snowball effect” for ecosystem growth, where more funds granted leads to more funds available for grants in the future. This will happen with more network revenue or a rise in&nbsp;OCEAN.  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/On-ROI">This page</a> has more information on Expected&nbsp;ROI.  <p>Criterion (2). The project must help to promote the Ocean’s mission &amp; values (or at least not work against&nbsp;them).</p>  Mission &amp; values. Ocean’s mission is to equalize the opportunity for people to access data. Ocean’s values, and further details, are&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">here</a>.   Minimum Proposal Requirements <p>Anyone can propose a project to OceanDAO. However, to be considered, you must have at least 5,000 OCEAN in the same Ethereum wallet as listed in your proposal by the time the proposal process ends (December 14th, 23:59 pm GMT). If selected for a grant, this will be the same wallet where you will receive your grant funding. This helps to filter towards people with a vested interest or “skin in the game” in OCEAN — that is, Ocean community members. Ocean Protocol team members will&nbsp;verify.</p> Discussion Venues <p>There are two main venues for discussion: text chat-based at Discord, and videochat Town&nbsp;Halls.</p><p>Discord: Navigate to the Ocean Protocol Discord and join the <a href="https://discord.gg/uvyQFWGBn8">OceanDAO channel</a>. Here we welcome all conversation and questions OceanDAO&nbsp;related.</p><p>Town Halls [<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Town-Hall">Link</a>]. These are regular videochat events among community members, open to all. It’s a great place to get to know the community. Here you can ask questions, share proposal feedback, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>The first Town Hall is Wednesday, Dec 2 at 16:00&nbsp;GMT.</p><p>See the Town Hall page for information on future&nbsp;calls.</p> Voting: Details <p>Voting will take place on: <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">vote.oceanprotocol.com</a></p> Implementation   At proposal deadline (December 14th at 23:59 pm GMT), Proposals that meet the “Minimum Proposal Requirements” and “Project Criteria” will be migrated to the <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">OceanDAO Voting&nbsp;Page</a>.  Vote with your OCEAN Tokens. 1 OCEAN = 1&nbsp;vote.  In order for your vote to count, you must have the OCEAN already in the non-custodial wallet you plan on voting with before the vote opens (December 15th at 12:00 pm GMT). This is so your existing OCEAN balance can be counted. Voting from exchanges is not supported.  Your wallet address can only vote on one proposal. If you would like to vote on more than one proposal, you will need to fund your multiple wallet addresses with the respective amount of OCEAN before the voting&nbsp;opens.  You can only vote with the OCEAN tokens in your wallet. You will be unable to vote with OCEAN that is deposited as liquidity in Ocean Market, Bancor, or otherwise. It is your choice if you would like to remove liquidity, vote, and re-add the liquidity back later. Risks come with removing liquidity (impermanent loss etc). This is up to you to manage. In the future, we aim to support voting without needing to remove liquidity (e.g. vote with&nbsp;BPTs).   How to&nbsp;Vote   Navigate to the <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">OceanDAO Voting&nbsp;Page</a>.  Once voting begins you will see the active proposals on the&nbsp;ballot.  Connect your Web3 wallet containing your OCEAN&nbsp;tokens.  Select the proposal you wish to vote&nbsp;for.  Click “Vote” and sign with your&nbsp;wallet.  Vote percentages will adjust accordingly as votes are&nbsp;counted.   Grant Details  Grant Recipients <p>In Funding Round 1, each winning project will receive 10,000 OCEAN from OceanDAO. There will be 5 winners: the top 5 highest voted proposals (additionally, to receive a grant you must also receive greater than 1% of the&nbsp;vote).</p><p>Funds will be disbursed to the grantees within 24 hours after voting&nbsp;ends.</p><p>Funds for OceanDAO currently come from Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF). Future funds are earmarked to also come from the 51% Ocean token supply (details&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">here</a>).</p> Non-Grant Recipients <p>If you were not selected for a grant in this Funding Round, we highly encourage you to continue to stay involved in the Ocean community. You are appreciated! There are future OceanDAO funding rounds on the first of every month starting in February 2021, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/fund">other opportunities</a> to receive&nbsp;funding.</p> On OceanDAO Evolution <p>The best practices and technology around DAOs are still evolving. OceanDAO’s strategy is to “bake slowly” — to ratchet up value-at-risk over time, to give space to learn and for technology to improve. Accordingly, the amount of funds per Funding Round may vary, and OPF reserves the right to make changes in general. The aim is: if OceanDAO creates positive value, then the funds allocated to OceanDAO will go&nbsp;up.</p><p>Shipping OceanDAO completes “Goal 4” in the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">2020 product plans</a>, on schedule. The label “V4” will be reserved for future software releases.</p> FAQ <p>Is voting from exchanges possible?</p><p>No. Make sure to have an OCEAN balance in a non-custodial wallet before voting opens on Dec&nbsp;15.</p><p>How does Ocean relate to other Ocean funding programs (Shipyard, Data Economy Challenge)?</p><p>They are complementary:</p>  Shipyard offers grants curated by the core Ocean&nbsp;team.  OceanDAO offers grants curated by the broader community of OCEAN&nbsp;holders.  Data Economy Challenge (DEC) offers prizes curated by expert judges from the community.  More information is at: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/fund">https://oceanprotocol.com/fund</a>  <p>Is Ocean a governance DAO? Can we use it to change parameter x?</p><p>No. OceanDAO is exclusively a grants DAO which gives funding for community-proposed projects. That’s&nbsp;it.</p><p>Is this Ocean V4? If no, does that mean you didn’t complete your&nbsp;roadmap?</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">roadmap</a> laid out shipping OceanDAO as Ocean Goal 4 / V4. In shipping OceanDAO, we are fulfilling Goal 4 and the promise of the roadmap. However, we are now reserving the label “Ocean V4” for future changes to Ocean smart contract software.</p><p>Why not <a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/quadratic-funding">quadratic funding</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">Quadratic voting</a>? <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475">Conviction voting</a>? <a href="https://twitter.com/gnosisPM/status/1330906217007509507">Futarchy</a>?&nbsp;…?</p><p>These are all great ideas. Currently we constrain ourselves to using readily-available tooling with a minimum of experimentation needed. None of the ideas listed fit that criteria. However as DAO tooling improves, we hope to be able to try out new&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Are there plans for a governance DAO?</p><p>Not at the present. This is also because, for Ocean, PRs or forks are generally more appropriate anyway, see below. Let’s see how things evolve. For changes&nbsp;to:</p>  Ocean Market code, then make a PR, or fork and make your own&nbsp;version.  libraries like ocean.js, then make a PR, or fork and make your own&nbsp;version.  the datatokens contracts: there is virtually nothing to change since they’re so simple. Basically just&nbsp;ERC20.  the pool contracts, fork it, change it, and deploy as your own version. We *want* more types of pools in&nbsp;Ocean.  <p>More OCEAN tokens are in circulation via the grant rewards. Does this really bring more value to the Ocean ecosystem? What are the benefits of OceanDAO?</p><p>OceanDAO is a grants DAO with the purpose of growing the overall value of Ocean Protocol. Investing in the Ocean ecosystem is a critical aspect of this goal. See <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">The Web3 Sustainability Loop</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>The OPF has Ocean tokens, will they use them to vote for proposals? Will it then be a centralized system where the OPF chooses what will get&nbsp;funded?</p><p>No. The OPF and BigchainDB will not be&nbsp;voting.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

As we head into the last month of 2020, this most extraordinary year, we’re delighted to announce a new partnership focussed on empowering work. <a href="https://vela.solutions/">VELA Solutions</a> has selected <a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> to power their workforce digital credentials platform.




 




Together, Meeco and VELA have created a secure digital credentialing platform to help individuals and businesses adapt to the changing work environment and modernise their HR practices.




 




The post COVID-19 world will be more digital. Whilst many digital technologies already existed, to support working from home, telemedicine or signing a contract, necessity accelerated adoption this year.




 




Now, as we look to 2021, with the promise of being able to work together again, there’s an opportunity to rethink the way we seek and start work in a more trusted and digital way.




 




New technical standards are emerging which focus on establishing trust in the digital world. One such standard is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>, the method by which credentials can be issued, verified and exchanged. This includes the ability to cryptographically prove that a credential is authentic, valid and trustworthy. The benefits for people and organisations of this technology include:




 





  Faster and more convenient to verify education and training records  Reduced risk and fraud  Credential portability and re-use               Verification and revocation  Improved compliance  Increased safety  Privacy management  








Founded by <a href="https://vela.solutions/about-us/">Andrew Scott and Michael Derwin</a>, VELA Solutions is the culmination of their extensive experience across workforce management, organisational development and HR Tech. Their motivation to build VELA draws on their personal stories.




 




For Andrew, the importance of identity was something he learnt at a much younger age. In his late teens whilst living away from home to study, the share house he was living in was destroyed by fire. He escaped only with the jeans he was wearing and with no way to identify himself. Without proof of identity, he was not able to access basic things like health services or his bank account. Living rough was the only option until he could get back on his feet. This experience has shaped his desire to ensure people can benefit from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralised identity</a>, also referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self Sovereign</a>, <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/mccom/en-us/issuers/digital-identity/digital-identity-restoring-trust-in-a-digital-world-final-share-corrected.pdf">Self-Managed</a> or <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/eIDAS-and-EUs-mission-to-create-a-truly-portable-identity">Portable Identity</a>.




 





<blockquote>We believe that this technology will fundamentally change the way businesses and employees work together – it’s just a matter of time.<p></p>Andrew Scott, Director – VELA Solutions</blockquote>




Michael has always had a passion for making technology work for people. He is no stranger to pioneering the change he wants to see in the world. His first foray was in the 1990s, using the early internet to support the education of Australian outback students using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Air">“School of The Air”</a>– something we now know as open learning.  More recently he co-founded the talent management software company, <a href="https://www.adepto.com">Adepto</a>, which was successfully acquired by <a href="https://degreed.com">Degreed</a> earlier this year.




<blockquote>We are now in the age where we can connect hardware and software technologies and truly empower individuals to take charge of their digital self. 

Michael Derwin, Director – VELA Solutions</blockquote>




The maturing of decentralised identity solutions underscored the decision to find an experienced partner. Enter Meeco. We have been pioneering the  collection, protection and exchange of personal data and identity since 2012.  The decentralised credentials technology developed for VELA draws on our expertise and uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable </a><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Credentials</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/"> Standard</a>, which means, we will deliver workforce solutions that are interoperable and globally supported.




 





<blockquote>“This is a significant achievement towards empowering people to securely collect, verify and share their workforce credentials. The mutual benefits of risk management and value creation demonstrates the power of human-centric technology. Adopting this approach gives mutual control over the collection and use of personal data, and give workforce eco-system partners a competitive edge.”&nbsp;  <p></p>Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder, Meeco</blockquote>





 









 





<blockquote>“The changing landscape around data privacy is putting the individual in charge of their data – this will fundamentally change the way companies need to operate.”









<p></p>Michael Derwin, Director, VELA Solutions</blockquote>





 




VELA and Meeco are united by our vision to get trusted workforce data into the hands of people so they can use their verified work data to get work, utilise their skills and experience, and progress their careers.




 




To support these workforce challenges, we have developed a secure platform with verified credential portability making it faster and easier to recruit, onboard and maintain employee and contractor professional credentials.




 




Our differentiator will be the ability to configure implementations to support both decentralised wallets and integration into existing enterprise systems. This is achieved with Meeco’s patented vault technology. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/developers">Meeco’s suite of APIs, SDKs and documentation</a> are available to our eco-system partners  to ensure integrations support corporate governance, risk tracking and reduction, improved safety and compliance outcomes, whilst always empowering people.




 




The VELA solution can be applied across a range of sectors such as health,  mining, education, aviation and government.  To find out more and register to keep updated on our progress, visit <a href="https://vela.solutions">VELA Solutions</a>.




 




Also stay tuned, in the coming weeks Meeco will announce our distributed ledger partner, along with our commitment to co-developing tools to support the issuers, verifiers and enterprises in this exiting new workforce eco-system.

   It’s over 13 years since we at Mydex Community Interest Company set up&nbsp;shop.  Back then, we had a vision and a mission: that every human being — every citizen in every country in the world — should have the right and ability to gather and use their own data for their own purposes, including exercising control over how others collect and use their&nbsp;data.

<p>It’s over 13 years since we at Mydex Community Interest Company set up&nbsp;shop.</p><p>Back then, we had a vision and a mission: that every human being — every citizen in every country in the world — should have the right and ability to gather and use their own data for their own purposes, including exercising control over how others collect and use their&nbsp;data.</p><p>At the time, this idea seemed so outlandish that most people simply ignored or dismissed our ideas as irrelevant.</p><p>But over the years the need for our mission has become ever more apparent, with mounting abuses and accelerating imbalances of power and reward, and with growing awareness that our society and economy is failing to <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">unleash the full potential of data</a> — especially personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Also, slowly but surely, the means of achieving this mission has also become clearer. Every citizen needs to have their own personal data store which enables them to collect, store, use and share their own data under their own control, independently of any other party or organisation that might have collected data about&nbsp;them.</p> Critical design principles <p>Particular details of how this system should work have also become clearer. Over the years, we worked hard to clarify the design principles that are critical for our mission’s success. We laid out the most important ones <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-a-new-data-infrastructure-22124e300f6c">in a blog back 2018</a>. Key amongst them&nbsp;were:</p><p>1. Public/social purpose and mission. The purpose of the new personal data infrastructure should not be to monetise data but to promote the public good e.g. benefits for citizens.</p><p>2. Independence. It should work for people — citizens — not for the profits of private corporations or for the&nbsp;state.</p><p>3. Neural and enabling The infrastructure should not be designed or used so as to favour one party’s vested interests over&nbsp;another.</p><p>4. Distributed, not centralised With each personal data store uniquely and separately encrypted, held by individuals for individuals (i.e. not creating yet another massive centralised database).</p><p>5. Zero-knowledge operations It should not look into or seek to influence how individuals use their data. Its job is to promote and enable their agency, not to seek to control&nbsp;them.</p><p>6. Aligned incentives The way it earns its money should be structured so that it has no financial incentives to monetise, manipulate or seek control over individuals’ data or their uses of this&nbsp;data.</p><p>7. Separation of storage from use The only way to achieve all the above is to create a structural separation of functions and roles: with one focused on the provision of infrastructure enabling citizens to collect, store and share their data, the other actually using the data (e.g. to provide financial advice, treat a medical condition, or assess an individual’s eligibility for a service).</p><p>8. Built to last — the infrastructure should have built-in safeguards against changes to its role, functions and priorities — for instance, in the case of a change of leadership, stock market listing, merger, sale, acquisition, bankruptcy etc.</p> The EU&nbsp;agrees! <p>This week, the EU published its new Data Governance Act, its core purpose being to “foster the availability of data for use by increasing trust in data intermediaries and by strengthening data-sharing mechanisms across the&nbsp;EU”.</p><p>A core part of its provisions are rules relating to data intermediaries that enable what it calls ‘C2B’ [consumer to business] data sharing. This is what the Act&nbsp;says:</p><blockquote>“These providers will have to comply with a number of requirements, in particular the requirement to remain neutral as regards the data exchanged. They cannot use such data for other purposes. In the case of providers of data sharing services offering services for natural persons, the additional criterion of assuming fiduciary duties towards the individuals using them will also have to be&nbsp;met.”</blockquote><p>Just as we had&nbsp;said.</p><p>Clause 23 goes on to say (in a rather long-winded paragraph):</p><blockquote>“A specific category of data intermediaries includes providers of data sharing services that offer their services to data subjects in the sense of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 [GDPR in other words]. Such providers focus exclusively on personal data and seek to enhance individual agency and the individuals’ control over the data pertaining to them. They would assist individuals in exercising their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular managing their consent to data processing, the right of access to their own data, the right to the rectification of inaccurate personal data, the right of erasure or right ‘to be forgotten’, the right to restrict processing and the data portability right, which allows data subjects to move their personal data from one controller to the other. In this context, it is important that their business model ensures that there are no misaligned incentives that encourage individuals to make more data available for processing than what is in the individuals’ own interest. This could include advising individuals on uses of their data they could allow and making due diligence checks on data users before allowing them to contact data subjects, in order to avoid fraudulent practices. In certain situations, it could be desirable to collate actual data within a personal data storage space, or ‘personal data space’ so that processing can happen within that space without personal data being transmitted to third parties in order to maximise the protection of personal data and privacy.”</blockquote><p>All this is pretty much what we wrote in our blog back in May&nbsp;2018.</p> One step forward&nbsp;… <p>It is incredibly positive that the EU has made this step, in many&nbsp;ways.</p><p>It’s very important that there is legal recognition of personal data services that work for and behalf of individuals; that are not traditional ‘data controllers’ that collect and use data for a particular organisation’s purposes.</p><p>It is very important that the two way nature of data sharing — both so-called ‘B2C’ [business-to-consumer] and ‘C2B’ [consumer-to-business] — be recognised. (We would rather that the ‘C’ refer to citizens rather than ‘consumers’, which is a derogatory term in our minds. But you can’t have everything).</p><p>And it is particularly important that the core design principles outlined above are recognised, embraced and enforced.</p><p>That said, there’s still a long, long way to go. Writing down some good principles is one thing. Interpreting them in the right way and actually implementing and enforcing them is something else entirely. The new Act makes progress easier, but in no way does it make progress inevitable.</p><p>There’s also the question of how the UK responds. Will the UK Government adopt a similar approach? With its own National Data Strategy consultation coming to a close next week, the UK Government has an immense opportunity to unleash the full potential of personal data for the nation’s citizens, society and economy. Has it got the vision and political will to do&nbsp;this?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/vindicated-cb897fb4e94b">Vindicated!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A recap of everything that has happened so far…and of what’s to&nbsp;come.  Intro <p>3 years can feel like an eternity at a time of relative normality, let alone in a year like 2020. In the blockchain industry, time travels so quickly that it can make you feel like you are travelling at lightspeed given just how much occurs in such a short amount of time. When Ontology officially launched in New York as 2017 was coming to an end, the world was witnessing global recognition of Bitcoin for the first time as the price jumped to almost $20,000, before crashing in January of 2018. At a time when the industry was plagued by scams, false pretenses and an overall lack of clarity, Ontology was able to seize the moment and establish itself as an industry leader that enterprises can rely&nbsp;on.</p><p>Not only has Ontology survived the bursting of the initial bubble; we have found our footing and thrived in the process. The first 3 years of Ontology have seen massive accomplishments both in terms of technical development and market adoption. Our focus has, and always will be geared towards the protection and control of individual user privacy and data rights, as stated by our Founder, Li Jun, in his earliest conception of the Ontology blockchain. In fact, Li Jun’s vision seems even more pertinent now than it was back&nbsp;then.</p><p>Today, concerns around user privacy continues to grow amongst all facets of society. Laws such as the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/#:~:text=The%20regulation%20was%20put%20into,tens%20of%20millions%20of%20euros.">GDPR, passed back in May 2018</a>, show governments attempting to address these concerns. It seems Ontology’s vision of a total decentralized identity solution such as our ONT ID is needed more now than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>However, we know that growth and progress isn’t always linear, as we have seen with the highs and lows the industry has experienced over the last 3 years. What is important though, is that we continue to move forward. We have compiled a recap of the things we have done to achieve our goals over the last 3&nbsp;years.</p> Year One: Systemic Construction <p>As with most long term projects, the first step is about building a solid foundation upon which the project can flourish. For Ontology, our initial phase saw the launching of our <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ontology-mainnet-ontology-1-0-has-officially-launched">MainNet</a> and the first version of our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/o-wallet-ontologys-official-desktop-wallet-version-0-8-0-release-notes-38b2ed8d1492">ONTO wallet</a>. Our MainNet serves as a high-performance public blockchain with a distributed ledger and smart contract system that also supports public chain customization and chain network collaboration. Notably, Ontology 1.0 was the first public chain capable of executing smart contracts with identity, setting the vision for decentralized identity in motion. To allow for better user interaction, we subsequently launched the first version of ONTO in the summer of 2018, which supported individual wallets, shared wallets, and the ledger hardware wallet. On top of that, in our first year we introduced a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-launches-vbft-a-next-generation-consensus-mechanism-becoming-one-of-the-first-vrf-based-91f782308db4">new consensus algorithm VBFT</a> for the Ontology framework and the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-introduces-the-triones-membership-system-5211294976bf">Triones Consensus System</a>, which laid the groundwork for an open governance model. With the first series of projects having launched on GitHub in March 2018, we moved further into the area of decentralized identity with the launch of <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-first-version-of-the-ontology-roadmaps-8760c96e50b5">ONT ID</a>, which includes the Ontology distributed identification protocol and verifiable claim protocol. To close off our system construction in year one, Ontology joined an array of internationally recognized blockchain based groups including the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation.</a></p> Year Two: Industry Recognition <p>Ontology’s second year revolved around developing our singular vision and ensuring our technical prowess within the broader ecosystem. Our goal was realized when Ontology was chosen to be part of the Microsoft Accelerator in December, 2018<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/onchain-wins-the-microsoft-accelerator-shanghai-third-cohort-graduation-award-acd28dcc22b5">,</a> as well as being officially listed as a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-is-now-an-official-google-cloud-partner-as-three-ontology-projects-are-accepted-to-the-935edeef3e64">Google Cloud Partner with three of our projects having been accepted</a> in their partner program shortly after in February of 2019. In June of 2019, Ontology celebrated its one year anniversary of our MainNet launch. Once we achieved a certain level of public trust in the technical expertise behind Ontology, launching our MainNet allowed us to build upon it for further Enterprise projects who were focusing on decentralized identity and data privacy. In addition, we launched the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-v1-8-0-goes-live-with-wasm-fa34e9f7f930">Wasm TestNet in May</a>, as well as the first ever cross-chain TestNet in the same month. The <a href="https://blockchain.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> also passed both of our proposed blockchain standards in&nbsp;June.</p><p>We wrapped up our second year with our Multi-VM launch in October, followed by the launch of our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-sharding-design-released-c900331f71fa">Sharding Design</a>. Our Sharding Design was specifically designed to provide effective linear stability and support for atomic cross-shard transaction processing.</p><p>During our second year, we also released the <a href="https://ont.io/Ontology-Infrastructure-White-Paper-EN-2.0.0.pdf">second version of our Whitepaper</a> in July. The whitepaper reiterated Li Jun’s original vision for decentralized identity and data privacy and highlighted our technical infrastructure and framework which put us ahead of the&nbsp;pack.</p> Year Three: Global Integration <p>In Ontology’s third year, our focus was to identify key ways in which we could become a cross-chain powerhouse in the blockchain industry, while also utilizing our ONT ID and data protection features in partnership with other leading companies. From a technical standpoint, we kicked off our third year with the launch of ONT FS, as well as our Blockchain SaaS Framework. Moving into 2020, our technical progress was demonstrated by the launch of Ontology Layer 2.0 — which included the launch of a brand new <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-wasm-jit-released-a-leading-smart-contract-virtual-machine-with-high-speed-and-519783fe5055">Wasm-JIT</a>, which provides high speed performance at low storage costs. Its launch was paired with the ONT ID 2.0 upgrade, which combines users’ decentralized identity with their ONTO wallet with one single login, while providing a framework that helps users control their identity and data. This further strengthened our position as a market leader in ensuring user privacy and data protection; a position reflected by the vast amount of external partnerships and media mentions we have achieved in our third year from leading outlets such as CoinDesk and Cointelegraph — the latter of which we are officially listed in as an Enterprise Solution Provider under their new consulting arm. We introduced a new governance and staking model in July, affecting both ONT and ONG, equipped with a <a href="https://node.ont.io/calculator/node">node and yield calculator</a> allowing users to easily estimate how much they can potentially earn from staking through ONTO. The launch of the <a href="https://www.poly.network/">Poly Network</a> in partnership with Neo and Switcheo enabled the support of cross-chain assets on Ontology. This allowed us to focus even more on providing decentralized identity solutions across different chains. It also enabled us to list ONT and ONG on Uniswap towards the end of the summer. With the turn of the leaves into Fall, we deployed our cross-chain DeID solution on Ethereum, Near, Neo, TRON, Klaytn, Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot. We partnered with Patract Labs late in November to accelerate smart contract ecosystem development on the back of our technical prowess.</p><p>As our third year draws to a close, we have been focused heavily on decentralized finance, otherwise known as DeFi. In September of 2020, the Ontology core team launched <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing.Finance</a>, a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi lending platform. Not only has Wing seen significant growth and engagement in its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with over ten governance votes passed already, but it is also primed to be the first ever DeFi platform to incorporate credit-based lending through Ontology’s unique OScore credit scoring solution. The Wing Inclusive Pool will allow users to under-collateralize assets and lower their interest rates. The Inclusive Pool is the first lending pool of its kind in the DeFi space, as well as the broader blockchain space as a whole. Not only is this incredibly exciting for Wing, but it will serve as an incredible opportunity for the demand of OScore as&nbsp;well.</p> Moving Forward. <p>We have accomplished a lot in our first three years. We tend to overestimate what we can accomplish in one day, but underestimate what we can accomplish in a year. So with that in mind, we want to ensure our community that we are adamantly and tirelessly working towards making the next three years even more successful than the last three years. Specifically, we continue to develop our core features such as ONT ID and OScore, we will seek more partnerships and collaborations with both public-chains and offline enterprises in an attempt to integrate Ontology’s technology and our underlying belief system. We will use Wing as a foundation to demonstrate how credit-based lending can catapult DeFi into the next era; an era of credit backed by&nbsp;OScore.</p><p>Still, throughout it all, we will focus first and foremost on the original vision laid out by our Founder, Li Jun — a vision of complete identity decentralization designed to protect users’ data and grant them the access, control, and autonomy that we believe every user deserves.</p><p>Thank you.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/3-years-in-the-blink-of-an-eye-the-ontology-story-so-far-e2b1298f89f4">3 Years In The Blink Of An Eye: The Ontology Story So Far</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jelurida-announces-blockchain-based-bridge-strategy-game/">Jelurida announces blockchain-based bridge strategy game</a> 

<p>Bitcoinist: Blockchain software development firm Jelurida is set to launch an on-chain version of the bridge, the strategy card game. The platform will be called Bridge Champ and will enable anyone to set up their own white-label bridge gaming environment. The game leverages the benefits of blockchain, including in-game tokens and cheat prevention. Players will be able to “mine” bridge tokens based on “proof of play” and their achievements record, which is also stored securely on the Ignis blockchain. Online bridge was already popular among the millions of bridge players worldwide. However, since the coronavirus pandemic has restricted social opportunities, online bridge has proliferated to the point where the American Contract Bridge League reported it had seen a fivefold increase in usage by June 2020. For the benefit of the uninitiated, bridge is sometimes referred to as the “chess of card games” due to its complexity and sophisticated gameplay.</p>

 Suomi.fi customer test environment patch is now available. 
<p>As we previously announced:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On 4.9.2020 Suomi.fi announced that the algorithms used in Suomi.fi authentication would be updated to harmonise security and protections to SAML2 authentications to be in line with Traficom’s SAML2 profile recommendations. Initially on 15.10.2020 these changes were applied to the Suomi.fi customer test environment. Then towards the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 the changes will be applied to the Suomi.fi production environment. Please find the original announcement from Suomi.fi&nbsp;<a href="https://palveluhallinta.suomi.fi/en/ajankohtaista/uutiset/5f51e6b9fc2bb907bbb64186">here</a>.”</p></blockquote>
 Resolution 
<p>This patch release permits the continued use of your integrated applications with the Suomi.fi customer test environment. Detailed information about the changes in this release can be found in&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20191/Identity+Server+2019.1+Release+Notes#IdentityServer2019.1ReleaseNotes-SSO8.4.2">SSO 8.4.2 change log</a>.</p>
<p>SSO 8.4.2 can be found in the following location:&nbsp;<a href="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/">https://downloads.ubisecure.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 SSO 8.3.9 – status 
<p>In our original <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/technical-announcements/suomi-fi-saml2-algorithms-are-changing/">announcement</a> in September we offered an estimate release date for the then supported versions of SSO.&nbsp; While we encourage all customers to update their installed applications regularly, we recognise that this is not always possible.&nbsp; At this time SSO 8.3.x is no longer supported, see our <a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/KNB/Supported+versions">Supported Versions</a> table, that said, if you require this patch for your SSO 8.3.x environment, we ask that you please open a ticket with <a href="https://support.ubisecure.com/service-desk/">Support</a> or contact your Account Manager.&nbsp; We will work with you to ensure your environment remains functional with Suomi.fi until such time that you can upgrade to a supported version of SSO.</p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your IDS Platform in a timely manner. We release two to three Identity Server platform releases per year, which include feature improvements, corrections to known deviations and security fixes. We use&nbsp;<a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>&nbsp;on software releases. Minor versions are shows as, SSO 8.x.0 and CustomerID 5.x.0. As needed, we also will release patch version, SSO 8.5.x or CID 5.5.x. Patch versions will contain requested deviation corrections or essential security fixes. Updating your environment regularly is the best way to ensure you have access to the latest security fixes and the quickest access to essential code corrections such as this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.</p>
