<p><a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/">Innovatrics</a> is trying to drum up more interest in its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/innovatrics-breaks-down-selfie-onboarding-solution-74202103/">Digital Onboarding Toolkit</a> (DOT). To that end, the company is calling attention to the Innovatrics <a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/news/innovatrics-releases-updated-demo-app-for-digital-onboarding/">DOT demo app</a>, a free offering that shows users how the company’s onboarding technology works in practice.</p>



  



<p>The DOT demo app makes use of the same Onboarding Toolkit that Innovatrics offers to its paying customers. The Toolkit was built to help businesses verify the identities of their end users, and is delivered with an intuitive API that lets an organization integrate the Toolkit’s various utilities into an existing mobile or web application. Those that do so can also mix and match the API’s feature set to tailor the experience to meet their own particular needs.</p>



<p>However, the core functionality of the app will remain relatively the same for all users. The DOT demo (and the API) use <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-explains-how-digital-onboarding-toolkit-verifies-identity-documents-042606/">document recognition</a> to confirm the authenticity of a photo ID, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-earns-high-marks-dhs-biometric-technology-rally-030306/">facial recognition</a> to match that ID to a selfie of the person holding it. The platform uses <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/innovatrics-teaches-onboarding-toolkit-recognize-bengali-script-031603/">Optical Character Recognition</a> (OCR) tech to extract information from the document, and to help create a biometric template to perform the subsequent facial recognition match.</p>



<p>“Keeping the needs of our partners in mind, we have developed a new version of our demo app that allows them to observe how identity verification works in real-time and visualize how it can be integrated into their solutions,” said Innovatrics Product Management Head Daniel Ferak. “It’s now possible to individually demo and test each of its functionalities upon request that are designed to prevent fraud and create a trusted marketplace in the digital era.”</p>



<p>The DOT is compatible with ICAO IDs, and can extract data from a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/innovatrics-onboarding-toolkit-gets-offline-mrz-reading-capabilities-081707/">Machine Readable Zone</a> or an RFID chip. It also checks to make sure that the document has not been tampered with, and uses <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-adds-passive-liveness-detection-to-biometric-facial-recognition-solution-904211/">liveness detection</a> to make sure that the true document owner is the one taking the selfie. The Innovatrics DOT demo app is available for Android and iOS devices.</p>

<p>Despite a denial issued in April of 2020, a recently leaked software log reveals that police officers in The Netherlands used facial recognition software provided by controversial startup Clearview AI to try and identify suspects.</p>



  



<p>According to the <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2021/08/26/dutch-police-likely-used-controversial-facial-recognition-software-despite-ministers">NL Times</a>, a recent report by Dutch newspaper Reformatorisch Dagblad uncovered the police force’s use of the biometric software despite the fact that last year Minister of Justice Ferd Grapperhaus stated that officers “have not been approached centrally by Clearview, are not aware of any contacts with that company and have not purchased any products”, when pressed by GroenLinks MP Kathalijne Buitenweg.</p>



<p>Clearview jumped into the global spotlight following a January 2020 front page story in The New York Times that revealed the company was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-quietly-sells-face-recognition-tech-law-enforcement-agencies-012008/">using its algorithm</a> to scrape social media sites like Facebook and Twitter in order to build a database of millions upon millions of faces.</p>



<p>The report also showed that Clearview was targeting law enforcement agencies around the world, and selling its facial recognition solution without the consent of the companies it took the pictures from, nor the individuals whose pictures it was using for its database.</p>



<p>Over the past several months, the company has found itself in the news time and time again for a variety of reasons, from having its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-clearview-ai-client-list-stolen-022701/">client list stolen</a> by hackers, to being on the receiving end of a BIPA case. </p>



<p>Despite all the controversy, a recent Government Accountability Office report showed that a number of government agencies in the U.S. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/gao-finds-broad-support-facial-recognition-clearview-ai-among-federal-agencies-082701/">are still partnered </a>with Clearview, and last month the company announced a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-raises-30-million-in-series-b-funding-despite-legal-troubles-707221/">further $30 million</a> Series B funding round.</p>



<p>In this instance, the leaked software log showed that the Dutch police used Clearview’s solution somewhere between 50 to 100 times between 2018 and 2020 in what is considered to be a likely violation of the country’s privacy guidelines.</p>

<p>US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is hoping that more Global Entry travelers will start taking advantage of the program’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-customs-border-protection-expands-facial-recognition-screening-program-global-travellers-011701/">Facial Recognition capabilities</a>. The technology is now available at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, and CBP is using the opportunity to highlight some of the benefits that facial recognition offers to Global Entry members.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, CBP called particular attention to convenience. The Global Entry program is a voluntary program that gives trusted travelers access to an expedited screening process. To join, members need to submit personal and passport information to CBP, which will also collect biometric face and fingerprint data. That information is then processed in advance so members do not need to check in with a CBP agent as they pass through customs.</p>



<p>Of course, those travelers still need to prove their identity, which is where facial recognition comes in to play. In the past, members needed to swipe their passport and submit a fingerprint at a self-service kiosk to confirm their status as a Global Entry traveler. With facial recognition, they will no longer need to present their passport or their fingerprint. Members will instead be asked to pause for a photo at a kiosk, and that new photo will be compared to images that CBP already has on file. They will then be allowed to proceed if the photos match.</p>



<p>If there is not a match, Global Entry will revert to the old format, in which case the traveler will be asked to submit a passport and a fingerprint. The Global Entry facial recognition program does not collect any new information, and instead verifies information that the traveler has voluntarily submitted to CBP. The program is open to US citizens and permanent residents, in addition to citizens of 12 countries and NEXUS members in Canada.</p>



<p>CBP has been expanding its use of facial recognition for travelers who are not in the Global Entry program. The organization’s Simplified Arrival service has now been deployed at <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbp-biometric-simplified-arrival-denver-706082/">dozens of air</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbp-brings-biometric-border-control-to-washington-land-crossings-707022/">land borders</a> throughout the United States.</p>

<p>Call center solutions specialist Avaya is banking on biometric tech, announcing that it has made a strategic investment in Journey.Ai, Inc.</p>



<p>Already part of the Avaya DevConnect partner ecosystem, Journey offers a customer identification platform that includes support for face and voice recognition. The startup was co-founded in 2016 by a former Avaya executive – Brett Shockley, who served in multiple senior positions with the latter between 2008 and 2014, and who remains the CEO of Journey. Mr. Shockley’s son, Alex Shockley, serves as Journey’s President.</p>



<p>Avaya, for its part, is no stranger to biometrics and other innovative technologies. The company announced that its platform would support <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/avaya-biometrics-ai-call-center-solutions-510112/">face and voice biometrics</a> as far back as 2018, and also offered a Software Development Kit that enabled conversational interaction with AI assistants and a feature designed to assess end user sentiment.</p>



<p>That having been said, Avaya’s leadership are evidently impressed by Journey’s own technology. In a statement announcing the strategic investment, Avaya asserted that Journey’s solution “can confirm customer identity with 99.9999% accuracy in less than two seconds,” adding that its Zero Knowledge Network solutions “gives Avaya OneCloud CCaaS customers the unique ability to digitally request information from their customers, from Personal Identifiable Information (PII) to payments to electronic signatures.”</p>



<p>The latter solution sends that information to “back-office systems” for verification, without the need to share it with contact center agents, who receive only the information they need to help the customer. The solution thus helps to protect end user data and privacy.</p>



<p>“Journey’s innovation in Zero Knowledge, coupled with core Avaya Contact Center offerings address critical components of the customer experience along with the privacy and security requirements faced by contact centers,” explained Avaya Corporate Development GVP David Austin. “This strategic investment in an ecosystem partner enhances key security capabilities for our global customers, and is bringing additional industry-leading innovation into the Avaya OneCloud platform.”</p>



<p>Avaya’s investment reflects ongoing interest in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/id-rd-teams-red-box-on-call-center-voice-biometrics-solution-101505/">voice biometrics technology</a> as a call center solution, as well as the increasing use of facial recognition for remote customer verification.</p>



<p>The companies did not disclose the amount of Avaya’s investment, but acknowledged that it is not expected to have a material impact on Avaya’s current fiscal quarter.</p>

 GiD Report#175 — Everyone wants an&nbsp;NFT <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-174-facebook-is-a-monopoly-again-ec2a4477d020">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p> This week:   The month of the&nbsp;NFT  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. NFT sales reach almost $1 billion in&nbsp;August Degen Ape NFTs on&nbsp;Solana<p>At this point, most people have heard of a non-fungible token (NFT), but for the still uninitiated, here’s a quick&nbsp;primer.</p><p>Your typical cryptocurrency, much like currencies in general, are fungible. All that means is that you’re happy to accept a like-for-like replacement if you own one. I’m happy to have any U.S. dollar — it’s all the same to&nbsp;me.</p><p>That’s not the case for non-fungible tokens, which represent unique assets. Your plane ticket — that’s technically an NFT. Trade your ticket with someone else and it means you’re sitting somewhere else on the&nbsp;plane.</p><p>That makes an NFT very suitable for digital art, content, and collectibles. And beyond that, these tokens have potentially countless use cases. Maybe it’s a collectible. Maybe it’s a ticket to an event. Maybe it’s a membership pass, functioning as gated access for a private community. Maybe it’s a way for creators to assign attribution to their&nbsp;work.</p><p>After a brief lull after the crypto correction in May, the market is once again exploding.</p><p>Visa just <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/23/why-did-visa-buy-a-150k-nft-why-does-anyone/">bought a cryptopunk for $150,000</a>.</p><p>Ripple is <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/evolving-ripplenet-for-a-tokenized-future/">leaning into tokenization</a>.</p><p>Facebook is talking about<a href="https://blockworks.co/facebooks-novi-digital-wallet-could-support-nfts-in-future-exec-says/"> including NFT support for its Novi wallet</a> later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>European soccer teams have <a href="https://protos.com/fan-tokens-socios-european-football-clubs-200m-selling-crypto/">sold over $200 million worth of tokens</a> to its&nbsp;fans.</p><p>Justin Sun <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2021/08/23/justin-sun-buys-nft-rock-half-million-dollars">bought a digital rock</a> for half a million dollars. Yes — digital rocks are now status symbols in the crypto community. Don’t&nbsp;ask.</p><p>And the success of NFT projects such as degen apes (again, don’t ask) on Solana has helped <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/solana-summer">skyrocket the speedy, scalable crypto token</a> to over $100. (Hard Yaka is an early investor in&nbsp;Solana.)</p><p>All told, August has already seen <a href="https://blockworks.co/nft-craze-rages-on-as-august-sales-near-900m/">NFT sales over $900&nbsp;million</a>.</p><p>Let’s not get it twisted — this bubble will likely burst at some point and a lot of people will get left holding the bag. But some will also likely hold lasting value. (Good luck picking the right&nbsp;ones.)</p><p>Speculation aside, the concept, the technology — that’s real. That’s sticking around. And we’re only just experimenting with the tip of the iceberg here. We haven’t yet grasped its full potential.

 At Anonyome Labs we value well-written code that has good tests. This is a guide on how we go about producing useful and meaningful tests for our Android code. 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



 Testing approach: SDK or app? 



<p></p>



<p>Testing code isn’t a “one approach fits all” affair. The nature of the code you want to test will dictate the strategy you should employ. For example:</p>



  Building an SDK?&nbsp;<br>Unit tests that use a mock environment will give good coverage of hard-to-reach error paths, plus integration tests that run on Android device or emulator will exercise real world behaviour.  Creating an app?&nbsp;<br>Unit tests that use a mock environment plus Espresso visual tests that exercise all the visual elements and the screen-to-screen navigation will give you confidence all is well.  



<p>Your desire to test your code well will often mean you will structure your code in a way that makes it easier to test. It might make it a little more complicated than you had originally intended, by causing you to make parts of it replaceable when under test, but don’t be shy of this. Good tests will give you confidence in your code and give the next person who has to maintain it confidence they have not broken anything.</p>



 Unit tests that use a mock environment 



<p></p>



<p>Writing tests that run your code under the control of&nbsp;<a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://robolectric.org/">Robolectric</a>&nbsp;with a mocking library, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mockito/mockito-kotlin">Mockito</a>, will allow you to replace the code you didn’t write with mock or spy versions. When the tests run your code, they can check it made all the right calls. You can use these mocks to cause exceptions to be thrown from all the different places where an error can occur and check your code handles them correctly. In many cases, trying to test the error paths without using mocks and spies can be very difficult.</p>



<p>Imagine you have created a nice new API and you want to test it. Here is a very simple example:</p>







<p>At point&nbsp;A&nbsp;in&nbsp;MyApi&nbsp;you can see that the&nbsp;Worker, which simulates some other system your API needs to use, is provided to the API in the constructor which will allow you to override it in tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a test you might write to exercise the API and check the API does what you intend under normal operation and that the error conditions are handled correctly under abnormal conditions:</p>











<p>At&nbsp;B&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>MyApiTest,</code>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<code>mockWorker</code>&nbsp;is created that replaces the real&nbsp;<code>Worker</code>&nbsp;at&nbsp;C. This allows you to control the behaviour of the&nbsp;<code>Worker</code>&nbsp;and get it to misbehave when you need it to in the tests that check handling of error conditions.</p>



<p>At&nbsp;D&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>MyApiTest,</code>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<code>fini</code>&nbsp;method is annotated so that it is run after (<code>@After</code>) each test (<code>@Test</code>). It checks that the test that has just been run has correctly verified that every interaction by your API with the mock has been accounted for with a&nbsp;<code>verify</code>&nbsp;call. This will trap any unexpected interactions by your API with the&nbsp;<code>Worker</code>.</p>



<p>At&nbsp;E&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>MyApiTest,</code>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<code>mockWorker</code>&nbsp;is changed for just that test to throw an exception instead of returning a result. This allows you to check that all the error conditions that can occur are dealt with by your API.</p>



<p>Other interesting aspects to note about this test are:</p>



  The test methods have unusual names. They provide a description of what the test is doing and the expected outcome. They often have the form&nbsp;<code>`&lt;method name&gt; should &lt;do|not do&gt; &lt;something&gt;`.</code>  There are many powerful testing libraries that can make your test easier to read and maintain. The&nbsp;<code>shouldThrow</code>&nbsp;method is used to check that the&nbsp;<code>doWork</code>&nbsp;method throws an exception and that it is the the correct exception.  The comments&nbsp;<code>given</code>,&nbsp;<code>when</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>then</code>&nbsp;are encouraged because they make the tests easier to read and make it clear which part of the code is setup, invocation and checking for expected results.  



 Spy versus mock 



<p></p>



<p>There are situations where using a spy instead of a mock object may be beneficial. A mock is appropriate when you want to replace all the methods of an object. A spy can be used to replace a small number of methods on a real object. This is particularly useful on objects with many methods.</p>



<p>Imagine you have an API that uses&nbsp;<code>android.content.Context</code>&nbsp;which is a very common class with many methods.</p>







<p>And of course you want to test it well but mocking out the&nbsp;Context&nbsp;class would be tiresome — after all, your API only uses one method. This is where a spy is useful.</p>











 Testing on an Android device or emulator 



<p></p>



<p>Testing with mocks under the control of&nbsp;<code>JUnit</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>Robolectric</code>&nbsp;is a great way to really exercise your code, but it’s not the real world. Writing a test that runs on Android and makes use of the real environment will give you an extra level of confidence that you are using the right APIs on the platform and that you are using the environment correctly and have all the necessary permissions. This is very valuable when you are dealing with connections over a network, local databases or any other type of specialised API.&nbsp;</p>







<p>This test focuses on checking that the API operates correctly under normal conditions when run on an Android device or emulator. Interesting aspects of this test are:</p>



  The method names have to be proper Java identifiers to be run on Android.&nbsp;  A different runtime environment is required for on device tests (<code>@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)</code>).  No mocks are being used.  



<p>It is possible that setting up an integration test that can authenticate with your servers to run the tests may be difficult. This will depend on the nature of your API and authentication mechanisms. Don’t immediately throw this in the ‘too hard basket.’ At Anonyome we design our systems so that we always have a test authentication mechanism that can be used instead of the production authentication system by developers during development and by automated tests. Naturally this must be done very carefully to avoid introducing a security hole, but if you can achieve this you will have a well-tested system in which you will have confidence.</p>



 Testing an app screen 



<p></p>



<p>When building an app, it is good practice to structure your code so that each screen can be tested thoroughly in isolation. Generally at Anonyome we use the VIPER design pattern for each of our screens. This pattern leads us to naturally break up the parts of each screen into pieces that can be easily separated. Each piece is supplied with the APIs it needs, usually at construction, making it easy to mock these pieces and then use the&nbsp;<code>verify</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>verifyNoMoreInteractions</code>&nbsp;methods to check we have accounted for all the places our screen interacts with other parts of the app.</p>



<p>Here is a simplified example of a screen implemented as a VIPER module:</p>







<p>Because the classes of the screen communicate to each other through interfaces, it is easy to test each part of the screen in isolation. Here is an example of how the presenter test might look:</p>







 Visual testing with Espresso 



<p></p>



<p>While it’s good practice to test all your screens in isolation with unit tests and mocks, this can’t give you confidence that your app actually hangs together. Unit tests can’t check that the flow of screens in your app is correct and that the right screen is shown in the right order. This is where visual testing with Espresso comes in.</p>



<p>Espresso tests invoke an&nbsp;<code>Activity</code>&nbsp;within your app and then simulate clicking on views, entering text, scrolling and all the other actions a real user would perform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso">articles</a>&nbsp;on how to write Espresso tests available on the Android Developers site and elsewhere, so I won’t repeat that material here.</p>



<p>When you start developing an Espresso test for the first time using the Espresso APIs you very quickly end up with a test with hundreds of lines of calls of the Espresso methods. This usually results in a long test that can be very difficult to understand for developers who have to maintain the code after you.</p>



<p>To combat this there is a pattern for developing Espresso tests that we have adopted at Anonyome. We use a robot pattern for our tests. Each screen of your app has an associated robot that knows about the controls of that screen and sometimes how to navigate to it from when the app is launched.</p>







<p>Using the robot the test becomes much simpler and easier to maintain:</p>







 Recipes 



<p></p>



 @VisibleForTesting 



<p>There may be parts of your app that you need to expose to test code so that it can check for correct operation. This can be done by making those parts more widely visible and annotating them with&nbsp;<code>@VisibleForTesting</code>which tells the IDE that only tests can exploit the wider visibility of this item.</p>







 Capturing arguments from calls to mocks 



<p></p>



<p>When using a mock there may be times that at the end of the test you want to check that not only was the method of the mock called but it was called with the correct arguments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you only want to check a few of the arguments of the call there is the&nbsp;<code>argThat</code>&nbsp;matcher that can help. In this example we want to verify that our code invoked an&nbsp;<code>Activity</code>&nbsp;with the correct action.</p>







<p>If you have more complicated checks that you wish to perform on the method arguments, you can capture the value(s) with an&nbsp;argumentCaptor&nbsp;and perform all sorts of checks. In this example we want to verify that our code invoked an&nbsp;Activity&nbsp;with the correct information inside the&nbsp;Intent.</p>







 Conclusion 



<p></p>



<p>If you are building an app, use a combination of unit tests and Espresso tests to give you excellent coverage and confidence your app is working properly. If it’s an SDK, then the combination of unit tests and integration tests will do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To take advantage of the full power of mocks and spies in unit tests, you may have to structure your code so that is exposes the interfaces your code uses to communicate with other parts of the app or operating system. This will allow you to thoroughly check all the paths through your code.</p>



<p>Use the robot pattern to make your Espresso tests concise, readable and maintainable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How regulatory risk and growth go hand in hand</p>
<p>The fintech revolution has led to significant disruption in the financial services and banking sector. Through lower cost, fast development, use of better technology, and superior <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ekyc-europe-regulation-customer-experience/">customer experiences</a>, fintechs operating in every banking area have impacted the way banks innovate and customers bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As fintechs consider their growth plans, there are many factors to consider, such as international expansion, what type of additional licenses to obtain to expand their product suite and how to utilise the most innovative technologies. These considerations and subsequent decisions lead to increasingly complex regulatory requirements and more regulatory risk, specifically in the area of KYC and AML. fintechs must essentially balance between sustainable growth plans and taking on the right amount of regulatory risk. Without considering regulatory risks due to new licenses and international expansion, fintechs run the risk of a material impact on the business.&nbsp;</p>
 Regulatory risks every fintech should consider 
<p>The European eKYC mix varies by country, with different options, norms, and standards. Similar national identity systems in Scandinavia, such as BankID, make for a relatively easy international expansion for a fintech based in Denmark to expand into Sweden or Norway. However, most countries experience differences not just in national KYC regulations but also in how the majority of customers approach data privacy and views on using fully digital financial services. For example, a UK fintech looking to expand in Germany will need to consider different KYC regulations stipulated by the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">BaFin (German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority)</a> and a higher proportion of customers who value digital privacy and may not have experience in undertaking digital KYC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second risk involves acquiring new licenses to operate. In general, fintechs either hold an e-money institution, a banking license, or passport off the license held by a Banks as a Service (BaaS) provider.&nbsp; Fintechs tend to start with either an e-money license (EMI)&nbsp; or using a BaaS provider, as the time, resources, and capital requirements for a banking license are arduous. However, as fintech “grow up,” they acquire the coveted banking license, either by application or by acquiring an existing bank. When a fintech company becomes a licensed bank, there is greater regulatory scrutiny and requirements. Although the door is opened to offer a broader range of products and services such as loans and investments, new products are inherently subjected to greater risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A third risk applicable to fintechs is how to implement and potentially experiment with new technologies which could be subject to regulation. Fintechs pride themselves on their “digital-first” mentality. Specifically, fintechs operating in the cryptocurrency space, or using AI and Machine Learning for robo-advice or lending products, face a high risk of medium to long term regulation in how these technologies can be used in a financial services context, regardless of the type of license they hold.<br>
</p>
<p>Although fintechs face a range of regulatory risks as they scale, maintaining and re-assesing&nbsp;an effective risk management strategy and implementing future-proof KYC solutions are key.&nbsp;</p>
 Finding a future-proof solution to mitigate regulatory risk 
<p>An eKYC solution, such as AI-driven ID verification is one way fintechs can ensure they are mitigating regulatory risks at almost any stage of their growth plans. These solutions are highly customizable, ensuring that fintechs are adhering to the necessary KYC requirements based on their license, technology uses, and geographies they operate in, and provide a seamless customer experience, a critical factor as fintech disruption has been the result of putting a good UX front and center. Solutions that can also similarly <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML screening and monitoring</a> with KYC can create a quicker, user friendly and memorable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/customer-onboarding-banking-balance-security-ux/">onboarding experience</a>, ensuring fintechs keep ahead in the battle for user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For fintechs from various areas, such as Buy-Now-Pay-Later companies, early and late stage cryptocurrency companies and fintechs with an EMI looking to broaden their product offering with a full-banking license, regulatory risk should be top of mind. In particular, mitigating risks through a future-proof KYC strategy are critical in ensuring the technological, product, legal and cultural growth of any fintech are aligned to the future vision and plans for growth. Looking to a customizable, future-proof eKYC solution, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AI-driven ID verification</a>, can ensure that your fintech can seamlessly launch in new markets, mitigate significant changes in maintaining compliance with the addition of new licenses, and mitigate risks when using new and unchartered technologies.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the sixth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/alvinTIOx">Alvin</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyPH">Philippines Community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I first heard about Ontology via a website called stakingrewards.com. I liked the idea of decentralized identity (DID) and also the staking reward opportunities.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I own some ONT tokens and wanted to give my full support. I like the Ontology brand and&nbsp;product.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>The key role of a Harbinger is to increase awareness about Ontology, grow the community, educate newcomers about Ontology’s products and earning opportunities, and answer any questions from the community.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Being part of the Ontology community is very important because I interact with other like-minded people and stay up-to-date with Ontology’s latest developments.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>The Harbinger program. Other projects don’t have a community-oriented program like this. Ontology has a variety of local language communities to accommodate community members from different parts of the&nbsp;world.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>Twitter, Facebook, and Telegram. I really want to have a YouTube channel as well but I don’t have enough funds to set one up. I don’t have a camera or microphone for live streaming. One day in the future I hope to be able to start a channel to help support Ontology.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>I received Ontology merchandise, including Ontology T-shirts, a bag and stickers. I earned these from my service as a Harbinger. My advice would be to get active in the project, study it and its products and share your knowledge with&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Growing, active, consistent.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Doing AMAs is great but I would like to see it in all local communities, not only in the ONTO Wallet Telegram group. For example on Binancei, every time there is a new project, an AMA is held in all of their local communities. Now NFTs and GameFi are trending, it would be great to have an NFT game Ontology network like HyperDragon.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Three years of growth is a great milestone, already. Many partnerships and EVM integration coming will bring great products to Ontology. The community needs to be consistent in letting the world know how great Ontology is so we can onboard more&nbsp;members.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the seventh interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Sterke vereenvoudiging gemeentelijke dienstverlening door eenduidige procesvoering 



<p>BS&amp;F en Ockto breiden hun samenwerking uit. In het introductiejaar zijn al meer dan 20 gemeenten Ockto in combinatie met het platform Gezondverzekerd.nl van BS&amp;F gaan gebruiken om gemeentelijke regelingen op rechtmatigheid te toetsen. Beide partijen kijken terug op een succesvol jaar en intensiveren nu hun samenwerking met de ontwikkeling van één uniforme applicatie voor het gemeentelijke domein.</p>



<p>Met deze applicatie kunnen minima en kwetsbaren eenvoudig inzicht krijgen voor welke regelingen zij in aanmerking komen en deze via één uniform aanvraagproces eenvoudig aanvragen. De nieuwe applicatie biedt gemeenten een volledig geautomatiseerd toetsingsproces ten behoeve van een efficiënte uitvoering van deze regelingen. Met het ontwikkelen van één uniforme applicatie willen BS&amp;F en Ockto de&nbsp;versnippering van processen rondom gemeentelijke regelingen oplossen.</p>



 Eén proces voor alle gemeentelijke regelingen 



<p>Binnen de nieuwe applicatie hoeven gegevens slechts eenmalig, volledig AVG-proof, aangeleverd te worden via de Ockto-app. Daarmee worden de gegevens in één keer correct, volledig en digitaal aangeleverd. Via de Ockto-app haalt een inwoner de benodigde gegevens rechtstreeks op bij overheidsbronnen zoals de Belastingdienst en het UWV. Na toestemming van de aanvrager worden de gegevens verstuurd en direct ingelezen in de Backoffice applicatie van BS&amp;F, waar de gemeente de getoetste aanvragen kan inzien en behandelen.</p>



<p>De applicatie maakt op basis van de aangeleverde data direct inzichtelijk voor welke regelingen de inwoner in aanmerking komt. Zo worden behoefte voor aanvullende regelingen en kwalitatieve toetsing sneller bij elkaar gebracht en processen voor de vele verschillende regelingen gestandaardiseerd.</p>



 Reductie administratieve lasten van wel 60% 



<p>Dit levert een forse besparing op van de administratieve lasten bij gemeenten.Laurens Krol, directeur BS&amp;F: “In een Randstedelijke gemeente waar onder andere de toetsing wordt uitgevoerd van de Gemeentepolis leidt dit al tot een reductie van 60% van de benodigde capaciteit. Het inzetten van de applicatie voor de andere gemeentelijke regelingen biedt kansen voor verdere optimalisatie.”</p>



 Aansluiting met andere initiatieven in het sociale domein om versnippering te voorkomen 



<p>Andere initiatieven in het (gemeentelijke) sociale domein kunnen hun oplossing ook aansluiten op het BS&amp;F platform. Hiertoe wordt&nbsp;<a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgezondverzekerd.nl%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Crob.janssen%40bsenf.nl%7Cea21f065027b4b90082208d948292322%7Cfd0a521d354d4e2db363f5d833376d6f%7C0%7C0%7C637620163791275099%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=ZotG01jZrFxvsCX6pKhzrpe6VxwE%2B1RQZMUmdcRTC30%3D&amp;reserved=0">Gezondverzekerd.nl</a>&nbsp;ook toegankelijk gemaakt voor andere partijen. Zo ontstaat er een brede samenwerking, die alle partijen in de keten van (schuld)hulpverlening ondersteunt om minima financieel, fysiek en mentaal fitter te maken en de uitvoering sterk te vereenvoudigen. Auke Dirkmaat, Head of Sales Ockto: “Hiermee wordt voor alle partijen het oerwoud aan regelingen inzichtelijk gemaakt in een uniforme oplossing voor alle regelingen binnen het sociale domein. Toegankelijk voor iedereen, op basis van betrouwbare gegevens die zorgen voor een enorme efficiëntieslag bij de toetsing op rechtmatigheid”.</p>



 Over BS&amp;F 



<p>BS&amp;F biedt al ruim 20 jaar toegang tot zorg en ondersteuning van kwetsbare inwoners. Via Gezondverzekerd.nl kunnen in meer dan 300 gemeenten inwoners met een laag inkomen een Gemeentepolis afsluiten. Onlangs kondigde BS&amp;F aan samen te gaan met Intermediad. Intermediad is marktleider in stadspassen voor diverse doelgroepen waaronder minima&nbsp;en ontzorgt met Bureau Minimaregelingen gemeenten in de uitvoering hiervan.</p>

<p>The growing digitalization of our lives means that we interact with thousands of apps, hundreds of companies, and possibly millions of users each year, depending on what we do&nbsp;online.</p><p>While these interactions have opened a world of possibilities, it has also greatly increased the risk of data breaches because we don’t know where our data and identities are stored, who accesses them, and where they are used. These concerns of privacy and security have led to the evolution of a framework called the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign identity</a> (SSI), where the owner of a data controls where his/her data resides, chooses where to use it, and determines with whom it can be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>The widespread implementation of SSI or any other framework for that matter requires a set of standards to make the data interoperable and to create an ecosystem that will leverage its power. One such standard implementation is the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) that uses claims or data objects called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p><p>As a user, you might wonder why in the world you should embrace VCs and what’s in it for you. Well, here are some reasons to use&nbsp;them.</p> Follows the Principles of Decentralization <p>Verifiable Credentials put you right at the center of the system, as per the principles of decentralization.</p><p>Contrast this with some of the more prevalent systems such as the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Federated Identity Management</a> (FIM), where the identity provider is at the center of the system and determines where and how data must be stored and used. Sometimes, these identity providers even decide which apps can be given access to your data, and in the process, creates a centralized and monopolized system.</p><p>But with VCs, the data owners determine the applications that can access their data. In fact, these owners sit in the middle of what’s called a trust triangle, thereby connecting the issuers and verifiers in an ecosystem.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. An individual (holder) has taken COVID vaccination at a healthcare company and the details of this vaccination have to be verified by airport authorities before the holder can board a flight. Here, the healthcare provider is the issuer and the airport authority is the verifier, and these two entities are connected by the holder, thereby making him/her the central point of the transaction.</p><p>Thus, VCs empower decentralization because every piece of data is owned and controlled by the individual holder and not by any single&nbsp;entity.</p> Interoperable across&nbsp;Systems <p>VCs are interoperable across many systems and can be used in almost every possible scenario. Here is a list of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">use-cases</a> where VCs can be used and PoCs developed based on&nbsp;them.</p><p>The biggest advantage of VCs is they are interoperable. Let’s say, you have your date of birth as a VC that’s stored in a digital wallet. Now, you can use this VC by itself to prove that you are above 18 years or you can combine it with other VCs to create a verifiable presentation and share it with the chosen verifier.</p><p>The number of places where you can use these VCs is virtually endless. Going back to the date of birth VC, you can show it as proof of age to buy alcohol or you can combine it with a bunch of other VCs into a verifiable presentation to open a bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>The possibilities and use cases are truly&nbsp;endless.</p> Secure and Authentic <p>VCs are a safe and secure way to ensure that your data is seen only by the intended recipient, which is often the verifier, though it can also be seen by companies to whom you choose to sell your&nbsp;data.</p><p>All VCs are secured by <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">Public Key Cryptography</a> and digital signatures, so they can’t be seen by unauthorized entities. Further, these encryption mechanisms help the verifiers to attest to the authenticity of the data and the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>In this sense, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> are a win-win situation for everyone involved. It creates business opportunities for the issuer, secures the data for the holder, and ensures the authenticity of the data for the verifier.</p> Complete Control over your&nbsp;Data <p>One of the driving principles of SSI is data control and ownership, and VCs help to achieve&nbsp;that.</p><p>Typically, the issuer provides a VC to a holder, which is stored by the latter in a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a>. The holder (which is you) has the power to decide what parts of a VC should be combined in a verifiable presentation sent to the verifier.</p><p>For example, if an issuer has given your full name, date of birth, and a government ID as a VC, using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signatures</a>, you can just take one credential, say your government ID, put it in a presentation, and send it to the verifier.</p><p>That’s the level of granular control you have over who views your information.</p> Protects Privacy <p>One of the biggest issues with the current digital identity systems is a lack of privacy. Besides hackers, your online activities can be monitored by government agencies, your Internet Service providers (ISPs), and&nbsp;others.</p><p>But these issues are non-existent with VCs because every piece of information is digitally signed. The issuer encrypts the data using the holder’s public key, and this credential can only be viewed by the holder, thanks to the public-private key pair in digital encryption.</p><p>Hence, no one besides you and those with whom you want to share your data can encroach into your private&nbsp;life.</p> Meets Compliance <p>As governments understand the need for security and privacy, they are pushing towards a decentralized digital environment with the required legislation. A case in point is the EU’s Digital Wallet announcement and the&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">GDPR</a>.</p><p>As governments move farther on this front, you need a system that will meet these compliance requirements, and as you have guessed, VCs perfectly fit the&nbsp;bill.</p> Easy to Implement <p>VCs are easy to implement from a developers’ standpoint and easy to use from an end-user perspective.</p><p>Affinidi’s tech stack gives all the APIs and SDKs you need to build a VC-based application, and it also offers support to developers throughout the development process.</p><p>As for end-users, accessing and sharing VCs is easy too, as they can hold it in a digital wallet that’s controlled by them, and share it by combining it all in a verifiable presentation. A friendly UX can hide the complexities for the end-user, making it a breeze to securely share credentials with anyone in the&nbsp;world.</p> Power to Monetize your&nbsp;Data <p>VCs give you the option to monetize your data with the company you want. This provides two major benefits straight out of the box. First off, you get to make money out of your data instead of an identity provider raking in profits from your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Secondly, you know who is using your data and how it’s likely to be used. In this sense, you make money on your terms and through a company or way that’s most comfortable for&nbsp;you.</p><p>To conclude, VCs are likely to be a gamechanger and an integral part of the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/innovation-in-digital-identity-and-credentials-in-the-post-covid-world-f182a5743ce8">future</a> given the many benefits they offer to individuals, businesses, and the web ecosystem as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>To learn more about VCs and how you can use them to build applications, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> or email&nbsp;us.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

<p>Per velocizzare le procedure di apertura di un conto Widiba, dallo scorso 21 giugno è possibile usare l’identità digitale InfoCert: pochissimi minuti per sbrigare le pratiche. Il direttore IT e Innovazione Daniela Pivato: “Puntiamo a rendere l’interazione col cliente più semplice, intuitiva e di valore”.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Ad oggi, sono più di&nbsp;21 milioni gli italiani in possesso delle credenziali SPID. Lo strumento è nato per rispondere alle esigenze dei cittadini di interfacciarsi in maniera smart ai servizi della Pubblica Amministrazione, ma oggi finalmente si registra un’altra &nbsp;importante svolta verso il settore privato.</p>



<p>Grazie al supporto di InfoCert infatti, Banca Widiba, l’istituto di credito “digital native” – che ha appena vinto il premio innovazione Abi per la digital transformation – aggiunge un nuovo tassello nell’ambito della strategia votata ai servizi innovativi, integrando la soluzione di InfoCert nella sua piattaforma per certificare l’identità dei clienti e i processi di contrattualizzazione.</p>



 Widiba e InfoCert insieme per una migliore customer experience 



<p>Widiba è la prima banca in Italia a sfruttare le potenzialità dello strumento SPID per aprire un nuovo conto bancario. Questa scelta è derivata anche da una lunga collaborazione con InfoCert, che già da anni supporta l’istituto di credito nell’acquisizione di nuovi clienti e nella gestione delle pratiche bancarie.</p>



<blockquote><p>Volevamo cambiare profondamente le normali procedure operative bancarie fatte di montagne di moduli di carta da firmare, controfirmare e inviare per posta o consegnare alla filiale più vicina.</p>Daniela Pivato, Direttrice IT e Innovazione Digitale di Banca Widiba</blockquote>



<p>Il processo di onboarding è completamente paperless, basato sulle soluzioni di Firma Digitale e Posta Elettronica Certificata di InfoCert, che insieme costituiscono la cosiddetta TOP – Trusting Onboarding Platform.</p>



<blockquote><p>Non si è trattato semplicemente di acquistare due prodotti, ma di studiare insieme come integrare efficacemente le due soluzioni nei nostri sistemi, così da garantire semplicità e fluidità all’intera procedura di onboarding. La nostra volontà era quella di traghettare la clientela nell’era digitale nel modo più naturale possibile. Ma anche quella di aumentare la conversion dei conti e il cross selling di nuovi prodotti.</p>Daniela Pivato</blockquote>



<p>L’automazione dei processi ripetitivi, oltre a migliorare la customer experience in chiave digitale, ha anche permesso alla banca di risparmiare grazie all’eliminazione di stampe, invii postali, ricezione e controlli manuali dei documenti.</p>



<blockquote><p>Nella convinzione che i clienti vadano premiati, dagli inizi abbiamo stipulato un accordo ad hoc con InfoCert per cedere loro gratuitamente la casella PEC attivata con l’apertura del conto, così che possano disporne anche per fini personali, al di là degli utilizzi legati alle comunicazioni da e per la banca.</p>Daniela Pivato</blockquote>



<p>L’onboarding con SPID permette di aprire un conto con Banca Widiba in circa 5 minuti, in linea con le esperienze offerte dalle più note neobanche e digital challenger, italiane e non, incontrando il favore dei clienti e dei prospect come metodo di riconoscimento più comodo.</p>



<blockquote><p>A poche settimane dal lancio oltre il 50% degli utenti Self, ossia che operano sul conto in totale autonomia, lo ha infatti scelto come modalità preferita. Insomma, anche la collaborazione con InfoCert ci permette di continuare a proporci come anticipatori dei trend del mercato e protagonisti del cambiamento.</p>Daniela Pivato</blockquote>

 Sneller duidelijkheid over hypotheekaanvraag door online verzamelen documenten 



<p>Vanaf 31 augustus 2021 biedt De Hypotheker de Ockto-app aan al haar klanten aan. Hiermee onderscheidt zij zich in de markt door bronontsluiting als nieuwe standaard te hanteren voor het aanleveren van gegevens. Met de Ockto-app kunnen klanten via verschillende overheidsportalen zelf alle benodigde documenten voor een hypotheekaanvraag ophalen en verzamelen. Doordat al deze data via één digitaal loket worden ontsloten, zijn deze in één keer volledig beschikbaar, waardoor klanten eerder zekerheid krijgen over hun hypotheekaanvraag. Doordat alle digitale gegevens al zijn gevalideerd, kan de geldverstrekker de actuele en correcte documenten bovendien direct accepteren.</p>



<p>Met de introductie van de Ockto-app bood De Hypotheker een deel van haar klanten al sinds 2019 de mogelijkheid om documenten die nodig zijn voor de acceptatie van de hypotheekaanvraag, digitaal te verzamelen. Nu breidt zij deze dienstverlening uit naar al haar klanten, waardoor de Ockto-app de nieuwe standaard is voor het aanleveren van de benodigde hypotheekgegevens. Het enige wat klanten hoeven te doen, is de app downloaden, waarna zij worden gevraagd een QR-code te scannen in de Mijn Hypotheker-omgeving. Vervolgens wordt klanten stap voor stap meegenomen door de app. Per overheidsbron worden zij gevraagd met hun DigiD in te loggen om de documenten te ontsluiten.</p>



<p>Alle benodigde informatie kan op deze manier eenvoudig en veilig worden opgehaald &nbsp;bij verschillende <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/databronnen/">overheidsportalen</a>, zoals MijnOverheid, het UWV, de Belastingdienst en Mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl. De documenten worden vervolgens via Mijn Hypotheker direct in het systeem geplaatst. Daarnaast worden gegevens – zoals personalia, inkomens- en pensioengegevens – zo veel mogelijk automatisch ingevuld. Alle documenten worden opgeslagen in de <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/hypotheekacceptatie/">Ockto Brondata </a><a href="https://www.ockto.nl/hypotheekacceptatie/">Service</a>, een beveiligde database waar geldverstrekkers toegang tot kunnen krijgen voor het accepteren van de hypotheekaanvraag. Hiermee beschikken klanten over de zekerheid dat alle data veilig worden verzameld en gegevens niet worden opgeslagen. Ockto versleutelt alle persoonlijke informatie, waardoor alleen de partij die toestemming heeft de informatie kan inzien.</p>



 Snel duidelijkheid over hypotheekaanvraag bij De Hypotheker 



<p>Door de gevalideerde data kan een hypotheekadviseur in een veel eerder stadium zekerheid bieden over de hypotheekaanvraag. Dankzij een samenwerking met een groeiend aantal geldverstrekkers kunnen de ontsloten brondata na toestemming van de klant ook door deze geldverstrekkers worden opgevraagd. Omdat het door alle partijen gevalideerde brondata betreft, kan een aanvraag bij de samenwerkende geldverstrekker vrijwel direct worden geaccepteerd. “We zijn erg blij dat wij de Ockto-app vanaf nu standaard kunnen aanbieden voor alle hypotheekaanvragen: van de aankoop van een woning, het oversluiten van een hypotheek tot het financieren van een verbouwing”, zegt Jasper Cuijten, directeur Business Development van De Hypotheker. “Doordat zij alle brondata via deze app kunnen ontsluiten, bieden we klanten veel meer gemak tijdens het verzamelen en delen van alle gegevens voor hun hypotheekaanvraag. Samen met hun hypotheekadviseur doorlopen zij vervolgens in een aantal overzichtelijke stappen het financieringsproces, zodat zij snel zekerheid krijgen over hun hypotheekaanvraag.”</p>

<p>Are non-fungible tokens the biggest thing in crypto ever? Apparently, they are bigger than <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=NFTs+%22bigger+than+defi%22&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk020T7TNS77c1oHsAa0VVXY8uxGnHg%3A1627771163791&amp;ei=G9EFYYvUL-iE9PwP3P65WA&amp;oq=NFTs+%22bigger+than+defi%22&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBwgjEK4CECc6BwgAEEcQsAM6BQghEKsCSgQIQRgAUJ2aAVj-nAFgkZ8BaAJwAngAgAGhAYgBiwSSAQMzLjKYAQCgAQHIAQTAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLzfiPsI7yAhVoAp0JHVx_DgsQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfZDS9XGl0A">Hip Hop</a>, and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/polygon-studios-blockchain-gaming-nfts">Hollywood</a>. We’ll see. But the prospect of immutably tracking ownership of things without centralized intermediaries certainly has people’s attention. And, in many cases, their money: the first half of 2021 saw <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nft-sales-climb-to-2-47b-in-first-half-2021-report">close to $2.5B in NFT sales</a>, with some tokens <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_non-fungible_tokens">going for millions apiece</a>.</p><p>I won’t try to make this article an NFT explainer, but the basic idea is that NFTs are meant to be unique representations of ownership of an object. Objects can be digital, like a particular tweet or image file, or, in principle, physical, like a house. </p><p>To date, NFTs have been versions of smart contracts, meaning they are programs that execute particular functions using a blockchain-based computing network such as Ethereum’s. For example, an NFT might have not only a means of its ownership being transferred (with that record then stored on the blockchain), but also of a royalty being automatically sent back to the original artist every time that happens (with payment sent automatically by the blockchain network).</p><p>So, it might seem that NFTs rely on blockchain technology. It turns out, though, that NFTs are more straightforward, more versatile, and more efficient to run on Holochain than on blockchain. In this article we look at three ways this is true and why. But first a word on what it means for something to be ‘fungible’.</p> On Fungibility <p>When an item is fungible, it’s interchangeable with other instances of the item:</p>  A can of soup is more-or-less interchangeable with other cans produced from the same batch.  A brand-new tennis racket is more-or-less interchangeable with other brand-new rackets of the same make and model.  Units of a currency are designed to be interchangeable with all other units of that currency.  <p>Items in real-world systems, meanwhile, are rarely fungible:</p>  An acre of land isn’t interchangeable with other acres of land. This is why we have title records that rely on wordy descriptions of property, containing latitudes, longitudes, landmarks, and other surveyor notes.  Your favorite houseplant isn’t interchangeable with similar plants.  Friends are not interchangeable, despite what our Facebook counts might imply.  <p>Actions are also not interchangeable:</p>  When someone says “I love you”, it’s not equivalent to when someone else says it, or even when the same person says it at a different place and time. The meaning and value of the statement is inherently connected to the context in which it was spoken.  When someone dunks a basketball, it’s a unique dunk at a unique moment in time. The two points are equivalent to all the other points scored in the game, but the play has more nuance and more value than just the points scored: it provides momentum, it makes highlight reels, and it might build fan excitement or star power in a particular way that a different dunk in a different moment does not.  <p>And, of course, physical artworks and acts of art are not fungible: paintings, hand-made sculptures, particular performances of a piece of music.</p><p>What about a digital work? This one is a little trickier, because digital works can be easily replicated. But the movement toward NFTs is predicated on an idea that someone can declare a digital work to be scarce– “there will only be one NFT representing this basketball highlight clip” or “I will sell only 50 NFTs representing this painting” – and then the item, or at least its representation(s), are made scarce by that act. The token(s) representing the digital work are non-fungible.</p><p>Alright, with that established, here are three reasons NFTs make a lot of sense on Holochain.</p> I. Holochain NFTs are Efficient <p>Because blockchains are historically designed to manage interchangeable units of currency, there’s no inherent function to make units unique. When Alice spends 10 Bitcoin from her wallet, there’s no way of identifying whether the units she’s spending are ones she got from Bob, Carol, or elsewhere. It’s like water scooped into a bucket: when you scoop some out, you don’t know which inbound scoop of water the molecules you’re getting came from.</p><p>So in order to create a unique representation of something, an additional layer must be created: smart contracts that uniquely identify assets and keep the NFTs distinct from one another as their ownership is transferred. The idea is to make sure that a particular token isn’t just a representation of a certain piece of art; it is the token representation of the piece of art.</p><p>Holochain is different in its principle of provenance: every piece of data, everything ever said or done, is associated with its source. This means that every piece of data, including every token, is inherently unique – the data itself plus its source information – so no additional code is required to keep instances of data distinct from one another. Thus, an NFT on Holochain is an extraordinarily simple application: it’s just a transfer protocol, a means of assigning the token from one person to another.</p><p>Holochain’s built-in uniqueness saves on all kinds of work and costs relative to blockchain-based NFTs – developer work, storage work, and especially computing work, all of which lead to energy consumption and cost. We <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">wrote previously</a> about how blockchain’s need to reach global consensus results in substantial costs (usually called gas fees), transaction delays, ecological impact, and other inefficiency challenges. With NFTs this is even more the case, since blockchain NFTs are <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/true-or-false-a-single-nft-can-power-a-european-household-for-1-5-months">particularly energy-intensive</a> relative to ordinary transacting. Plus, as with all blockchain smart contracts, nodes are required to retain all transaction data forever, so there’s a hefty storage cost in addition to computing cost. And that’s to say nothing of storing the actual digital works that NFTs often represent.</p> II. Holochain NFTs Can Store the Actual Digital Work <p>Blockchain-based NFTs are not the actual file they represent, nor do they contain the actual file they represent. The digital work needs to be stored somewhere else – somewhere public – in order for it to be clear what the token represents. But how meaningful is it, really, to own a token of something that anyone else can access and download for themselves any time?</p><p>It’s no wonder that people question the point of NFTs and debate whether an item that’s not actually scarce can just be declared to be scarce and sold as such. Sure, there’s a case for saying the answer is yes – after all, that’s sort of what money is – but wouldn’t it be better if it were possible to buy and sell the actual unique digital file along with the NFT? Then there’s just no question.</p><p>Holochain makes that possible because files can be stored privately on one’s own personal ledger of events known as a source chain. The record representing the file’s ownership is made visible to the network, along with maybe a thumbnail of the image, but the file itself does not need to be published, even as the two are inextricably linked. This way, an artist can create a digital asset that is truly unique (or limited to a certain number of ‘prints’). When an NFT is signed over to a new owner, the actual file can get sent along with it, without sharing a copy with the world, similar to transferring a physical art piece.</p><p>It’s also easy to create ‘replicas’ of the digital work – versions that can be published widely that differ just a bit, visibly or invisibly, from the original(s). This way, the work can still serve a public purpose and/or become widely known, even as the ‘real’ version, which might be the highest-resolution version, lives safely with its owner… again, just like in the physical art world.</p> III. Holochain NFTs Can Represent Real-World Works and Property <p>How do we know for sure that a blockchain-based NFT represents the work it claims to represent? For digital works the mechanism is reasonably reliable: a unique ‘hash’, or fingerprint, of the digital file is created and stored as part of the token. But for non-digital works, the mechanism breaks down. There’s no way to be sure that the NFT you’re buying is the NFT that corresponds to the piece of land, the boat, or the painting in question. It’s a version of blockchain’s oracle problem: with everyone being anonymous and no central authority, it’s virtually impossible to incorporate real-world events (such as the creation of a painting) into on-chain events (such as designating a token to uniquely represent the painting). For this reason, blockchain-based NFTs have so far focused on digital works only – quite a major limitation.</p><p>Whereas blockchains try to provide anonymity, Holochain is optimized for accountability. Holochain’s provenance means that it’s always evident who created the NFT; its creation is digitally signed by the creator’s private keys. If an NFT supposedly represents The Starry Night, you can check to see if it was created by Vincent Van Gogh, or (more likely) the Museum of Modern Art. Of course you might have some real-world homework to make sure that the MOMA was the rightful owner of the painting at the time of the NFT’s creation, but records already exist for that, and in any case it’s a much smaller problem than one in which anyone can anonymously create an NFT claiming to represent the painting.</p><p>(Yes, you’d also need a reliable way of knowing that the private key account claiming to be the museum is actually the museum, but this is easily accomplished through <a href="https://hackmd.io/Y4QSGqn6T_amCvHv6T9f6A">Holochain’s identity protocols</a>.)</p><p>If someone else is trying to sell you The Starry Night, you can readily see the chain of ownership within the NFT’s published records, all the way back to the MOMA if this is the legitimate NFT. So not only are you sure that this NFT truly represents the painting, but you’re also sure that the person claiming to have the current right to sell it truly does.</p> The Future of Ownership <p>With the ability to represent real-world objects, the implications of Holochain NFTs extend well beyond artworks to all kinds of property – land, homes, and vehicles, for starters – pointing to a future of ownership that is digital, reliable, and independent of centralized government records. </p><p>Right now, every time you buy a house, or even refinance one that’s already yours, you pay thousands of dollars for agents to search a patchwork of municipal records systems, to make sure that the property description (still) accurately describes the property and that the title is free and clear. Title insurers currently collect <a href="https://www.firstresearch.com/industry-research/Title-Insurance-Carriers.html">$16B annually in the U.S alone</a>, mainly to ensure that property owners have the rights to sell the property they’re selling (and insure against the possibility that they don’t).</p><p>None of that is necessary in the Holochain age. Each piece of property can simply be referenced by a digital identifier, which could be called a token, that is created by the property’s originator and passed through immutable transfer protocols when a sale is made. Like all data on Holochain, the NFT data is hosted by the owner of the property. (Or on a peer hosting network such as <a href="http://holo.host">Holo</a> – but still affiliated with the property owner’s private signing keys.) The data is then ‘published’ (shared) to a table that is also held among the members of the network.</p><p>Government clerks could still sign every property transfer; we’re not talking here about eliminating municipal systems necessarily, or at least not eliminating them prematurely. But the government no longer needs to manage and host a whole bunch of offline or online infrastructure, and people retain authoritative copies of their own records.</p><p>Permissions can also be set so that owner information is shared only on a need-to-know basis, which could be useful in particular for vehicles, where we expect more privacy than with property ownership.</p><p>There’s precedent for this kind of scenario already. Estonia has converted its property records to being hosted on immutable hash chains. But Estonia did need to build new infrastructure to pull this off, plus the records are still relatively centralized, with government agencies remaining a <a href="https://medium.com/@joshmzemel/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-31bf1866e193">point of enclosure</a> (concentrated power) as well as still incurring overhead that needs to be paid for one way or another.</p><p>When everyone can just speak for themselves about their right to sell their property, with their speaking instantly verifiable just by looking at the record they’re presenting, the tracking of ownership becomes quite simple. So does shipping and logistics, which isn’t chain-of-ownership but is still chain-of-custody: imagine simplified tracking of who delivered what to whom when, making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources,_Events,_Agents">REA accounting</a> easy (HoloREA is building such tools [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uDrVLt4oN8">short video</a>|<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4xcaYnI9iY">full video</a>|<a href="https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea">Github</a>]) as well as improving supply-chain transparency so you can tell where your food, electronics, and other products came from.</p><p>More broadly, provenance around custody is a version of provenance around information: we <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/is-holochain-a-safe-haven-for-dangerous-extremists-or-a-beacon-of-hope-for-accountability-fcbb8f5d38c6">wrote previously</a> about the idea of a Holochain-powered verified web, in which signal (accurate information) is discernible from noise (potential disinformation) because no one can ever claim something was said that wasn’t, or claim something wasn’t said that was.</p><p>It might seem like a stretch to categorize provenance of all information on Holochain, property-related or otherwise, as a version of ‘NFTs’. But, from a technical standpoint, it’s actually not. Every communication and transaction on Holochain, whether it’s sending money, transferring property rights, or ordering a sandwich, is inherently non-fungible because data is always associated with stamps of time and authorship. This makes every entry of data, effectively, a unique token. Thus, Holochain isn’t just an ideal framework for NFTs; it builds the properties everyone wants from NFTs into everything. From a Holochain vantage point in which all data is already unique, the very idea of making data unique, which is what blockchain NFTs jump through hoops to try to do, may begin to seem like an artifact.</p>

<p>Indian Railways is now monitoring commuters with the help of an extensive facial recognition system. The organization has installed nearly 500 cameras to help keep tabs on the millions of passengers that ride its trains on a daily basis.</p>



<p>The network is being rolled out despite the growing public opposition to facial recognition in the country. India’s National Crime Records Bureau has already <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-india-plans-open-bidding-massive-face-recognition-surveillance-system-092001/">opened the bidding</a> for a massive facial recognition system, and the police used the technology to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-indian-police-use-facial-recognition-make-1100-arrests-031308/">arrest more than 1,100 protestors</a> in March of 2020. Those actions have raised the ire of privacy advocates, who have argued that the country needs <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/indian-privacy-advocates-push-stricter-facial-recognition-guidelines-012503/">stricter privacy protections</a> and have asked the government to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iff-calls-three-year-moratorium-biometric-facial-recognition-india-112505/">suspend its use of the technology</a> until such guidelines can be put in place.</p>



<p>The Indian Railways deployment is unlikely to quell those concerns, especially since the NtechLab is providing the facial recognition technology for the system. NtechLab is based in Russia, and operates a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-russian-activists-challenge-moscows-new-facial-recognition-network-013107/">network of more than 100,000 cameras</a> in Moscow. However, it is not at all clear that that network is secure after privacy advocates uncovered a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/pay-for-play-service-offers-unregulated-access-moscows-biometric-facial-recognition-system-111302/">pay-for-play scheme</a> that seemed to give regular civilians access to NtechLab search results. NtechLab also faced criticism for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/software-track-faces-twitter-312192/">developing a FindFace app</a> that could be used to stalk people on social media.</p>



<p>That track record has prompted watchdogs to question the government’s motives when deploying surveillance technology.</p>



<p>“What’s clear from all these projects is that this government is putting surveillance first,” said AI Observatory Founder Divij Joshi. “Often security becomes the go-to excuse for these things, but it is so weak and widely defined with such few safeguards that it could easily turn into moral policing of interfaith couples or activists, or whomever they want.”</p>



<p>In the meantime, NtechLab has continued to grow its customer base despite those privacy concerns. The company recently opened a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ntechlab-brings-controversial-facial-recognition-system-middle-east-081604/">new office in Abu Dhabi</a> to raise its profile in the Middle East, and believes that there is a high demand for its product in India.</p>



<p>“India is a huge market for video surveillance, among the biggest worldwide. This is the entry point to one of the largest clients there,” said NtechLab CEO Andrey Telenkov. “Now it is a few railway stations, but I believe they do want to expand the solution across the entire network.”</p>



<p>The Indian Railways network has now been active for a month, at 30 stations in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. That includes the city of Mumbai, which carries upwards of 7 million passengers every single day. The NtechLab system can count passengers and identify people wearing masks, and can match as many as 50 individuals at the same time.</p>

<p>Amazon is trying to make it easier for people to find their favorite celebrities. To that end, the tech giant has updated its Rekognition facial recognition system to improve its ability to identify the faces of well-known public figures.</p>



<p>The new feature is geared toward media companies, and is designed to help them tag and categorize the photos and footage in their extensive archives. It will also improve the quality of the metadata associated with each image. For example, the improved Rekognition can gauge someone’s facial expression, and determine whether or not they are smiling, which will in turn make it easier for people to find an image with a particular tone or mood.</p>



<p>The service is expected to appeal to news agencies that may need to dig up old images of public figures as they become relevant to the news cycle, or to documentarians searching for old interviews or video highlights. Rekognition will allow people to sift through hundreds of hours of footage in a short amount of time, and will speed up the categorization process, which is incredibly time consuming when performed manually. As a result, the solution will help save money and turn those archives into usable assets for the organizations that possess them.</p>



<p>The updated Rekognition is more accurate, and has been trained to recognize a wider range of celebrities. It is now familiar with tens of thousands of public figures from all over the world, and offers search support for Europe, Japan, and the Asia Pacific region in addition to the United States. It can also add gender tags to the metadata for an image or a video.</p>



<p>Amazon is not the only facial recognition provider with a celebrity tracking feature. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/realnetworks-releases-biometric-video-products-identify-celebrities-060302/">RealNetworks released a StarSearch browser extension</a> in June of 2020, though the public-facing tool was designed primarily for consumers that want to identify familiar faces on streaming platforms, rather than the media companies that own the actual footage.</p>



<p>Amazon has previously come under fire for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/orlando-police-abandon-trial-amazon-rekognition-071905/">selling Rekognition to police</a>. The company would eventually <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/amazon-still-refuses-sell-facial-recognition-law-enforcement-052603/">suspend sales to law enforcement</a> in the wake of George Floyd’s murder (and the subsequent protests) last summer. The celebrity finder is less likely to raise privacy concerns, insofar as it is not being used for surveillance and is instead being applied to footage that has already been released to the public, though critics may still have some lingering doubts about the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aclu-amazons-rekognition-907273/">accuracy of the platform</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imprivata.com/">Imprivata</a> is trying to support healthcare agencies looking to make the transition to the cloud. To that end, the company has made its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/advantech-integrates-imprivatas-onesign-boost-security-medical-devices-092506/">Imprivata OneSign</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/imprivata-epcs-self-enrollment-solution-features-aware-knomi-tech-706071/">Imprivata Confirm ID</a> solutions available on the Microsoft Azure platform.</p>



<p>According to Impirvata, the arrangement will <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/imprivata-explores-digital-transformation-virginia-hospital-060507/">accelerate digital transformation</a> because it will provide healthcare providers with more readily scalable identity management capabilities. OneSign, for example, is a single sign-on (SSO) offering that lets people log in from remote, on-premises, and mobile workstations with either a badge swipe or a fingerprint scan. As a result, it makes an organization more flexible, and ensures that employees always have access to key workplace applications and materials.</p>



<p>Confirm ID, meanwhile, is an authentication and recordkeeping solution that lets organizations fulfill their DEA requirements for the Electronic Prescription of Controlled Substances (EPCS). It supports biometric authentication and hands-free authentication to improve workflows in clinical environments.</p>



<p>The news builds on Imprivata’s existing relationship with Microsoft. The two companies launched <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/imprivata-microsoft-team-healthcare-access-management-805013/">Healthcare Seamless SSO</a> back in 2019, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/imprivata-microsoft-team-up-new-digital-id-solutions-042207/">integrated OneSign with the Azure Active Directory</a> to give healthcare workers access to Microsoft apps in April of 2020.</p>



<p>“We’re pleased to extend our digital identity capabilities to the cloud while deepening our partnership with Microsoft,” said Imprivata CEO Gus Malezis. “Healthcare organizations can securely and conveniently access clinical applications and patient information both inside and outside of the hospital, and from any device, so they can focus on delivering high quality patient care.”</p>

<p>The Biden Administration has asked the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish a new cybersecurity framework to guide organizations in both the private and public sectors.</p>



<p>It is the latest sign of the Administration’s focus on cybersecurity after high-profile hacking events including the SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline security breaches. In May of this year, President Biden <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biden-seeks-establish-clear-cybersecurity-standards-with-executive-order-051807/">signed an executive order</a> mandating federal agencies to implement multi-factor authentication and encryption within a 180-day timeframe; the move was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fido-alliance-praises-bidens-new-mfa-requirements-051707/">praised by the FIDO Alliance</a>, which has long championed 2FA and MFA security.</p>



<p>According to a Fact Sheet issued by the White House this week, the NIST was asked to develop the new cybersecurity framework in consultation with “industry and other partners”. Google, Microsoft, IBM, Coalition, and Travelers have already agreed to work with the NIST on this project, which is broadly aimed at helping organizations to “build secure technology and assess the security of technology,” according to the Fact Sheet.</p>



<p>In a separate but related endeavor, Apple committed to working with its vast network of suppliers to encourage the adoption of security mechanisms including multi-factor authentication after meeting with White House officials. Amazon, meanwhile, committed to making a multi-factor authentication device available to all Amazon Web Services account holders.</p>



<p>Looking to the gas pipeline sector in particular in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, the White House is pushing operators to implement technologies that “provide threat visibility, indications, detection, and warnings,” according to a NextGov report.</p>



<p>It is not yet clear which specific technologies will be in focus for the companies working with the Biden Administration on these cybersecurity efforts, but it’s worth noting that Google, Apple, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft have all displayed interest in biometric security in their respective business activities. Earlier this year, for example, Microsoft announced partnerships with companies including Acuant, AU10TIX, IDEMIA, Jumio, Onfido, Socure, and Vu that would effectively make face-based authentication <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/microsoft-azure-reaches-decentralized-id-milestone-in-collaboration-with-biometrics-leaders/">a key component</a> of its Azure AD Verifiable Credentials program.</p>



<p>The White House announcement comes shortly after President Biden’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/white-house-names-nominee-head-nist-072601/">nomination of Laurie E. Locascio</a> as the new head of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Locascio is currently the Vice President of Research at the University of Maryland, and has previously served in multiple positions at the NIST.</p>

<p>With many places such as restaurants, schools, and gyms now checking for COVID credentials in the U.S., we wanted to remind our users that GlobaliD currently has a quick and easy method for storing your vaccination record card with your digital identity.</p><p>Simply add the COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card self declaration (Identity tab→ [+] → Personal) in your GlobaliD app. You will be asked to take photos of your vaccination record card. Only you have access to the stored imagery, which you can share as necessary to prove that you’ve gotten your vaccination.</p><p>Of course, there are limits to this approach. The main issue is that there isn’t a convenient way to verify the authenticity of the vaccination card, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2021-08-20/global-black-market-for-fake-covid-19-vaccination-cards-flourishing">a growing problem</a> as some companies, schools, as well as the government have implemented vaccination mandates.</p><p>This implementation was always going to be a stop-gap solution.</p><p>And so today, we’re super excited to talk about the future of where the GlobaliD credentials platform is&nbsp;going.</p><p>The new and improved GlobaliD credentials platform</p><p>The existing GlobaliD verifications platform is undergoing a major upgrade — a new self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework, of which the first implementation has already been&nbsp;built.</p><p>The primary benefit of this new system is interoperable, portable, verifiable credentials that groups can issue and that users can carry with them across platforms and borders. This new framework will not only be much more scalable but also industry backed — thanks to the work of the Linux Foundation’s Cardea Project, which is working on global standardization around COVID credentials. (GlobaliD is <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f29803224">a founding member and part of the steering committee</a>.)</p><p>In case you missed <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">the announcement</a>, this is what the Cardea Project is all&nbsp;about:</p><p>Cardea is a complete ecosystem for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital credentials, open sourced as a project in Linux Foundation Public Health. Launched by Indicio.Tech, Cardea provides an easily verifiable, trustworthy, unalterable proof of health tests or vaccination that can be shared in a privacy-preserving way. Cardea easily integrates with existing health systems to ensure trusted data sources for credentials and uses decentralized identity technology to enable better control of data for individuals.</p><p>With our new platform, we’ll also be releasing a brand new COVID credential. Users will be able to validate the authenticity of their digital vaccine record from around the world and store the proof of the validation as a credential in their GlobaliD app. The user would then be able to present this proof in the interoperable format within the Cardea ecosystem and beyond. However, GlobaliD will not stop there. Because GlobaliD also enables verification of government IDs, verification of ownership of the vaccine digital record will also be possible by comparing personal information from both documents in a privacy preserving way.</p><p>Indicio.Tech, the firm that launched Cardea (and also a GlobaliD partner), is already working on active pilot implementations in <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">Aruba</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/indicio-and-liquid-avatar-technologies-launch-canada-s-first-privacy-preserving-decentralized-technology-for-sharing-health-data-827748977.html">Canada</a>.</p><p>An interoperability hackathon</p><p>On September 9, GlobaliD will be participating in an interoperability hackathon — Cardea’s Interop-athon:</p><blockquote><a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a>, the COVID credential project hosted at Linux Foundation Public Health, is going to host an “Interop-athon” on September 9, 8:00 am to 12:00 pm Mountain&nbsp;Time.</blockquote><blockquote>As Cardea is now being commercially deployed to share COVID-19 test results, vaccination, and trusted traveler credentials, it is important to facilitate and showcase the interoperability among these projects. To this end, Cardea will host a four-hour interoperability “hackathon style event”. The maintainers of Cardea will stand up a test environment including an Issuer, Mediator, Government, and Verifier Agents for participants to test against. Participants can also bring their own decentralized network!</blockquote><p>GlobaliD will be demoing an early implementation of our latest version of the COVID credential.

 Interview Credify’s Head of Compliance Bruno Sivanandan 



<p>Vietnam is preparing to implement its new <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=2a984c37-100b-498c-895a-81cdb0412c7e">Decree on Personal Data protection</a> at the end of 2021. Currently, it already has many regulations that govern the collection, receipt, transmission, and use of data, still many cases of infringement persist. In this interview, we had a discussion with Bruno on what Vietnamese businesses can expect and prepare for themselves when the decree comes into practice.</p>



<p>From his early working experience, Bruno soon realized the difficulties of companies to adapt their systems to such regulations. Now being the Chairman of Eurocham Digital Sector Committee, Bruno can bring discerning insights to Vietnamese businesses affected by this new decree. He also shares his case study at Credify on data compliance that can save many businesses in transforming their system architecture and coping with the growing complexity of the digital economy.</p>



<p>*Disclaimer: The comments of this article only reflect the opinion of Bruno Sivanandan and by no means those of the Eurocham or the Digital Sector Committee. Moreover, they are based on the draft decree and will be only relevant provided the actual decree does not change extensively comparatively to the draft.</p>







 What do you think about this new decree on personal data in general? 



<p>The draft Decree on Personal Data Protection is to be analyzed in relation to an array of policies pertaining to data and privacy protection, such as the Cyber Security Laws or the Decree 72 on the management, provision, and use of Internet services and online information. This regulation is absolutely necessary for Vietnam, where the digital share of the economy is growing dramatically. Without clear rules and guidance, it is likely that personal data would be handled inappropriately. This would leave the privacy of the citizens at risk and, on another scale, limit the perspectives of the inclusion of Vietnam in the global economy.</p>



<p>We are currently witnessing forced digitization of the economy, especially in Ho Chi Minh, with the strict regulations related to COVID-19. We always use more services and those are always handling more sensitive data… Even our financial and health data transit through applications nowadays. The framework in which these internet-based services operate has to ensure our safety and privacy. This is the challenge Vietnam is tackling with those regulations.</p>



 What would be the impact on Vietnamese people, to specify, the consumers and data owners? 



<p>The daily experience of the users will not change much. The main difference would be that upon accessing a service, users will have better information about why their data is collected, and to whom it is provided. The idea is that citizens be confident that any digital service they access on Vietnamese soil will respect their privacy and that authorities will actually enforce infringements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, citizens will be entitled to specific rights on their data they can use to force a service provider to erase their records or print out their data for them.</p>



 What does this decree mean for Vietnamese firms? How would it impact their business? 



<p>The private sector is likely to be the most impacted by the decree on Personal Data Protection and related laws mentioned above. Companies that are processing personal data will have to obtain a license to do so. First, this license will require proof that one’s system is secure enough, preventing hackers from getting their hands on the intimacy of the citizens. Secondly, companies need to prove that they are processing the data legitimately, i.e that the user gave his consent with sufficient details about the processing itself. Thirdly, that all the third parties involved in processing the data are themselves compliant.</p>



<p>In practice, such requirements are very costly to set up and enforce. Ideally, it means that all companies processing personal data, and that is a lot of companies, should be audited before having a license to operate, which is absolutely impractical.</p>







<p>However, where to find such resources is a problem that every single country is facing, amid a rise in cyber attacks. Only wealthy corporations are able to pay for such massive transformation projects.&nbsp; But what about the rest of the economic actors, how can we build a trusted network? We need new services on the market that lower the cost of compliance to acceptable levels. That is where Credify enters the dance!</p>



 What does this decree mean for international enterprises located both in Vietnam and overseas? 



<p>This is the million-dollar question. Cross-border data transfer is a Gordian Knot nobody has slashed at the moment. The most formidable example is probably the Privacy Shield breakdown by the Schrems II court decision. This means that European and American companies are not able to legally exchange personal data since the 16th of July 2020… it is obvious is the million-dollar question. Cross-border data transfer is a Gordian Knot nobody has slashed at the moment. The most formidable example is probably the Privacy Shield breakdown by the Schrems II court decision. This means that European and American companies are not able to legally exchange personal data since the 16th of July 2020… it is obvious that we have a problem here. This is one of the main topics we are working on at the Digital Sector Committee, we are working on solutions with the input of relevant governmental bodies.&nbsp;</p>



 What measures from governments can be taken to enhance the practice of this new decree? 



<p>Governments, in general, need to issue guidance that is as clear as possible for businesses to follow. From general legislation that states the spirit in which the law has been written, there is a need for precise “how-to” manuals for each industry. For example, in the e-commerce industry, what are major platforms supposed to do? How are they supposed to make sure their system is secured and that users are sufficiently aware of what is going on with their data?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where we mix the legal field with the IT engineering field, and typically where Best Practices need to be detailed measures by measures. The best way to achieve this is to let experts in each industry gather in working groups and issue “Codes of Conducts” for their peers to follow. Such precise guidelines clarify what exactly needs to be implemented to gather a user’s consent, encrypt a password, protect your system from an array of cyber attacks, and so on.</p>



“Only wealthy corporations are able to pay for such massive transformation projects.&nbsp; But what about the rest of the economic actors, how can we build a trusted network?“



 What advice would you give for Vietnamese businesses to prepare before the decree comes into effect? 



<p>Any business needs to have a digital transformation strategy, the Covid crisis has only accelerated a trend that has been ongoing for a few decades and made it critical to have one! In my opinion, the main elements are to focus on what is your core business and to outsource the rest to companies you trust. One example is the cloud computing services: most companies prefer to outsource this responsibility to trusted companies like AWS, Azure, GCP, it has become too costly and even less secure to buy your own servers, build your data center, cool it, assess the personnel, maintain backups and so on… If it’s not your business, leave it to people who focus on it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The methodology I advise is first to map your system, document all the business processes, the data each one is handling, under whose supervision, and so on. This is tedious work, but it will serve as the basis of any compliance program for the Vietnamese regulation, the GDPR, an ISO certification, and much more.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The most impacted businesses are obviously those relying on personal data to provide their services. It is especially important for such companies to convey to their users the exact list of sensitive data they are processing, for what purpose, and with the help of which subcontractor(s). At the scale of a company, it is challenging to keep this documentation up to date, as it requires real discipline from the workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A general thought process is to imagine an auditor inspecting the system of your company. The auditor will want to make sure that every data flow is secured with adequate technical measures, relative to the sensitivity of the data. It is up to the company to be able to demonstrate their compliance.</p>



 How is Credify responding &amp; contributing to this new decree on data protection? 



<p>If you were to remember one idea of this article, I would go with that one: Credify is an enabler for the economic actors to take part in the digitization of the economy with minimal effort, leaving the burden of compliance to Credify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Credify has a cutting edge technology to transfer data between two systems with a high level of security while dealing with consent gathering and audibility. The vision of Credify is two-fold: first create a trusted network of companies relying on personal data, enabling them to access personal data sitting in another system while complying with the regulation, the details of how to comply are dealt with by Credify, that is our serviceX product. Secondly, empower the user with their data, that they can use to access different services, that is idX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The level of security required to operate this data bridging service is extremely high, and one needs to add all the constraints mentioned above that come from the regulation. It becomes clear that handling sensitive data is becoming a craft of its own. Companies will need a reliable partner to do it, just like they do with Cloud computing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where Credify displays its value! We are building a network where members can exchange users’ data securely, under the supervision of the users. This enables, with minimal efforts, traditional businesses to make a first step in the digital economy, or for tech-savers businesses to dramatically enhance the exposure of their services in the trusted network of Credify.</p>



 About the Head of Compliance 



<p>As the Chairman of Eurocham Digital Sector Committee, Bruno takes the role of enabling members of the committee to express their opinion about the Vietnamese Digital regulatory Landscape. Their purpose is on one hand to clarify the regulation for the business community, and on the other to give their opinion on key policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He earned his Computer Engineering degree in the National Institute of Applied Sciences of Lyon, a leading engineering university in France. He then had a diverse experience when decided to come to Vietnam, step out of the engineering world and try himself at doing business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bruno is now the Head of Compliance of Credify. Thanks to the knowledge he brings about data protection and privacy regulation, coupled with his insights from being the chairman of the digital Sector committee of the European Chamber of Commerce, and his IT background, Bruno can share a valuable perspective on the products and strategy of Credify.</p>



<p>Credify’s products, idX and serviceX, both have data privacy and cyber security at the core of their design. Therefore, Bruno’s role is to help streamline the production processes of the company to ensure everything we ship is secured, as well as designing the contractual structure with our customers to fit in the regulatory landscape that is being built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On another hand, he is involved in gathering intelligence about the potential markets Credify can reach through this new industry of “data bridging”. This intelligence is then projected in the way we package our technology for the actors of e-commerce, insurance, finance, healthcare etc.</p>

<p>This week’s roundup of FindBiometrics’ top stories offers a few upbeat news items, and one piece of very bad news that also understandably attracted a lot of attention from readers.</p>



<p>Let’s get the bad news out of the way. Among the many consequences of the United States’ rapid withdrawal from Afghanistan was that the Taliban, upon seizing the capital city Kabul, acquired biometric identification devices left behind by the US military. It’s a development that appeared to put many Afghans who had worked with the Western-backed government in danger, and that put biometric tech in the spotlight as the media surveyed the ongoing crisis:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/taliban-captures-biometric-devices-left-behind-by-us-military-082001/">Taliban Captures Biometric Devices Left Behind by US Military</a> 



<p>The industry has also generated a lot of positive news in recent days. NEC, for example, got to celebrate after once again attaining the top ranking in the 1:N Identification category of the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Face Recognition Vendor Test. NEC’s algorithm demonstrated an accuracy rate of 99.78 percent:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nec-once-again-reaches-top-of-nist-leaderboard-708241/">NEC Once Again Reaches Top of NIST Leaderboard</a> 



<p>And in some positive news for CLEAR as well as society at large, the airport screening and biometric venue access specialist announced a partnership with OpenTable aimed at enabling users to verify their vaccination status when booking reservations on the latter’s platform. It’s a strong signal of CLEAR’s growing interest in the growing vaccine passport space, where it has made pioneering efforts with its Health Pass app:</p>

<p>ForgeRock, meanwhile, got a lot of attention with its announcement of the appointment of Tschudy Smith as its new Chief People Officer. Smith is an accomplished HR executive, having previously served as AOL/Time Warner’s Senior Leader in Human Resources and as Cisco’s SVP of People and Communities:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/forgerock-new-chief-people-officer-708234/">ForgeRock Looks to Strengthen Workforce with New Chief People Officer</a> 



<p>And finally, a number of FindBiometrics visitors this week showed interest in a new episode of the ID Talk Podcast, in which FindBiometrics Founder Peter O’Neill spoke with JJ Baird, the Director of Engineering and Operations for IDEMIA’s NORAM arm:</p>

    Important COVID-19 announcement.
  
  <br><br>
  
    Before we dive into explaining this amazing opportunity, we don’t want to waste your time. So, if you don’t have Australian citizenship or permanent residency, or if you are representing a recruitment agency, remote worker or offshore provider, then this is not for you. This role is based in Adelaide, Australia and requires the successful candidate to also have the necessary work experience and visa status and living in South Australia. Unfortunately, with the current COVID situation in Australia, the changing conditions and closed borders present too much uncertainty to candidates outside of South Australia.
  
 

<br><br>




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a&nbsp;Senior Multimedia Specialist&nbsp;for&nbsp;our&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;team, where you can contribute to the success of our product team developing our globally awarded personal data platform. The Meeco platform is comprised of suite of products including a decentralised wallet, key management store, exchange for identity, credentials &amp; tokens and secure data enclave (vault).




 




At Meeco we build the tools to enable people and organisation to access, protect and create mutual value from personal data. We are personal data pioneers offering a range of solutions powered by Meeco and decentralised on Hedera Hashgraph.




 




We are passionate about building a new digital economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, for the benefit of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organisations enter a relationship of mutual value and build a new, more meaningful way to personalise digital services. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more about our thinking and the vision that drives us.




 




We have built a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia, Belgium and the UK. Collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, and each bring a unique personal data story that advances our mission.




 





 About the role 




This is an exciting opportunity to apply your expertise with a technology scale-up working to improve the world! Meeco is a growing team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK and we are looking for a senior Multimedia Specialist to join our Adelaide based design team.




 




This role is ideally suited to someone who has commercial experience and is excited and passionate about communication and multimedia and how these can be used to help humanise technology.

You will be the first point of contact for communications and coordinate external communications with the CEO and Chief Commercial Officer. Your duties will include creating concepts for new designs, providing cost estimates, and ensuring all content meets our guidelines and security requirements.




 




This role will have client contact, therefore excellent communication and presentation skills are critical. You will be required to coordinate with clients at a variety of levels and across functions and oversee client expectations to accurate and timely delivery, including the following responsibilities:




 




• Oversee the production of digital media including videos, website development, online advertising, and email marketing




 




 •  Assisting in analysing, specifying and developing Meeco’s digital and on-line strategy including plans, guidelines and monitoring for quality and alignment to brand

 Information security 




Meeco is an accredited ISO27001 organisation. Information Security sits at the centre of everything we do internally and for our partners. Therefore, and understanding of information security, access management, quality assurance and security communication will be highly regarded. As would experience in the preparation of communication systems for security monitoring and audit.




 




Additionally, you will work closely with Meeco’s engineering team to ensure that security protocols are followed for digital assets and hosting websites, including backup and disaster recovery.




 




This will include designing, developing and coding with other specialised inputs, such as image files, audio files and scripting languages, to securely produce, maintain and support Meeco’s digital assets.




 




We use a variety of industry standard tools including Figma. It is not a requirement that you have experience in using any of these tools, but a willingness to learn and self-directed education is required.




 





 About you 




We are looking for someone who is an experienced multimedia professional with a minimum of 5 years’ demonstrable experience.




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the centre, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical or design solutions.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most. English is our primary language, but as we work with European clients, having the command of other European languages is a huge plus.




 




The following is our wishlist. It is not necessary that you have all this experience, but the more you have or can pick up quickly will increase your chances of success in the role:




 




 • Be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in UX/UI, either through your study or personal projects




 




 • A tertiary qualification in the marketing field and/or a Bachelors degree (or equivalent) in the communications field, ideally a majors in multimedia




 




 • Experienced in using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Affinity or Adobe design suite and Content Management tools such as Webflow and WordPress (including migration)




 




 •  Solid copywriting skills as well as editing and proofreading




 




 •  Experience working across different time zones, where English maybe the second language for many of your colleagues. An understanding of Dutch or French would be highly desirable




 




 •   A technical understanding of English to assist in the proof-reading and editing of content or experience in English language teaching would be a bonus




 




 •   Demonstrated understanding of what a Design System is along with keeping up to date with the latest marketing, UI/UX design and usability trends and techniques




 




 •  Experience writing and reviewing internal policies, including security and audit documentation




 




 •  Understand and have experience with web development technologies such as Javascript and CSS.




 




Whilst Meeco supports remote work, this role will be based in our Adelaide Office. Given the collaboration aspects of this role, we would like you to be in the office at least three-four days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.&nbsp;




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and be self-directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed.&nbsp;We love you asking for help!








  What we offer 




We pay a competitive start-up&nbsp;package&nbsp;based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 





  What we have achieved 




We are&nbsp;early pioneers&nbsp;in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012. You can read more on our achievements and announcements on our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/">blog</a>.&nbsp;




 




Funding; our founder bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products and helping our partners adopt them.




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community. Check out Meeco on Twitter or LinkedIn and you will see our consistent focus in helping build a global personal data economy. If you would like to know more about the exciting stuff we are working and have in store, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">check out this recent webinar</a>.




 




Awards: We have won&nbsp;nine&nbsp;international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands and Germany for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: We recently launched a media platform&nbsp;for kids&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it</a>&nbsp;and a decentralised Wallet to support identity and verifiable credentials. These are just two great examples of how enterprises and other start-ups are using our technology to developer better Privacy and Security by Design personal data solutions.




 




Innovation:&nbsp;Over the past year we have grown&nbsp;our engineering team along&nbsp;with some really interesting&nbsp;blockchain/distributed ledger&nbsp;projects&nbsp;which we are currently&nbsp;productising and been launching throughout&nbsp;2021.




 





 How to apply 




By reading this you have reached the end, so if you feel you are the right person for the job, all you must do is email <a href="mailto:jointheteam@meeco.me">jointheteam@meeco.me</a>




 




Please include&nbsp;what you like about the role, why&nbsp;you&nbsp;may&nbsp;want to join,&nbsp;any questions along with your&nbsp;resume and&nbsp;confirmation of your Australian citizenship or residency.




 




Last time we advertised we had hundreds of applications. Whilst we were delighted it took us a few weeks to consider the long-list and juggle interviews between Australia and Europe. If you meet the criteria,&nbsp;we will be in touch with you&nbsp;as soon as possible. We’re all looking forward to meeting you soon!&nbsp;

The idea was to use legal and software engineering to create a persistent digital identity for goods rather than people. Tethering an object with a cryptographic key pair would enable a secure evidence chain of interactions and transactions around an object, securing provenance and value for years to come. The design methodology stems from the<a href="https://iang.org/papers/intersection_ricardian_smart.html"> Ricardian contract framework</a> developed by Ian Grigg, which allows us to secure and execute property rights in virtual and physical space through dual integration of legal contracts and software.</p>The Ricardian “Bowtie”&nbsp;Model<p>In the process of gathering the data, certifying authenticity, cryptographically signing agreements (warranties) on the blockchain, and storing all documentation on IPFS, we realized that this design framework was very modular and customizable, on both the legal and technical side.</p><p>The key modular element of the MAP is the warranty. Each warranty covers various terms of a contract, ranging from identity, terms of service, arbitration, vault condition, tokenization, carbon offsets, and eventually even anti-slavery certification.</p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.100.alpha.001.150768/">https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.100.alpha.001.150768/</a><p>With the Ricardian framework, we can bind warranties together around an object over time, securing value and accountability while maximizing utility.</p><p>Let’s explore these areas in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Asset Passports Give Objects Accurate and Lasting&nbsp;Value <p>Securing the value of property is a core purpose of MAPs. We can look at two distinct but related elements which enable this within the Mattereum Protocol: digital provenance and trust communities.</p><p>Blockchain-Enabled Provenance Creates an Enduring History of&nbsp;Trade</p><p>By using the Ricardian framework of using cryptographic signatures to bind contracts and software, we can bring together all warranties around an object or service in such a way that any transaction or change to the documentation is recorded in a cryptographically secure and verifiable evidence chain of activity.</p><p>And since we use the public and global infrastructure of a blockchain shared ledger in tandem with immutable, distributed file storage via IPFS instead of traditional client-server databases, there is a much higher confidence in the integrity and accessibility of that data for years and decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Instead of relying solely on paper certificates of authenticity or siloed ledgers across individuals and organizations, we can immortalize the information of an object’s ownership history on the most secure networks on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Trust Communities: Distributed Trust Networks Secure Value &amp; Reduce&nbsp;Doubt</p><p>One of the innovations which arises from the MAP is the Trust Community, a peer-produced alternative to centralized certification methods whereby a network of independent certifiers provides digital warranties to facts within the MAP over time. All claims are backed by financial stake, putting skin in the game and adding weight to their assessments. In blockchain parlance, Trust Communities can be seen as mini-DAOs for securing product information.</p><p>Without a durable and incentivized trust framework like Trust Communities, commerce on the Internet suffers from the “doubt discount.” Lack of trust and certainty impairs the value of goods online, costing sellers an average 20% per exchange.</p><p>Mattereum Trust Communities, built upon the composable, legal-tech framework of the Asset Passport, restore value, increase liquidity, and bring peace of mind to digital commerce.</p> Asset Passports Create Accountability in Digital&nbsp;Commerce <p>A clever and powerful aspect of the MAP’s design is how the dual-integrated, legal-transactional framework creates crystal-clear lines of accountability: between buyers, sellers, certifiers, and other third parties (custodians, C02 offset markets). Whenever an entity interacts or transacts with the asset, they show intent to honor a shared agreement by signing the document with a cryptographic key.</p><p>When multiple parties sign a shared agreement in this way, an interwoven evidence chain of signatures is produced which is cryptographically secure and verifiable. Ian Grigg has referred to this process as “entanglement.”</p><p>Now what happens when things go&nbsp;wrong?</p><p>In the event of a commercial or systemic fallout, any party within the MAP can file a claim for breach of a warranty which is then presented to a designated arbitration court to settle. Applicable in 150+ countries under the 1958 New York Convention on Arbitration, this digital dispute resolution framework enables near universal legal enforceability of the contracts that comprise an Asset Passport.</p><p>This arbitration clause is included in the core contract of the MAP, waiting to be invoked if things go&nbsp;south.</p> Asset Passports Give Objects More&nbsp;Utility <p>In a world littered with hundreds of billions in stranded, underutilized goods, passported objects are not only more valuable than their zero-history counterparts but are also more useful. Without a system akin to the Asset Passport, goods drastically lose their value in the secondary market and either gather dust at best or end up in a landfill at&nbsp;worst.</p><p>An object with an MAP is imbued with more potentiality, as we can then program value flows and structure social protocols which unlock its full potential. This can encompass all scales of value: a socket wrench shared by a neighborhood, a treasured art piece secured in a vault, or even a forest that owns&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Using warranties which connect to smart contracts, we can bring blockchain innovations in finance and governance into the real world. From various forms of tokenization to collective ownership and management of assets, we can create new modes of value creation that oscillate between the realm of matter and the realm of&nbsp;bits.</p><p>It’s warranties all the way&nbsp;down.</p><p>Warranties within a MAP give us a composable design space for commerce on the Internet. We can offset carbon emissions behind the production and use of goods, bind an asset to a smart contract (tokenization) to mint digital assets of varying utility (physical NFTs, securitization, etc.), obtain risk protection, and provide digital dispute resolution in the case of commercial or systemic fallout. And this is simply what we’ve built to&nbsp;date.</p><p>What started as “digital identity for physical things” became a framework for programming value flows around goods and services as well as structuring the social protocols around them: a precursor to the Mattereum vision of <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/introduction-to-smart-property-ecb446268f23">smart property</a>.</p><p>Join us as we build new experiences in this exciting new frontier of digital commerce!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/composable-commerce-with-mattereum-asset-passports-4e102f85139a">Composable Commerce with Mattereum Asset Passports</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Thus far, we have published two articles (<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-dffcce766220?source=collection_detail----5e10d5c26b55-----6-----------------------">Part 1</a> &amp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-0-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-part-two-48562cbd5bfb?source=collection_detail----5e10d5c26b55-----2-----------------------"> Part 2</a>) outlining Web 3.0 and Ontology’s contribution to the evolving Web 3.0 landscape. In this article, we discuss Web 3.0 in relation to the “Shared Global Community” and “Mutual Trust Product Application”.</p> Shared Global Community <p>Web 3.0 will give users increased sovereignty, especially with regards to data and identity management. Ontology believes that the Web 3.0 ecosystem is driven by a decentralized future, with individuals able to build, contribute and own their preferred products and services. Ontology’s users can already fully control their data and decide who can access the data. They can also participate in developing decentralized infrastructure community activities and governance votes that impact the direction of the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Over the past few years, Ontology has managed to build a global <a href="https://ont.io/community%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%8C">community</a> spanning more than 30 languages in dozens of countries across several continents. In order to help further expand the Ontology community, we launched the Ontology <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">Harbinger Program</a>. We also launched the Harbinger <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-dumont-9964984fee4d">Interview Series</a> which gave some of Harbingers a chance to share their history with Ontology.</p><p>Finally, we continue to host regular <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4SrrJy2zHe">Community Calls</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DeIDSummit">DeID Summit</a> events every week to discuss community governance and product development.</p><p>Ontology values every member of our global community. The beauty of Web 3.0 is that it is not controlled by large centralized platforms. Rather, the decentralized Web 3.0 allows every individual to contribute whilst maintaining their autonomy.</p> Mutual Trust Product Application <p>A core issue with the current Web 2.0 landscape is that it is governed primarily by a few large tech companies that continuously accumulate, store, and monetize user data. Centralized storage of private data is vulnerable to attack. There have been many reported cases of data breaches among some of the largest corporations in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>In “<a href="https://forkast.news/why-decentralization-protect-user-data-privacy/">Why decentralization is essential for protecting user data and privacy</a>”, Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, detailed how decentralized solutions help address these vulnerabilities. Ontology’s mission is to return control of data and digital identities to the user. In this way, only the user can decide who can access his or her data. This promotes privacy and autonomy, which are severely lacking in the current Web 2.0&nbsp;era.</p> Identity <p>Ontology’s solution to the Web 2.0 identity problem is <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a> and <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a>. ONT ID is Ontology’s decentralized identity framework that enables users to control their data and decide whether a third-party can access a particular piece of information about them. It protects user privacy and ensures data security, enabling trusted collaboration. OScore is Ontology’s decentralized credit score. By participating in the decentralized ecosystem, OScore users can develop a decentralized reputation and reap rewards based on their activity.</p> Data <p><a href="https://protocol.sagamarket.io/">SAGA</a> is Ontology’s decentralized data market. SAGA provides enterprises and individual users with a credible, standardized and cost-effective data transaction platform. In the SAGA ecosystem, users (individuals or companies) use ONT ID to verify data and associate the data stream with its owner. This ensures the data owner’s rights are protected.</p> Digital Assets <p>Ontology uses pure technical means to provide trust guarantees between unfamiliar users, combines the decentralized credit system with traditional finance, creates a credit-based cross-chain decentralized asset management platform, and realizes Web 3.0 peer-to-peer transactions and disintermediation.</p><p>In addition to being supported on the Ontology platform, the above products can also be adopted by traditional industries and centralized internet platforms. Ontology hopes to promote the transition to Web 3.0 through the widespread adoption of decentralized products.</p> Summary <p>Although there are different opinions on the definition of Web 3.0, Ontology is primarily concerned with overcoming the problems inherent to Web 2.0. By taking advantage of blockchain technology, Ontology, among other decentralized technologies, can awaken the internet’s true potential with Web&nbsp;3.0.</p> Follow Us <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology Website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO Website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/4SrrJy2zHe">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-0-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-part-3-f1722638c32d">Can Web 3.0 Awaken the Internet’s True Potential?

If you want to support us and your KSM is currently being used for staking, unstake&nbsp;now.  If you don’t own KSM and want to participate, you need to purchase KSM and start voting for KILT&nbsp;then.  The minimum crowdloan contribution for KILT is 0.1&nbsp;KSM.  <p>Kusama crowdloans are run as candle auctions. For this reason, we encourage our community to enter their bids up to September 3rd at 9:00 GMT. Afterwards, you can continue to support KILT with additional bids until the auction ends on September 9 at 9:00&nbsp;GMT.</p> KILT’s crowdloan reserve <p>KILT is bidding for an 8-period parachain slot; when secured this lease will last for 48 weeks total. Participating in a crowdloan means the KSM you lock is unavailable to you during the unlocking, bidding, and parachain lease&nbsp;period.</p><p>Transferring or staking KSM is not possible during this time. We’ve set aside a crowdloan reserve of 4.5 million KILT Coins in order to say “thank you” for your support. This reserve is set aside for distribution by the KILT governance when KILT is decentralised. BOTLabs, the entity behind KILT Protocol, will vote in the parachain auction process but is excluded from this&nbsp;reserve.</p> KSM&nbsp;:&nbsp;KILT <p>The maximum cap for KILT’s crowdloan is 220,000 KSM; when 220,000 KSM is received no further bids will be accepted.</p><p>KILT’s crowdloan reserve is set aside for the governance to divide among the crowdloan supporters (excluding BOTLabs). This means that if governance follows our proposal and the maximum cap is achieved, you can get a minimum of 25 KILT Coins per 1 KSM that you bid in support of KILT’s parachain slot. If the maximum cap is not achieved, you would receive even more. Everyone who voted for the successful KILT bid would receive these coins regardless of when their KSM was&nbsp;placed.</p><p>When the parachain slot expires, or in the event that KILT is not successful in obtaining a slot within the 6–10 auction period, the Kusama crowloan module automatically returns your KSM to your wallet within 8&nbsp;weeks.</p> Step-by-step guide <p>First, you need to buy KSM or use the unlocked KSM you already have. Then decide if you want to participate via Polkadot.js or the Fearless&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Instructions for both are&nbsp;below.</p> Polkadot.js: If you have a KSM&nbsp;account <p>If you have available KSM on Polkadot.js, go to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/parachains/crowdloan">crowdloans</a> page on Polkadot.js and click “Contribute” in the column on the right next to KILT Spiritnet.</p><p>This will open up a pop-up&nbsp;window.</p>  Select the account you wish to contribute from.  Select the amount of KSM you wish to contribute.  Click “Contribute” (bottom&nbsp;right).  <p>You will then be asked to sign and submit this transaction.</p><p>Congratulations — you’ve now successfully voted for the KILT parachain slot!</p> Polkadot JS: If you don’t have a KSM account&nbsp;yet <p>If you don’t already have a KSM account on Polkadot.js, set one up by following the steps <a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000098878-how-to-create-a-dot-account">outlined here</a> and watch the how-to video. (Ignore the “DOT” header — the process is the same for DOT and&nbsp;KSM).</p><p>When you go to <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer">https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer</a> to begin the process, make sure you switch to the Kusama network before you follow the instructions.</p><p>You can do this by clicking on the network on the top left (see&nbsp;arrow).</p><p>This opens up the network options. Click “Kusama &amp; Parachains”.</p><p>This opens up the Kusama network options. <a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000169778-how-to-switch-network-nodes">Select a network</a> and click “Switch”.</p><p>When the Kusama network loads, click “Network” in the top bar, and “Parachains” in the dropdown.</p><p>Click on the “Crowdloan” tab.</p><p>This opens the list of active crowdloans. Then follow the instructions at the top of this section for contributing to the KILT crowdloan.</p><p>That’s it!</p> Fearless Wallet <p>Set up an account with Fearless Wallet; download links are on their website <a href="https://fearlesswallet.io/">here</a> and you can ask any questions on <a href="https://t.me/fearlesswallet">their Telegram here</a>. You can buy KSM directly via Fearless Wallet as part of the setup&nbsp;process.</p><p>When your account is securely set up, go to the “Crowdloans” tab at the bottom of the&nbsp;screen.</p><p>Select KILT from the list of ACTIVE crowdloans.</p><p>Add the amount of KSM you wish to bid. This view will indicate the network fee, estimated reward, and leasing period. You can also see the crowdloan info specific to KILT, such as the amount raised, time left and a link to the KILT crowdloan page.</p><p>Tap “Continue” to&nbsp;proceed.</p><p>Check that the amount you are adding to the KILT auction bid is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>Tap “Confirm”.</p><p>It’s that simple to add your KSM to the KILT auction bid via the Fearless&nbsp;Wallet.</p> Helpful resources from Kusama and&nbsp;Polkadot <p>If you haven’t participated in a Kusama parachain auction before, it’s very important to DYOR (do your own research!) to become more familiar with the process. We strongly recommend taking a look at these Kusama and Polkadot resources:</p>  Kusama: <a href="https://kusama.network/auctions/">Parachain Auctions overview</a> and video <a href="https://youtu.be/YrTxDufrcQM">How to Participate in Crowdloans on&nbsp;Kusama</a>  Polkadot: <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/mirror-learn-crowdloans">Crowdloans Wiki</a>  Polkadot Decoded: General overview “<a href="https://youtu.be/sxju74QqYuA">Auctions, Crowdloans, and Parachains, Oh&nbsp;My</a>!”  <p>All our crowdloan information is available on the “<a href="https://www.kilt.io/crowdloan/">Crowdloan</a>” section of KILT’s website.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The idea of low-code/no-code (LC/NC) application development seems to be extremely popular nowadays, to the point of it almost becoming a marketing buzzword similar, say, to “Zero Trust”. For decades, creating “proper” application software was a complex and tedious process that required qualified professional developers to produce even the smallest app. Organizations only had two choices: either purchase an existing off-the-shelf product from a software vendor or commission an internal or external development team to design, code, test, and deploy a custom application. Well, that or write an Excel macro…</p>
<p>LC/NC strives to change this dichotomy by offering a third choice: let business people build their own custom apps just by using a graphical design tool, choosing from a library of existing building blocks, or maybe even let artificial intelligence do the heavy lifting. The users, or “citizen developers” as they are now called, would only need to provide their domain knowledge, with no coding skills required.</p>
<p>In theory, the idea is great: every accountant, doctor, business analyst, or HR employee should be able to solve their small daily problems of finding the right information, doing a small calculation, or automating a back-office task without the need to involve software developers. There are so many potential use cases for LC/NC solutions and so many opportunities for software vendors to attract new customers with their citizen development offerings!</p>
 Do not trust the label! 
<p>Unfortunately, the market for these solutions is still in the very early stages of maturity – the diversity of products being sold under the “low-code/no-code” label is astounding. Anything ranging from sophisticated integrated development environments and robotic process automation platforms to glorified scripting tools and even chatbots – anything passes for LC/NC nowadays. This makes finding the right tool for a specific use case very difficult and, of course, only further increases the danger of Shadow IT – having an uncontrolled zoo of low-code tools in an organization is just as dangerous as letting your employees use unsanctioned cloud services.</p>
<p>However, the security and compliance implications of current-generation low-code platforms are much larger than that. First of all, “proper” software developers do not just write code. They are responsible for the full life cycle of their applications, from early design to implementation, operations, monitoring, fixing bugs and vulnerabilities, and, last but not least, protecting apps from attacks and preventing security breaches.</p>
<p>Low-code platforms must be able to implement all these capabilities, but even better than traditional software platforms because the customer simply does not have a team of citizen DevOps engineers and citizen security analysts. Even the largest enterprises that do have such teams at hand usually don’t plan to involve them in their citizen developer projects. After all, the biggest selling point of such projects is that business people can use them directly, without relying on their colleagues from IT.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most solutions currently available on the market seemingly do not focus too much on these challenges, as some of the recently discovered problems indicate. Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/power-apps">multiple data leaks</a> were reported in Microsoft Power Apps – a popular suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment for custom business apps.</p>
 The dangers of "shadow citizen development" 
<p></p>
<p>Although the platform provides a number of tools to enable user authentication, configure access permissions for tables that hold data, and so on, these controls were not enabled by default, leaving many apps created by customers completely exposed to anonymous access via the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/odata/">Open Data Protocol</a> API. Since all customer apps are hosted on subdomains of the same domain and the API endpoint address is fixed, the security researchers were able to quickly discover hundreds of affected companies and over a thousand lists with sensitive data such as passenger contact information, healthcare records, and even Microsoft’s own internal business data.</p>
<p>This particular data breach was quickly contained but who knows how many others are waiting to be discovered? Similar past problems with the likes of Amazon S3 or MongoDB clearly show that if a database or service allows making sensitive data public, it will eventually happen again and again, most commonly through negligence and misconfiguration, but sometimes by the hand of a malicious insider.</p>
<p>And if this can happen to a seasoned IT expert, how can we expect every citizen developer to be able to secure their data properly? Potential privacy implications of letting non-technical (and non-legal) people decide which data should be put into a no-code platform and who should have access to it might be massive, too. After all, citizen developers are just as likely not to understand international privacy regulations like GDPR as they are to have no clue about security principles.</p>
<p>Also, let’s not forget that one of the most popular usage scenarios for a low-code platform is combining and analyzing data from multiple external sources – for visualization, reporting, or automation, for example. If a custom app can be easily breached through such a trivial vulnerability in the underlying LC/NC platform, it will essentially turn into a massive security hole, potentially letting hackers pivot to and breach multiple other IT systems.</p>
 Choosing the right low-code/no-code solution 
<p>What should customers do to avoid such problems? Even before they decide to adopt the citizen development methodology, they have to carefully incorporate the idea into their existing security and compliance policies. They have to consider all the potential challenges and carefully evaluate the risks of “shadow citizen development” as well.</p>
<p>When choosing the best LC/NC solution, one should understand that the market is nowhere near maturity yet, and available capabilities can vary dramatically. There will probably never be a single product that can address all potential use cases, but again – business people alone should not be allowed to decide which tools (and to what extent) to use just based on their needs. All such tools must be carefully vetted by security and privacy experts, and proper constraints and policies must be established for their usage. Needless to say, access to any sensitive systems and data sources through a low-code platform must be controlled, secured, and generally treated as untrusted.</p>
<p>If an LC/NC platform comes with its own data platform, it must be secured to a higher standard than other enterprise databases, not a lower one. All the security and compliance controls for a database used by citizen developers must work at least as efficiently as for other sensitive data sources, but in addition, they must be fully transparent, not user-serviceable, and always on.</p>
<p>And, of course, creating an app in a modern low-code/no-code environment should be at least somewhat more convenient than writing an Excel macro. Otherwise, nobody will bother to use it.</p>

 Filling the information gap. <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">Subscribe to the newsletter</a>. This is for you who doesn’t want to read through all the messages on Discord everyday (where all the latest project information can be found.) For you who can’t be bothered with following social media. For you who just generally wants to have a life and still get the occasional updates on Verus and its ecosystem. And everyone else is welcome&nbsp;too. <p>Next to publishing the monthly recap on Medium, I will send the exact same content through a newsletter. <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">Subscribe here</a>. I’ll try to keep things short and to the point. So let’s get started with the very first monthly&nbsp;recap.</p> August 2021  Preparing Testnet for Ethereum&nbsp;Bridge <p>The multi-chain testnet has been reset. This in preperation for the bridge to the Rinkeby testnet. It has been said we are very close to this game-changing release.</p> Wallet Updates <p>Highly recommended non-mandatory Verus Desktop and CLI wallet updates have been made available. (Critical for notaries and pools). <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Download v0.7.4&nbsp;here</a></p> Conversations with Mike &amp;&nbsp;Bluesky <p><a href="https://blueskyweb.org/">Bluesky</a> is an initiative from Twitter to create a decentralized social media platform. Verus lead developer Mike Toutonghi had some very interesting posts in their Discord channel explaining the benefits that Verus and VerusID can bring to their project. Everyone in their Discord is still shell-shocked from the bombs that Mike dropped on them. <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505987175062437888/879966215857127454/unknown.png">Read a part of the messages here</a>. Verus has been selected to start a workgroup to integrate with <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a>. The future will tell if it is something worthwhile. One big positive is that more people, and especially developers, will learn about Verus. You can read all the messages back in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/YmrHBhCuFa">Bluesky Discord</a>, and please keep the shilling to yourself. We want to foster professional and productive environments.</p> Giant Website&nbsp;Overhaul <p>We are close to finishing a giant website overhaul. Better, more concise messaging. Easier to understand copywriting. More illustrations. Clearer design. All-in-all easier to digest for all people. I personally can’t wait for it to be online. I believe it to be a great improvement that will definitely get more people more interested in&nbsp;Verus.</p> Mobile Wallet Developments <p>Interesting progress on the mobile development front. Verus Mobile will be able to function as an encrypted local repository for your personal data, creating a central place for you to securely store information about yourself (that only you control.) This data allows you to integrate your wallet with in-app service providers that extend application functionality. Initially, this is how fiat on/off ramp services (<a href="https://www.sendwyre.com/">Wyre</a>) will be connected to the wallet. Later on, VerusID integration gives users the power to prove information about themselves in a decentralized, self-sovereign way. Exciting&nbsp;stuff!</p> New Docs&nbsp;Website <p>In addition to the new website we are working on a documentation website. In here you can find information if you want to take a deeper dive into Verus blockchain technology. It will be online the same time as the new website. Although this one is still a work-in-progress and needs to be updated constantly.</p> Community-Made Videos <p>Community member tango808 made an awesome video showing current and near future capabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwjfB184qfg">Check it out on YouTube</a>. He made even way more and you can find <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18GDpFFP1BngAPXOjvlyVhP_d4DrexZH5">them here</a>. Please share them around if you&nbsp;want!</p> Ecosystem Project&nbsp;Valu <p>Community member Consilience from <a href="https://www.valu.earth/">Valu</a> low-key confirmed that they will launch their project soon after PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) has been brought to mainnet. One of those things are fiat gateways for Verus. It will be a giant boost for the ecosystem I’m&nbsp;sure.</p> Fun Fact <p>At the time of writing the active amount of $VRSC staking is over 33M. Not bad. Still room for improvement. So get staking! Or not (more for&nbsp;me.)</p><p>Thanks for reading. That’s it from me. Until next&nbsp;month!</p> Please <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">subscribe to the monthly recap</a> so you’ll get it each month in your&nbsp;mailbox.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/august-2021-verus-monthly-recap-4241c7c80b8a">August 2021— Verus Monthly Recap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Shyft Network and Kylin Network take steps towards building compliant DeFi infrastructure for Financial Institutions. <p>Bridgetown, Barbados — We are delighted to announce our partnership with <a href="https://kylin.network/">Kylin Network</a>, the cross-chain data infrastructure powered by Polkadot, to collaborate and build cross-chain data infrastructure for Decentralized Finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p><a href="https://shyft.network/compliant-defi">Shyft Network’s</a> opt-in compliance infrastructure, such as whitelisted addresses and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) and GDPR compliant systems, will be further strengthened by Kylin Network’s data infrastructure and oracle&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Kylin Network commits to provide required datasets to Shyft Network, allowing it to build a “compliant DeFi” framework, which would allow institutional funds and financial institutions from capital markets to deploy funds into the DeFi ecosystem in a secure and compliant manner.</p><p>Some key parameters of the partnership:</p>  Kylin Network will afford the opportunity to placehold a validator node for Shyft Network. The first validators are vetted by the Kylin Network such that the health of the network in the crucial early days of the ecosystem is robust. We expect heavy demand to be a validator node, and only select partners will be invited to take&nbsp;part.  Kylin will also work with Shyft Network as a parachain to call each other’s functions via XCMP pallet-calling. XCMP pallet-calling is a revolutionary way to call the functions of another parachain or parathread on Polkadot. Kylin has innovated this feature and will work closely with Shyft Network to identify cool ways to implement it in&nbsp;synergy.  With data feeding provided by Shyft Network, and then filtered through Kylin Network’s consensus and arbitration mechanisms, an augmented robustness of data accuracy and trustability becomes possible. Basically, we can add another layer of trust and validation to whatever data that Shyft Network provides.  In turn, Shyft network will expose Kylin Network to its burgeoning community and innovations in the field of compliance-managed data solutions.  <blockquote>Dylan Dewdney, Chief Stratosphere Officer of Kylin Network said, “The coming renaissance in DeData-enabled Web 3 solutions will naturally include emergent data validation layers. Kylin Network and Shyft Network will work in concert and synergy to find ways to validate and render the many nascent use cases of validated web 3 data journeys into incentivized frameworks that undergird more accurate and trustworthy results”</blockquote><p>Shyft Network recently announced the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-based-shyft-network-launches-aims-for-fatf-compliant-defi">launch of its mainnet</a> and, shortly thereafter, the coordinated <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf">deployment of Veriscope</a>, the decentralized solution to the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule. This signals the first steps in the development of a global, decentralized, and opt-in compliance infrastructure.</p><blockquote>Juan Aja Aguinaco, Co-Founder of Shyft Network said “Shyft’s strength comes from its network of partners and participants; as a data validation layer, Shyft Network’s integration with Kylin Network helps build a stronger, more reliable and functional oracle infrastructure. By leveraging Kylin’s consensus and arbitration mechanisms, we get closer to reaching our goal to enable institutional funds from capital markets and financial institutions to participate in compliant DeFi and create a new era for&nbsp;crypto.”</blockquote> About Kylin&nbsp;Network <p>Kylin Network aims to build a cross-chain platform powering the data economy on Polkadot. It will be the data infrastructure for the future DeFi and Web 3.0 powered by Polkadot. Kylin Network hopes to provide valid, reliable, secure, cost-effective, and easily coordinated data sources and data analytics.</p> Contact Kylin&nbsp;Network <blockquote>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/KylinOfficial">https://t.me/KylinOfficial</a></blockquote><blockquote>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Kylin_Network">https://twitter.com/Kylin_Network</a></blockquote><blockquote>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/PwYCssr">https://discord.gg/PwYCssr</a></blockquote><blockquote>Medium: <a href="https://medium.com/kylin-network">https://medium.com/kylin-network</a></blockquote><blockquote>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kylinnetwork">https://www.linkedin.com/company/kylinnetwork</a></blockquote><blockquote>Official website: <a href="https://kylin.network/">https://kylin.network/</a></blockquote> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network is a public protocol designed to aggregate and embed trust, validation, and discoverability into data stored on public and private ecosystems, and facilitate information transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks.

Chris Owen,  Director of Product Management at Savyint is to deliver a presentation on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4614/1" title="Worlds Collide: The Importance of Convergence in IAM"> Worlds Collide: The Importance of Convergence in IAM </a>on Tuesday, September 14 starting at 8:30 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Chris some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When worlds collide is an interesting subject. What does it actually mean and what is colliding?  </p>
<p>
Worlds colliding is essentially looking at the different markets that exist within the identity space. So in particular, if we take privileged access management (PAM) and identity governance and administration (IGA), they've typically existed within silos. So PAM tools were originally designed for on-premise infrastructure, for managing access into a data center and critical assets. IGA tools have really focused on provisioning identity life cycle management. What we're starting to see now is these worlds really coming together. And a lot of that is driven by cloud adoption because now everything has an identity.<br><br>And as people adopt more cloud, privileged controls are really having to change, it's no longer just about access to servers and where the critical data is. It's access to interfaces, consoles, and at the same time everything has an identity. What's becoming important is the fact that you need to govern these identities, have visibilities of where they are, and bring further context into the management of these identities. The concept of worlds colliding is really these two types of technology really becoming closely aligned together, and what we call convergence, where essentially they are becoming the same platform.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is this specific to IGA and PAM or do you see this happening in other areas?  </p>
<p>
This is definitely something that's happening in other areas. So if we look at the identity market as a whole, we're starting to see a lot of consolidation taking place. A lot of vendors are starting to now combine technologies, not just IGA and PAM, you're starting to see PAM and IDaaS type solutions. You have typical IDaaS vendors, such as Okta that are making moves into the IGA and PAM space as well. So there's a lot of adjacent things happening. There's also other areas within security in the identity space. So new acronyms around cloud infrastructure, entitlements management, cloud security, posture management, kind of coming together and that may get consumed by Pam IGA tools as well.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some customers have already made large investments in identity solutions, why would they move to a converged solution?  </p>
<p>
There are really some key drivers to moving towards a converged solution. Some of those are cost savings, benefits, time, efficiency, and that type of thing, but certainly a lot of organizations have made investments. These may be on-prem, they may be more traditional siloed approaches. So there's definitely a good time to embrace these types of technologies. Digital transformation is a key driver to look at our technology stacks, to make sure it's meeting our requirements, to make sure that it's fit for purpose. And that's a good time to transition towards these type of new converged solutions as they are.    </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you expect more changes in the future?  </p>
<p>
I think the technology landscape is constantly evolving. I think we will definitely see more. I think we'll see more consolidation within the industry. There'll be more acquisitions. There'll be more, I guess, new bleeding edge type of technologies that come into the fold as well. So cloud security posture management is definitely the big subject of the moment and infrastructure entitlements management. At the moment, that is very much a segregated market. And there's a lot of new vendors coming into that space. But I think we'll definitely see more consolidation take place there, and perhaps, more established markets such as secrets management, really being brought into that fold as well.  </p>

<p>How can we streamline and improve the techno-social protocols around commerce so we can better maintain equilibrium with our planet and ourselves?</p><p>This article is a companion piece to the first episode of The Future of Stuff podcast. Listen to Vinay unpack the idea of smart property in the debut episode&nbsp;🎙</p><p>Humanitarian engineer Buckminster Fuller once described an approach to building economic systems which he referred to as ephemeralization, defining it as our ability to “do more and more with less and less until eventually we can do everything with nothing.”</p><p>Now, such a thing seems impossible with the numerous technological and social constraints that come to mind, but the idea of “doing more with less” as a design principle — if followed responsibly — could eventually lead us to a future where atoms and bits dance in perfect synchrony, benefiting everyone at the expense of no&nbsp;one.</p><p>With that north star, we can start prototyping the systems of tomorrow with the tools of&nbsp;today.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s explore a potential techno-social medium for building this future: smart property.</p> What is Smart Property? <p>In the online age, people are used to summoning entities around the world to meet their everyday needs. A few taps on the scrying mirror of a smartphone can marshal human and autonomous agents to provide all manner of services. Transportation. Goods. Housing. Entertainment. Education. Nearly anything.</p><p>This ability to program value flows and social interactions around goods and services presents an incredibly powerful design space which we can refer to as smart property.</p><p>In practice, smart property is property that can be bought, sold, collateralized, and accessed via software APIs and search engines. While we already have this in a sense with housing (AirBnB), transportation (Uber), distribution (Amazon), and other areas, these systems are often controlled by centralized corporations operating under the illusory banner of “platform,” resulting in ongoing concerns around privacy, security, and labor practices.</p><p>At Mattereum, we believe smart property is an inevitable evolution of commerce, but how this system is implemented and the motivations behind it are paramount. Smart property can be how we achieve equilibrium with the planet and with each other, or it could be co-opted by the incumbent powers-that-be with results that can be read in dystopian science&nbsp;fiction.</p> Smart Property Can Fix Society’s Inventory Problem <p>The world is suffering from a severe misallocation of resources, especially on a long-term time horizon. At the core, this is a system design problem. Between planned obsolescence and trade globalization in the pursuit of corporate profit, the things we produce are not actually built to last and rely on an unimaginably complex, global infrastructure powered by distant (or not so distant) horrific labor practices and environmental costs.</p><p>The IPCW industrial cycle, designed by Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta and a team at the Rocky Mountain Institute, provides an almost mandala-like mapping of industry. As you can see, the four main areas are Investment (of different capital types), Production, Consumption, and&nbsp;Waste.</p><p>One way to explain this odd paradox of gluttony and scarcity in the world today is to map where in this cycle we have innovated over the last half century, and where we have&nbsp;not.</p><p>Investment and Production witnessed a transformative leap in operational efficiency and scale in the post-WWII era, yet similar progress has not been made in optimizing Consumption and managing&nbsp;Waste.</p><p>Tightening these feedback loops will require better policy, technology, and social awareness.</p><p>We don’t know what we don’t know about our stuff and figuring it out is critical to achieving sustainability and improving quality of life for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Smart property as a design framework can help us generate, access, and act upon the necessary product information to build secondhand markets of durable quality goods and facilitate truly efficient p2p commerce. Imagine a digital wallet interface akin to an MMORPG’s character inventory in which the assets are actual objects which can be owned in common, shared, leased, bought, or sold with a few taps on a&nbsp;screen.</p><p>This is possible.</p> Smart Property Streamlines Complexity in&nbsp;Commerce <p>It is important to emphasize that smart property is not about embedding sensor devices in everything under the sun (Internet of Things, smart cities) and more about designing the social protocols around goods and services enabled by a tight integration between law and software to streamline, structure, and secure the numerous interactions and transactions around a good or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Oddly enough, with smart property it is the space and social interaction around an object which is where the magic happens. The ‘ground’ is the key design space rather than the ‘figure’ of an&nbsp;object.</p><p>On the first episode of The Future of Stuff podcast by Mattereum, Vinay illustrated the potential of smart property in multiple examples, including one that would seem random at first glance, but is profound in its implications.</p> The Logistical Nightmare of Wedding&nbsp;Planning <p>If the idea of smart property is to automate and streamline transactions and interactions between various parties around a good or service, reducing complexity and costs to those involved, then wedding planning makes for a surprisingly fitting use&nbsp;case.</p><p>Venue. Catering. Travel. Entertainment. Fashion. So many moving pieces in constant motion. What if there were a system which allowed one to aggregate these pieces via software protocols, creating order in the chaos and vastly reducing mental and transaction costs?</p><p>As Vinay explains, someone in charge of planning the event could use a smart property system to “build a multi-path matrix of possible solutions,” securing various options leading up to the day of the event as a safeguard for any failure or setback in the&nbsp;chain.</p><blockquote>“It’s this ability to take processes where there are tons and tons of dependencies, turn the dependencies into option contracts, group the option contracts together until you have a solution, and then once you have a solution, execute all of the options. Bringing that kind of capability out of heavy engineering and finance into ordinary everyday people’s lives will be completely revolutionary.”</blockquote><p>Of course, the application of smart property in event planning is not limited to weddings. Think of all the events we attend throughout our lives which involve networks of contracted parties which do the work of creating these dynamic social experiences. Concerts. Reward ceremonies. Conferences. Imagine booking and planning these events as easy as using&nbsp;AirBnB.</p> Smart Property is a Critical Use Case of Blockchain <p>It is imperative that a smart property system be decentralized and operated on a peer-to-peer basis. There’s a real risk of smart property systems as envisioned by Mattereum being co-opted by the incumbent Big Tech companies and being absorbed into monopolies and oligopolies, resulting in economic centralization with severe consequences for society (price distortions, resource misallocation, etc).</p><p>We do not want a world in which everybody owns nothing and Big Tech companies lease the majority of material goods to the populace, under contractual agreements which favor them at the expense of the user at every turn. No recourse. No&nbsp;agency.</p><p>If antitrust legislation and governmental efforts to prevent monopolies or keep them in check fail (and such legislation tends to wax and wane across administrations), then people would be at the mercy of market forces (such mercy does not&nbsp;exist).</p><p>Building smart property systems with p2p protocols is critical to ensuring that the already terrible distribution of wealth and power is not made even worse for future generations.</p><p>Blockchains provide cryptographically secure and verifiable transaction networks for the seamless and borderless exchange of value. A global, programmable medium of value transfer open to all is a design space we are still trying to wrap our heads around. And it is currently the most compelling technological solution for smart property.</p><p>Traditional client-server databases are silos which lack the interoperability necessary for coordinating and streamlining complex business transactions across multiple contexts. Having a shared financial infrastructure instead of a patchwork of protocols that struggle to maintain consensus can vastly reduce complexity and cost of&nbsp;trade.</p><p>However, neither blockchain nor any other computer system for that matter can power smart property alone. There needs to be a way of “programming” the material world and the social agreements between&nbsp;people.</p><p>Bringing the programmable value of blockchain into the real world requires a tight integration between legal systems that enforce property rights and the software systems which facilitate commerce.</p><p>Enter Mattereum.</p> Prototyping Smart Property with the Mattereum Protocol <p>Mattereum is building the legal-transactional framework that secures trust in digital commerce. Bridging the programmable value of blockchain-based digital assets with the programmable agreements of contract law with the affordances of both presents a compelling design framework for smart property.</p><p>The Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Real-World Asset NFTs, and Trust Communities. Here’s how the protocol works, in&nbsp;brief:</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/">Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.)</p>  Asset Passports are a bundle of legal warranties tied to a particular object. Essential warranties include identification, confirmation of the presence and capabilities of verification technologies such as NFC tags, vault status, carbon offsets, anti-slavery certification, and tokenization. The heart of the Mattereum Protocol, Asset Passports are powerful, composable tools for securing property rights in virtual and physical&nbsp;space.  Real-World Asset NFTs are unique digital tokens that denote the right to take physical custody of a particular object. While sharing features with the NFTs now gaining popularity in the cultural mainstream in the creative industries, these tokens are different in that they are backed by an underlying physical asset, complete with warranties, insurance, and legal enforceability to create trust in trade. They are paired with objects via a warranty in the Asset Passport.  Trust Communities are the networks of expert certifiers that accrue around each object (artwork, memorabilia, precious metals) throughout its lifetime. All expert certification of an object is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment. Built upon the composable, legal-tech framework of the Asset Passport, Trust Communities restore value, increase liquidity, and bring peace of mind to digital commerce.  <p>So far, the Mattereum Protocol has tokenized a wide range of objects, ranging from <a href="https://opensea.io/NTFA">gold-backed NFTs</a>, to <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/third-millennia-collection-1">pop culture memorabilia</a>, to <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">historical/cultural artifacts</a>.</p><p>Currently, these assets and arrangements are only a simple display of smart property. An asset is secured in a vault and can be physically delivered to the NFT bearer upon burning the token, with all the necessary legal warranties attached to the property. A transferable, cryptographic voucher of&nbsp;sorts.</p><p>Mattereum is researching and developing tools and methodologies to build upon this groundwork, streamlining the passporting and tokenization process for a wider range of asset classes and exploring new opportunities in this exciting design&nbsp;space.</p><p>In the future, there will be smart legal templates which create a streamlined user experience around generating the Asset Passport and minting digital assets, automated custodians that reduce the risk and complexity around custody of physical goods (and even provide corporate legal status of certain objects to empower collective ownership, asset governance, amongst other possibilities), advanced search capabilities with robust metadata schemas of all goods and services on the protocol, and APIs that allow others to build and expand on these foundations.</p><p>The idea of smart property is to use technology to create a better relationship between ourselves and the planet. The digitization of commerce is a trend with no stopping point, so we might as well be good at it. Eventually, the technological and social systems which underlie trade will become so coordinated that we will move into an era of property rights so fluid and dynamic that it will be more akin to “streaming property” than owning property. How we build this system is crucial to preventing injustice and inequity in the world, and Mattereum is aiming to build the protocols to enable this future such that everyone can benefit at the expense of no&nbsp;one.</p><p>In the spirit of Buckminster Fuller, let’s build a future of “more with less” where everything simply works in stunning techno-social grace.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/introduction-to-smart-property-ecb446268f23">Introduction to Smart Property</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Ian Grigg is one of the most influential builders in the crypto space, having built digital asset systems since the nineties. We discuss his invention of the Ricardian contract framework, what makes cryptonetworks successful, identity as communal phenomenon, and the importance of building positive-sum systems.</p> EPISODE NOTES <p>In this episode, I had the pleasure of talking to financial cryptographer Ian Grigg (@iang_fc). Ian is an unsung hero in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space, having built crypto-based digital asset systems since the nineties using the Ricardian contract, a design framework for binding software with legal agreements that has been the foundation of many crypto projects over the years, including Mattereum. We discuss the invention of the Ricardian framework, its design philosophy, the importance of community in the formation of one’s identity and the success of entire cryptonetworks, as well as the critical need to shift our focus from building zero-sum games to crafting positive-sum systems that benefit everyone at the expense of no one. I learned a lot from Ian in this conversation, and I hope you find the insight as enriching as I&nbsp;did.</p><p>Track: “Optimist” by Zoe&nbsp;Keating</p><p>Links:</p>  <a href="https://iang.org/">https://iang.org/</a>  <a href="http://www.financialcryptography.com/">http://www.financialcryptography.com/</a>   Episode Outline   The Origins of the Ricardian Contract [00:01:20]  Ian on the Advent of Cryptocurrencies [00:09:27]  Blockchain is Just Another Tool [00:12:47]  Mattereum’s Building on the Ricardian Framework [00:14:46]  The Cost and Necessity of Building Governance [00:16:35]  The Chamapesa Project [00:20:53]  Identity Through Community [00:24:05]  Dissonance Between Identity Frameworks &amp; Societal Expectation [00:26:02]  Reputation &amp; Identity in Cryptosystems [00:28:19]  Zero-Sum vs Positive-Sum Games [00:33:10]  Ian on Encouraging Ricardian Contract Adoption by Devs [00:38:21]  On the Future of Smart Contracts [00:43:04]  Improving Asset Custody in Smart Property Systems [00:47:11]  <p>Welcome to the podcast&nbsp;Ian.</p><p>Ian: Good to be&nbsp;here.</p> The Origins of the Ricardian Contract [00:01:20] <p>Garrison: A lot of people who are kind of familiar with what Mattereum does and how it approaches building things may be familiar with the concept of the Ricardian contract as this kind of hybrid system for integrating contractual agreements with software that executes the agreement. That’s kind of foundational to what we do. It’s also been used in a lot of different projects and inspired a lot of amazing work across smart contracts and formation of entire digital organizations. Could you kind of describe how the Ricardian contract was formulated?</p><p>Ian: It all happened around about 95 to 97. What was happening there was that digital cash was a hot topic, a very hot topic. And it was kind of funny because when the Bitcoin thing started out and that became a hot topic, it was just an echo of the nineties to a lot of us who had already been there, done that and so forth, seeing what would&nbsp;happen.</p><p>While the digital cash people over in Amsterdam — that’s DigiCash, David Chaum’s company — were doing digital cash, I was sitting in finance classes and learning about zero coupon bonds and a zero coupon bond is basically like a dollar note, if you like, or a pound note or something like that. And listening to all this, I realized that actually, if you’re trying to do digital cash and digital cash is a dollar or a pound or a Euro or whatever it was, and a zero coupon bond is the same thing. The zero coupon bond is actually the atomic element of finance in terms of mathematical modeling.</p><p>From that you can build up everything else practically speaking. You can build up derivatives as constructions of zero coupon bonds. And it occurred to me that, well, if we can do digital cash, we can do everything in finance. This light bulb moment got me thinking. And I started out with a mate and I moved to Amsterdam and we started working on digital cash and digital assets. The ones we chose were bonds and to cut a long story short, the thing about bonds, I did a lot of research into this. It took me six months to figure this all out. Bonds are legal contracts. If we could do a legal contract in a digital form, then we could do bonds. And then a bit later on it transpired that bonds themselves are just the simplest form of financial instrument. And most other things are based on the contractual mechanism.</p><p>Most of them. I mean shares are based on government say-so, but even then shares could be based on contracts. So we could do everything if we could do contracts. And I went through a long process of trying to work out how to do contracts. I got stuck on the normal computer science notion: oh gosh, a contract is a bunch of data so we shove it in the database and we get stuck into normalized forms and all this sort of stuff. Which is normally good&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>And the world often reduces to that in computer science terms which is why so many databases are built out there in the world. But the contract just didn’t work. I discovered that bonds, for example they were lots of lots of words which had very strange meaning, especially to a computer scientist. The bonds didn’t have standard words. And every time somebody came out with a new bond, they changed the wording. And it was often just a little bit. So you wondered whether they were responding to new events. There’d been some new crisis or whether it was just the lawyers deciding that they needed to generate fees or something. But either way, didn’t really matter to us. The bonds kept changing, so databases just didn’t&nbsp;work.</p><p>And at that point I had this second light bulb moment. If you like, when I said, “Okay why don’t we flip the problem upside down, give the lawyers what they want, give them a text document. It will make the computer science side work harder than try and pander to the computer programmers. We’ll pander to the&nbsp;lawyers.</p><p>So we constructed, or I constructed a simple text document, which included the text of the contract. And instead of it being, shall we say, all the words that the legal people wanted to wrote, write, and nothing more. It included some parameters in there. And these parameters were very simple line based things, which said something like name equals 2009 bond from the Pacific railway. And the denomination could be in dollars and so forth. Simple tag equals value. And what that meant was that the program could dive into the document with a very simple parser. We’re talking about a line based thing which can be knocked up by any decent programmer. Read down, grab out the tags. And then with that document, the software could then display it to the user. So the software didn’t need to be didn’t need to know what the contract was beforehand. It got all the information it needed out of the contract, such as the denomination, such as the decimalization, the symbol to display. And then when it came to showing the user what was going on, it could simply use those tags without necessarily understanding them.</p><p>Which if you think about it, that’s what you want. If you’re going to be handling many, many bonds, you don’t want to know what the bonds are in advance. You don’t want to modify the software for every bond or every asset or every Bitcoin or every Ethereum or whatever. You want a standardized document that tells you what it&nbsp;is.</p><p>So out of that process, we added rooting to find out where the actual asset was, was managed. And we added digital signatures, such that the issuer would make this claim as a contract. And that was the&nbsp;method.</p><p>The funny thing is we didn’t realize that what I’d come up with was much of an invention, but we found every time we were talking about it we were saying, well the way you issued a bond is you write a contract and it’s the contract form that’s inside Ricardo, the name of our digital cash system. And that got shortened to the Ricardian contract. Hence the name. So eventually after our gosh six or seven years of having these conversations, I realized I had to basically publish a paper on it and did that. So from then of course everybody could just refer to the paper. So that’s the foundation of&nbsp;it.</p><p>But it’s quite interesting because we did discover it was very broad. We could do every sort of financial asset with the Ricardian contract. And not only that other people came along and did other things with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Chris Odom turned it into configuration files. The configuration of his software was a set of Ricardian contracts.</p><p>And the OpenBazaar people turned it into a trading cycle in that their invoices, for example, would be a Ricardian contract. And that would refer back to a previous author to enter into a contract. And then the receipt, for example, would be pointing back to the invoice and the payment would be pointing back to the receipt. So they had these chains of things where they’re basically pointing at each other. And that was very interesting because it created this cycle where everything was available and everything was documented in cryptographic security which allowed a lot of software to work pretty much perfectly. And it removed the problems that are caused by insufficient information. So yeah, it was interesting.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, it’s a really interesting kind of design space. Paper you wrote “The Intersection of Ricardian and Smart Contracts,” you have this kind of X and Y axis of where the Y axis I believe was like semantic richness. So it’s more leaning into the, natural language kind of agreement. What we traditionally think of as a contract document. And then on the X axis you have operational richness, which is basically what’s actually executable by code. And I think that’s a great kind of mapping of how to map things that are working in this kind of legal&nbsp;tech.</p><p>Ian: Yeah.</p><p>Garrison: And it can vary from asset to asset from use case to use case. There’s so many possibilities there.</p> Ian on the Advent of Cryptocurrencies [00:09:27] <p>Garrison: So when Bitcoin and smart contract platforms like Ethereum emerged. With Bitcoin, we had I guess you could say like the first digital cash system that kind of persevered or kind of survived and kept going and withstood regulatory friction and a lot of forces of nature kind of working against it. Then we had Ethereum that emerged six years later, or, handful of years later, and it kind of delivered on this, on this promise of the smart contract, which Nick Sabo proposed in like&nbsp;1994.</p><p>So when these cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms emerged, what was your initial response to them in relation to this digital cash system that you had actually&nbsp;created.</p><p>Ian: Mm. Yeah. Well, I was in the cryptography group when Satoshi published and discussed and eventually published his&nbsp;paper.</p><p>And I read the paper at the time. I didn’t like it. The key thing was, it was a very clever invention obviously and I realized that at the time, but this notion of having a competition for consensus meant immediately to me, people are going to be burning energy on this thing. And that seemed to me to be an unsustainable expense. But actually the author was clearly a lot cleverer than I was and had managed to constrain it, such that it didn’t completely get out of control. It was a stability involved based on the price which we didn’t really see it until prices actually started to move from zero upwards. But then, there was a stability in the system based on the number of people who were trading these things which was very clever. And obviously a massive breakthrough.</p><p>What was the big issue there was because considering that I had come from the client server world, we had all been thinking that client server was the only way to do it. But what we had entirely missed was that the server was always a weakness. And we had been somewhat blinded by our, if you like, our bias towards client server. So whenever one of these systems failed, we hadn’t treated it as a server failure. So for example, I was involved in the e-gold community. built a thing called Digigold. You could consider it to be e-gold version two or something like&nbsp;that.</p><p>Which we got up and going, but it got into trouble through the actions of the people involved. I mean, to put it short in short terms, I and Douglas Jackson, the e-gold founder, got into court battles and so forth and so on. And, because I was the guy who was running Digigold and he was the guy running e-gold, these things didn’t survive because the founders behind these systems got into distracting arguments.</p><p>And it wasn’t clear that the problem there was the architectural problem was that there was a founder, there was an owner, there was a contractor party, there was somebody managing the servers. The inspiration of this, of Satoshi, was — yeah, that’s the problem. The people behind the servers or the people behind the center are the problem, not the solution. So let’s figure out a way to remove that. And that was the big that the huge breakthrough that changed everything.</p> Blockchain is Just Another Tool [00:12:47] <p>Garrison: And was there kind of a moment where there was like Bitcoin or Ethereum that you thought that: finally there’s like the infrastructure that we needed to do the things that you had envisioned or was it just another tool that kind of just&nbsp;emerged?</p><p>Ian: No. I think it’s just another tool that it merged. Obviously did a lot better than what we had done. There was a moment where I decided that actually this thing had passed the test of time and was here to stay. And that was when a fund in America paid me to go and be their dark horse. They’re anti-Bitcoiner. Through that process where I sat in front of 20 or 30 potential investors into their fund and I argued against Bitcoin and so forth. And when I saw what was happening there, I thought, okay, this is interesting. Regardless of what I think technically, we’re now at the point where enough people will believe in this thing such that it will sustain and it’s clearly sustained itself in the past. So, well, I kind of flipped at that and realized, well, this thing here is here to&nbsp;stay.</p><p>Not that I’ve ever got over my, if you like, my distaste of the proof of work consensus, load cost, and so forth. So I actually, I was very happy to join the Block One crowd and work on DPoS, delegated proof of stake, because that is a system that gets rid of the expensive proof of work mechanism. Albeit it brings in its own problems. So if you like the proof of work thing gives you open access and open entry, and therefore it is in a theory, it’s a fair mechanism, whereas delegated proof of stake encourages the problem of cartelization amongst the block producers. Which eventually causes problems unless you’re very careful to keep that down. There’s swings and roundabouts, there’s pluses and minuses with all these systems. So you have to be very careful about what it is you’re trying to do before you choose one of these mechanisms.</p> Mattereum’s Building on the Ricardian Framework [00:14:46] <p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely. So to kind of bring it back to Mattereum, it would be fun to kind of explore initial conversations you had with Vinay when he was like conceptualizing Mattereum and thinking about it. Could you unpack what was part of those conversations? Those initial conversations.</p><p>Ian: To be frank we didn’t have that many conversations on it. Vinay has always been very, very solid about saying that basically he’s just building on the Ricardian contract and the governance techniques that I did in the nineties. There’s a thing called five parties model, which I put together in the nineties. It wasn’t so much an invention as take classical governance techniques and lay them out and just slot them into the digital world. This is what we did at e-gold and Gold Money and the various other players. And it’s what they should be doing with the stablecoin issues for example, and also ICOs and so forth, but they haven’t learned this&nbsp;yet.</p><p>These things were all available to Vinay and I think, yeah, he mostly did his own study on it. He really came back to me and said, what about this? What about that job? He just seemed to drink it up. So it’s unusual to find somebody who can actually drink this stuff up just by reading the documentation.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. I remember like when, he was telling me the kind of origin story, if you will. How he was basically like screaming into the void at the rest of the people in crypto. That we have to get the legals right in order to actually properly integrate the system with the real world. If you want this world changing potential of blockchain, you have to be able to connect these two realms in an effective way. And most people would just completely ignored him. So then eventually he founded a company that was aiming to do just&nbsp;that.</p> The Cost and Necessity of Building Governance [00:16:35] <p>Ian: Yeah. And it’s interesting because I faced the same dilemma. We issued gold in around about 2000, the Digigold thing. And we issued physical gold in 2002 thereabouts. We had a kilogram bar, which was our reserves. The custodian was designated as a person. The mint was designated as a person. Todd Boyle, the accountant, was in fact part of that circle of governance. And we got the whole thing completely right, and issued it and so forth. But it was interesting because some people appreciated that but the vast majority of people didn’t really appreciate what we done. It was a if most people would look to other people for validation. And therefore you had this wide open space for scams. All you had to do is generate the sense of validation in some sense, And everybody would pile in because somebody had validated it to them and they’d been validated by somebody else. And it eventually becomes a circle. But to do it properly is actually a bit of work. It took us a month to set up the governance, just the governance of the gold bar, for example, in terms of agreements and contracts and understanding, getting everybody on board for the parts that they&nbsp;play.</p><p>It’s quite easy to fall into the trap of saying, “Yeah, let’s ignore all that stuff, throw it out there and see what happens.” And of course, people start throwing you money. And what, somebody once said to me, or somebody frequently said when there was, if you like, opposition to his ideas, he kept saying, “People keep sending me money and therefore I know what I’m doing.” And he was right until he wasn’t right. And it all came crashing down and that’s where you need those better mechanisms. So if you’re in it for the long run, yeah, you need to do all this&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>And actually that’s a really good way of figuring out whether something is a fraud or not, or something is going to be undermined and fail. Or not, it doesn’t necessarily have to be a fraud. Do they do the governance? And the governance is fairly simple. It’s all standard. It’s all documented. You just follow these steps. Did they do it, or did they not? But nobody seems to want to get into that because it’s not sexy. It’s not tech. It’s&nbsp;not</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. It’s very&nbsp;human.</p><p>Ian: Yes. It’s not this magical consensus thing. This proof of work and NEMIS keys and all that sort of&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>Garrison: One of the projects that Mattereum is working on currently is launching gold-backed NFTs. Which is kind of like just the recent iteration of the kind of gold digitization that e-gold did and Digigold and. It is true. It’s a lot of work to deal with all the humans or wet code that’s kind of necessarily involved to do the right governance. And when you’re, when you’re dealing with physical objects and stuff like that. If we can do that process well enough and perhaps streamline it over time, it opens many use cases in terms of like what kind of assets can be created or managed. Or opening access to certain&nbsp;assets.</p><p>If we can get the governance right around digital assets or digital assets that are tethered to physical objects, then it would open up a lot of doors for us. Like just as a society in terms of managing commerce and production and consumption. But you know there’s a lot of tough work that you have to do in order to kind of get to that&nbsp;future.</p><p>There’s a lot of things that you’ve worked on that I’ve been very fascinated about. Whether it’s governance. Governance of entire blockchain networks, like with the design of EOS, for example, or integrating crypto with like existing social structures, which I find really fascinating with like Chamapesa. You’ve explored a lot of the different kind of use cases of these technologies, drawing upon like the foundational work and thinking that you did around the Ricardian contract. Like what, what excites you these days? What actually stands out to&nbsp;you?</p> The Chamapesa Project [00:20:53] <p>Ian: The work I do these days is still the old Chamapesa project. It’s working slowly because I’m having to code it up myself. I guess I should say a little bit about that. The notion that you can come together as small groups and you can decide to commit as a group to do savings together is something that can be done completely disconnected from the financial system. So you’ve actually created, if you like, your own answer to financial inclusion because what you’ve done is you’ve excluded the financial system from yourselves. The financial system was already excluding you from their participation. So you have to start&nbsp;again.</p><p>But it only works not as individual system and not as a large community, but as a small group. It only works because what you can do is you can choose the members of the group to start from a very high trust level, even in a totally corrupt environment. Enough people very close by and you can select from them who is trustworthy and bring those together as a very small, tight, trustworthy group.</p><p>And on top of that, you can do all sorts of things because we’re trying to do savings in these groups. That means we’re handling each other’s money and therefore we’re very dependent on each other. And once we get that level of trust, it’s possible to do a lot of things. We can interact with other groups. We can do supply chain. We can do organizations of payments, for example. We don’t need to worry too much about who the other party is as long as we know which group it is. We can rely on the group to look after its members. We can do things like identity. There’s a lot of things that we can&nbsp;do.</p><p>So consequently my work these days is trying to build a platform which works with those groups and allows them to, if you like, utilize their capabilities in better ways, in more powerful ways. As I say, it’s slow work cause I’m doing it all&nbsp;myself.</p><p>Garrison: I love that concept of like focusing on smaller groups and then scaling from there. That’s just natural to how people organize and cooperate with one another. Something that I pay a lot of attention to is projects, both within crypto and outside of crypto that are kind of founded on more like, principles of cooperation and interdependence rather than absolute independence, assuming that everyone is working in their own selfish interests. I don’t really buy into that framework so much. But I really liked that idea of scaling up from existing social structures and trust relationships, because you could apply that to social savings groups in Africa. But also in other parts of the world, cooperatives throughout the world. The context could vary from just the community to art co-ops or studios and stuff like&nbsp;that.</p><p>I really like that kind of approach to things. Cause a lot of people try to have this monolithic solution. We cook up some solution in Silicon Valley and then we try to export it to other parts of the world in different cultures. And it’s like that doesn’t work&nbsp;out.</p> Identity Through Community [00:24:05] <p>Ian: That doesn’t work out at all. Yeah. It’s interesting. You say that it’s natural. It’s actually more than being natural. It’s who we are. Because if you look into it, try and figure out where all this came from, it traces back to basic anthropology and society in the sense that if you start, for example, with the child or the baby that’s born on day zero, they’re basically a tabula rasa, an empty slate, blank slate. And there’s nothing in there except the ability to cry and suckle basically. But if you shift forward 20 years or so, you’ve now got a working functioning adult with all the sophistication that is needed to do complex trades to engage in negotiations, to date with a person and start a family of her&nbsp;own.</p><p>So how did this happen? Well, actually it turns out the answer is very much in groups. It starts out with the mother of course, bringing the baby up, but pretty soon on the father turns up and upsets the very cozy arrangement that the baby had with the mother. So the baby now needs to learn how to deal with the father, which creates a sense of identity. And then they’ve got siblings and uncles and aunts and grandmothers and so forth. So actually the child is brought up in the context of a group. And therefore, when it comes time to leave the nest, when the child is booted out, because she’s now an adult and she’s got to go make her own way, she carries with her, this, this shall we say, groupness, this sense of identity inside a group. So naturally she’s quite happy to form another group or to participate in a group or to find a&nbsp;group.</p> Dissonance Between Identity Frameworks &amp; Societal Expectation [00:26:02] <p>And the reason we don’t really treasure this, we in fact avoid it in, if you like, academic discussion is because of the Western tradition for the last 500 years or so of individualism and capitalism. We treasure the notion of individualism and capitalism and so forth. And you’re going out to fight in the markets and become a millionaire by the time you’re 50 or whatever it is. These things are inculcated as the way we work in the world, but it’s not the way we work in the world. The way we work in the world is inside&nbsp;groups.</p><p>So the whole Western economy, if you like, has this dichotomy where we’ve got this theoretical notion of individualism fighting with our natural sense of community in groups, whereas we go outside the Western world, they don’t have the dichotomy. They’re much more oriented to the notion of, “Yes, we are naturally in our groups. We have groups, we work with groups, we have extended families. We have community groups, we have this, we have that. That’s how we do things.” So they don’t have that, if you like, collision of&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Garrison: It all comes down to people’s framings of identity. Crypto is, in large part although it’s certainly changed over the years, tends to be a little more very capitalist driven, libertarian, rugged individualism. It’s kind of lacking in the kind of interdependence and kind of cooperative principles that you find a little more in other cultures. Or at least it’s more prominent or foundational to other cultures.</p><p>I love your example of how an identity is formed because there’s like a — what was it? I don’t know if I’m saying that right — concept of like “I am, because we&nbsp;are.”</p><p>Ian: Yes,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>Garrison: Is that what it is or am I misquoting?</p><p>Ian: That’s exactly what it is. Yes, yes. Yes. I am because we are. I am the person that my community defines myself, defines me as. I am the person that everybody around me, who I hold close will say that I am. And my position in the community is my future, if you like. I’m not an individual, I’m a member of a community.</p> Reputation &amp; Identity in Cryptosystems [00:28:19] <p>Garrison: The paradigm for awhile, at least in the blockchain space, has been. Assuming that the networking question has some sort of protocol token, that the more of that said token that you have, the more power you have or that kind of defines your presence within that ecosystem. Whereas there’s other design approach where it’s like, okay, well, identity is more about connections between people and your history. So like how do we, how do we build that? And kind of operationalize that.</p><p>And you’re starting to see people kind of talk about this more often lately and like the past year or two about like on chain reputation, or kind of being able to aggregate your on chain activity in a way to kind of prove that, oh, you’ve contributed to this or contributed to&nbsp;that.</p><p>It’s a little more meritocratic. Rather than kind of this. Identity along the edges that we’re talking about, but you’re starting to kind of see that&nbsp;shift.</p><p>The core principles.</p><p>Ian: Yeah, people have been talking about reputation since the beginning of computer time. It was a topic in the nineties and every year or two, somebody would come up with this new concept of putting reputation onto the internet and it never works. It never works. And the reason is that reputation is a very broad group-wise thing whereby in my head, there’s something about you and in your head, there’s something about me. It’s almost by definition, not quite by definition, but almost by definition, you can’t reduce it to a number. You can’t reduce it to a database entry. I mean, they do these things with credit scores and so forth, but obviously that’s such an approximation that it misses out the richness of what’s going&nbsp;on.</p><p>And so, consequently, I think anybody who’s talking about reputation first hasn’t understood the problem at all, and they will waste a lot of time. It turns out that reputation, if you like, comes from groups, comes from identity, comes from trust and so forth and so on. So you have to talk about those things first. And once you’ve got those things sorted out, reputation not only falls out very simply, it’s not particularly important. What’s important is what you’ve&nbsp;built.</p><p>You can see all this in world of, for example, ICOs and token sales and so forth. People looking at the number, the amount of tokens, and they’re saying, “Well, this is the power. This is the goal. This is why we’re here.” But actually the numbers are just the outcome. And if you go back and you look at the process of say, successful token sales, you’ve got this situation where some of the ICOs are fluff. There’s nothing in them. Then others of the ICOs are actually really good projects and really good people and so forth. But one of the ICOs might make more money than the other, or raise more capital or sell more tokens or whatever it is. And it’s not necessarily correlated to how good the project is in a technical sense. You mean, you could look at two white papers and say this one’s good this one’s bad, but the bad one makes more token sales than the good one. What it’s really correlated to is the strength of the network that the founders bring to the&nbsp;table.</p><p>So if you look at, for example, the EOS thing, which I had a lot to do with. It sold tokens to something like $4.1 billion or whatever the published number was. I don’t know what the real number&nbsp;was.</p><p>Garrison: I believe it was the largest of its kind. To this day, it’s the&nbsp;largest.</p><p>Ian: An order of magnitude. Yes. The only one that came close was the Telegram one, but that had to be wound back because they got in trouble with the SEC. Anyway, the reason that happened was because of the strength of the network and that network was a broad group of people who were already operating the BitShares network and the Steemit network. So there are already thousands of people across the world who were interested in, shall we say, Dan Larimer’s next venture. That whole network moved in to purchase the EOS tokens, making it very large. So yeah, the notion of relationships and networks is more or less ignored by the technical community, but it is the&nbsp;key</p><p>Garrison: And there’s a potential risk there as well. if you have a powerful existing network that carries over, especially if it follows like a particular builder or a founder, you do run the risk of cartelization. Because they’re like, “Oh, well, we can put the stakes down, claim our territory right out the gate and it can cause more centralization, cartelization moving&nbsp;forward.</p> Zero-Sum vs Positive-Sum Games [00:33:10] <p>That idea of the network, the kind of social ecosystem that surrounds the project is kind of what lends to its success. It seems interesting that there’s this tendency to completely ignore this kind of like what we’ve been talking about, this kind of more social&nbsp;,community-driven, interdependent aspect of things, which is natural to us as human beings. But there’s this tendency to think of it as, oh, it’s just a flaw that needs to be fixed with some new some new application. So it can be kind of difficult to kind of like steer the blockchain community to like kind of thinking more along these kind of lines of interdependence rather than just everything is competition over cooperation and stuff like that. And that’s just. Differences in philosophy, I&nbsp;guess.</p><p>Ian: Well, it’s differences in economic models, if you like. Those people who are focused on the pure mechanics of a smart contract and the zero sum game, and the notion that we can do these things without having to trust our counter parties. Missing the fact that actually, even if you do these things, there is going to be a large proportion of people who aren’t trustworthy coming in to game the system. So you’re going to end up with, if you like, a very adversarial community. Which is fine if you get it perfectly right, and your use case just needs that. But the vast majority of use cases do need some form of trust. They need some form of positive engagement such that you can actually do things together.</p><p>For example, just the issue of not being able to hack the smart contract is an issue of community in the sense that the hacker is part of your community. Now, what is incentivizing the hacker to not hack? We know what’s incentivizing the hacker to hack, that’s getting all the value and stealing it, but how would you incentivize that person not to hack and without thinking about that, you’re basically creating, if you like, a very technocratic foundation.</p><p>We’ve been doing software since 1943 or thereabouts. And what we have discovered is that software always has a terrible amount of bugs. A huge number of bugs. So when we go forward and say we’ve got this wonderful machine, the smart contract, that can be written to do a perfect zero sum game such that everybody’s happy. Well, that’s total bullshit. We just don’t know how to write good software either as a discipline or a profession or whatever. It’s just not on the table. So we’re fooling ourselves. We’re representing something that we have never really mastered. There is an exception, and that is the spacecraft software, software to run the space craft, the shuttle, so forth. But even there they’ve had quite a few disasters based on program. So yeah, we just can’t prove this. So we are living in a world where we have a cognitive dissonance where we believe two separate things. That software can create this perfect zero sum game, but we know we can’t do anything perfect with software.</p><p>Garrison: One of the things I kind of hope for is kind of shift from zero sum thinking to positive sum thinking, like creating systems that by design are intended to encourage positive sum games or outcomes. Cause it’s just better. I think it’s better if everyone that’s interacting within a system they all benefit in some way. And it seems like it’s just a design approach. But there’s a lot of core philosophies that kind of drive or influence how people think about things much less actually build them or implement them.</p><p>Your example of the spacecraft. Or even airplanes. That software that has in the event of a failure it’s catastrophic. There’s a sense of lives at risk. There’s a weight to&nbsp;it.</p><p>You don’t really see people thinking of smart contract development, building decentralized finance protocols, thinking necessarily with that same kind of weight. Responsibility with what they’re trying to build. It’s very much kind of experimental. Because ultimately even the so-called mature DeFi protocols that people will think of as established are still experiments that are like three years old at the&nbsp;most.</p><p>I’ve seen you on Twitter emphasize strongly how like the contract, the thinking of the contract behind these digital assets, is still lacking. Do you have any thoughts on like how to like convince people who operate in this kind of like digital prime thinking, where it’s all very technical kind of focused in the digital realm, to adopt kind of more like the physical prime thinking where like, oh actually the kind of agreements between people, actual people, are really important to building these&nbsp;things.</p> Ian on Encouraging Ricardian Contract Adoption by Devs [00:38:21] <p>Ian: I have done some recent thinking on this because it’s pretty obvious that people haven’t gone in that direction other than exceptions like Mattereum and so forth. The, the vast majority of the market, we’re talking 99% or so, has just skipped past that and had lots of fun issuing tokens. NFTs, of course, the recent&nbsp;craze.</p><p>So what’s going on here? It’s relatively easy to convince lawyers because lawyers, of course, their meat and drink is contracts. To almost an exclusionary approach. They can’t even think outside the realm of a contract. So they’re quite happy with the concept, but lawyers don’t program. So they can talk and talk and talk about this. And also lawyers aren’t entrepreneurs. They don’t act, they respond. So their way of thinking is, “Oh, there’s a dispute coming, I need to defend.” Yeah. And even if you ask them to write a contract, they’re writing in the future as if there’s a defense needed, there’s a dispute so they’re already in court in their mental state. They’re responding to an&nbsp;attack.</p><p>Whereas your entrepreneur acts into the void and create something in the void. So the lawyers are particularly helpful in this respect. So the other community, if you’d like, that’s interested in this is the developers and I’ve had a look at the whole the development process and I’ve actually come up with a recent thought and that is: okay, how do we make it easier for the developers to do&nbsp;this?</p><p>Well, one thing is we need the tool to write the contract. Another issue is what’s the tool to share the contract? And if you think about, for example, Google Docs, it’s a great tool for sharing documents, but it’s a lousy tool tool for exporting.</p><p>You can’t actually get access to it easily, except by exporting it as a PDF, for example. And that’s a useless form. You can imagine trying to teach lawyers to use Google Docs, but they look at it blankly and say, well, hold on, where’s Microsoft Word? I can’t see it. So you’ve got this huge difficulty and the same happens with programmers, but there is a tool where programmers do share documents, and that’s&nbsp;Git.</p><p>So what I’ve done is I’ve dived into Git, and specifically GitHub, the commercial company, and started modeling the Ricardian contract in GitHub as a GitHub posted document in Markdown format. Now that’s a document that is accessible and it’s shareable by the developers so they can contribute to it by means of pull requests. And they can come to a consensus over what the right version, and it can be exported from because GitHub posts all these different URLs you can use to get access to the document. So I’m now actually reconfiguring all of my software to do GitHub Markdown as the format. I used to use the old Microsoft INI format from 30 or 40 years ago. And that gave us good&nbsp;service.</p><p>We have, if you like, a non-technical, a co-operative requirement, and I’m experimenting with the notion that if we use GitHub, we can show the software and the contract being built up at the same time and therefore attract more developers to the process. And once we get enough developers doing it, there’s going to be the sense whereby, okay, gosh, there’s these developers over here that are using the Ricardian contract. And then there’s the majority of the market, which just don’t know don’t care don’t want it. But if you could compare them, the amount of information available in the Ricardian contract is orders of magnitude better because it’s tied to the NFT. It is the NFT and it is the contract. And we can hold that person to account and say, this is the contract you issued, right? You sold me an NFT, a photo with these rights. The right to hang it on my wall. Okay. Where’s the picture? When can I hang it on my wall? And you can state that with absolute certainty because it’s written in the contract. And once you get that, what you do is you will cause this, if you like, this bifurcation, this forking in the market, such that there’s the people who are doing it properly, the contracts, and then there’s the&nbsp;rest.</p><p>And then will start to spread. Because once you have this very solid difference, like Mattereum is trying to generate now. The Mattereum gold bar is a gold bar, and it’s on the net and it can be purchased and it can be traded. And that works because it’s based on contracts. Once you get that, enough people know that, you’ll start to, if you like, export the proper way of doing&nbsp;things.</p> On the Future of Smart Contracts [00:43:04] <p>Garrison: The kind of trends that are going on right now, both social trends and technological trends. Where do you see smart contracts 5, 10 years from&nbsp;now?</p><p>Ian: So, I’ve long predicted smart contracts really won’t come into their own until they’re incorporated with the legal documentation. And there are a few people that have gone in that direction. So for example, EOS put in the elements of smart contracts and Mattereum of course is doing it with it’s NFTs and so forth. But just getting that element together, you also need the governance and the governance is a lot of work. It’s a lot of costs. Getting that right, is something where somebody’s basically got to invest in doing it right up front to show that over the long run this thing works because we got the governance up and going in the beginning and that we sustained that governance through the lean years to the point where now it’s starting to generate some return for both the customers and for the investors or owners of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>So I think we’re still in the phase where we’re building enough of the building blocks to the point where we can set up, if you like, a foundation, enough foundation, so we can start building the use cases until we’ve got a smorgasbord of governance techniques to choose from and a smorgasbord of contractual mechanisms and different contracts and a smorgasbord of accounting systems and then a smorgasbord of, shall we say, smart contract coding and so forth. Until we’ve got that all nicely laid out such that we just pick one of each of them, put it together, and we create our foundation, we are going to be stymied in building a lot of complicated apps.</p><p>So it’s still a building phase. And I see that Mattereum for example, but there are others doing this as well, doing the brave work of investing upfront into the uncertain future, because if it can get this right, it will create that cornerstone that couples in with the other cornerstones, which makes the foundation work. Somebody has got to do that. Unfortunately, we hit the HODL problem in that it’s far easier to sit there and rely on other people to do the good work and just basically pretend we’re innovative, but really the only innovation we’ve got is bringing more people into the HODL circle, uh, which locks up so much of the capital. And makes it very hard, for example, to create reality, to create a substance. It’s good that people like Mattereum people like Vinay and yourself are pushing forward on this because that’s where the value is going to come from. And that’s where the real value is going to come from, building these building blocks and getting it up and&nbsp;going.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. That’s very well said. From what I gather it is a very expensive and time intensive process to kind of get these governance issues right. But it’s even just important just to give it due consideration before you just jump into some new&nbsp;venture.</p><p>A lot of budding entrepreneurs in the blockchain space. It’s really easy to kind of get carried away by the hype and the potential and the narrative. The kind of lasting impact will be in kind of just staying the course and thinking very longterm. Instead of short term potential or gains and stuff like that. I think there’s more maturity. more maturing going on in the development space. And people’s imaginations are just broader in terms of use cases. So like you get different types of thinkers and builders involved with the technology. So I think that will be hopefully great for all of us. And building better systems, better financial systems, and new ways of cooperating.</p><p>So we’re coming up on an hour into the session here. We’ve covered some of the work you’re currently doing and thinking you’re doing. Is there anything else you’d like to plug before we round things&nbsp;up?</p> Improving Asset Custody in Smart Property Systems [00:47:11] <p>Ian: So one of the things that I’ve done is I’ve looked at a problem that Mattereum had, which was how to do a solid custodial arrangement for some of these physical things. They have the bare bones but what they needed was something a little bit more, if you like, scalable and professional, and so forth. And I just happened to be working with a company called Hover, which is a specialist in the field of setting up custodial arrangements for physical&nbsp;items.</p><p>And I was able to introduce Hover and Mattereum together. I’m related to both companies, so it was a very easy introduction to make, but of course, I also end up being I’m able to participate in the discussion except to jolly things along a bit, because I’m in a conflict of interest. But that’s&nbsp;fine.</p><p>So Hover is a company that is explicitly setting out to create a good custodial arrangement for these assets. And therefore what it does is it solves one of the problems from Mattereum, which is great. How they do it I’m not gonna mention because at the moment they’re still in there shall we say their first or their seed round. And they need to get some money and build their MVP, which is going to happen. And then we’ll start, we’ll be able to talk about how they’ve actually done this but it’s been good because together we’ve found that missing piece which allows the full Mattereum puzzle to be solved. At least that’s the piece that I’ve been advised was missing. So now it’s not missing so that’s&nbsp;good.</p><p>It’s interesting because if you look at the whole arrangement to do this properly, not only do you need the smart contract, the coding, not only do you do need the legal document, but you also need people to hold assets and you need dispute resolution You need these different components which all get put together as a sort of Lego building. And until you’ve got them all there it’s not going to last in the long run. It’s going to be one of these flash in the pan things that scream up and then get into trouble and spring down&nbsp;again.</p><p>Garrison: It puts a lot of pressure to kind of generate a lot of intellectual and financial capital in the very early days of conceiving of this and having to kind of stay the course to make sure you get it right. Cause if you don’t get it right, then there’s a lot of legal systems and software systems start becoming detached from each other and it can be a messy a mess to clean&nbsp;up.</p><p>Ian: It gets messy, which creates costs, which drags everything down.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p>So where can people follow you and your&nbsp;work?</p><p>Ian: These days I tend to use Twitter. But, but that’s just rambling on topics of the day. Iang_fc is the handle. I have a blog called Financial Cryptography that was a long standing blog for over a decade, but I don’t post much on there. In fact, I don’t post anything on there anymore because broken. I haven’t got the wherewithall or the patience to go in and fix&nbsp;it.</p><p>One thing that is happening is that the entire identity cycle has been turned into a book and that book is coming out fairly in the next few months. And that describes, if you the Chamapesa journey and the relationship of social groups to identity and so forth. It’s a long book in terms of an internet read. A 100 or 200 pages. But unfortunately to actually explain why this is so, I had to go very deep and trace through things like the anthropology of the child’s upbringing and so forth. Therefore the description is quite long winded. But without that it’s too many jumps and too many leaps of faith. It took me six years to get it all written down. So consequently, it’s a long read if you like, which is not useful in today’s terms, but anyway, the book will be coming out at some point and hopefully that will be amusing to some&nbsp;people.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, that’s fantastic. I I’ve read a lot of your writing on like identity and not just the Ricardian contract side of things, but also digital identity and your thinking behind that. It’d be great to have it all kind of both compiled and expanded. The connective tissue of that concept. And actually I would love to have you on the podcast again to kind of dig, really dig into the identity thing. We touched upon it in this conversation, which I’m really glad we did. But it’d be great to kind of focus on that. Get a more kind of overarching view and dive deeper into that particular subject.</p><p>Ian: Well, when the book comes out, I guess I’ll be happy to talk if you drifted into the book and actually got some questions out of it. That’d be&nbsp;great.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely. And for listeners, I highly recommend going to — it’s iang.org right that you have some of your papers and&nbsp;—</p><p>Ian: Yeah, it’s just my stuff really. It’s just the stuff site. It’s not pushing any particular concept. I’ve got a section for this, a section for that. I collect everything there so it’s more like a CV or resume than a website, but&nbsp;—</p><p>Garrison: A lot of the topics we covered a lot of the papers that kind of articulated these ideas are in there. I highly recommend if users are interested in like Ricardian contract or thinking about like digital identity and the kind of frameworks for building financial cryptography systems. Definitely check it out. There’s a lot that I think people could get out&nbsp;of.</p><p>Ian: Yes. And the other one is financialcryptography.org. There’s nothing new there, but there are something like 1500 posts over the last decade or&nbsp;so.</p><p>Garrison: Excellent. Thank you very much for coming on the show in Ian. A lot of the work you do is like something that I’ve paid attention to for three, four years now. So it was great to kind of dive in and get your perspective on&nbsp;things.</p><p>Ian: Good to hear. I mean the point of writing it all down is so other people can take from it and maybe learn a bit, but also maybe build on it and do something bigger. It’s encouraging to see Mattereum basically do that. Grab some papers. And race with them. Try and build the&nbsp;future.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/fos-ep-5-ian-grigg-on-crypto-identity-community-and-building-positive-sum-systems-17ef316703b9">FOS Ep. 5: Ian Grigg on Crypto, Identity, Community, and Building Positive-Sum Systems</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Ontology’s Head of Community, Humpty Calderon, answered questions from community members in a <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/6395581279/4672326085646568">short video</a>. He shared some key points about Ontology, highlighting its “mission, products, and partners”.  Ontology published the second in a series of articles about Ontology’s contribution to the coming <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-0-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-part-two-48562cbd5bfb">Web 3.0</a> era. The article discussed co-governance rules and the co-construction ecosystem in relation to Web&nbsp;3,0.  Ontology published its <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1429747737285730304">#WEB3 101</a> Series on domestic and overseas platforms, The thread introduces Web 3.0 and how it will improve upon Web 1.0 and 2.0 infrastructure. Ontology’s EVM support makes it the first public chain to support four virtual machines (VMs), allowing more developers and users to participate in the development of Web 3.0 infrastructure.

<p>Tomorrow’s lending experience runs on consumer-permissioned data. Credit scores and self-submitted details have provided a framework for easy personal lending and even some business loans, but tomorrow’s lending will utilize consumer-permissioned data. This data comes directly from bank accounts, and this process increases accuracy and&nbsp; improves the experience for borrowers when used to augment credit scores and verify self-submitted information.</p>
<p>This transformation into consumer-permissioned data use in credit-decisioning is already happening today thanks to Finicity’s leading open banking data access connections direct to bank accounts. Where’s lending with data headed? How will it benefit lenders and consumers? <a href="http://www.finicity.com/lend-infographic">Download our open banking lending infographic to learn more</a>.</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="http://finicity.com/open-banking">consumer-permissioned financial </a><a href="http://www.finicity.com/open-banking">data</a> from Finicity’s open banking platform to lending makes a difference in a number of ways.</p>
<p>This data allows for simple, personal experiences to capture customers and build trust. It also reduces friction and allows consumers to apply for loans across the devices they use.</p>
<p>One interaction with your borrower can tell a complete financial story using data from different accounts for real-time insights without needing to wait to confirm borrower-submitted details.</p>
<p>Empowering experiences provide direct benefits to the customer by allowing access to their&nbsp; financial data, control over how it’s used, and the ability for them to benefit from its use, such as with obtaining a better loan product or lower interest rate. Additionally, this new innovative service&nbsp; provides lenders a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more secure experience provides clear reasons for consumers to test the waters of new lenders or new products. Knowing your data is safe makes trying new lenders, partners, or products more likely providing a boost to innovative, new products by answering a big question for many people — security.</p>

The FTC is back with its suit against&nbsp;Facebook <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/technology/ftc-facebook-antitrust.html">The NYTimes</a>:</p>Photo: Alessio&nbsp;Jacona<blockquote>“Facebook lacked the business acumen and technical talent to survive the transition to mobile,” Holly Vedova, the acting director of the bureau of competition at the agency, said in a statement. “After failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat.”</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook responded: “There was no valid claim that Facebook was a monopolist — and that has not changed. Our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were reviewed and cleared many years ago, and our platform policies were&nbsp;lawful.”</blockquote><p>As the NYTimes report continues, this is one of Lina Khan’s first big tests after he judge dropped the initial case that’s since been resubmitted:</p><blockquote>The F.T.C.’s core argument is that Facebook tried to maintain a monopoly over social networking through its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Slow to develop its app for mobile phones, the company sought to “buy or bury innovators threatening to out-compete Facebook in the new mobile environment,” the agency said in its complaint.</blockquote><blockquote>The lawsuit also says that, beginning in 2010, the company stifled competitors like Circle, a social network, and Vine, a short-video platform, by adding new limits for how outside developers whose products connected to Facebook could work with other social networks.</blockquote><blockquote>“Facebook beat competitors not by improving its own product but instead by imposing anticompetitive restrictions on developers,” according to the&nbsp;lawsuit.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/technology/ftc-facebook-antitrust.html">U.S. Revives Facebook Suit, Adding Details to Back Claim of a&nbsp;Monopoly</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hit-with-renewed-antitrust-lawsuit-as-ftc-tries-again-11629387483?mod=djem10point">Facebook Hit With New Antitrust Suit From Federal Trade Commission</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/techs-antitrust-nemesis-girds-for-battle">Lina Khan Gets to Work at the&nbsp;FTC</a>   2.

<p>If you have a minute, read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-herrman">John Herrman’s</a>&nbsp;thought-provoking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/31/style/anonymity-pseudonymity-online-identity.html">piece</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;titled “Reconsidering pseudonymity and what it means to be ourselves online.”</p>



<p>We liked the article because it highlights why&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;exists and states a position we’ve always believed in—that there’s a genuine place for anonymity and pseudonymity online.</p>



<p>For years solutions to the growing problem of trolling and abuse have largely centered on ridding the internet of anonymity—forcing people to reveal their real names and identities when they engage online. But unmasking the vile troll&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155923">won’t stop the abuse;</a>&nbsp;instead, it would leave the honest majority of users without protection, freedom and control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often when the legitimate need for anonymity and pseudonymity is discussed, the conversation starts and stops with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/removing-anonymity-online-would-risk-the-most-vulnerable-users/">most vulnerable groups</a>. While a completely valid use case, this tends to marginalize the general need to a niche, a notion that Anonyome Labs rejects. We started our company in 2014 expressly to provide such services for the general public.</p>



<p>We believe that all people should be able to determine how, when, where, and with whom they share their personal details, and that level of control is best delivered via&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">digital pseudonymized identities</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, the public discourse needs to catch up to the broader need for anonymity and pseudonymity. As John Herrman says in his article: “When represented at all, positive uses of anonymity and pseudonymity are portrayed as narrow and exceptional; it makes sense for dissidents, for instance, but what does everyone else have to hide?”.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re pleased to see the nuances of anonymity and pseudonymity explored in a publication as mainstream as the&nbsp;New York Times. The world needs to have this conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because after all, as Herrman says: “The desire for semi-anonymity shares one concern: control. A troll wants control over who knows what about him; a master-of-the-universe type wants to decide what gets stuck to the family name; a young person needs a space to figure things out; an older person needs a space to change. And yet, the desire to be different to different people is as familiar as family, as common as having friends and living around other people, valuable to the powerful and the weak. Who hasn’t, at some point, yearned for that kind of agency?”</p>



<p>It’s hard to argue that those sentiments aren’t universal, even if you also think Internet trolls are ruining the world.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the fifth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/Jatinkkalra">Jatin</a>, administrator of <a href="https://t.me/OntologyIndia">Ontology&nbsp;Hindi</a>.</p><p>1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology?</p><p>It was around mid-2019 when I got to know about Ontology through Twitter. I went into their Telegram and saw some good announcements in the announcement channel, and thus I started following them.</p><p>2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand?</p><p>Once I started communicating with other Indians in the chat, I realized that most preferred Hindi. That made me decide to create an <a href="https://t.me/OntologyIndia">Indian Ontology group</a> to invite the friendly guys I met on Telegram.</p><p>3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger?</p><p>I think the key role is to interact with the community and address all their doubts. That’s what I am good at and I do enjoy interacting with my friends in the <a href="https://t.me/OntologyIndia">Ontology India Telegram</a>&nbsp;chat.</p><p>4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you?</p><p>I like to hang out in my Indian groups and discuss what is going on in the decentralized identity ecosystem, and crypto in general. I have a great time&nbsp;there.</p><p>5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out?</p><p>What makes it stand out is the freedom that the Ontology team gives to the Harbingers. Whether it is on events, campaigns, ideas or handling the local communities in their own way. Not many crypto projects give this much freedom to their community managers.</p><p>6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others?</p><p>That would be Telegram, as that’s the platform my friends and I are most active on. Twitter is also being revamped and an event/contest will be announced every month there from now&nbsp;on.</p><p>7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger?</p><p>That would be the wishes and the vibe I receive at festivals or whenever something good happens in the life of any Indian community member. I would advise you to make the community members your family, and you will have the best time hanging out with&nbsp;them.</p><p>8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words?</p><p>Friendly, Awesome, Energetic.</p><p>9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow?</p><p>Updating the wider community about <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ultimate-ontology-staking-guide-e70c44330429">ONT staking</a> and the yield farming strategies in the Ontology ecosystem can help a lot, in my opinion. There are lots of opportunities available; yield farmers just need to be made aware of&nbsp;them!</p><p>10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these?</p><p>Working and achieving new heights in the decentralized identity world is a great achievement in my opinion. Upcoming EVM-compatibility will also help to onboard many more developers to the Ontology ecosystem. Community can also help by spreading more awareness about Ontology’s achievements and thus can turn more eyes toward the growing Ontology ecosystem.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the sixth interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

In the past year, as Urbit has become more reliable and easier to use, we find that we're spending almost all of our time on the network. We've disappeared into the system we've been building, and it's a pleasure to be on Urbit. There's nowhere else we'd rather be.

If you're on the network with us you can see the system being built and getting better in real time. Bug fixes and new features appear on your ship constantly. The community is actively planning the future of the system _using the system itself_. At Tlon, we have the unparalleled pleasure of working on the system, _on the system_. This feels great, but for those of you who aren't on the network, it can look as if we've disappeared.

Right now, Urbit is not for my non-technical friends. But everyone can tell that mainstream apps are getting worse and most feel a desire for change. We want Urbit to be as easy to use as a conventional service. Or, at least as easy to use as Signal. And we're getting pretty close to that.

In this post I'll cover the progress we've made since releasing OS 1 so those who aren't on the network can get a sense of what we've been up to and where we're going. We've built a great communication tool called Landscape, we are improving Urbit's ease of onboarding, and we're launching an entire software distribution system. We have a lot of work on our plate.

Okay, let's talk about where we currently stand and where we're heading.

**Arc**

Let's start at the top: we're working to build a new network and operating system for everyday cloud computing. We think everyone deserves to control and shape the tools they use to communicate and collaborate.

Or, to put it another way: the apps and services we have today are confusing, annoying, and overly complicated. The only way out is to start at the foundation by building a new software stack. Once we have a cloud computing stack that an individual can own and completely control, the old hope that computers can be tools of freedom will return. We haven't forgotten the original vision of software as a fun, free, flexible everyday tool.

This is a hilariously ambitious thing to try to do, we know. This is what makes it fun. So far, we just try to move step-by-step without overhyping what we're doing. Building a new platform for networked computing is both a technical and social problem. The technology has to work exceptionally well and the community has to care for it and move it forward.

Our first step was simply to build a prototype, then to refine it into something that could plausibly work. Then, most recently, take that plausible prototype and build a user experience we liked enough to depend on it from day-to-day.

In the last eighteen months we've done exactly that. We depend on Urbit day-to-day and have shipped a tool that has become a home for numerous cultures and communities who are invested in moving the system forward. We first called that tool OS 1 but now it's known as Landscape.

First, let's talk about the general arc of OS 1 → Landscape, both the successes and challenges. Then we'll talk about our next step, which is to create an independent and community supported software ecosystem.

**OS 1 → Landscape**

The tools we use shape the way we think. So how could we build better tools with old broken ones? We needed to cut our reliance on old tools that couldn't care less about how people actually work and live. The only thing they maximized was distraction and dependence. We needed something that was fundamentally private, durable, and flexible. Above all, we needed something that actually belonged to us.

Building Urbit involves a lot of communication and collaboration. In order to move Urbit forward we knew that we needed a place to converse and connect, and we knew that place had to be on Urbit itself. We didn't need a Slack or a Discord or a Google Drive or a Reddit. We needed all of those things, in one place, that actually belonged to us.

We experimented, built things, threw them away, and then eventually built and [launched OS 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ViyftPkGk).

OS 1, now Landscape, is a simple tool for bringing groups together to communicate and stay connected. When a real physical community goes online they immediately become fragmented between various apps. Perhaps a Slack channel coupled with some Notion notebooks and a Telegram channel works for some people. It's easy to imagine other permutations, and you probably are already in at least two or three. These duct-taped stacks are not only ugly and confusing, but your day to day computing is spread thin and remains in the control of companies—not you.

Urbit is a decentralized network but Landscape is for re-centralizing your communication. Users can form groups which share a set of channels; each channel can be either a chat, a notebook or a collection of links. This means groups can communicate flexibly, exactly how they want. And since Landscape is built on Urbit, each group is private and peer to peer; data is only shared between people in the group; each community on Landscape is completely independent. Communities own their data and last as long as they need to.

This combination of a flexible unified interface on a decentralized platform you can trust feels really good.

When OS 1 was first released, it was slow, buggy, and frustrating—but we loved it and wanted it to be better. We spent the next nine months making sweeping changes to take it from releasable prototype to pretty-nice first version. We rewrote the frontend completely, massively improved the performance of Urbit OS itself, and overhauled the interface. It was an enormous collective effort.

By the end of 2020 we had renamed OS 1 to Landscape and the user experience was far better. We [announced our hosting service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qKe_WZr50) and onboarded close friends to help us test the system. I [wrote a little](&lt;[https://tlon.io/news/landscape-now/](https://tlon.io/news/landscape-now/)&gt;) about using Landscape from day-to-day around that time.

Landscape wasn't just a useful tool for us, but it was something that other communities were starting to use in earnest. It seemed like Landscape could be a great place for people to grow new private communities, so long as we could onboard new users effectively. Hosting is a huge piece of the puzzle, since we need non-technical people to be able to use this wonderful platform as easily as its mainstream competitors.

At this point (early this year), we encountered some pretty serious hurdles.

To use Urbit, you need an Urbit ID. Each one of these is an NFT (something that no one cared about when we first launched Urbit ID). The basic idea is that an ID should cost something so that they aren't used abusively. But, in late 2020 the combination of a crypto bull market and congestion on the Ethereum network caused the transaction fee for buying an Urbit ID to increase from ~$1-2 to ~$100. An Urbit ID should cost _something_, but \&gt;$100 is too much of a barrier for entry. We knew that this could happen and started researching solutions late last year, ultimately deciding to [implement a solution ourselves](https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/).

The tough part about having an identity verified on the blockchain is that you become vulnerable to unpredictable volatility. We saw a period of painfully high prices, followed by a dip, followed by another stretch of extremely high prices. We opted to continue releasing Landscape updates and moving the system forward despite the fact that it became prohibitively expensive to onboard people. Luckily, our solution to this problem should go live this summer, and will reduce the cost of onboarding about 60x. The best part is that it is a permanent solution so we'll never have to face this problem again.

The other challenge to scaling the onboarding process is hosting.

We have a functional hosting structure but we want it to be fully automated and featured. We've been able to onboard friends and enthusiasts which has taught us a lot about how the system should work. But hosting has to be easy for anyone to join and get online quickly. Without an automated invite flow and it's not ready for prime time.

We've made great progress on this front. We are currently testing improvements internally and aim to have a final version ready simultaneously with lower planet fees. Then, at long last, we can comfortably invite friends to get on the network without ever leaving the browser.

It's worth mentioning that hosting is very much a Tlon Corporation project. Urbit is a platform owned, maintained, and developed by the people that use it (along with the nascent Urbit Foundation). Tlon, while also contributing to the Urbit project, ultimately wants to produce applications and services on Urbit. Hosting is one of those projects. Hosting makes Urbit easy, approachable, and usable without the compromises involved in using a conventional service. Since we'll be one of many Urbit-related providers, Tlon won't be the only host. There are already a few others (like [UrbitHost](https://urbithost.com/)) getting off the ground, which is fantastic.

**Landscape → Grid**

As the world has become more physically distributed we rely on our digital tools to keep our communities connected. The rise of DAOs, collectives, squads, and alternative community governance structures underscores the importance of tools like Landscape that communities can actually own and control.

Our first goal was to find out if we could build something really good on top of Urbit. We did that. And we're continuing to lower the barrier to entry. We've also got an Urbit 'messenger' iOS app in the works that's really nice.

Landscape is great, but in the long run Urbit is meant to be a platform for anyone to build on top of. Urbit is a computer, not just a single communications app like Landscape. The whole point of Urbit is to make it easy for an individual to run their own general-purpose computer in the cloud. Your Urbit isn't just meant to run Landscape it's meant to run any sort of application. And that's where we're going next.

Grid is a holistic interface for interacting with your Urbit node. Landscape, as it's known today, will become one of many apps that can be launched. Perhaps most importantly, Grid will have peer-to-peer software distribution over the network. This means you can, as a developer, build something, let a friend sync it over the network, and never have to run a dedicated distribution server. Or, as an everyday user, you can run software on your private Urbit node without the developer ever being involved.

Urbit isn't an OS in the traditional sense—it's an 'overlay' OS. It has to run on top of something else. But Urbit _is_ an OS in the sense that it's general-purpose. And our goal in building interfaces for Urbit is to deliver that feeling of openness and flexibility to the user. Grid is a major step toward that goal.

Not only should a community own their communication tools, they should be able to run and host their own cloud software. They shouldn't need to rely on providers to store their data, run the application, and determine how their digital life will function.

Grid will surely go through the same process that Landscape did. It'll start as a working first version that will inspire us to refine and make it better. But, unlike Landscape, Grid opens up an entirely new frontier for what can be done on Urbit.

We're putting together our first conference on Oct 15-17th to inaugurate Urbit as an integrated platform and distribution system for new applications. [Tickets for Assembly 2021 are already available](https://checkout.eventcreate.com/assembly2021/select-buy). Tlon is going to Austin!

**Closing**

Urbit is a deeply optimistic project. Although the digital world seems more broken than ever, we're confident that something else is possible. We have already created software that people use everyday. We want everyone to have the experience that we do, and we want that experience to continue to get better. Beautiful, reliable infrastructure that communities can build on will have a significant impact on the world. The end game of connected computers doesn't have to be dystopian.

For those of you who aren't directly involved with the project, I hope this gives you a snapshot of where we are. If we were on an Antarctic expedition the postcard would read something like 'Team is well-fed, healthy and motivated. Making great progress.'

With that, I'll get back to work.

 Jolocom bringt im ONCE Projekt hoheitliche Identitäten sowie SSI in eine Wallet. 



<p>Jolocom arbeitet im Project “ONCE – Online einfach anmelden” gemeinsam mit renommierten Partnern daran, die digitalen Identitäten von Bürgern und Bürgerinnen ganzheitlich auf das Smartphone zu bringen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Projekt ist Teil des Innovationswettbewerbs „Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten”, gefördert durch das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi), und eines von insgesamt vier Projekten, die es in die dreijährige Umsetzungsphase geschafft haben. Die Jolocom GmbH wird ihre Expertise in der Entwicklung von Wallet-basierten Digitalen Identitäten auf Basis des Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Ansatzes in insgesamt drei der Umsetzungsprojekte einbringen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nach einjähriger Vorbereitung im Rahmen der ersten Wettbewerbsphase hat die Umsetzungsphase für das Projekt ONCE im Mai 2021 begonnen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In der Anfangsphase liegt der Fokus noch stark auf der Entwicklung, Implementierung und Integration der technischen Komponenten. Bald wird allerdings die Umsetzung von Anwendungsfällen aus den Bereichen Öffentliche Verwaltung, Mobilität und Tourismus in den Vordergrund treten. Die Lösungen des ONCE-Ökosystems werden dann insbesondere in der Region Hessen, sowie in Partnerstädten in Bayern und Nordrhein-Westfalen pilotiert und in Umlauf gebracht. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt werden die praktischen Ergebnisse von ONCE&nbsp; im Alltag durch Anwohner und Bürger der Regionen erprobt.</p>



<p>Das ONCE-Ökosystem besteht aus einer Reihe von aufeinander abgestimmten Komponenten, die langfristig als eine Referenzimplementierung für ein offenes Identitätsökosystem dienen sollen. Aus diesem Grund wird bei den zu entwickelnden Komponenten von “ONCE-konformen” Lösungen gesprochen.</p>



<p>In seiner Funktionalität ist das Ökosystem darauf ausgelegt sowohl hoheitliche Identitäten und Nachweise zu bedienen (eID, mDL, iKfz), als auch Identitätsmerkmale, die nach den Prinzipien der selbstbestimmten Identität (Self-sovereign Identity) herausgegeben und verwendet werden. Das ONCE-Projekt berücksichtigt auch derzeitige Entwicklungen rund um die europäische eIDAS-Verordnung, mit dem klaren Ziel zukunftsfähige Lösungen zum Thema Digitale Identitäten für deutsche und EU-Bürger bereitzustellen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom ist im ONCE-Projekt für die Entwicklung der ONCE-konformen Wallet zuständig, welche auf der Jolocom Smart-Wallet aufbaut und die gemeinsam mit den Projektpartnern in den kommenden zwei Jahren um weitere Module und Funktionen ergänzt werden wird.&nbsp;</p>

 Jolocom puts sovereign identities, as well as SSI into a single wallet as part of the ONCE project. 



<p>Jolocom is currently working on the project “ONCE – Online einfach anmelden” (simply register online – ONCE) alongside a number of prestigious partners, with the aim to bring the digital identity of any citizen onto their smartphone.</p>



<p>The project is part of the competitive innovation programme “Showcase Secure Digital Identities” (SSDI) funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and one of four projects that qualified for the implementation phase.</p>



<p>Jolocom is a partner in three of the four SDI implementation projects, to which it will lend its expertise in self-sovereign identity and years of experience in developing digital identity wallets.</p>



<p>ONCE is the first of these projects to launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a year’s preparation during the initial competition phase, the implementation phase of the ONCE project started in May 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, the focus is on the development and application of the technical components. Soon, however, a large number of use cases from the public administration, mobility and tourism sectors will be piloted in the Hesse region and in partner cities in Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia. It is at this stage that the ONCE ecosystem will be tested by ordinary citizens.</p>



<p>The ONCE ecosystem consists of a number of inter-dependent and well coordinated components that are intended to serve as a reference point for a long-lasting open identity ecosystem in Germany. As such, components developed in the project have been dubbed ONCE-compliant solutions.</p>



<p>In terms of its functionality, the ecosystem is designed to serve officially issued, so-called sovereign identities and proofs (eID, mDL, iKfz), as well as digital identity credentials issued and used according to the principles of self-sovereign identity. The ONCE project is also taking recent developments in the European eIDAS regulation into consideration, with the aim of providing future-proof solutions for digital identities to German and EU citizens.</p>



<p>Within the ONCE project, Jolocom is responsible for the development of the ONCE-compliant wallet. This will be based on Jolocom’s existing SmartWallet and will, with the aid of the project partners, be supplemented with additional modules and functions over the next two years.</p>



 Publicly funded project partners 



<p>Bundesdruckerei GmbH (Lead coordinatior of the consortium), AKDB, Behle Hochheide GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Deutsche Telekom Security GmbH, ekom21 – KGRZ Hessen, Fraunhofer-Institute für Angewandte und Integrierte Sicherheit (AISEC) und für Arbeitswirtschaft und Organisation (IAO), Giesecke+Devrient Mobile Security GmbH, Governikus KG, HelloGuest Solutions GmbH, Jolocom GmbH, regio iT GmbH, Robert Bosch GmbH, Stadt Fürth, Vodafone GmbH.</p>



<p>A further 24 companies are associated partners of the project, supporting the consortium work without public funding for their expenses.</p>

 ML Ops — a TPM’s guide on how to get&nbsp;started <p>First things first — Why am I writing this&nbsp;article?</p><p>I had my first experience working on deploying a new machine learning model to a live production system two years ago when I joined a high profile project said to be game-changing for our business (no pressure!). We had a tight timeline and high expectations to positively impact key business metrics. As a technical program manager (TPM) I was responsible for driving the successful delivery of the research-ready model to production in the requested time frame and ensuring we realise the expected business impact. Spoiler alert — it didn’t go so smoothly!</p><p>While working on this project I identified numerous gaps in our machine learning development and delivery infrastructure and processes. After highlighting these gaps to our leadership, I was tasked with founding our machine learning operations team. In this article, I will share a framework for founding and growing an ML Ops team within an organisation.</p><p>When starting in the field, I found that it was pretty difficult to find resources on how to start, organise and run an ML Ops function and team in an organisation. There was a lot of information on different tools that take care of parts of the ML pipeline but that was about it. For a newbie to the problem space, I found that I largely had to depend and draw on my skills and prior experience as a TPM and take it from&nbsp;there.</p><p>Here I will reflect on some of my experience working in ML Ops and will discuss the background, fundamentals and how to get started. I hope it will be useful to those just starting their ML Ops&nbsp;journey.</p><p>ML Ops Background</p><p>As the popularity of machine learning models grew, machine learning platforms were required to support the development, delivery and maintenance of many models in a live production system at scale. Particularly, the need for machine learning platforms began to rise several years ago after companies developing and using ML models in their products started to realise that deploying ML models came with added complexities compared to traditional code. Whilst deploying the model itself can be relatively easy, it’s the ongoing operations and maintenance once the model goes to production that was difficult to&nbsp;manage.</p><p>One of the most prominent papers that first highlighted this problem came in 2014 from a group of Google researchers titled “Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt”. In the paper, the authors alluded to a growing and often ignored problem, namely the operational complexities of maintaining a machine learning system in production.</p><p>The paper highlighted that ‘Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning.’ [D. Sculley, Gary Holt,&nbsp;etc]</p><p>The paper also sparked awareness and interest in the problem field of operations and maintenance of machine learning models in production. In response, many companies started investing and forming ML Ops functions to develop and manage their machine learning platforms and the full machine learning lifecycle.</p><p>This brings us to two main questions:</p>  What is ML&nbsp;Ops?  What is the full machine learning lifecycle?  <p>What is ML&nbsp;Ops?</p><p>There are a few definitions of the ML Ops function and team responsibilities but, at its core, the team’s purpose is to ‘help simplify the management, logistics, and deployment of machine learning models between operations and engineering teams and machine learning researchers’. Most commonly, as intuited by the name, ML Ops is compared to DevOps or cloud infrastructure teams but applied to the field of machine learning. The goals of the two functions are very similar. Much like DevOps, the goal of ML Ops is to create a continuous development pipeline for machine learning models. A pipeline that quickly allows data scientists and machine learning engineers to deploy, test and monitor their models, ensuring they continue to act in the way they are expected&nbsp;to.</p><p>In practice, this means that ML Ops must manage a much wider range of responsibilities than would normally be expected from DevOps. Unlike DevOps, ML Ops typically requires additional considerations including data verification, model analysis, metadata management, feature engineering, code and data versioning along with the ML code&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Besides DevOps, ML Ops also works very closely with data/applied scientists and software engineers. The diagram below visualises the scope of the ML Ops team and its function.</p><p>From my personal experience, there are two key benefits of ML Ops in an organisation. The first is to provide tooling and infrastructure by working closely together with DevOps and Engineering. The second is to bring data/applied scientists and software engineers closer together and to foster collaboration and best practices, thereby streamlining the model development, productionisation and maintenance.</p><p>The ML Pipeline and the ML Lifecycle</p><p>Often, the ML Lifecycle is described as having the following stages:</p><p>However, in a modern organisation that builds AI-powered products, the above diagram covers only half of the ML lifecycle. For truly successful ML-powered products, additional stages need to be&nbsp;added.</p><p>Using the extended ML lifecycle model we can look into what a typical ML Pipeline looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>The above pipeline also nicely depicts the scope of work of an ML Ops&nbsp;team.</p><p>Is ML Ops worth&nbsp;it?</p><p>Increasingly, organisations are adopting machine learning to help improve their performance, business decision making, and to reduce costs. When deployed successfully, AI and ML could help drive up to 20% of companies’ earnings (McKinsey 2020).</p><p>To get to a place where your machine learning models are adding real value to your business, you not only have to build the right models but also need to effectively deploy, monitor, update and govern these&nbsp;models.</p><p>The key learning here is that machine learning can provide great value to your bottom line, but only if implemented and maintained correctly. In the context of a growing business, scaling ML can be difficult to achieve without a solid framework. This is where ML Ops comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>How to get&nbsp;started?</p><p>After your organisation agrees that investing in ML Ops is valuable, you need to decide how to start your ML Ops journey. As the ML Ops function is relatively new there is a lot of fluidity and flexibility around what’s in scope for the team and how it’s organised. This can also differ from company to&nbsp;company.</p><p>At my company, we started our journey one and a half years ago with an MVP (minimum viable product) ML Ops team. The newly formed team had three members — a technical program manager (me), a software engineer and a DevOps engineer.</p><p>We started by identifying our stakeholders. This step is often missed but I believe it is crucial to take the time to do this as it helps define the scope of the team. Conventional wisdom tells us that ML Ops’ stakeholders are data and applied scientists. While I agree that these are some of the main stakeholders, I strongly believe that a successful ML Ops team and function has many stakeholders in the organisation whose needs need to be understood and&nbsp;met.</p><p>Our stakeholder list looked like&nbsp;this:</p>  Applied science team. It’s important to recognise that this team has two groups with aligned but different needs and requirements. These two groups are individual contributors and managers.  Product teams utilising the ML models — especially the software engineers working together with applied scientists on deploying models.  Data scientists and product&nbsp;analysts  Security team  Compliance team  Legal team  Senior company leadership  <p>After identifying our stakeholders, we conducted interviews with all of them asking “What is the hardest thing for their function with respect to ML?” and “What do they need in order to go faster and do&nbsp;better?”</p><p>You can get a lot of interesting insights by asking different people the same question. The answers from our applied scientists and software engineers somewhat surprised us with the breadth of issues they discussed.</p><p>Our business stakeholders and engineering managers complained about projects taking too long. Specifically, they complained that getting the first versions of a model to production took surprisingly long (a problem most organisations using ML in their products suffer&nbsp;from).</p><p>Our applied scientists complained about data access, data labelling and overall data management. They struggled with version control of their code, data, models, dependencies and parameters. Additionally, thorough testing was difficult and time-consuming.</p><p>Our software engineers and applied scientists alike complained about collaboration and communication and struggled to work effectively and efficiently together. For example, we saw applied scientists incorporating modern off-the-shelf ML libraries but, unfortunately, we witnessed various issues caused by these libraries when they got included as dependencies in production workflows.</p><p>For our security team, the balance between data security and operational efficiency was a real challenge and one that is difficult to strike and maintain.</p><p>Our legal and compliance teams had increasing requirements with respect to AI governance and model explainability.</p><p>Mapping the pain points from all stakeholders looked a bit like&nbsp;this.</p><p>The tip of the iceberg shows the concerns of our main stakeholders while the hidden part of the iceberg depicts the needs of the secondary stakeholders. The whole iceberg depicts the needs of the ML-powered organisation as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Regarding our main stakeholders: as we expected, we discovered some technical gaps and realised that most of the things that our scientists needed to do were, in theory, technically possible but nothing was easy enough. Common operations were tedious and time-consuming, lacking process support. Standardisation was minimal and we realised we were in a situation which we called ‘The Wild West of&nbsp;models’.</p><p>A ‘‘Wild West of models’ situation is characterised by:</p>  Lack of consistency in working practices and processes.  Basic tooling to supporting some of the stages of the ML lifecycle but lack of extensive pipelines supporting the entire ML lifecycle.  High compute costs which are difficult to explain and&nbsp;manage.  Work is done in silos and there is little and sporadic documentation.  Model deployment takes ‘surprisingly’ long.  <p>While these are some of the main signs, this is by no means an exhaustive list (but you get the idea!) If you are in a similar situation, operational efficiency and a quick machine learning deployment cycle, while meeting security and regulatory requirements, seems a distant&nbsp;dream.</p><p>Alongside working on understanding the current state of ML Ops and stakeholders’ pain points we also worked on a vision for the team and an ideal future state. We stated our mission as ‘To enable our organisation to efficiently develop and ship ML-powered features throughout the product.’</p><p>It’s intentional that this statement focuses on the efficient delivery of ML-powered products from an organisational perspective. I believe that ML Ops, like any other successful team or function in an organisation, needs to support the delivery of business value and it’s important to capture this in the mission statement of the team. It is for this same reason (laser focus on delivering organisational value) that having a clear understanding of your team’s stakeholders and extended ML lifecycle is so&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>The next step is to take these pain points and develop a roadmap that will take the infrastructure and operations from the current status to your North Star. The roadmap should focus not only on building infrastructure and tools but also recognise the need to improve processes and practices alongside to fully realise the benefits of the developed infrastructure and tools. Failing to evolve processes, practices and culture alongside the technical infrastructure and tooling is a common organisational issue and one that is important to avoid in the context of ML&nbsp;Ops.</p><p>Once you have all these foundational pieces in place all that is left is to get to&nbsp;work!</p><p>Fast forward to today and, amongst other things, we have managed&nbsp;to:</p>  Perform a security audit of tools and practices to identify gaps and close&nbsp;them.  Build a new data pipeline making data sourcing and management significantly easier and&nbsp;faster.  Improve the development experience by streamlining the number of tools used and their&nbsp;setup.  Hold training with our applied scientists to help improve their python and general coding&nbsp;skills.  Reduce costs by 20% while increasing the number of jobs run by 30% through better resource management.  Reduce overall time from an ML PoC (machine learning proof of concept) to production by&nbsp;20%.  <p>By keeping laser-focused on what matters and relentlessly demonstrating the business impact of the team’s work I was able to build the case to double the team early this year with plans to quadruple by the end of the&nbsp;year.</p><p>So what is next for us? Our next goal is to reduce cycle time from data collection, training and testing the corresponding model in production safely down to 48 hours. For mission-critical systems like ours, this is very ambitious but we are up for the challenge!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/ml-ops-a-tpms-guide-on-how-to-get-started-652c115c02a6">ML Ops — a TPM’s guide on how to get started</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is an emerging philosophy that puts you in complete control over your data. In this framework, you get to store your data and share it with just the entities you&nbsp;want.</p><p>This relatively new concept of digital identity management has three essential pillars and they are the issuer, the holder, and the verifier. Together, these three pillars or entities constitute what’s called the trust triangle.</p><p>Let’s start with understanding what these three pillars&nbsp;are.</p> Who are&nbsp;Issuers? <p>An issuer is an entity that is authorized to issue a credential. These issuers are typically government organizations, healthcare centers, banks and financial institutions, schools and universities, and possibly even organizations and startups that verify a piece of information and issue a credential attesting that information.</p><p>For example, the Department of Motor Vehicles is an issuer that is authorized to issue a driver’s license credential that contains the license number of an individual. Similarly, SafeTravel is a startup company that verifies whether an individual has taken his or her COVID vaccination and accordingly, issues a credential to attest&nbsp;it.</p> Who are&nbsp;Holders? <p>A holder is the owner of the credential and has complete control over how it can be managed, with whom these credentials can be shared, or revoked. Holders can be individuals or organizations.</p><p>Since the holder is the owner of the credential, this entity can create a verifiable presentation consisting of one or more <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>, and this presentation is shared with verifiers who will use this information to authenticate the user or validate the shared information.</p> Who are Verifiers? <p>A verifier is an entity that verifies a credential and ensures that it comes from a competent issuer, is tamper-proof, and is still relevant (not expired or revoked). A verifier takes the verifiable presentation from the holder to determine its authenticity.</p><p>Verifiers are entities that need specific information about a holder for authentication, so its services can be offered to the holder. A good example is an alcohol store that has to verify the age of the buyer before selling alcohol to him or&nbsp;her.</p> Why are they Called the Trust Triangle? <p>The relationship between the issuers, holders, and verifiers is called the trust triangle simply because you need an element of trust among these entities for them to work together. Also, this term is typically used to convey human relationships in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>When an issuer issues a credential, the holder is willing to trust the issuer. The same applies to the verifiable presentation shared by the holder to the verifier and when the verifier verifies the issuer’s credential.</p><p>While this does not mean that there is a legal partnership or understanding between the entities involved, it does mean that each of the entities is willing to examine the credibility of the other, and this implicit trust is what constitutes this&nbsp;term.</p> Real-world Examples <p>Here are some real-world examples of how the issuer, holder, and verifier come together to create a transaction.</p> Employment <p>Some companies like GoodWorker verify the profiles of workers and issue <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">employment credentials</a> to authenticate their past employment. Thus, they are the&nbsp;issuers.</p><p>The holders are the workers themselves on whom the credential is issued while verifiers are those to whom the holder shares the credential issued by the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Opening a Bank&nbsp;Account <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">Verifiable credentials</a> can come in handy for opening a bank account. Here, the issuer can be a startup company that collates all the government-issued documents and stores them in the form of a verifiable credential. A good example would be DigiLocker from the Government of India that provides access to authentic digital documents to citizen’s digital document&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>The holder is an individual/company/entity looking to open a bank account while the verifier is the bank where the holder wants to open an&nbsp;account.</p> Verifying Age at a&nbsp;Bar <p>Another example is when a holder shares a date of birth verifiable credential with the bar manager to prove that he is over 18 years of&nbsp;age.</p><p>Here, the issuer is a government entity or a startup that has verified the holder’s records while the verifier is the restaurant manager.</p><p>As you can see, there is an element of trust involved in the relationship between all three&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Here are more <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use cases</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">PoCs</a> for you to understand the relationship between an issuer, holder, and a verifier.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

<p>First of all, I want to publicly say that I’ve struggled with obsessive-compulsive disorder for most of my life. This is Dev Pulse 102 and I'm talking about Holochain v0.0.103. Those numbers differ by one, and that really annoys me. But I’ve found that one of the best remedies for OCD is to laugh at myself. So I’m going to have a little chuckle, delight in the mismatch, and move on to the exciting news for this release!</p> Countersigning <p>[Editor's note: this section was modified on August 23rd, 2021, at 04:30 UTC, after I received feedback from the core devs. It's meant to be a gentle introduction to countersigning, not a comprehensive guide. It'll make it into the Core Concepts soon though. In the meantime, <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/countersigning-has-landed-in-holochain-v0-0-103/6739">join this forum thread</a> to share your questions, use cases, and other thoughts related to countersigning.]</p><p>This is the big news in Holochain v0.0.103. Many of you who follow Holochain come from the cryptocurrency world, so naturally you’re probably interested in Holochain as a platform for building new cryptocurrencies. But you probably also know that they <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae">won’t work like traditional cryptocurrencies</a>.</p><p>So how will they work?</p><p>Using a technique called countersigning. Because every participant in a hApp has their own source chain, every transaction is a bit like a cross-chain <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp">atomic swap</a> (not exactly, but close enough).</p><p>Here’s what countersigning looks like, in rough terms. Although it can be used for any sort of interaction where multiple parties come to agreement, we’ll use a currency transaction because everyone is familiar with that. (Other use cases we've seen include legal contracts, ownership transfers (also known as <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/nfts-on-holochain-easy-as-passing-the-ball-2/">NFTs</a>), and even <a href="https://youtu.be/AQ6-_QsuLIw">chess</a> player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">ranking</a>.)</p><p>Alice owes Bob 100 credits for a bicycle purchase. She sends Bob the details of the transaction and Bob acknowledges that it’s the correct amount. This is the human part, where Alice and Bob are interacting with their app UIs.</p><p>Now that the transaction details are agreed upon, Alice and Bob’s hApps start an automated process to countersign and commit the transaction to their own source chains. It's meant to happen quickly, when both parties are online. Once it’s done, each person will have a copy of the transaction on their own source chain, signed by both themselves and the other party, and published to the DHT.</p><p>(Note: From here on in, ‘Alice and Bob’ actually mean Alice and Bob’s computers.)</p><p>Alice creates a proposal that she and Bob come to ‘local consensus’ on the states of their source chains. This is called a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html">preflight request</a>. It specifies who’s involved (her and Bob), the hash of the proposed transaction, and the time window for action. Once she’s created it, she sends it to Bob.</p><p>Bob sends Alice his signature on the preflight request, along with his current source chain state. This is called a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.PreflightResponse.html">preflight response</a>. His source chain is now ‘locked’ at this state until the transaction succeeds or fails. In the meantime, Alice signs the preflight request too.</p><p>Now Alice creates a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.CounterSigningSessionData.html">countersigning session</a>, containing the preflight request, along with her and Bob’s signatures and source chain states. Once again, she sends it off to Bob.</p><p>Alice and Bob both try to commit a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/enum.Entry.html#variant.CounterSign">countersigned entry</a>, including both the countersigning session and the transaction data, to their source chains.</p><p>This is where they both have the chance to back out if something goes wrong — their entry gets passed through a validation function which double-checks that Alice still has sufficient balance. Alice and Bob both run the validation function twice — once from their perspective and once from the other’s perspective — just to make sure it’s valid for both source chains.</p><p>If all goes well in validation, it’s ready to commit — almost. First, Alice and Bob publish the entry and their own headers to a certain part of the DHT, the entry’s neighbourhood, where it gets validated by third parties.</p><p>Once the neighbourhood collects both Alice and Bob’s headers, they send a copy of both headers to both of them.</p><p>Now that Alice and Bob have seen that the other has signed the entry, the transaction is almost complete. There’s one last step: they finally commit the entry to their source chains and publish their headers to two more parts of the DHT, their own neighbourhoods. This allows future counterparties to check for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp">double-spend attempts</a>.</p><p>Now the money is transferred, Alice and Bob’s source chains are unlocked, and Bob gives Alice her bike.</p><p>If this sounds complicated, it’s because it is. The good news is that most of this stuff is handled by the Holochain conductor. As a developer, you just need to know about <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html">preflight requests</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.PreflightResponse.html">preflight response</a> signing, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.CounterSigningSessionData.html">countersigning sessions</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/enum.Entry.html#variant.CounterSign">countersigned entries</a>, and the new <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/countersigning/fn.accept_countersigning_preflight_request.html">accept_countersigning_preflight_request</a></code> host function which does most of the heavy lifting for you. The rest is flexible; you can create, distribute, and collect these things in whatever way works for you. And any app entry type that you define can be part of a countersigned transaction, in both <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/6_crud_actions/#simulating-mutability">create and update flavours</a>.</p><blockquote>Note: Countersigning isn't related to 'chain fork detection', which catches the dreaded double-spend attack, so it doesn't have the power to prevent it. That's the job of the DHT, which <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#a-cloud-of-witnesses">collects all the evidence</a> needed to detect a fork and eject the bad actor after the fact. Our core devs are also working on a possible preventative solution; watch the Dev Pulse in the coming months for more details.</blockquote> Parallel network functions <p>Network functions, like DHT gets, remote calls, and remote signals, are blocking calls — that is, they stop execution of your code until they’re done. If you have to retrieve a lot of DHT data or call the same function on a lot of peers’ devices, that means you have to loop over everything you wanted to do and do each call in serial. This can take a lot of time.</p><p>There’s been a change to many network functions; now you can specify multiple DHT hashes for <code>get</code>, <code>get_details</code>, <code>get_links</code>, and <code>get_link_details</code>, and multiple agent IDs for <code>call_remote</code>. Holochain then does the work in parallel, returning a list of successes and failures all at once.</p> Fixes and breaking changes   Breaking: A header timestamp will always be newer than its previous header’s timestamp. Previously it was always newer than or equal to.  Breaking: Conductor configs now <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.103/CHANGELOG.md#holochain_conductor_api-003">require a <code>passphrase_service</code> directive</a>.  Breaking: <code>sys_time</code> returns a <code>Timestamp</code> instead of a <code>Duration</code>.  Bugfix: DNAs can now be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/881">installed in parallel</a>.  Holochain now uses Lair 0.0.3, which stores entries in SQLite and encrypts them using a supplied passphrase. This is why conductor configs now require a passphrase service directive.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.103/CHANGELOG.md#20210817185301">Read the full changelog</a> for more details.</p> Two more releases coming soon! <p>Over the next two or three weeks, the core dev team will release Holochain v0.0.104 and v0.0.105. These changes are scheduled to include:</p>  DHT sharding (yay!)  Fixes and speed improvements for gossiping and publishing  HDK improvements  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/932">‘Relaxed’ concurrent source chain writes</a>  Binary releases for Linux  <p>I’m away on holiday next week, so I might be late announcing one of these releases.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hegde">Raj Hegde</a></p><p>
Carsten Stöcker, co-founder and CEO at Spherity is to deliver a presentation on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4692/1" title="Identity Is the New Blue"> How an Entire Industry Adopts Digital Enterprise Identity </a>on Wednesday, September 15 starting at 3:30 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Carsten some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>How would you describe the current state of the digital identity sector? </p>
<p>
The current state is determined by industry players and governments that are realizing the importance of digital identity. It's a part of digital identity for interactions on the internet for digital transformations and for digitalization of public services. And this is not only happening here in Germany - the European Union, for example, is pushing very hard for the so-called EU digital identity wallet. There's a large movement in the government to put this in place to stay competitive. It's digitalization of our societies and industries, but it's also happening in the US and in Asia.  A lot of governments and enterprises have realized the importance and are now starting to adopt technology to push this into a field test to experiment with regulatory frameworks, to get these technologies into production.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why are secure digital identities so important in today's economy? </p>
<p>
Yeah, it's not just important. It's also mandatory. And if you look at the sheer numbers, so I, as a corporate, or as a government have terabytes and terabytes of data in my IT systems, but today I don't have any instruments to check the authenticity of the data. So who provided the data, which citizen, which customer, which IoT device, which business partner provides the data? I don't have any instruments. And I also don't have enough instruments to check the integrity of the data. And that's now changing with digital identity technology built upon public key infrastructure. I suddenly have some tools to check the authenticity, integrity, provenance of my data. I can trust my data even more and especially in use cases where I have to interact with a lot of previously unknown supply chain actors. So this is a must-have capability for the circular economy.   </p>
<p>Think about supplier onboarding. Can I trust if my supplier is real or fake? What credentials do they have are they compliant with environment, health and safety standards?  Do I trust the IoT device? I cannot answer these questions today, but with digital identity digital signatures, I get all the instruments to bring digitization to the next step. And, not only to improve the business policies, regulatory requirements, but also improve cybersecurity quite a bit. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Where are you experiencing the adoption of digital identities? What role do you specifically play?</p>
<p>
So we experienced most adoption in ecosystems that have a clear problem to be solved, especially when it's regulatory problems, regulatory requirements where I must do something, I must prove something, I must verify something, and we are experiencing a lot of adoption when there is a government push. Um, for example, in Europe, in Germany, governments want to keep up with digitization and have understood digital identities and their core capabilities. They really push hard to build entire ecosystems. And that's of fundamental importance because this technology is not just for one company, It's for entire ecosystems. It needs to be adopted by a lot of supply chain and value chain actors and ecosystem actors. And that's so crucial. So crucial role as a government to push hard, to get the entire ecosystems in place and even help out with some regulatory requirements and regulatory requirement amendments. And there we are experiencing the biggest adoption when it comes to early productive systems and productive field tests. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You will be speaking at EIC about how an entire industry adopts digital enterprise identity. Could you give us a sneak peek about your talk?  </p>
<p>
Yeah, sure. I will talk about the so-called the US drug supply chain security act, and there's one requirement that's the authorized trading partner requirement. What problem does it solve? It basically solves the problem that previously unknown supply chain actors, such as the manufacturer and the wholesalers they’ve never met before, but they would like to exchange data. Then the law says you must authorize and authenticate your supply chain partner, which means I, as a wholesaler, when I'm interacting with the manufacturer, I must check, is this the real manufacturer and ask the manufacturer if they have a state license to manufacture pharmaceutical products. I must check the state license. Today, that's a manual process. The process takes a long time and with digital identity and verifiable signatures - this can be fully digitized. In addition, what we also speak at EIC. So we talk about role of partnerships, strong partnerships to build an entire ecosystem and to drive full adoption of an entire industry domain, um, because only if the full adoption could be achieved, then this is a massively scalable technology. And yeah, interested in this use case, learn more at the EIC and join our talk. </p>

 The second in a series of articles on Ontology’s contribution to the coming Web 3.0&nbsp;era. <p>In <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-dffcce766220">Part 1</a>, we described how Web 3.0 improves upon Web 2.0 through decentralization and how Ontology is facilitating the transition to Web 3.0 via its decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Part 2 continues our exploration of Web 3.0 by discussing co-governance rules and the co-construction ecosystem.</p> Principles of Co-Governance <p>From Web 2.0 to Web 3.0, it is a more data-based and Internet-based uploading process for our lives. Correspondingly, all users’ (including developers and enterprises) demand for infrastructure not only at the physical level, but also contain the requirements for governance guidelines. Web 3.0 may have its own attributes of equality and user autonomy, but it does not mean the absence of governance.</p><p>In moving towards the Web 3.0 era, Ontology strives to establish a foundation founded upon on-chain governance, inter-chain governance, and chain-network governance.</p><p>The core of governance within the Ontology chain is based on one hypothesis, three roles and two processes.</p> Hypothesis   Most of the network nodes on the Ontology chain (within the fault tolerance of the consensus algorithm) are operated by rational&nbsp;actors.   Roles   Rule Maker, Executor, and Supervisor.  The Rule Maker is responsible for the formulation of the rules, the Executor is responsible for the implementation of the rules, and the Supervisor is responsible for supervising the formulation process and the implementation of the&nbsp;rules.   Processes   The process of rule-making and the process of work execution.  The process of inter-chain governance decision-making and the process of meeting consensus decision-making can reuse the on-chain governance framework, or use traditional consensus tools.  <p>In and outside the chain, in order to maintain a sustainable, open and co-governance Ontology chain network system, we have formulated the chain network governance guidelines, which include: network governance, consensus governance, and economic governance. The basic idea is to manage the consensus network in a single ecological chain, in conjunction with the governance model. According to the variation in server computing power, the networking nodes of different ecological chains in the chain network are deployed to different servers. The same server can participate in multiple ecological chain contributions. When the ecological chain exceeds the consensus fault tolerance, the malicious nodes will be removed from the network and the nodes with benign competition will be re-selected to participate in the consensus.</p><p>In sum, Ontology has formed a complete set of governance guidelines from chain to network. Their effectiveness has been verified through years of operation, allowing more developers and users to participate in the development of blockchain Web 3.0 and open co-governance.</p> Co-Constructed Ecosystem <p>The openness and co-governance of Web 3.0 means that multiple parties jointly develop key infrastructure. Based on the hyper-converged chain network system and multi-virtual machine solution that Ontology has built, as well as the governance principles of co-governance, Ontology can easily integrate with a variety of infrastructure builders, enterprises, and centralized Internet platforms Together we can develop and accelerate the transition to the decentralized Web 3.0 landscape.</p><p><a href="http://onto.app">ONTO</a>, Ontology’s decentralized cross-chain wallet, currently supports 14 blockchains, along with over 400 dApps.

<p>Whatever your KYC needs are, AutoIdent has got you covered.</p>
 What is IDnow AutoIdent? 
<p>AutoIdent is IDnow’s AI-powered automated identity verification solution. Its automation offers an easy and convenient onboarding process without compromise to security.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent leverages modern AI and machine learning, trained on millions of data sets and backed by the expertise of a network of top identity and fraud specialists. The outcome is the best of both worlds, convenient and secure.</p>
 What makes IDnow AutoIdent so versatile? 
<p>What sets IDnow AutoIdent apart is its ability to adjust to your use case and regulatory needs. No matter how high your security requirements are — IDnow AutoIdent has got you covered. Multiple modules such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signatures</a> (QES) or Bank Transfer allow you to customize AutoIdent to your needs.</p>
<p>Because of this versatility, IDnow AutoIdent is one of the first identity verification solutions compliant with the German AML Act that operates as an automated process and meets high-security requirements.</p>
 Why are there different levels of security? 
<p>Not every country, industry, or use case has the exact security requirements for identity verification. Therefore, different use cases require different levels of security.</p>
<p>For example, verifying the validity of your driving license for your favorite mobility app requires less security than verifying your identity to open a bank account. The same applies when you need to verify your age on an online gambling website, compared to opening an account at the newest cryptocurrency exchange. Furthermore, when looking at geographical differences, opening a bank account in the UK is regulated less than in France or Germany.</p>
 From the UK FCA, over EU eIDAS to the German BaFin, AutoIdent covers it all. 
 UK post Brexit. 
<p>IDnow AutoIdent is also fully compliant with the UK AML regulation and the FCA post Brexit. As the UK recognizes automated remote identity verification solutions for opening bank accounts and other financial services, the standard version of IDnow AutoIdent is sufficient to meet the regulatory requirements.</p>
 European eIDAS. 
<p>Based on European eIDAS regulation, article 24(1)d, IDnow AutoIdent can be used to identify a person in combination with a QES (Qualified Electronic Signature), as long as the procedure is accepted at the national level. In conformity with eIDAS, IDnow AutoIdent is compliant for bank account opening in most European countries, such as France and Italy.</p>
<p>However, some markets, such as Germany, go beyond European standards and have unique country-specific regulatory requirements that require the combination of identity verification with a QES and bank transfer for GwG-compliance. We discuss this in further detail in the next section.</p>
 One of the first automated solutions to comply with the German GwG. 
<p>The German GwG regulation is often considered the holy grail of AML and KYC regulations and, therefore, a benchmark in the industry. IDnow, originating from Munich, sees the German market as its home turf and strives to be a leader in GwG compliant identity verification solutions.</p>
<p>To comply with the German GwG requirements, IDnow AutoIdent can be coupled with QES and Bank Transfer modules. In combination with these modules, IDnow provides a fully compliant remote onboarding solution in accordance with the German AML Act, the Geldwäschegesetz (GwG), under Section §12 sentence 1 No 3.</p>
<p>After starting the automated identity verification process, an extra level of assurance is initiated. By combining the security features of a Qualified Electronic Signature and an existing online bank account, AutoIdent complies with the German GwG requirements. This approach simplifies opening additional German bank accounts tremendously.</p>
  
 How do the different modules work? 
 QES (Qualified Electronic Signature). 
<p>A QES is not necessarily a signature in the traditional sense. You can better compare it to a digital security certificate that certifies the validity of a piece of information. According to the European eIDAS regulation, a QES can only be issued by a Trust Service Provider (TSP).</p>
<p>In the majority of cases, a QES is being used to sign contracts digitally. However, in the case of AutoIdent, we are using the QES to add another level of assurance and verify the identity.</p>
<p>Instead of signing a contractual document, a document with the identity information is signed. The good news is, IDnow AutoIdent, including QES, is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1) d).</p>
 Bank Transfer (as small as 1 Euro Cent). 
<p>At first sight, you might ask yourself, “How can a bank transfer improve my KYC process?”. However, the logic behind the process is straightforward.</p>
<p>The prerequisite is that somebody who has already opened a bank account in the same country or regulatory environment before, at the same time, has performed the required KYC and identity verification as well. Consequently, a reference transaction from a qualified bank account is considered a valid form of identity verification.</p>
<p>In practice, the process requires the customer to make a transfer, as small as one Euro Cent, which is being reimbursed, from their existing bank account to IDnow. This approach simplifies the process of opening additional bank accounts.</p>
 Use IDnow AutoIdent plus eSign to sign important contracts. 
<p>Depending on the customer’s needs, the onboarding process offers total flexibility, with the possible of additional components of the IDnow platform added, e.g., <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/esign/">eSign</a>. The add-on for the digital contract signing opens up additional use cases such as taking out a consumer loan. In that case, the QES is being used to sign a contractual document while also validating the identity verification and validating the identity verification.</p>
<p>Use IDnow AutoIdent plus eSign to offer your customers a convenient and secure way to sign important contracts. eSign can be used to sign loan agreements, insurance contracts, employment contracts, or any other form of agreement.</p>

  <p>Even if you’ve never heard of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant, formerly known as the Device Flow, you’ve probably seen it in action on a smart TV or other streaming device. The Device Authorization Grant is commonly used on devices with limited keyboard input ability. The process allows you to log in to an account more easily via a separate browser on your laptop, mobile phone, or other companion rich-input device.</p>

<p>For instance, if AtkoTV is launching a streaming service, its streaming Apple TV app might present you with something like the sign-in screen below. Instead of struggling to input anything on your TV, you’d log in on your laptop or mobile phone to complete the sign-in process.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Back in 2019, <a>Aaron Parecki</a> showed <a>how to support the OAuth 2.0 Device Grant</a>, but it required you to deploy a proxy. Fast forward a couple years, and today we’re happy to let you know that the Okta platform has officially introduced native Device Authorization, and it’s available now as an early access feature. This post will show you how to enable the Device Flow process in your Okta account, and how to use it in a real application.</p>

 The OAuth 2.0 Device Grant Interaction 

<p>The <a href="https://oauth.net/2/device-flow/">OAuth 2.0 specification</a> defines the Device Grant as  “an OAuth 2.0 extension that enables devices with no browser or limited input capability to obtain an access token.” The official <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628">RFC</a> describes the interaction in detail, as you can also see in the following flow diagram.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the code. In the command line, we can perform the first authorization step as follows:</p>

   <code>curl -X POST \
  --url https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/device/authorize \
  --data 'client_id=0oa15wulqt5yqD9FP5d7&amp;scope=openid profile offline_access'
</code>   

<p>We will get back a response:</p>

   <code>{
  "device_code": "df1b060b-4e36-4bbe-98aa-5dcb11909f5f",
  "user_code": "DRTDNTJC",
  "verification_uri": "https://dev-133337.okta.com/activate",
  "verification_uri_complete": "https://dev-133337.okta.com/activate?user_code=DRTDNTJC",
  "expires_in": 600,
  "interval": 5
}
</code>   

<p>In the second step, to poll for the access token, we issue the following command:</p>

   <code>curl -X POST \
  --url https://dev-133337.com/oauth2/v1/token \
  --data 'device_code=df1b060b-4e36-4bbe-98aa-5dcb11909f5f&amp;grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&amp;client_id=0oa15wulqt5yqD9FP5d7'
</code>   

<p>If the user has not logged in, the response looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "error": "authorization_pending",
  "error_description": "The device authorization is pending. Please try again later."
}
</code>   

<p>Otherwise, we’ll get a response back with the <code>access_token</code>, <code>refresh_token</code> and <code>id_token</code>.</p>

   <code>{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "....",
  "scope": "openid profile offline_access",
  "refresh_token": "....",
  "id_token": "...."
}
</code>   

 How to Enable the Device Grant in Okta 



<p>The Device Grant is an Early Availability feature on the Okta platform. First, you’ll need to enable the feature from your org dashboard. From the left navigation pane in the Admin Console, go to Settings -&gt; Features, locate the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant slider, and slide to enable.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Follow these steps to add a new app that supports the Device Grant.</p>

 
   
    <p>In Applications-&gt;Applications, click Create App Integration. In the pop-up, choose OIDC - OpenID Connect, then Native Application. The Device Grant is only available for Native Applications.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>In the next step, check Device Authorization in the Grant type section.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>If you want to use a custom Authorization Server, you also need to accept the grant type in the authorization server’s policy interface:</p>

     
       Go to Security-&gt;API 
       Select the authorization server you want to use (for example, default). 
       Click the Access Policies tab, and edit the rule for your policy.  Make sure to select the Device Authorization checkbox. 
     

    <p></p>
   
 

 How to Enable an SSH Server with Device Authorization 

<p>We’ve identified many use cases for the Device Authorization Grant beyond TV apps, as it can be used to authenticate a variety of devices. In this use case, we share an example of SSH login with the Device Authorization Grant on Okta.</p>

<p>When accessing servers, we typically use SSH. While SSH supports strong security, it has a couple of limitations:</p>

 
   SSH works well for a single user, but it’s harder to manage in an enterprise where multiple users log in to the same server. SSH stores the public key for each allowed user on the server, so the server must be able to update the keys when the permissions list changes (for example, when a new user is granted access). 
   Lack of two-factor authentication: SSH only supports password and private key authentication natively. Adding stronger user authentication, such as SMS verification, requires extra work. 
 

<p>The following example enables the Device Authorization Grant on an Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS server, but the instructions should work for any flavor of Linux server. The end-user login experience looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>On a Linux server, the SSH daemon uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to enable an authentication extension. First, let’s edit the PAM configuration. In <code>/etc/pam.d/sshd</code>, we look for <code>@include common-auth</code>. Then we’ll comment it out to disable the normal authentication method, such as password or private key check. Then we’ll add a line of code directly below to enable Device Authorization.  <code>deviceflow.so</code> is the PAM module that follows.</p>

   <code># @include common-auth             # Disable password authentication
auth    required    deviceflow.so  # register custom authentication module
</code>   

<p>Next we’ll edit the <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file to make sure that challenge-response authentication is enabled, using PAM.  You’ll see a line starting with <code>ChallengeResponseAuthentication</code>. The default is <code>no</code>. Change this to <code>yes</code>:</p>

   <code>ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
</code>   

<p>Later on in the same file, make sure that “UsePAM” is set to yes (it is the default) as follows:</p>

   <code>UsePAM yes
</code>   

<p>Next we’ll develop the authentication module. To make sure the necessary libraries are installed, we run the following commands:</p>

   <code>apt-get update
apt-get install build-essential libpam0g-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libqrencode-dev libssl-dev
</code>   

<p>The full source code for the PAM module is available on <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-ssh-oauth-example">GitHub</a>. For a PAM module, we need to define two interfaces:</p>

   <code>PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_setcred( pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int argc, const char **argv)
PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_authenticate( pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags,int argc, const char **argv )
</code>   

<p>The second interface handles the authentication flow, which holds all our authentication logic. The code is self-explanatory, so we’ll only cover the high-level steps:</p>

 
   
    <p>First, plug in your org’s URLs in <code>deviceflow.c</code>. Change the URL based on your org name and whether you are using the org Authentication Server or a custom Authentication Server. Also, define the client ID for the Native App where you’ve enabled the Device Authorization grant type.</p>

       <code>#define DEVICE_AUTHORIZE_URL  "https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/device/authorize"
#define TOKEN_URL "https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/token"
#define CLIENT_ID "0oa15wulqt5yqD9FP5d7"
</code>       
   
   
    <p>We first issue a POST call to our <code>authorize</code> endpoint on the Authorization Server. From the POST result, we can extract the <code>device_code</code> and <code>user_code</code>. The POST call is abstracted away as a call to a helper function <code>issuePost</code>, which takes the URL as the first parameter and the POST data as the second parameter:</p>

       <code>sprintf(postData, "client_id=%s&amp;scope=openid profile offline_access", CLIENT_ID);
issuePost(DEVICE_AUTHORIZE_URL, postData);
</code>       

    <p>The helper function uses libcurl to send the POST request:</p>

       <code>void issuePost(char * url, char * data) {
   /* send all data to this callback function  */
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, WriteMemoryCallback);
   /* we pass our 'chunk' struct to the callback function */
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, (void *)&amp;chunk);
      
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url ) ;
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POST, 1);  /* this is a POST */
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, data);
   int res = curl_easy_perform( curl ) ;
}
</code>       

    <p>The <code>WriteMemoryCallback</code> function saves the callback results in a <code>chunk</code> buffer. Then, we use a helper function <code>getValueForKey</code> to extract the value fields for keys <code>user_code</code>, <code>device_code</code>, and <code>verification_uri_complete</code>.</p>
   
   
    <p>We then prompt the user to login to the activate endpoint. For a more pleasant user experience, we incorporate the URL inside a QRCode. We use the value field for <code>verification_uri_complete</code>, which includes <code>user_code</code> as part of the query parameters, so that a user does not have to type in the code manually. We leveraged the code from <a href="https://github.com/Y2Z/qr">Y2Z/qr</a> to generate ASCII output so that it will output properly in the command shell.</p>

       <code> char * qrc = getQR(activateUrl);
 sprintf(prompt_message, 
   "\n\nPlease login at %s or scan the QRCode below:\n\n%s", 
   activateUrl, qrc);
 free(qrc);
 sendPAMMessage(pamh, prompt_message);
</code>       

    <p>Since this is a PAM module, we cannot just print to screen directly. The <code>sendPAMMessage</code> helper function uses the PAM module’s interface function to send messages to the user:</p>

       <code>void
sendPAMMessage(pam_handle_t *pamh, char * prompt_message) {
   int retval;
      
   struct pam_message msg[1],*pmsg[1];
   struct pam_response *resp;
   struct pam_conv *conv ;
      
   pmsg[0] = &amp;msg[0] ;
   msg[0].msg_style = PAM_TEXT_INFO ; 
   msg[0].msg = prompt_message;
      
   resp = NULL ;
      
   retval = pam_get_item( pamh, PAM_CONV, (const void **) &amp;conv ) ;  
   if( retval==PAM_SUCCESS ) {
      retval = conv-&gt;conv( 1, (const struct pam_message **) pmsg, &amp;resp,  conv-&gt;appdata_ptr ) ; 
   }
   if( resp ) {
      free( resp );
   }
}
</code>       

    <p>In the above, we set the communication type to <code>PAM_TEXT_INFO</code> to indicate that we want to send a message to the user. In the <code>pam_get_item</code> call, we retrieve the PAM conversation module <code>conv</code>, and in the following line, we just invoke the <code>conv</code> module, which writes the message to the user console.</p>
   
   
    <p>We periodically issue a POST call to the token endpoint. If the POST result gives a token back, we return <code>PAM_SUCCESS</code> to allow the user to log in, or eventually, we return <code>PAM_AUTH_ERR</code> to signal authentication failure and deny user access.</p>

       <code>sprintf(postData, "device_code=%s&amp;grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&amp;client_id=%s", devicecode, CLIENT_ID);

while (waitingForActivate) {
   issuePost(TOKEN_URL, postData);
   // ...
}
</code>       
   
   
    <p>The POST return includes various JWT tokens. From the <code>id_token</code>, we know exactly who logged in, and we optionally print a customized welcome message.</p>
   
 

<p>To compile all our code (<code>deviceflow.c</code> and <code>qr.c</code>), we run:</p>

   <code>gcc -fPIC -c deviceflow.c qr.c
sudo ld -x --shared -o /lib/security/deviceflow.so deviceflow.o qr.o \
        -lm -lqrencode -lcurl -lssl -lcrypto
</code>   

<p>The second command installs the compiled PAM module under <code>/lib/security</code>, which is where PAM looks for additional plugin modules.</p>

<p>Then we restart SSHD daemon to make sure the new PAM module is invoked:</p>

   <code>sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
</code>   

<p>In the repo, we’ve also included a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-ssh-oauth-example/blob/master/Dockerfile"><code>Dockerfile</code></a>, so you’ll have a local Ubuntu container in which to try out the new SSH sign-in flow.</p>

 SSH Login in the Cloud with Okta 

<p>Although we’ve only added a couple hundred lines of C code, this fundamental change in SSH login using the Device Grant empowers you to do more with Okta.</p>

 
   Move your SSH management to the cloud, and avoid the hassle of local management. With this new feature, there’s no need to manage SSH passwords or public keys locally. 
   You now have the full power of Okta at your disposal! Leverage Okta policies, enable multi-factor authentication, add sign-on policies and multiple IdPs (Identity Providers). 
 

 Other Uses for the Device Authorization Grant 

<p>In this post, we’ve demonstrated how to implement the Device Grant for SSH login. Using the information returned from the tokens—including the user’s profile information contained in the ID token—we can go even further. We can easily create a separate Linux account in the PAM module and set up the permissions correctly, so a user can sign in to their individual account. You may be trying to connect to a root account via <code>ssh root@server.com</code>. Instead, the PAM module can log you in as <code>user@server.com</code>—a less privileged account—by learning who you are from the ID token.</p>

<p>Token-based permissions give you finer granularity in access control. For example, it’s easy to implement time-limited access control. The access token can be set up to expire within a given time span. If the time limit for access is exceeded, the access token renewal will fail, and the server can revoke permission right away. In addition to enabling time-limited access, you can also customize scopes and claims to further fine-tune the access model.</p>

<p>While this app demonstrates how to enable SSH login, we believe there are many other applications for the Device Flow. We’re eager to hear from you with feature requests and new use cases. Let us know what applications are on your mind. You can share ideas and feedback by leaving a comment here.

<p>Since we’ve been learning a lot from the Close-up Magic meetups, we’ve decided to start writing a recap at the end of every event. We hope that these recaps will help you in your career development. Enjoy!</p><p>For our latest Close-up Magic meetup, we welcomed Praveen Durairaju, Senior Developer Advocate at Hasura to talk&nbsp;about:</p>  The early days of&nbsp;Hasura  What it’s like to build a backend from scratch vs. with&nbsp;Hasura  His journey from Software Engineering to Developer Advocacy  <p>Here are a few of our favorite takeaways.</p> Key Takeaways  Developer feedback is key to success&nbsp;🔑 <p>The road to Hasura was one that was filled with many paths. Hasura initially tried to solve multiple problems for developers, such as the need for better DevOps tooling, and also the need for a faster way to build apps with a data&nbsp;layer.</p><p>By collecting feedback, Hasura was able to find that data access was the biggest pain point developers faced. With this golden insight, the company pivoted to what is now known as Hasura, a Jamstack tool used and loved by large enterprises and exciting startups such as Philips Healthcare and&nbsp;Netlify.</p> Choose Hasura for a backend in minutes, rather than days&nbsp;👏 <p>There are a lot of moving parts involved when setting up a GraphQL-powered app from scratch. You have to set up a GraphQL server that describes your data, a client that specifies how you ask for the data, and then you need to connect the GraphQL server with a database you’ve&nbsp;built.</p><p>For those who are new to backend development, the thought process involved in optimizing data fetching, handling errors and caching with GraphQL becomes slightly more complicated than when using the well-known alternative, Rest API. This is because you’re pretty much reinventing the wheel of Rest API with&nbsp;GraphQL.</p><p>If you don’t have the time to dig into the GraphQL or your chosen database’s documentation, try Hasura. Like us, your mind will be blown away by just how easy Hasura makes it for us to build a backend with a readily available API.</p> Developer Advocacy is all about Developer empathy&nbsp;❤️ <p>Praveen’s journey from Engineering to Developer Advocacy felt inevitable.</p><p>As an early engineer at Hasura, he started helping developers solve a few of the pain points they faced with their tool. Pretty soon, he was helping improve Hasura’s docs and writing content to support developers in their integration phase.</p><blockquote>“I believe in the product and love using the product as well. So there’s a natural progression that happened where I was helping out devs with documentation, finding out their pain points on using the product. And I think that’s where I started writing content, some documentation, some guides and tutorials to fix their pain&nbsp;points.”</blockquote><p>Praveen thoroughly enjoyed doing all of this because he was passionate about using Hasura, and he couldn’t help but to evangelize the product to other developers.</p><p>As it turns out, these are the ingredients needed to become a Developer Advocate. You have to be sold on the value of the product. You have to be able to get into the shoes of a developer and understand their pain points. And you have to be passionate about solving their pain points in any way possible, whether that be answering their questions, improving the documentation or creating tutorials, or communicating the feedback internally.</p> Q&amp;A Session <p>At the end of the talk, we received a great question from one of our listeners.</p><blockquote>“What were some of the most challenging things about the development process of building Hasura from the beginning?”</blockquote><p>Curious to know Praveen’s answer? Make sure to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8J4tkwbtCk&amp;t=100s">this recording</a> of the fireside&nbsp;chat!</p> Interested in Close-up&nbsp;Magic? <p>If you ever want to be a special guest for Close-up Magic and talk about a tech you’re passionate about, schedule a chat with Maricris <a href="https://calendly.com/magic-maricris/15min-1">here</a>. Until next&nbsp;time!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/recap-building-a-backend-from-scratch-vs-the-hasura-way-4f4237f42032">Recap: Building a Backend from Scratch vs. The Hasura Way ✨</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			 José Navalon is Full Stack Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Jose Navalon, I currently live with my wife and my son in Geldrop, a little town in the Netherlands. I was born and raised in Valencia, a sunny city on the east coast of Spain. I graduated as an engineer (ing/MSc) from the Polytechnical University of Valencia.</p>
<p>During my professional career, I have developed software solutions for both big companies and startups. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, cooking, reading books and of course spending time with my family and friends.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After I finished a big project for my previous company, I was looking for a permanent remote position and I got an offer from Tokeny. After interviewing with some team members, I was impressed by the work being done in Tokeny. Tokeny is up to speed with the latest technologies and always works with the leading technologies of the moment. Also, Tokeny’s product vision on blockchain is sure to be a success. So it was clear for me to join Tokeny 🙂</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>All people are really skilled and it is a pleasure working with them. Tokeny gives us full freedom at work, in my case I’m working remotely not only due to the Covid. The honesty and transparency of each member of the team makes you really integrated in the company.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I like traveling a lot with my family and friends. Knowing new places, new cultures, new food, other ways of life…</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I have many, but the most important one is “Mankind beats the Corona”, of course we can make it, be optimistic! xD</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Too many things to be changed 😀 but for example I’d love to see all people, not only nations, working together to solve global problems such as poverty, child education, global warming, ….</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the fourth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/Trung_cave">Duy</a>, administrator of <a href="https://t.me/OntologyVietNamese">Ontology Vietnam</a> and <a href="https://t.me/WingDAOVietnamese">Wing DAO&nbsp;Vietnam</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I first learned about Ontology in March, 2018. At that time, I followed the newly listed coins on Binance and realized Ontology is a high-performance blockchain with the goal of building a decentralized trust ecosystem. It’s revolutionary technology allows businesses to use blockchain technology without having to be experts in the technology themselves. I was really impressed with the&nbsp;project.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>Realizing the potential of Ontology; a project that I believe will thrive in the future. Community is also one of the factors contributing to the success of the project. So, I decided to become one of the supporters of Ontology.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>A Harbinger’s role is to share information about the project, improve community understanding of the project, and remove language barriers. I feel happy when I can help communicate and share information with the community.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>I strive to contribute my efforts to the sustainable development of Ontology.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Ontology’s community is multilingual, with over 30 different languages. Not many other blockchain projects have such a large community. With a community as diverse as Ontology’s, the project’s information can be spread across the globe. In this way, Ontology will be known by more and more&nbsp;people.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>I typically use Telegram. Currently, I am the administrator of <a href="https://t.me/OntologyVietNamese">Ontology Vietnam</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/WingDAOVietnamese">Wing DAO Vietnam</a>. I also opened a Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OntologyVietNam">Ontology Vietnam</a>, because Vietnamese people use Facebook more than other social networks. At the same time, I also have a personal <a href="https://twitter.com/Trung_cave">Twitter account</a> to interact with Ontology.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>I have learned many skills and absorbed lots of knowledge and experiences from managers and other Harbingers. My advice to Harbingers is to try, try to learn, learn more information about products, ecosystems, and technologies related to Ontology. Do your best to help and interact with the community and you will become an excellent Harbinger.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Advanced, Sophisticated, Sustainable.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>To expand and develop the community further in the future, I think building a good team of Harbingers is also one of the factors. And in the future, I hope Ontology’s products such as websites, documents, ONTO, etc., can be available in more languages. In addition, actively interact, absorb and respond to the community more.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Ontology’s big milestone for me was the MainNet launch event. Over the years, Ontology has continuously evolved and updated its decentralized identity and data vision and decentralized identity framework, ONT ID. With the rapid development of the Internet today, data has become a valuable resource that requires secure methods of storage. The cryptocurrency market has been developing strongly in recent years, but it is also a new industry with lots of potential, as well as challenges and limitations. Ontology is no exception. They have a lot ahead of them. Hopefully the community will always support Ontology in the future, helping Ontology grow stronger and stronger.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the fifth interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

And maybe other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk">existential risks</a> like&nbsp;AI.</p><p>We have far too many smart people working together to be shooting for smaller goals than this. We want our work to <a href="https://noahraford.com/wp/2014/08/04/silicon-howl/">matter</a> and nothing smaller than this counts because if we fail on the existential risk stuff it is not going to matter how much volume went through our decentralized exchanges or what our NFT collection was&nbsp;worth.</p><p>The World Computer should be used to do some computation which reduces our chance of extinction or breaking the ecosystem.</p><p>Preferably the world computer should be part of a global effort to reduce the earth’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_the_Study_of_Existential_Risk">existential</a> risk to zero. It’s a long road to get there. Can we do an ICO for long range sky scanning to stop asteroids hitting earth? I don’t&nbsp;know.</p><p>But what I do know is that the World Computer is well positioned to be used to do computation which directly cuts our existential risks by crushing climate&nbsp;change.</p> Carbon Footprint Calculations <p>Right here, right now: what is your carbon footprint?</p><p>Your answer, I guarantee, is “I don’t&nbsp;know.”</p><p>You can get an approximation from a <a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">carbon footprint calculator</a>, but it’s just an approximation. The well-meaning among us buy these offsets once a year to cover at least some of our damage. But until these systems are precise they cannot be automated. Imprecision means there is always a manual&nbsp;step!</p><p>When we know exactly what our footprint is, we can easily say “buy offsets for my footprint.” But when it is all approximate there is always a sense that we are making a decision to accept the imprecision, to roll the dice on the estimate. You have to look and think “does that seem about right?” and the whole system grinds to a halt on that decision.</p><p>Having to calculate our own CO2 footprint and accepting that the result is just a guess produces enough friction in the process that very few people in practice do CO2 offsetting. Even relatively well off green activists don’t do it, even though the cost is typically a hundred dollars a year or&nbsp;less.</p><p>Automated, we might all offset our emissions. It might even become mandatory, the cost of staying alive, the most basic act of personal self-responsibility. Because we have systems like zk-SNARKs on top of ERC20s, we could imagine a future with a mandatory CO2 tax. In that potential future everybody has to offset 100% of their CO2 consumption. But their privacy is protected. The system knows how much CO2 they have to offset, but without ever revealing the lifestyle choices which led to generation of that CO2 footprint.</p><p>We could get more privacy and a safer&nbsp;world.</p><p>That seems like a fitting job for a World Computer: to run the global carbon accounting system which makes sure that trillions of dollars a year are spent planting trees and rewilding or grinding up olivine mountains to make sure that the earth does not dry out, burn up, and blow&nbsp;away.</p><p>So let’s put that right into the Ethereum Theory of Change right now. The world computer will run the global carbon accounting system. That’s our ambition. That is one way we’re going to change the&nbsp;world.</p> Reducing waste in the global economy to&nbsp;zero <p>Another grand challenge is global resource overconsumption. It is easiest to see when we think of <a href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/deforestation-facts-and-statistics">deforestation</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/deforestation-facts-and-statistics">Deforestation Facts and Statistics</a></p><p>We are simply using too much wood and land. The forests are getting cut down for other purposes.</p><p>But a third of the food grown is <a href="https://earth.org/facts-about-food-waste/">wasted</a>. If we could not waste that food there would be more than enough land for the forests to be left in peace. Rewilding at scale requires food efficiency.</p><p>The food chain has an enormous number of links. There are tens of thousands of significant actors. Gigantic companies and tiny farms. Huge franchises and one-cook restaurants. It all combines to make the food system. There is simply no way to get a system in place to manage all of this on any database technology other than the World Computer. Every corporation involved will want to keep its private data in a silo. They will want to hide evidence of their own waste, particularly in areas where waste equals profit. To keep people honest, we need to get an overview of how the food is produced, where it is stored, and how it is consumed. Over time we can tighten up the waste in that system and enormously reduce the pressure we place on the land. We need to break open the silos to understand the performance of the system as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>The World Computer. Nothing else is going to do this. Yes, it envisages a World Computer with nearly infinite computing power but that is coming. Computers continue to get faster every year. The underlying algorithms that power Ethereum get more refined every year. L2 solutions which bind to quantum supercompuers can’t be that far away. This thing can actually&nbsp;work.</p><p>And of course it’s not just food. Empty houses in countries filled with homeless people. Systemic structural inefficiencies exist in every supply chain. The world is both cold, starving and homeless at one end, and packed with empty five bedroom houses and untouched boxes of cold pizza at the other. I am not suggesting that we pack the homeless into those five bedroom houses. Rather I am suggesting that if everybody moves up a little we make plenty of room for everybody. Efficient markets should provide for everybody.</p><p>But the efficient market cannot be efficient enough on the existing technical, social and legal infrastructure. The world computer opens up the possibility of genuinely efficient markets in truly dramatic&nbsp;ways.</p> Circular Economy <p>Every manufactured thing in the world eventually winds up in landfills or as scrap, with a few exceptions. Some of the scrap is recycled and turned into new products, but some of it just sits and rots until it <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/viewers-horrified-over-viral-video-of-thick-black-smoke-100415035.html">catches&nbsp;fire</a>.</p><p><a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/viewers-horrified-over-viral-video-of-thick-black-smoke-100415035.html">Sinister story behind thick black smoke seen from space</a></p><p>In almost no case is the true cost of disposing of things calculated. So much recycling just winds up as landfill or dumped in some poor <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-12/fast-fashion-turning-parts-ghana-into-toxic-landfill/100358702">country</a>&nbsp;too.</p><p>Similarly, when an old camera or an old phone breaks and cannot be repaired because it was designed not to be fixable, both its owner and the world get a little poorer. The global capital base is depleted every time a poorly designed thing breaks and enters the waste stream. All these individual leaks seem small but together they constitute a flood of wasted life. The time and energy of the person who made the thing are wasted when it breaks. Then we must count the cost of a replacement. What of all the natural resources burned to make a thing? All of that is lost when a thing breaks in a way that cannot be repaired. Almost every single one of my old phones and laptops could have been resold to somebody else if it had been designed to be <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/most-repairable-apple-products">repairable</a>.</p><p>In a world this resource constrained we cannot afford that kind of&nbsp;waste.</p><p>Imagine that all manufactured goods have digital twins on the blockchain. As the assets change hands and experience wear and tear every repair is logged. Soon we can see what is repairable and resellable, what can be patched and mended, and what is just dead-loss scrap. If every single thing we buy has a unique ID and a permanent place to store its records, things will change. Manufactured goods cannot fail to improve in every way when exposed to the harsh light of transparency. Nobody wants to buy junk. A property rights transfer is as simple as having a neutral third party check that the item matches the blockchain record of the object, and an NFT is transferred to move the legal ownership.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> has built this. Gold <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/ntfa">bullion</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">art</a> and <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/third-millennia-collection-1">collectibles</a> to start, but pretty soon we will present prototypes for real estate transactions and consumer goods. I believe this is the unstoppable adoption-driving blockchain use case everybody has been searching for: a better way to buy physical things than anything Web2 has offered. <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/engineering-consumption-ac3bd74b1a21">Read more about this approach to managing our environmental footprint in the Mattereum Manifesto.</a></p>The Investment, Consumption, Production, Waste&nbsp;cycle. Mattereum embodies this theory of&nbsp;change <p>My company Mattereum deeply reflects this theory of change: we are (in the long run) a carbon accounting and radical resource efficiency company. I built the company to implement a theory of change I believed in: the World Computer cleans up the global economy. Computation on the global computer allows us to slash our carbon footprints.</p><p>Mattereum also <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/07/07/mattereum-sells-350000-year-old-hand-axe-a-dali-and-tibetan-buddhist-statue-as-real-world-asset-nfts/">sells</a> half a million year old stone hand axes as NFTs. We believe that art and antiquities, luxuries and collectibles, are excellent initial markets for Mattereum. While the world wakes up to the carbon challenge, we still need to develop the technology. There are many excellent here-and-now use for a system which binds objects to multi-faceted statements of truth about the objects. Very soon, blockchain scaling solutions will enable Mattereum to add trade in clothing, laptops, and eventually all manufactured objects. Real estate is an amazing use case too, and we expect prototyping in late Q4&nbsp;2021.</p><p><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">Here are some of the first physical artworks we are selling on&nbsp;OpenSea.</a></p><p>There’s also a lovely collection of <a href="https://ntfa.io/">Never Touch Fiat Again</a> gold bars here. NFT art combined with gold bullion: you can literally take physical delivery of the gold bars! Built in partnership with <a href="https://lohkowallet.com/">Lohko&nbsp;Wallet</a>.</p><p><a href="https://opensea.io/accounts/NTFA">NTFA's account | OpenSea</a></p><p>The way this system works is that for each individual NFT, such as this digital art piece backed by physical gold&nbsp;—</p><p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/47824387705324153400210554042155132922682187088261737780213014300224093421569">https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/47824387705324153400210554042155132922682187088261737780213014300224093421569</a></p><p>— there is a <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.100.alpha.001.150768/">Mattereum Asset Passport</a> which gives a legally binding set of promises about the gold bar associated with the&nbsp;NFT.</p><p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.100.alpha.001.150768/">Mattereum Asset Passport: Valcambi Suisse Gold Bar - 100g - Vector 777</a></p><p>You can check where the gold bar is vaulted and how it is insured. Pretty soon the Mattereum + <a href="http://unn.finance">Union</a> partnership will produce a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/mattereum-union-risk-protection-for-the-digital-physical-economy-628371e4cf8a">DeFi-based protection system for buyers</a>. This is a perfect example of the modular and composable nature of services in the Ethereum defi ecosystem: <a href="https://lohkowallet.com">Lohko</a> handles the gold, NTFA handle the art, Mattereum handles the proofs and provenance, UNN provides additional risk handling, and an as-yet-unnamed lender will soon be lending money against these gold bullion&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Of course, we would not be doing this if there were not some more fundamental purpose: every gold bar sold in this system has CO2 offsets purchased from <a href="https://nori.com/">Nori</a>, offsetting not only the CO2 burned by Ethereum mining on the NFTs, but also the CO2 emitted by the original mining of the gold&nbsp;itself.</p><p>We started with gold in vaults because it is one of the highest value and best controlled global supply chains: a good fit for management by NFTs and smart contracts. Fine art is a close second, although it is much harder to prove art fraud than gold fraud. High end liquor is another great area, because so much of the product is stored in high security warehouses. As we get more of these key assets into the system, it will become clear to more people how totally revolutionary this application of the World Computer really&nbsp;is.</p> What is Ethereum’s Theory of&nbsp;Change? <p>Ethereum’s theory of change is comprised of the theories of change of every person working with Ethereum.</p><p>I feel like I’ve made a good case for the potential to use Ethereum tokenization of CO2 and offsets, and as an instrument for the eradication of waste in areas like consumer electronics.</p><p>What are the other areas we could use Ethereum to transform?</p><p>For example, is DeFi the key to accelerating solar and wind energy installations? Funding vaccine research? Could we get that deep sky scan done? Fund space missions?</p><p>What is your vision of Ethereum’s theory of change? What are the elements of global transformation that you feel the World Computer genuinely enables?</p><p>I mean the stuff that matters. Save the world with the World Computer.</p> An economy with a&nbsp;future <p>Things change in fundamental ways <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State">when they have names</a> (or other unique identifiers). ISBN numbers empower libraries. ISIN numbers enable the global financial architecture to function. Namespaces rule everything.</p><p>An Ethereum contract address can map on to any underlying data structure you like. If you use IPFS the immutable data it connects to can be of arbitrary size. A single namespace for all objects and assets is possible. You just need the data structures to represent what is vital about the&nbsp;object.</p><p>Just imagine that for a moment. An Ethereum address attached to every physical thing, and every asset, you own. Orthogonal legal operators for sale, rental, escrow, use as collateral on a loan, or fractionalization and equity release. Those legal operators are based on Ricardian contracts, so they look like legal contracts to a court. But to a smart contract, they look like another smart contract: a digital/legal bridge that creates property rights. Mattereum calls this the Smart Property Register. For anything you own. And everything that everybody else owns&nbsp;too.</p><p>Everything carbon calculated, and fully offset. There would be trillions of dollars a year of offsets going into planting forests and restoring wetlands and everything else. It might be ten years before we have built a blockchain that can handle that kind of data load, but I guarantee you, it is&nbsp;coming.</p><p>In that world a huge number of humanity’s fundamental problems just evaporate.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/evangineer">Mamading Ceesay</a> coined the term “Economies of Omniscience” to describe the total economic transformation that such a world will bring. No more delays, no more things that don’t fit in the back of the truck so there have to be two runs. A computer figures that stuff out, because it has the data to figure it out. If a thing was made using CADCAM then the original digital models ought to be available on chain. Read the barcode or scan the NFC, download the CAD files, pass it to a piece of software which knows how to pack stuff in trucks: “yes it will all fit” and it does. These are the “economies of agility” which are enabled by actually being able to use computers to work with the material world properly. Better still, since the discovery of zkSNARKs and other zero knowledge methods, we can create “blind omniscience” where the coordination systems run perfectly but without any actor being able to see more than their part of the system. In short, the advantages of central planning, without a central planner. A privacy preserving panopticon. Technology now enables us to scale this paradoxical tower.</p><p>Now imagine this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gntV6AePOM">operational</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spime">paradigm</a> applied across everything: when you fly, you borrow everything you need when you land. It’s all waiting for you at the airport. When you move house anything which it is cheaper to sell and rebuy on the other end is waiting for you when you arrive. When you need tools for a job they come from your neighbours. It all starts with being able to identify physical property, clearly record its condition, and bind it to legal frameworks that enable it to transact.</p><p>Then we apply this to the industrial economy: no more shortfalls or warehouses of feedstocks which won’t be used for months. All the advantages of Just In Time, but coupled to the capability to buy and sell components directly to other companies, or your suppliers. Immediate configuration of capability by pre-designing systems using computers, and then provisioning the purchasing for all the necessary items using smart contracts. Option everything you need to buy, then when you have options on everything and you know it will all work if everybody does their jobs, execute the options. It’s a revolution like Just-In-Time manufacturing, but across all organizations rather than simply down a single supply chain: a Just-In-Time industrial web.</p><p>Then property can be fully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_utilization_theory">utilized</a> at all times, and we can create years of economic growth just from increases in fundamental process efficiency without increasing our ecological footprint at all! We are rearranging physical things and their legal property using software. We do this to optimise their utility and their disposition. Optimization and simulation pave the way to globally efficient logistical solutions.</p><p>We can use the World Computer to teach matter to dance. And a dancing world might be able to feed all of us because perfect coordination frees up vast resources.</p><p>It is a moral imperative that the Ethereum community starts to get serious about climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>My work with Mattereum is a culmination of decades spent thinking on how to manage scarce resources on the planet such that people’s basic necessities of living are secured, even in the worst of situations.</p><p>I’ve distilled some core insights on the technological and social transformation of material culture in a little book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Stuff-Vinay-Gupta-ebook/dp/B08B4F5QK3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+future+of+stuff&amp;qid=1629340329&amp;sr=8-1">The Future of Stuff</a>, in which I explore how things came to be and how we can build a better path forward where humanity can live in equilibrium with the&nbsp;planet.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Stuff-Vinay-Gupta-ebook/dp/B08B4F5QK3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+future+of+stuff&amp;qid=1629340329&amp;sr=8-1">The Future of Stuff</a></p><p>If long-reads aren’t your preferred media, our company podcast extends this discussion to other builders and thinkers who are shaping material culture across a range of industries.</p><p><a href="https://podcast.mattereum.com/">The Future of Stuff</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Can the World Computer Save the World?

Each one encompasses a <a href="https://knowhow.ncvo.org.uk/how-to/how-to-build-a-theory-of-change">theory of&nbsp;change</a>.</p>  The problem is governments. Bitcoin will destroy governments.  Solar panels, wind farms, batteries and so on will get so cheap we will entirely stop using coal, oil and gas, and the planet will&nbsp;heal.  We can grind up mountains made of <a href="https://www.projectvesta.org/science#Introduction">olivine</a> into new beaches, which will soak up CO2 faster than humans are pumping it out, at a fairly affordable cost.  The problem is <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/The_Invisibles_Vol_1_3">cities</a>. If people would just go back to human-scaled settlements with deeper personal interconnectedness, we would stop over-consuming physical things to meet our unmet emotional needs. Society needs&nbsp;therapy.  The problem is giant squid from beyond time have invaded the human group mind and are making us drive ourselves to extinction by pretending to be our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJdJEEZvhsA">gods</a>. The magician-artist Alan Moore figured it out and killed them during the process of producing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6eJkZJ1opo">Watchmen</a>, and freed from their awful influence humans will make better decisions. The world is slowly&nbsp;healing.  The planet is <a href="https://www.sapiens.org/culture/gaia-hypothesis-covid-19/">conscious</a> and will defend itself from human overpopulation by sending a&nbsp;plague.  The problem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism">capitalism</a>. We can reorganize global society along eco-socialist lines and there will be enough for everybody’s needs, but nobody’s&nbsp;greed.  The problem is trauma. Widespread use of MDMA-assisted <a href="https://maps.org/research/mdma">psychotherapy</a> will create saner humans on average, and these saner humans will start living&nbsp;right.  The Pentagon’s <a href="https://astronomy.com/news/2021/07/pentagon-ufo-report-no-confirmed-aliens-but-the-government-wants-to-learn-more">UFO</a> reports make it very clear that our understanding of the laws of physics as we understand them are incomplete. Either the beings operating these devices, or our physicists who learn from observing them, will use these newly discovered laws of physics to save&nbsp;us.  <p>Now clearly nobody could believe in all of these possible futures at the same time. You’d be mad. Not only do they contradict each other,&nbsp;they..</p>  Contradict the laws of&nbsp;physics  Contradict all possible models of history and human&nbsp;nature  Contradict… in fact there are an almost infinite list of things that other people’s models of the future can contradict.  <p>But apart from the one idea I put on that list to test people, intelligent people can hold and argue any one of those&nbsp;beliefs.</p><p>Can you pick which one is the stupid&nbsp;one?</p> World Models <p>In fact, what models of the future we take seriously are tightly tied to two things. These two implicit pieces of mental furniture are profoundly important in understanding why we as humans find it so difficult to agree on how to save each-others’ lives, which is what the world demands of us&nbsp;now.</p><p>The first piece of mental furniture is our world model: what we believe to be the facts of the situation. No human mind can contain the entire global situation. Our world model is inevitably partial and incomplete. It takes us time to ingest information. Our lifespans are not infinitely long. The sheer volume of a field like chemical engineering could take 12 lifespans to master. Or&nbsp;120.</p><p>So the world model system in our minds contains some sub-functions:</p>  A curiosity metric for estimating what information is worth fitting into our world model — what do we choose to learn&nbsp;about?  An existing set of facts that we consider to be true — the world model&nbsp;itself  A mechanism for discarding facts which are no longer thought to be true: the deletion&nbsp;rules  A model of who’s facts we will trust, which forms a trust&nbsp;graph  A detail filter which throws away things like precisely which elements go into making solar panels, now that the Indium Crisis is not thought to be a factor in production  A social harmonizer which tries to make sure that our world model is close enough to that of our tribe (including family, close friends, employers, or even the voting public) to keep our world model from becoming a survival liability  <p>It’s clear in the era of covid misinformation that even relatively small points of scientific knowledge (“are vaccines safe?” “do cloth masks work?” “do FFP3 masks <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1663">work</a>?”) result in dramatically different management of this deadly disease — and even the fact that covid is deadly is hotly debated in some&nbsp;circles.</p><p>It is unsurprising that in an age of infinite information choices, it has become extremely rare to meet two educated people who believe the same things about the world. Our world models have become distant from each other and fractured, because the curiosity metric is empowered by Google to find out anything.</p><p>Even if we stay in the domain of solid academic publications, where you focus results in completely different models of the&nbsp;future.</p> Theories of&nbsp;Change <p>The second piece of mental furniture is our theory of change. Not everybody has a theory of change. Many people share a few basic (and wrong) theories of change based on&nbsp;history.</p><p>Typical working folk are not consciously trying to change the world, for the most part. They’re trying to provide for their kids, their parents, and their own old age. This can turn into “who dies with the most toys wins” but for the most part people are spending on schools and elder-care. The yachts are few, but the prep schools are&nbsp;many.</p><p>The big formulaic theories of change, mostly rooted in historical analysis, are given names like Marxism or Socialism or Capitalism. Each one of these political movements, and all the others like them, contain a historical analysis and a proposed set of actions. In other words, a world model and then a theory of change that operates on that world&nbsp;model.</p><p>However, as people are increasingly self-educating on the internet our world models have become increasingly diverse and disassociated. It becomes harder and harder to synchronize world models with the people around us to participate in collective action. If our general world models do not match up, it is even less likely that our theories of change will match. Another way of saying this: if we cannot agree on the past and the present, it is unlikely we will agree on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoAyizBrk0M&amp;t=22s">future</a>.</p><p>Ethereum does not have a particularly strong theory of change. It starts as a direct evolution of bitcoin: “bitcoin <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html">plus</a> smart contracts.” A simple sense of “this is the next step” technologically is enough to get that started. Afterwards the lack of political consensus between the early founders of the Ethereum project resulted in a sort of forced Swiss neutrality. The exchange of fire about whether Ethereum should be a corporation left enough political fallout that the question of where Ethereum was on the political landscape has gone generally unanswered. <a href="http://radicalmarkets.com/">Radical Markets</a> is probably the political brand most closely associated with Ethereum. But even that has taken a back seat to the rainbow unicorns and various animal-themed token projects. We have here a technology without an ideology.</p><p>Unfortunately the world is still on&nbsp;fire.</p> Proposing an explicit theory of change for&nbsp;Ethereum  Should Ethereum even have a theory of&nbsp;change? <p>Is it possible for the Ethereum community to share a theory of change, given how culturally diverse the community is? The DeFi people and the NFT people, for example, barely&nbsp;touch.</p><p>You could frame this as “the internet does not have a theory of change, so why should Ethereum?” But actually the internet does have a theory of change: “a little bit of everything, all of the&nbsp;time.”</p><p>Omniversal access to information! The internet superhighway. Freedom to&nbsp;know!</p><p>However you frame it, this is the internet’s theory of change — individuals using the internet all embrace this model, at least a little bit, by virtue of their actions. It may be implicit, but that theory of change is universal: somehow, hollering at strangers on the other side of the world using social media will fix things.&nbsp;Somehow.</p><p>So at the very least there are a handful of universals in the Ethereum theory of change, the implicit factors. The basic structures in the world model&nbsp;include:</p>  Not your keys, not your&nbsp;crypto  Anyone can create a smart&nbsp;contract  Radical inclusion through open access to infrastructure  Anonymity and pseudonyms are absolutely recommended  Ethereum runs everywhere in the&nbsp;world  <p>Usually the whole theory of change is summarized as “decentralization”. There’s an idea of tearing down monopolies and dispensing with middle men, kind of freeing up markets to Do The Right Thing freed from exploitation because perfect competition gets rid of rentiers.</p><p>And that’s about as close to a theory of change — a coherent story about how we are going to save the world — as Ethereum gets these&nbsp;days.</p><p>I am very clear that “decentralization” needs a lot of unpacking and context to be a valid way of looking at what the blockchain does. Permissionless also needs serious unpacking in a situation where (for example) exchanges decide which tokens to list. A lot of sketchy projects slip by because we do not get down to the details of who actually makes the decision. Decentralized can often mean oligarchical because one token means one vote, for example. Permissionless usually fares a little better, but then how do people know who to trust or who is being scammed by who? It is not like we have universally adopted Ethereum-wide public key infrastructure and identity infrastructure for projects.</p><p>Also note how much this theory of change shares with bitcoin’s theories of change. Now that EIP 1559 has firmly placed Ethereum on the deflationary path there is no doubt that a lot of the bitcoin-style reasoning about Ether as money will start to converge.</p><p>So in this sense, many of the parts of this theory of change do not belong uniquely to Ethereum. The basic structures of this world model are heavily overlapped with cryptocurrency in general, rather than applying specifically to smart contracts or the whole world computer&nbsp;context.</p><p>Something as revolutionary as Ethereum should have a more clearly articulated theory of change, I think — and not one, but several! Ethereum’s theories of change may be plural, but we would be making a lot more impact if they were clear and explicit: how are we going to help save the&nbsp;world?</p> Who am I to propose&nbsp;this? <p>I came into the Ethereum project in 2014. I decided to quit my job in military academia because it was impossible to change the world from that position in the ways that I wanted to. I wanted to retool the world’s militaries for climate change operations through civilian-military cooperation on disaster relief. It was a dead&nbsp;end.</p><p>Then I heard a story about a team working on a bitcoin-like smart contract system, and recognized that it was going to change the world. I chose to dedicate my life to making it&nbsp;work.</p><p>I was already well experienced with digital currency, having been a full send user of e-gold in the late 1990s. I knew my way around ERIGHTS and ESPEAK, capability based operating systems and all the rest: I had, after all, been a crypto activist in the 1990s when crypto meant “encrypted communications” not “digital currencies.” My background in distributed systems went back into the 1980s (!). I had a choice between the Ethereum technical track in Berlin, or the Ethereum Communications track in London and I chose to stay put rather than move. Comms needed help, and I’d done quite a bit of work for charities doing communications. I wound up as <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/">the release coordinator for the Ethereum launch</a>. Critically, I was managing community expectations about what would be released and when. It’s all ancient history now but for a while I was one of the public faces of the entire&nbsp;project!</p><p><a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/">The Ethereum Launch Process</a></p><p>I’m telling you this now so you understand that I was deeply grounded in the Ethereum project, but in no way foundational to it. I’m often confused as being one of the original Gang of 8, but I was something like employee&nbsp;30.</p><p>The Gupta World Model<br>A word about <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-2-world-models-theories-of-change-cd8aecfd53de">my world model</a>, since world models are what we’re talking about. I’d spent most of my time since 9/11 working on climate change, poverty, natural disaster, and plagues in the think tank world, military academia, and charities. It had been an extremely hardcore 12 years, and I was burned out, bitter, and filled with experience of bureaucracy, corruption in power hierarchies, and the disastrous nature of governance and government. It was, in short,&nbsp;bleak.</p><p>So I viewed Ethereum as a chance to hang up my “end of the world” hat. I got to work with the direct challenges of getting the world the smart contract platform it so desperately needed. I was part of a fabulously talented team of legends. It was a big turn in my&nbsp;life.</p><p>One of the phrases I’d picked up during my time in military academia was “unity of action without unity of command.” I picked it up from Lin Wells (famous for the Wells Memo on <a href="https://library.rumsfeld.com/doclib/sp/2382/2001-04-12%20To%20George%20W%20Bush%20et%20al%20re%20Predicting%20the%20Future.pdf">predicting the future</a> among other things.) This was, to me, the goal of Ethereum: to coordinate the world so we could increase efficiency, reduce waste, and take care of all of humanity’s concerns more effectively.</p><p>Some people heard “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs">World Computer</a>” as “a computer that spans the world” but I heard world computer as “a computer that heals the world.” I had a very clear sense of what I wanted from this thing: I wanted a system which could out-perform current models of capitalism (intensely wasteful and wrongfully productive) without requiring political turmoil to adopt. I wanted an evolution in the culture and the machinery of the market, to produce a world with carbon accounting and an end to world hunger because crops no longer rotted in the&nbsp;fields.</p><p>I had not worked out the details, but that’s where I thought the project was&nbsp;going.</p><p>Where do we go from&nbsp;here?</p><p>Part 3:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Can the World Computer Save the World?

It is clear that things are just <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/09/world/global-climate-change-report-un-ipcc/index.html">trashed</a> and it’s getting worse year on&nbsp;year.</p><p>Also we are being profoundly ineffective on the solutions side.

Unlike most of the people in the space I have never owned or held a significant amount of bitcoin: a series of defense jobs made me uncomfortable with the idea of having poorly-understood cryptographic software running on my laptop. I also have some religious prohibitions about speculative finance and zero-sum economic activities like gambling. I’m not going to explain those right now, but it is sufficient to say that I am not crypto rich, and am a fairly neutral observer: I am not talking up my own book right&nbsp;now.</p><p>People completely forget the first iteration of bitcoin. In 2010, bitcoin was mined on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rise-of-asics-bitcoin-mining-history">laptops</a>.</p><p>Mined. On.&nbsp;Laptops.</p><p>It was essentially a basic income scheme for laptop owners. A person could download the bitcoin mining software and run it on their machine at night and have a few bitcoin in the morning. As more people did it, the mining reward was spread thinner and thinner. Bitcoin was, at that point, libertarian socialist (which is to say Anarchist) if it had any politics at all. Very broad participation in economic production was possible, and the rewards were distributed evenly.</p><p>There was no particular return to capital because people were mining on laptops they had already owned. Nobody was buying hardware to run bitcoin&nbsp;on.</p><p>This was a radically different period in history. Nothing worked the same way that it does now. I remember railing against the arrival of ASIC mining, because as far as I was concerned, it ended the revolutionary potential of&nbsp;bitcoin.</p><p>I was wrong, but not in the way you&nbsp;think.</p><p>In the early phases of bitcoin, the workers owned the means of <a href="https://tedcurran.net/2013/04/own-the-means-of-production-what-karl-marx-knew-about-opportunity-in-the-digital-economy/">production</a>.</p><p>After ASIC <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rise-of-asics-bitcoin-mining-history">mining</a> was invented there was a role for capital in the bitcoin ecosystem. Commissioning production of ASICs is extremely expensive. It takes a ton of up front investment.</p><p>The reward is to be able to mine bitcoin cheaper than anybody else&nbsp;can.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rise-of-asics-bitcoin-mining-history">The Rise of Specialized Mining Equipment on Bitcoin - CoinDesk</a></p><p>Once that role for capital was established, bitcoin went from being libertarian socialist with workers entirely owning the means of production (because they owned their own laptops) to something else. Bitcoin became anarchocapitalist. The line between libertarian socialism and anarchocapitalism has always been&nbsp;thin.</p><p>Gupta’s Libertarian Observation <a href="https://www.appropedia.org/User:Vinay_Gupta#Gupta's_Libertarian_Observation">states</a>:</p><p>Free people create free markets. Free markets do not necessarily create free&nbsp;people.</p><p>Because there is no doubt that if people have political freedom they will engage in trade. But if that trade creates a situation in which workers do not own the means of production — that is to say, the profit created from labour is returned to capital and not to labour — then markets move from being an expression of liberated circumstances to being just another instrument of oppression.</p><p>For people who have a hard time grasping this: there is a difference between a road and a toll&nbsp;road.</p> How is bitcoin going to save the&nbsp;world? <p>Since bitcoin was invented there have been several distinct stories about how bitcoin is going to change the&nbsp;world:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/top-10-bitcoin-maximalist-tweets-of-all-time-8857bc28767c">Maximalism</a>/Hyperbitcoinization<br>Bitcoin will change the world by overtaking the dollar and bankrupting the world’s governments by making it impossible to tax the citizenry. As this became less probable a new narrative emerged…  Banking the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/yayafanusie/2021/01/01/stop-saying-you-want-to-bank-the-unbanked/">Unbanked</a><br>Bitcoin will change the world by banking the unbanked, and bringing sophisticated financial infrastructure to the entire world. People in developing world countries will be able to trade globally. Facilities like microfinance will be administered largely by machines making it economically efficient to deploy capital in villages and farms all around the planet. But this turned out to be hard, nearly intractable. Progress was slow and even the remittance market largely refused to convert to a bitcoin-by-default configuration.  Store of <a href="https://builtin.com/finance/crypto-wont-replace-gold">Value</a><br>Bitcoin will change the world by transforming the centralized financial institutions like pension funds and ETFs into bitcoin holders, providing a “store of value” which cannot be inflated out by governments. Bitcoin is in some sense “digital real estate” in that, like land, there is only so much to go around and if you own it, you own it. Note that this theory of change is confined to bitcoin holders: it’s not a dream of global transformation in the way the first two stories were. Bitcoin has begun to mainstream, but at the cost of its world-transforming values.  Maximalism 2.0<br>There is a potential future phase of the Bitcoin story, which is the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/inflation-rampant-buy-bitcoin">inflation</a> hedge story. Right now inflation is pretty low, or being passed off as a very temporary situation. If this changes and the US economy sees sustained inflation and people watch their savings shrink year on year then things will become extremely dramatic and not in a good way. The “store of value” argument will go from being relatively esoteric to being a mainstream lived experience for an enormous number of people, and bitcoin will be back at phase one all over again: a threat to the primacy of government in the currency&nbsp;market.  <p>Now pause for a moment&nbsp;here.</p><p>Climate change is trashing the planet. Bitcoin is hugely CO2 intensive to produce. It has no environmental value system built into it. It creates no environmental benefit by existing. There are some <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-bitcoin-may-actually-speed-up-the-transition-to-renewable-energy-2021-05-18">weak arguments</a> about how bitcoin mining is accelerating the transition to renewables in some way. But at the end of the day, electricity is being consumed, and those renewable resources could be powering anything. It’s just shilling.</p><p>I believe that crypto is an integral part of the human future: I think it’s the necessary backbone for fixing a lot of the world’s problems.</p><p>But not like this. Not like&nbsp;this.</p><p>Bitcoin inside of the existing narrative is probably a very, very good thing for bitcoin holders in the event of inflation inside of America. But even if those people thrive the world still&nbsp;burns.</p> The economy without a&nbsp;future <p>The correct value of many of our most “valuable” financial assets is&nbsp;zero.</p><p>Ski towns in places with no snow. Island fortresses in hurricane belts. Almond orchards in areas with no water to feed the crops. Real estate in flood plains. All of the oil and coal in the ground. All of&nbsp;it.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranded_asset#Climate-related_asset_stranding">Stranded asset - Wikipedia</a></p><p>It’s worth nothing because in the future it will be illegal, uneconomic (carbon taxes) or both. The people who hold those assets currently hold nothing but that’s not what they report to their shareholders. The size of this financial catastrophe cannot be overstated. But it is a direct result of mismanagement by fund managers and boards who chose to ignore climate change. They have wound up as “bag holders” with portfolios stuffed with worthless coal, oil and gas “assets.”</p><p>They’d have done better to buy bitcoin. At least bitcoin might be worth something in&nbsp;future.</p><p>Even with scenarios like geoengineering most of these assets remain completely worthless: we are not going to wind up in a world where we geoengineer the entire climate and then continue burning oil and coal like nothing ever happened. At the very least the costs of the geoengineering will be passed directly on to the coal, oil and gas producers.</p><p>Have I mentioned the continuing catastrophic subsidization governments are doing of their own fossil fuel industries, while making vague noises about unenforceable climate targets? That’s a topic for another&nbsp;essay.</p><p>But if we take out all the assets which are wiped out in a fully scale climate change scenario there is basically nothing left of the current economy: the oil companies are gone, coal, natural gas wiped out. Entire industries like almonds. Fishing. You can just go down the list: gone, gone, gone, wiped out, worthless, gone. Other industries rocket into existence: solar, wind, renewables, batteries, energy efficient construction, you name it. An entire universe goes, and a different one is&nbsp;created.</p><p>But the pension funds, the behemoths of the financial landscape, are gigantically underwater to climate change. That’s another way of saying the old people who are relying on those pension funds to provide them money to live on further into their old age are not going to get paid. The money they saved their entire lives was pumped into worthless assets in nearly every future scenario. By the time they are old enough to pull the money out of the pension fund, the pension fund is worth 20% of what it was worth because the economy that it invested in is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.vox.com/22291568/climate-change-carbon-footprint-greta-thunberg-un-emissions-gap-report">lifestyle</a> you have ordered is out of&nbsp;stock.</p>Banksy ‘Out of Stock’ — <a href="https://streetartlondon.co.uk/blog/2011/12/banksy-out-stock/">Street Art&nbsp;London</a><p>Part Two:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-2-world-models-theories-of-change-cd8aecfd53de">Can the World Computer Save the World?

**An Interview with UrbitHost**

Urbit has been making great strides to become accessible to those who are non-technical. Port enables a user to launch their Urbit ID from their personal computer without any knowledge of the command line. However, you only have access while you are running Port, which means you can't do things like check your DMs while on the move.

Hosting your Urbit means that your Urbit is always on and available. All that is required to access the network is visiting a URL and logging in.That means you can access Urbit from your phone, laptop, or any device with a browser.

The downside is that running your own server can be a complex and difficult process. Third-party hosting allows an expert to do that work for you. The hosting provider gets paid, and you get 24/7 access to your ship.

[UrbitHost](https://urbithost.com) is one of the latest [hosting providers](https://subject.network/planet-sales/) to enter the market. As of now, it is one of the fastest and easiest ways onto the network. You pay the fee, and you get sent a link that you use to access Landscape. It's that easy.

At least, it's that easy for the end user. For the guy running the operations, ~lavlyn-litmeg, it can be quite a complex operation. I sat down with him to find out about what it's like being a commercial developer on Urbit. We also talked about technology, the developer ecosystem, and the future of Urbit.

If you want to get in touch you can reach him at ~lavlyn-litmeg, the ~sardys/uh group, or [urbithost.com](https://urbithost.com).

**Tell us a bit about yourself and your history with Urbit?**

I'm a software engineer who is currently working at one of the larger crypto currency companies. My history with Urbit goes back quite a long time. I saw one of those early demos by Curtis where he had two dojos running, sending messages back and forth, and I thought it looked interesting. Since then, I often checked in on the project, but I stayed at the sidelines because it felt not quite ready; there were constant breaches and so on. What kept me close by was that I believed in the vision of Urbit.

I think the open internet only has a future if people retain control of their digital identities, which means that, in addition to a cryptographic identity, they need to be able to keep control over their data. This not only includes their social graph, but they also must be able to run computations on that data. Urbit checks all those boxes. The people behind Urbit and all the other contributors have been steadily marching towards these goals with incredible stamina. I'm inspired by that. And, since the release of OS1, Urbit is very much usable, and I find myself spending more and more time on it instead of other corners of the internet.

**Why did you decide to work on hosting rather than another Urbit project? If you weren't working on UrbitHost what would you be working on within the Urbit ecosystem?**

I want my non-tech friends to be able to join Urbit. Most people I know can't be bothered with executing a blockchain transaction, many feel uncomfortable installing an app they don't understand, and almost all would shy away from the command line. For the vast majority of people, getting onto Urbit must be as easy as signing up for Gmail or Twitter, otherwise they won't come.

I thought about how I could contribute to Urbit and decided that now is a good time to build a hosting provider. It's still early, but a non-technical person can actually spend time on the network and be productive. I think we are just now seeing a shift where we need community builders as much as we need engineers working on the internals of Urbit. It is important that those community builders have no barrier to entry for themselves or their communities.

That is why ease of access has been my goal from the beginning. I wanted the site to be fully automated, meaning someone could sign up and be on Urbit within minutes. It was also important to me that users be able to choose their own Urbit ID. As far as I know, there was no offering like that yet, so I decided to build it—but I know that others are working on this too.

If I was working on something else, it would be Urbit apps. We're waiting for the new release for it to be easier to distribute and access apps; there are a few tools I would really like to see. But other than that, I would like to spend more time community building.

**Can you tell us about how you're implementing UrbitHost? You beat Tlon to the punch of having immediate hosted access to the Urbit network -- what're you doing differently? How will your implementation change when programmatic access becomes available via Khan (the new vane to replace Herb)?**

UrbitHost runs on Kubernetes, which is a tool to orchestrate containers. What that means, concretely, is that each ship runs inside a Docker container, and Kubernetes makes sure that each container is running and has enough resources. For example, if a server goes down, Kubernetes will automatically move the ships that were on that server to a new server that is available. No data is lost and there should be very little down-time.

People think Kubernetes should only be used for services that can be scaled horizontally, meaning there are multiple instances running of the same services. Scaling like this is obviously not an option for Urbit, because a ship must only run as a single instance. But in the last few years, Kubernetes has added many features to run single and stable instances of a container, for example a database. UrbitHost is making use of these features—permanent volumes, stateful sets, and so on—to provide a high-availability hosting for Urbit. It also scales well. I surmise, we could host thousands of ships, we would only have to add compute nodes.

As for beating Tlon, I'm not sure if it is a fair comparison. UrbitHost, as it is currently, is a minimal viable product. I tried to realize a simple goal: automated hosting. Tlon is hosting many more planets, not to speak of all the stars and galaxies that make up the network. As far as I can tell, Tlon and UrbitHost are doing things quite similarly. For example, I knew that Tlon is also hosting on Kubernetes, which gave me much more confidence that we could do it too.

UrbitHost's programmatic interaction with hosted ships is quite minimal once it is booted. We use airlock to retrieve the access code and do a few more maintenance things, and we are using it for some upcoming features like automatic S3 configuration. But from what I can tell, Khan looks like a really important step forward, because interacting with the hosted ships via airlock is one of the most brittle areas, and I'm looking forward to making it more robust once Khan is out.

**What is most needed within the Urbit ecosystem — any particular apps or services? Which projects are you most excited about?**

The ability to publish content directly from a planet to the regular internet would be cool. I would really love to see some bigger blogs being hosted on Urbit. The basic idea would be this: everyone can read the blog, but to join the conversation one would have to join Urbit and the group associated with that blog. Of course, a planet could publish other content too, possibly a mix of free and premium content. Either way, it would pull a lot of people into the gravity well of Urbit.

Publishing could also be a good value proposition for Urbit hosting providers. If public content is hosted on a ship, then all the profit from new customers who are brought to the provider could somehow be split between the host and content producer. What is nice, though, is that a content producer can take his Urbit-native community anywhere, anytime, without disrupting the community much. The portability of Urbit at every level would really shine here as communities grow.

There are incredible projects happening on every front. The Bitcoin integration is very exciting, it is being realized in a truly Urbit-native way and could prove to be a great catalyst for the ecosystem. However, as a hosting provider, the constant lower-level improvements are exciting too.

**What will be the effect of two upcoming changes to Urbit:**

1. **Built in software distribution and management**
2. **Layer 2 and the new "Khan" vane**

**For #1, how would you pitch developers on the benefits of building on Urbit?**

**With regard to #2, I think there is about to be an explosion of hosting providers. Will this unleash an Eternal September effect or does Urbit's "walled garden" style of communication make it more resilient? Urbit is not a single silo like Facebook, after all.**

I think that once software distribution is as simple and easy as the iOS app store it will be a watershed moment for Urbit. Put bluntly, it will give users something to do on Urbit besides chat. There are several interesting apps out there already, but they are not easy to discover and install.

Developers want reach. The most important pitch to developers will be that on Urbit they have access to a substantial audience. I remember developing for the iPhone in the early days. Objective-C was really a tough pill to swallow, but because the platform was interesting and promised to reach a large audience, I kept going with it. I think Urbit is an interesting platform for the various reasons already mentioned. But learning to develop for Urbit is really a time investment—I myself am still a novice Hoon developer —and for it to be worth it, there has to be a clear pay-off. For some, this is making system-level contributions, but for most it will be having that app show up in some centrally visible place and seeing people engage with it. Once this exists, it will be much easier to pitch Urbit to developers.

The layer 2 solution which will make spawning planets much cheaper is an important next step, especially for hosting providers. Layer 2 will help us immensely because spawning and keying planets is very expensive right now, and it puts a damper on how much we are actively pursuing growth.

If new hosting providers come online, it will not necessarily mean a huge influx of users. In my experience, building a provider is hard and takes time to mature. However, I would love to see fast user growth.

I honestly don't think having our own Urbit Eternal September would be that bad. I would just see it as growing pains. If we enter a time of sustained growth and rapid user onboarding, the fact that some Urbit groups will get overwhelmed with all the new people will be a small price to pay. The current setup, with a few central groups that act like hubs and discovery points—for example, the fantastic Urbit Index—would have to change. People would need to be funneled into their own Urbit universes that might not overlap much with other areas on Urbit. The nice thing is that all this is accounted for in the Urbit infrastructure.

If a certain hosting provider ends up bringing thousands upon thousands of users to Urbit, like AOL did back then with Usenet, then it will be the provider's responsibility to onboard those users sensibly and not just dump them on the existing groups. In other words, providers, in my opinion, also have a community building responsibility. Of course, this does not mean that providers should be overbearing parents, allowing only this or that, but simply that they should have sensible defaults that don't overwhelm or destroy the network.

**What is the role of commercial providers in the open-source ecosystem?**

Commercial providers will be incredibly important to make Urbit succeed. I think if Urbit attracts a large number of users, many, if not most, will run their ship via a hosting provider. It is the easiest way to get started.

However, using a hosting provider to get onto Urbit might at first seem antithetical to the spirit of the project. If someone is trying to get away from mega-corporations, why would they go right back to another company and give them their data?

Well, because it's a completely different relationship. The relationship between us, the provider, and you, the customer, is transparently straight forward. You are not the product. We have a more traditional provider-customer relationship where we just do the dev ops work. It is in our interest to keep your data private and keep your ship running. We give you an Urbit ID, which you can keep forever, and host your ship as long as you wish. When you want to leave, you can download your pier and Urbit ID and use it with a different provider or on your own computer in minutes. On the other hand, you cannot leave Facebook and run your profile off of your laptop. Basically, we cannot count on customer lock-in, we must provide good and honest service. Again, the portability promise of Urbit is essential here and ensures that we are on an equal footing.

**Once the Urbit payment ecosystem gets built out more, would you consider accepting payments over the Urbit network?**

Of course. Having an Urbit-native economy would be a key marker of success, and I would love to participate in it. Moreover, we are planning to offer a Bitcoin node to our customers soon.

**Are you coming to Assembly 2021?**

Yes. At least, I'm planning to! I would love to meet all the people behind Urbit in real life.

**I know you are a Christopher Alexander fan, how has he influenced your work?**

I've been interested in Christopher Alexander for quite a long time. When I realized that many of the people building Urbit are also inspired by him, I understood why much of the Urbit vibe resonated with me. Critics of Urbit either focus on the technical details or on Curtis Yarvin's writings, sometimes conflating the two. That's fine and perhaps a valid point to start, but what they don't understand is that so many other ideas and ideals have since become driving forces behind the project. This is at least what I observe as an outsider.

Alexander's ideas are all about how to build beautiful houses. He wants us to inhabit places that feel life-giving, places that make us more fully human. The same should be asked of the technology we use. So much of the current internet is the equivalent of a fluorescent-lit cubicle, a brutalist government building, or a flashy central square. It might be interesting to travel through these places, but they do not make good homes.

To explore what makes a building beautiful, Alexander had to wade into metaphysics, because he wanted to give a much more objective account of how beauty is present in physical artifacts, which led him to treat beauty as a universal. I think to build more meaningful technology we need to do the same. We do not have a good metaphysics of technology, and this is something I'm really interested in.

**Give me a brief summary about your personal philosophy of technology. Do all tools fall under the umbrella of "technology"? Or do some tools hit an inflection point where they acquire radically different characteristics (compare a shovel and a computer)? It seems to me that the philosophy of technology often boils down to trying to define what "technology" actually is. What do you make of all this?**

Yeah, I definitely think there is an inflection point once technology becomes digital, but I believe there is something all technology has in common. My approach here is classical. Artifacts have to be distinguished from living things because human made things have their origin outside themselves, meaning they are manufactured (in Aristotelian terms, and stated somewhat simplistically, artifacts have an efficient cause outside themselves, whereas biological things have an innate efficient cause). We are often tempted to think of living organisms simply as elaborate self-replicating machines, but that is putting the cart before the horse. We should rather look to the world of living things to be inspired to build our artifacts.

The question of inspiration becomes even more pressing when discussing modern technology, and you put your finger on it with the inflection point. There is no tradition to fall back on when we are building digital technologies. Someone like Christopher Alexander, who is working on architecture, has thousands of years of architecture to look at. He can read the past and see what worked and what did not. On the other hand, when we build things like Urbit, we must look for inspiration in other places because there is no corpus of, say, thousands of years of constructing digital social networks where we can simply choose the best parts. So far, we have mostly bad examples, how not to do it. And considering how new the internet is, most of it is still a blank slate. So while I'm definitely interested in the ontology of technology, I think it is an even more pressing question to learn the principles of the living world around us in order to build digital places that feel organic and life-giving.

**Thanks for chatting!**

See you on the network!

<p>It is with great pleasure that today I am officially announcing that Chris Hart has joined the Civic Board of Directors and has succeeded me as Civic’s CEO. On behalf of the board, I would like to congratulate Chris on this appointment and thank him for his contributions since 2017 as our COO!</p>



<p>Chris is deeply committed to our mission. He has an exceptional understanding of the ecosystem’s technology, and a compelling strategic vision for the company. I am confident that Civic will continue to reach new heights under his leadership. Chris’ background and track record as Civic’s long-serving COO make him particularly well qualified to assume the mantle of CEO, and I have every confidence that he is the right person to lead Civic into the future.</p>



<p>As part of this change I will become the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors at Civic. In this new role, I will continue to be active at a Board and strategic level within the company, and look forward to contributing to Civic’s future successes. Jonathan Smith, our co-founder and CTO, will continue in his current role, and is more excited than ever about Civic’s next phase.</p>



<p>Over the past six years, Civic has become a leader in identity-based solutions for the fast-emerging blockchain compliance and identity space. Civic is in a great place, and my role change is timely given the many positive developments this year. This timing also coincides with the appointment of <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/new-board-member-maja-vujinovic/">Maja Vujinovic to the board</a>, which was done largely to support the company and advance our strategy.</p>



<p>Last summer, in light of the crippling impact of high ETH gas fees on Civic Wallet, we made a strategic decision to move our company to an ecosystem that can support a high volume B2B model. This was one of the primary reasons why we were one of the first crypto companies to be <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-announces-integration-with-solana-blockchain/">integrated with Solana</a>. As the company shifts to scale sales and ramp up growth in this category, we will be well served by Chris Hart’s strong marketplace, mobile and crypto background.</p>



<p>Most importantly, in my final message as CEO I want to thank all of you, from our community to our team and our investors, for your tireless contributions to Civic’s success over the past many years. I know that in Chris and Jonathan’s able hands, our amazing culture will produce identity services that will support the viability of the digital asset ecosystem and make the world a better place. As Executive Chairman, I will remain heavily involved with Civic but from a different vantage point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m looking forward to the many new milestones ahead for Civic. My conviction and excitement for Civic has never been stronger. Congratulations again to our new CEO, Chris Hart!</p>

The Web 3 era promises a world in which we are no longer at the mercy of centralized platforms.”   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>The Paypers — <a href="https://thepaypers.com/expert-opinion/the-taste-of-a-global-digital-identity-framework-interoperable-decentralised-secure--1250868">The ‘taste’ of a global digital identity framework — interoperable, decentralised, secure</a></p><blockquote>More than a buzzword, digital identity promises to unlock many benefits for consumers and businesses alike in many sectors: healthcare, legal, government, financial. But lack of interoperability and data privacy issues hinder the adoption of these technologies. Moreover, the need to find new ways to identify consumers remotely (ways that are secure and inclusive) and the fact that more and more fintech and online platforms have begun replacing banks means that the need for global development of a digital identity infrastructure is expected to&nbsp;grow.</blockquote><p>Ontology is committed to enabling users to have digital identities and to achieve autonomous data management. At the same time, Ontology provides a comprehensive decentralized identity solution for enterprises, with its decentralized identity framework, ONT ID, at its core. It can quickly identify and connect people, money and real-world assets. It has the characteristics of decentralization, independent management, privacy protection, safety and ease of use. We look forward to contributing more to the development of global digital identity system infrastructure.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

 What Is Identity Authentication 

<p>Identity Authentication verifies a user’s identity by specific means. We obtain detailed user metadata from the Identity Provider (IdP) to determine whether a user has access to particular resources.</p>

 Identity Authentication Modes 

<p>There are two main categories of identity authentication: traditional mode and centralized mode.</p>

 Traditional Authentication Mode 

<p>In the traditional authentication mode, each application service needs to support authentication separately, such as accessing the login interface when the user is not logged in. The interface returns a <code>301</code> jump page. All application services need to develop the logic to maintain the session and interact with the identity provider for authentication.</p>

<p>You can see the flow of traditional authentication in the figure below.</p>

<p>First, the user initiates a request, then the gateway receives the request and forwards it to the corresponding application services, and finally, the application services interact with the identity provider to complete the authorization.</p>

<p></p>

 Centralized Identity Authentication Mode 

<p>Unlike traditional authentication, the centralized identity mode removes user authentication from the application services. Take Apache APISIX as an example; you can see the centralized identity authentication process in the figure below.</p>

<p>First, the user initiates a request, then the gateway itself takes charge of the user authentication process, interacting with the identity provider and sending them an authorization request. The identity provider returns user identity information (user info). After the gateway identifies the user, it forwards the user identity information (user info) to the services in a request header.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Compared with the traditional authentication mode, centralized identity mode has the following advantages:</p>

 
   Centralized auth simplifies the application development process, and reduces the development application workload and maintenance costs by avoiding the need to repeat the development of authentication code for each application. 
   Centralized authentication mode improves business security. At the gateway level, it can intercept unauthenticated requests in time to protect back-end applications. 
 

 What Is OpenID Connect 

<p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a centralized identity authentication mode. The benefit of using OpenID Connect is that users only need to register and log in with one OpenID Connect identity provider’s website and use one account’s password information to access different applications. <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> is a common OpenID Connect identity provider, and the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect plugin supports OpenID.  As a result, the plugin can replace traditional authentication mode with centralized identity authentication.  In this case, we’re using Okta.</p>

 OpenID Authentication Process 

<p></p>

 
   APISIX initiates an authentication request to the Identity Provider. 
   The user logs in and authenticates on the Identity Provider. 
   The Identity Provider returns to APISIX with the Authorization Code. 
   APISIX requests the Identity Provider with the Code extracted from the request parameters. 
   The Identity Provider sends an answer message to APISIX with the ID Token and Access Token. 
   APISIX sends the Access Token to the Identity Provider’s User Endpoint for authentication. 
   After passing the authentication, the User Endpoint sends the User Info to APISIX to complete  authentication. 
 

 How to Configure Okta Authentication Using the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Configuring Okta authentication using the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect plugin is a three-step process that allows you to switch from traditional authentication to centralized identity authentication mode. The following sections describe the steps to configure Okta authentication using the OpenID Connect plugin for Apache APISIX.</p>

 Prerequisites 

<p>Have an <a>Okta account</a> ready for use.</p>

 Step 1: Configuring Okta 

 
   
    <p>Log in to your Okta account and click Create App Integration to create an Okta application.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Select OIDC-OpenID Connect for the Sign-in method, and select Web Application for the  Application type.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Set the redirect URL for login and logout. The Sign-in redirect URIs are links a user can go to after a successful login, and the Sign-out redirect URIs are links a user goes to after a successful logout. In this example, we set both sign-in and sign-out redirect URIs to <code>http://127.0.0.1:9080/</code>.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>After finishing the settings, click Save to save the changes.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Visit the General page of the application to obtain the following configuration, which is required to configure Apache APISIX OpenID Connect.</p>
   
 

 
   Client ID: OAuth client ID, the application ID, which corresponds to <code>client_id</code> and <code>{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}</code> below. 
   Client secret: OAuth client secret, the application key, which corresponds to <code>client_secret</code> and <code>{YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET}</code> below. 
   Okta domain: The domain name used by the application, corresponding to <code>{YOUR_ISSUER}</code> below. 
 

<p></p>

 Step 2: Install Apache APISIX 

 Install Dependencies 

<p>The Apache APISIX runtime environment requires dependencies on NGINX and etcd.</p>

<p>X-Access-Token: Apache APISIX puts the access token obtained from the user provider into the <code>X-Access-Token</code> request header, optionally via the <code>access_token_in_authorization_header</code> in the plugin configuration Authorization request header.</p>

<p>X-Id-Token: Apache APISIX will get the Id token from the user provider through the base64 encoding into the <code>X-Id-Token</code> request header, you can choose whether to enable this function through the <code>set_id_token_header</code> in the plugin configuration, the default is enabled.</p>

<p></p>

<p>X-Userinfo: Apache APISIX will get the user information from the user provider and put it into <code>X-Userinfo</code> after encoding it with Base64, you can choose whether to enable this feature through <code>set_userinfo_header</code> in the plugin configuration, it is set to be on by default.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you can see, Apache APISIX will carry the <code>X-Access-Token</code>, <code>X-Id-Token</code>, and <code>X-Userinfo</code> request headers to the upstream. The upstream can parse these headers to get the user ID information and user metadata.</p>

<p>We have shown the process of building centralized identity authentication from Okta directly into the Apache APISIX Gateway. It is easy to sign up for a free Okta Developer Account to get started. Our approach reduces developer overhead and enables a safe and streamlined experience.</p>

Where we are with the infrastructure/crypto bill Photo: European Central&nbsp;Bank<p>The reality is that the U.S. government is going to want more control and oversight over the $2 trillion and rising crypto economy. That includes DeFi and NFTs and everything else blockchain. That’s inevitable.</p><p>It should be a good thing, though. It’s validation that crypto is important. Like the legalization of marijuana, it’s also an opportunity for new tax revenues. For investors and developers and entrepreneurs, having regulatory clarity protects their efforts and&nbsp;money.</p><p>Of course, things might get a little messy along the way. Such is the case with really new things that break the rules we thought we understood.</p><p>So where are we with the infrastructure bill and its crypto tax provision, reporting requirements, and overly broad definition of the term “broker?”</p><p>As we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-172-crypto-allies-fail-to-amend-infrastructure-bill-2f4d81e73e55">discussed last week</a>, a compromise amendment was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/senate-compromise-infrastructure-bill">rejected by a lone senator at the final&nbsp;hour</a>.</p><p>Now the bill will go to the House, where the battle&nbsp;resumes.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/treasury-seeks-to-quell-fears-crypto-tax-rules-are-overly-broad?sref=3REHEaVI">Bloomberg reports</a> that the U.S. Treasury will release guidance on the new provision:</p><blockquote>The U.S. Treasury Department is set to clarify that only cryptocurrency companies it considers brokers will need to comply with proposed IRS reporting requirements, aiming to quell concerns over a provision in the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by the&nbsp;Senate.</blockquote><blockquote>Other firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market — from developers and miners to hardware and software providers — won’t have any new requirements, so long as they don’t also act as brokers, according to a Treasury official. The Treasury’s guidance won’t grant blanket exemptions based on how firms identify themselves and instead will focus on whether a firm’s activities qualify it as a broker under the tax code, the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</blockquote><blockquote>The guidance, which could be made public as soon as next week, is an attempt to address concerns in the cryptocurrency industry that the $550 billion infrastructure bill would require a host of companies with ties to digital assets to report data to the Internal Revenue Service that they don’t have. The tax provision, estimated to raise $28 billion over a decade, was included in the legislation as a way to help pay for new investments in roads and&nbsp;bridges.</blockquote><p>Which seems like a positive development. But if you remember, it was also Janet Yellen and the Treasury fighting back against changes to the original wording of the bill. From Yellen’s perspective, that makes sense. Let’s start overly broad, and then release guidance that’s more specific. It allows the Treasury to cover all their bases and the necessary wiggle room if they want to maneuver in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The guidance is also probably a move to help push the bill through the House without as much of a fight. But we’ll see how much this really appeases the crypto community.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/treasury-prepares-crypto-carve-out-from-infrastructure-bills-tax-reporting-provision-report">Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>According to Cornell Law, the U.S. tax code defines a broker&nbsp;as:</blockquote><blockquote>“A) a dealer, (B) a barter exchange, and © any other person who (for a consideration) regularly acts as a middleman with respect to property or services.”</blockquote><blockquote>Treasury is reportedly planning to exempt non-broker parties on a case-by-case basis, a far cry from the more sweeping exemptions the industry had&nbsp;sought.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-senate-sends-infrastructure-bill-to-house">US Senate Sends Infrastructure Bill to House — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/senate-compromise-infrastructure-bill">Lone Senator Rejects Crypto Compromise in Infrastructure Bill — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/senate-fails-to-amend-crypto-tax-provision-in-infrastructure-bill/">Senate Fails to Amend Crypto Tax Provision in Infrastructure Bill — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/sec-brings-and-settles-first-case-in-crypto-linked-defi-sector-11628266336">SEC Brings and Settles First Case in Crypto-Linked DeFi&nbsp;Sector</a>   2. Felix Salmon on crypto regulations <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-50f20bda-46a8-431b-8a64-ae7b8bbd89de.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: SEC chair Gary Gensler — who has taught a course on cryptocurrencies at MIT — gave an important speech last week laying out a maximalist vision for the degree to which his agency can and should regulate the asset&nbsp;class.</blockquote>  FTX, the fastest-growing crypto exchange, last valued at $18 billion, wants to become a regulated stock exchange where stocks can be traded on the blockchain.  Ethereum, the upstart rival to bitcoin, is in the process of moving to a more centralized system that transfers power to the largest holders of the currency, including its founder, Vitalik&nbsp;Buterin.  Stablecoins, which by their nature are inextricably linked to TradFi, or traditional finance, have already started to dominate crypto trading and quell its more anarchic&nbsp;fringes.  <blockquote>How it works: A more regulated system would help solve problems like the difficulty of buying a home using the proceeds of crypto sales, or customers of NBA TopShot being unable to transfer their money to banks, including JPMorgan and Wells&nbsp;Fargo.</blockquote><blockquote>The bottom line: We’re now clearly at the beginning of the end of cryptocurrency as an anarcho-libertarian Utopia.</blockquote>  Most crypto activity continues to take place outside the U.S., often in unregulated (and very risky) venues. But when the U.S. wants to regulate global financial activity, it generally finds it very easy to do&nbsp;so.  <blockquote>Go deeper: Yahoo’s Roger Parloff has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html">a big profile</a> of FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried that examines in much more detail the regulatory tightrope he’s&nbsp;walking.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stablecoin-shakeup-messi-s-crypto-compensation">Stablecoin Shakeup; Messi’s Crypto Compensation</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/daos-vcs-put-6m-behind-governance-startup-tally">DAOs, VCs Put $6M Behind Governance Startup Tally — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/polygons-new-gaming-studio-launches-with-cricket-nft-platform">Polygon’s New Gaming Studio Launches With Cricket NFT Platform — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fortune-raises-over-1-3m-in-nft-of-cover-art-sale">Fortune Raises Over $1.3M in Cover Art NFT Sale — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://gokhshteinmedia.com/2021/08/has-xrp-gone-debit/">Has XRP Gone&nbsp;Debit?</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/ether-burns-hit-100-million-post-eip-1559-activation/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Ether Burns Hit $100 Million Post EIP-1559 Activation — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/neuberger-berman-begins-offering-exposure-to-crypto/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Neuberger Berman Begins Offering Exposure to Crypto — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/cryptocurrency-theft-hackers-steal-600-million-in-poly-network-hack.html">Hackers return nearly half of the $600 million they stole in one of the biggest crypto&nbsp;heists</a>  <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/08/05/locating-stablecoins-within-the-regulatory-perimeter/">Locating Stablecoins within the Regulatory Perimeter</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/113874/tether-new-reserves-report-june-2021-treasury-bills">Tether significantly increased exposure to treasury bills as of&nbsp;June</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-over-defi-opensea-just-overtook-uniswap-on-ethereum-usage">NFTs Over DeFi: OpenSea Just Overtook Uniswap on Ethereum Usage — CoinDesk</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/114189/poly-hack-attacker-return-funds-id-slowmist">Poly Network attacker returns $256 million of the stolen cryptocurrency</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/hackers-steal-over-600m-biggest-in-defi-history/">Hackers Steal Over $600M; Biggest in DeFi History — Blockworks</a>   3.

 Global Crypto Exchanges Begin Phased Deployment of Veriscope: The Decentralized Solution to the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Bridgetown, Barbados, August 17, 2021 — Today, Shyft Core, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.deribit.com/">Deribit</a>, <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/">Bitfinex</a>, <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/">BitMEX</a>, <a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a>, <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/">Huobi </a>and other collaborating Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), announced the launch of <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, a decentralized compliance framework and smart-contract platform for VASPs to enable travel rule compliance.</p><p>Participating exchanges are collectively initiating the phased deployment of Veriscope on the Shyft Network, a decentralized infrastructure designed to aggregate and embed trust, validation and discoverability into data stored on public and private ecosystems.</p><blockquote>“In 2019, the FATF tasked the industry to develop a technical response to the Travel Rule (Recommendation 16). This was no easy task as there are a number of technical challenges to doing so — particularly discovery of who a counterparty VASP is to a transaction. The Veriscope solution provides for an answer to this problem that causes the least customer friction, whilst at the same time respecting data privacy, data consent, and security to the greatest extent.” <br> — Malcolm Wright, Chief Compliance Officer at BitMEX and Chair of the Advisory Council at Global Digital&nbsp;Finance</blockquote><p>Veriscope is the result of a collective effort of some of the largest exchanges (by global volume), set out to collaboratively build <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/introducing-veriscope-a-decentralized-solution-to-the-fatfs-travel-rule-d7f3a0b99245">a decentralized solution for global compliance standards</a>, including the FATF’s Travel Rule guidance. Veriscope was designed, built and programmed to assist exchanges to meet these requirements by facilitating address discoverability, and KYC data exchange without unnecessary exposures of user’s&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“In order to truly make data transmission systems work at the scale of the largest VASPs today, we need open solutions that provide the highest level of security on behalf of our users. Blockchains enable global systems that address coordination while at the same time ensuring auditability across hundreds of countries, millions of users, and billions of transactions. Coming together as a global coalition to deploy this solution ensures the rest of the industry has a unified standard, and an open architecture, to help everyone meet global regulatory requirements. It is our responsibility to give clarity, lead regulatory standardization during this transition phase, while also helping smaller VASPs to define secure data requirements that sit at the forefront of regulatory transformation.” <br> — Jonathan Farnell, Director of Compliance at&nbsp;Binance</blockquote><p>By linking user consent-permissioning with VASP-to-VASP data transmission, Veriscope’s design ensures VASPs can determine the difference between honest transactions and data attacks while maintaining GDPR requirements and a trustless audit trail across counterparties. This coordination architecture eliminates the reliance on centralized trust and long-term reconciliation with counterparty VASPs that may or may not exist in the&nbsp;future.</p><blockquote>“Technology that allows VASPs to distinguish between transfers that are coming from or going to another VASP — solving the discovery problem — fulfills an important role in travel rule compliance. Veriscope’s solution for the discovery problem may be helpful in accelerating travel rule compliance and, as a consequence, the adoption of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions.”<br> — Peter Warrack, CCO of&nbsp;Bitfinex</blockquote><blockquote>“The goal of Veriscope was to design a utility that would enable a decentralized coordination system to address global data transmission requirements. In achieving this goal, Veriscope ensures that VASPs maintain full business sovereignty, determines counterparty requirements cross-jurisdictionally, while maintaining a decentralized system that isn’t owned by any one group of VASPs.”<br> — Joseph Weinberg, Shyft Network Co-founder</blockquote><p>To ensure Veriscope’s success, the participating exchanges also created the <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-launches-the-veriscope-governance-task-force-in-collaboration-with-some-of-the-8d045e7443f3">Veriscope Governance Task Force</a>. Chaired by Rick McDonell, former Executive Secretary to the FATF, and Josee Nadeau, former head of the Canadian delegation to the FATF, the Task Force came together to collaboratively work on governance requirements for counterparty onboarding, information indexing, and Know Your Business&nbsp;(KYB).</p><p>Regarding the Task Force, Rick McDonell said: “all systems require a reliable governance framework and workable operational rules. This is true for both the real world and the virtual world. But while the real world has had a long history of devising systems the virtual world has not. This is especially the case in the transfer of money or value which, with new technologies, allows instant transfers but has not had the balancing rules for compliance with global standards and national regulatory requirements. This is now changing with the launch of the collaborative Veriscope system which bridges the gap between highly efficient technology and the need to provide accurate, timely and protected compliance information.”</p><blockquote>“Deribit is glad to join Veriscope as it offers an important step towards adhering to the Travel Rule requirements, whilst at the same time protecting client sensitive information. Global regulatory standards and requirements are changing and we strongly believe the best approach is a coordinated effort by globally trusted platforms to form a feasible approach and set new sensible standards.”<br> — Jos van Griensven, Head of Legal &amp; Compliance at&nbsp;Deribit</blockquote><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

Eric Newcomer, Chief Technology Officer at WSO2 is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4606" title="Identity Is the New Blue"> The Rise of the Developer in IAM </a>on Monday, September 13 starting at 6:40 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Eric some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>What significant identity projects have you been involved in? </p>
<p>
Well, long time ago, I did an application for Salomon Ski for their warehouse subsidiaries around the world. And for that application - because there was no solution - I had to create my own identity management service. So, I got to know quite well what it takes to do that. And I would never do it again, of course, now that there are such good offerings on the market, I would just buy them. It is much more efficient to have a single solution across a company than have each application person develop their own. But it gave me a great insight into exactly what's needed, what's there, what you have to do, how hard it is to maintain administratively, the overheads, and this kind of thing. So, I had that basic experience of having coded one of these things a long time ago. Then when I joined Citi, about 10 years ago now, we had a very strong identity management function there, which had to do more with identity cards and payment cards than anything else.</p>
<p>But we did go into a sponsored partnership with Microsoft, where we worked with Kim Cameron, who is well known in the industry for his identity thought leadership. And we were working on things around how to decorate or enhance the social login credentials from Facebook and Google and things like that to make them strong enough for banking, which was, I thought a very interesting approach to things. And on top of that, at Citi we had done identity cards for the Department of Defense. This was one of our big contracts, and we were trying to think how could we enhance those cards to have payment information, which gets you into a whole other level of identity management, again, strong enough for banking. And then there was another aspect to this [that] we tried to morph that into, which was for the payments systems [for] social security in Italy to get a proof of life identity. It's another interesting challenge in that area, [we] worked with Microsoft on it a bit. Unfortunately, none of these things ever really came to fruition, but it was a great time, a great background, great education for me on identity management, a great chance to work with one of the leading figures in the field as well.  </p>
<p>And, last but not least, I should just add my recent role at Citi. [My] most recent role was head of security, architecture and strategy for the consumer bank. And there, I got involved in the Google project where we were federating the identity of Google users with Citi users in order to enable this Google Pay application to do banking services. And that was very interesting, not the least of which was the culture difference between what it means to have an identity in the Google world and what it means to have an identity in the banking world, but we did manage to smush those together, and that project should be coming to fruition sometime this year. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When you say “everything is code” what do you mean by that? </p>
<p>
Yes, it's a kind of a catchphrase, I guess you might say, but if you look at the world and you see code becoming greater and greater part of our lives with all these smart devices and smartphones and smart homes and smart cities and cars. You know, Tesla basically reinvented the car as a mobile computer on wheels that happens to be drivable. And you have the internet of things, you have Alexa in your home, you have all of these devices at the edge, you know, the Xbox game statistics doing an amazing job of adding computing at the network edge. So, computers and code is just becoming everywhere and becoming a part of our daily life. So for everything is code, I think in the case of security, it becomes also a mentality, or a kind of a culture change, where we start thinking about how can we do as much in code as possible, since the world is moving to code, and we'll need to have a security code as part of all of these devices and all of these smart things. They need to be secure, perhaps more than ever, because of the proliferation of them and perhaps [because] of the lack of attention on security aspects in the early days of creating these devices and their APIs, and so on.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In what sense is identity management becoming code, and how is that useful? </p>
<p>
I think two main aspects here. One of them is the cloud influence. When you bring an application to the cloud - to Amazon, GCP [Google Cloud Platform], Azure - you don't have an operations department anymore to stand up your infrastructure. [You] use APIs, and this is becoming [a] more and more popular trend because it's also very efficient and creates an ability to automate deployments and automate the provisioning of infrastructure that otherwise we would have had to do manually or ask somebody to do and put in a ticket to change something or so on. So, there's this whole aspect of how can we automate the whole provisioning, management, [and] administration process that's kind of going on, not only in the cloud, but also moving to on-prem as applications become more and more automated, security testing becomes more and more automated, [and] standing up of infrastructure and management of infrastructure becomes more and more automated.  </p>
<p>So, you've got that aspect, and you want to make sure security is a key part of that and works well with all of those trends because security needs to be baked in, right from the beginning, in any of these efforts of moving apps to the cloud, or creating digital solutions, or creating IoT solutions - all of these things. As much as those things are being automated, security needs to be automated as well and the infrastructure and the administration of it. And the other aspect is on the coding part, the code that you need to implement security policies and processes also needs to be made available as external libraries that developers can download and integrate into their projects as seamlessly as possible because a lot of developers don't have a lot of security skills and have trouble, of course, keeping up with all the rapid advancement in the security area where things are evolving almost daily between, you know, new techniques for authentication and authorization, new attack surfaces, new ways to protect APIs, [and] new attacks on APIs.   </p>
<p>It's very hard for developers to keep up with all of that, and still deliver the business functionality they are meant to deliver. And this creates in some cases, and we saw this at Citi fairly clearly when I was running the security architecture team, that developers sometimes would not want to pay much attention to security until it was too late. It’s a very common thing, and we we'd have to review projects and say, no, you haven't done your encryption correctly. You don't have your authentication done to Citi standards. You cannot go to production. And they would get very angry with us, of course, because they want to please their business sponsors, go to production, meet their deadlines. We just wanted them to think about security from the beginning so we wouldn't end up in this kind of position. And some of the people would, but having the security libraries and security capabilities available as code makes it easier, and helps break down some of these traditional barriers between the security teams and the application development teams. </p>   
<p>So that you can say to them, here, just take these pre-built libraries, these policy definitions, and implement the company standards. Please include them in your development process as early as possible. Make sure you have the automated testing so you can test those APIs for the correct authentication, authorization capabilities and policies, check all the vulnerabilities, put in the code scanning, put in the container scanning - everything in the pipeline. So, there's this whole process of getting into the coding process, the modern coding automation processes with pre-built security code, security tools, and getting that “shifting left” is one of the terms for it - as much as possible. And to help do that, we want to provide as much of the security capabilities and policies in code as possible.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can organizations ensure that IAM code is wherever it is needed, when its needed, and that it is automated like any other code? </p>
<p>
Well, as I was previously saying, the “security as code” trend, provides a lot of code that's available in library form for handling things such as identity access management, and that in particular, is a specialization of the security as code trend, where it’s becoming more available from different vendors, from industry sources, from open source libraries -  that a lot of the code that you need to include in your applications, mobile apps, web apps, internet of things apps, is available as a downloadable library. So, what you want to do is make sure when you're doing your development, that you identify the library specific to identity access management functionality, and for policies, that you need to include in your code chain as you're building it out and as you're testing it. Another important aspect of this, is to make sure you have automated tests, especially for the identity of APIs, for example, which can be a real vulnerability.   </p>
<p>When you publish APIs, you need to have a strong identity, and that needs to be tested as well as part of the identity access management as code capability. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can attendees of EIC expect in your presentation? </p>
<p>
I'm really looking forward to EIC and to talk. I'll talk about the topics we mentioned today, and go into more detail about how exactly it can be done so that we can improve time to market, which is a critical thing. Sometimes you have this problem where security is not baked in, and you can't really put it in very well at the end. How do we avoid that problem? How can we shift left? How can we include the code in our pipelines? How can we ensure we have the right levels of testing? In other words, it's kind of the bits and bytes of the mechanics of doing this kind of thing, as well as just covering the concepts in a bit more detail.   </p>
<p>What does it mean to think about security as code, in particular for the IAM space? And so we've got the conceptual, how do you think about it? How do you do it? And then with a particular focus on being productive and getting that code to market with as few hurdles as possible, avoid those security guys saying no, get the time to market productivity for those APIs and for those digital transformation projects, as smooth as possible, while relying as much on security as code, IAM as code, as possible. Why [to]do it and how to do it. </p>

<p>Diagnostic is a series of essays and hosted conversations exploring the challenges of building more inclusive digital economies. For hosted (virtual) conversations, like the one described below, Caribou Digital convenes a diverse set of experts and thought leaders with unique insights on an issue and gives them the opportunity to explore a topic together. The conversation here occurred in June 2021 and included investment officers from large foundations as well as thematic experts and employees from multilateral and bi-lateral donor organizations. The conversation was private to facilitate open exchange so the following is an edited summary of key themes and not attributed to any participant.</p><p>The conversation we discuss here was kicked off by reviewing a post called “<a href="https://medium.com/dfs-lab/fortune-at-the-middle-of-the-pyramid-3a6886eb97f3">Fortune at the Middle of the Pyramid</a>” that uses high-resolution income and consumption data to understand opportunities and limitations of various for-profit investment strategies in sub-Saharan Africa. While that post focused more on private sector concerns, in the Diagnostic discussion we tried to understand the implications for aid, government, and donor policy (i.e. the “development sector”).</p><p>A large set of impact investor, international donor, and government anti-poverty policy is based on the notion that for-profit companies can be induced to serve the poor with life changing services like banking or schooling but the limits of the for profit model are not always taken into&nbsp;account</p><p>According to the <a href="https://thegiin.org/research/publication/impinv-survey-2020.">Global Impact Investor Network (GINN)</a>, there was $715B USD under management by global impact investors in 2019. The majority of the investors surveyed are targeting market-rate returns and attempting to improve the lives of low-income people as their primary impact. This is to say that most of them believe they can help low-income populations by investing in for-profit companies who serve them or their communities with some kind of good or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Beyond the impact investing sector, there is a much broader set of development actors (donors, governments, and other aid organizations) whose strategies implicitly or explicitly embody a similar belief — that with proper support, the private sector will serve low income people with products and services that improve their lives in meaningful ways and thus help them out of&nbsp;poverty.</p><p>Identifying the limits to this kind of for-profit model is thus quite important for a large number of impact investing and development strategies. In this Diagnostic, we summarize our research and the discussion of our panel of experts around the question of whether the poor can be a profitable market segment. This is a necessary condition for for-profit companies to want to serve the poor at&nbsp;all.</p><p>African data showing the shape of consumer purchasing power at different levels of income shows that the largest segment of consumers below $2 per day control only a small fraction of total purchasing power</p><p>The main data source we are going to look at is PovCalNet, a decades old project by the World Bank to compile comparable measures of income and consumption across countries. Using detailed household surveys, PovCalnet attempts to estimate daily consumption per adult in each household.</p><p>The example depicted above shows how we used this data to calculate the height of the below curve at each point along the x-axis. The height is the amount of discretionary spending power wielded by the entire population at each level of consumption (total income * y % which is discretionary * total number of people at this income). Thus, we believe this amount is a good proxy for spending power (and thus for the size of the market opportunity) for non-food, non-essential goods. (We address food and essentials below.)</p><p>Adding in realistic cost to acquire and serve low income customers shows most of the poor to be unviable as customers</p><p>Importantly, we can see that aggregate discretionary spending is relatively small — below $3/day — despite the fact that the majority of the population live at this level. Their incomes are low and spent almost entirely on necessities. The graph peaks around $4–$6, which is where the smaller number of people is best offset by higher income. Beyond that, everyone gets richer rapidly, but the population numbers fall even faster than income rises — thus absolute spending power falls. Interestingly, the spending power (calculated as the area under the curve) of the consumers in the $5–$10 band of income (which comprise only ~10% of the population) is about double that of the $0–$4/day group (which comprise&nbsp;~85%).</p><p>This is the key observation of the analysis — this dynamic will create strong incentives to push for-profit companies to serve the much smaller group in the $5–$10+ band. This is especially true to the extent that product developers must make a trade-off and tailor their products to be more attractive to one group and less attractive to the other. (There are very few universal products;most must be tailored and thus a trade-off must be&nbsp;made)</p><p>Curves in this figure represent the total disposable income net of cost to acquire and serve where hypothetical costs increase from curve 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).</p><p>Lowering the cost of acquisition and distribution is&nbsp;key!</p><p>So far we’ve only considered spending figures — for-profit actors care about profits, so we have to consider customer acquisition costs as well as the cost of goods sold. Factoring these costs into the equation changes the picture quite a bit, as seen in the curves above. As costs rise, some consumers at the very lowest end will become infeasible (i.e. even if we captured all their discretionary spending, which is nearly impossible, the cost to acquire and serve would still be higher.) Also, the peak of the curve will shift to higher income brackets for two reasons. Not only is there more money, but also it is distributed across fewer people, so the cost to acquire a dollar of discretionary spending is assumed lower. In the graph above, we can see that the peak goes from $5 to closer to $20 as costs rise and the area under the curve (the total potential market value) shrinks dramatically.</p><p>Another way to look at this graph is in reverse — any entrepreneur that can design distribution models that dramatically lower cost to acquire and serve will create huge market value and make many more people feasible as customers (perhaps there are government or donor investments that can also have this&nbsp;effect).</p> From the Diagnostic conversation: <p>There may be business models that can serve populations despite a lack of significant purchasing power and thus show promise as poverty alleviation strategies based in the private&nbsp;sector</p><p>The financial inclusion field is one area of development policy that seeks to identify for-profit delivery models for services that will benefit low-income consumers. One area of discussion centered on the kinds of financial services models that could be successful. One observation was that this logic essentially rules out savings-based models, as they depend almost entirely on discretionary income and tend to have high acquisition costs due to most people’s low urgency for savings. An exception might be the voluntary savings circles, but most participants actually see those as credit. Insurance seems to suffer a similar fate. The very basic package of P2P remittances, bill payments, and credit that has become the standard mobile money offering seems to be pretty close to what is sustainable for lower-income populations. This is partly because these products are high-margin due to the degree of need and can almost be seen as necessities (sending money or borrowing it in an emergency can be very urgent&nbsp;needs).</p><p>The discussion also touched on products (like airtime or fast moving consumer goods) that can be sold as individual package pricing where profit is guaranteed at the level of the individual sale. Because there is no risk of acquiring a customer that is unprofitable, producers of these services are likely to be more open to serving the poor and see them as a limited but potentially profitable subsegment.</p><p>Finally, the group discussed cross-subsidy models (like Facebook) where a richer segment of the user population can cross-subsidize unprofitable lower-income users. <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-land-where-facebook-loses-money-d850c6593f70">Caribou Digital’s analysis of Facebook users</a> in the developing world shows that while Facebook makes lots of money on users in North America, Europe, and Latin America, they likely lose money on users in Africa and a few other parts of the world where user discretionary income is too low. Thus advertisers are not willing to pay the premiums they are willing to pay elsewhere (very much in-line with this analysis indicating they have low discretionary income), and lower-quality devices and constrained usage patterns make them harder to serve. We estimate that Facebook loses something like a dollar a year on hundreds of millions of users in the developing world. But because Facebook’s revenues are tens of billions of USD per year, these losses are likely considered a cost of doing business when running a global platform that benefits from the network effects of having everyone on board. But this strategy depends on the money-losing population of users being a relatively small fraction of the total user base, and one where the total losses are limited. Thus, outside of the handful of massive global platforms where this applies, cross-subsidy models are not a feasible way to serve the population below the poverty line with digital services.</p><p>Very low-cost acquisition models might also break this logic, at least to the extent they assure the population in the $4–$8/day range are feasible as customers. Finally, models focusing on selling food and daily necessities also have potential, as shown below. There was some excitement about models that focus on agriculture value chains as a perennial development sector that has recently seen more activity from new technology startups. It was noted that the development sector has not paid as much attention to models focusing on small business supplier marketplaces and last-mile logistics even though they often have necessities and food at the core — perhaps because they have mostly focused in urban areas to&nbsp;date.</p> Focusing on models that deliver food and basic necessities helps expand the opportunity for the private sector, but it is still an uphill&nbsp;battle. <p>The above analysis assumes that most companies are creating services that target discretionary expenditures. Above we show the same curve when we include all expenditures, including primary necessities like food. When considering basic necessities, we now see a much larger market and one where the peak of consumer spending power is at a lower level of income — now in the $2–$5 range. This comports with the “Bottom of the Pyramid” argument that there is significant spending power among the lower income populations when it comes to food, and other primary necessities. Nevertheless, we still show relatively limited aggregate spending power for the large group of people who live on less than $2/day, which biases the for-profit sector to higher incomes. Most digital and technology powered models do not focus on necessities, but we believe there is significant scope to do&nbsp;so.</p> What are the key takeaways from this&nbsp;data?   Purely B2C models that seek to sell discretionary goods or services directly to low-income African households are unlikely to be profitable due to low discretionary income and the relatively high costs of acquiring and serving customers.  The largest block of discretionary income is in the hands of the population who live at $4-$8/day. These folks are not formally poor by global development standards.  With realistic acquisition costs factored in, the incentive is more often to target $10+/day, which represents only about 5% of the population in most of&nbsp;Africa.   From the Diagnostic conversation: <p>Two conclusions for the wider implications of impact investing and the poor as a profitable market&nbsp;segment</p>  You can’t spend your way out of poverty — you have to increase&nbsp;income!  <p>One area the group went into in some depth was whether models that increase income could break the logic above. Digital services that include remittances, gig work platforms, marketplaces where SMEs can be sellers, and productive lending all potentially increase income and thus don’t depend as much on the initial income of the user (in fact, they increase it). We believe these models should be pursued aggressively by the development sector to the extent it can be shown any of these models increase welfare along with increasing income (many rigorous studies within the microcredit sector have not shown increases in welfare from productive lending, for example, despite the narrative that they were a way for low income people to pull themselves out of poverty).</p><p>2. The development sector could use a strategic repositioning from financial inclusion towards digital livelihoods</p><p>Some of the participants noted a trend of development actors pivoting away from financial inclusion as an example of a strategy focusing on delivering a service via for-profit providers to low-income populations. As one participant noted: “We did focus groups at some point and financial services was never anything the poor asked for. They ask over and over for jobs and ways to increase income.” So that participant’s organization is now more focused on broader financial sector development that will lead to increased economic growth and therefore jobs.</p><p>The group noted a number of development actors who had undergone similar strategic repositionings towards digital livelihoods or jobs. Often the repositioning was towards digital livelihoods, including platform marketplaces where people can go to find gig work (e.g. Uber, Gojek, Upwork) or seller marketplaces (e.g. Alibaba, Jumia) or a wider range of informal digital livelihoods (MSMEs who transact over WhatsApp or Facebook). Many of these opportunities are new and seem to present significant opportunities, though the potential downsides of the digital platform economy are also important to understand. Caribou Digital maintains a site with a trove of research and references in this new area called <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">Platform Livelihoods</a> and DFS Lab has looked at the Indonesian landscape in this area&nbsp;<a href="https://dfslab.net/our-research/">here</a>.</p><p>Finally, there was some discussion about what would be difficult about such a transition for many donors. Even if it does turn out livelihoods have a better business model and are what people actually want, it can be hard for donors to move in this direction. Since livelihoods cut across sectors, donors will need to understand multiple sectors at once, as well as the fast-moving dynamics of digital platform economies. It can also be more nuanced because dealing with digital platforms has potential positives and negatives where data privacy, working conditions, and the general balance of power is tilted in favor of platforms in setting the terms of engagement with workers or sellers. These nuances can be hard to navigate. For donors and governments it is relatively easy to defend giving a digital savings account, and harder to justify demanding gig-work with relatively low wages (even if this is clearly something that the workers benefit immensely from and want because it improves their&nbsp;lives).</p> What do we take away from this exercise? <p>This data helps quantify some of the key reasons most startups and technology companies as well as more traditional corporations target only a relatively small subset of the population at the higher end of the income spectrum in&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>In doing so, it also calls into question the notion that funding innovation or subsidizing the private sector in other ways will result in reaching the lower-income population. Realistic levels of customer acquisition costs may make much of this population unprofitable to serve regardless of the model or the technology. And, even if they are feasible, for-profit models will almost always be pushed by incentives to focus their marketing on the population above key global poverty line measures (e.g. $1.90 or $3.10) and potentially even try to discourage lower income people from using their services (especially if the total cost to acquire and serve make those people unprofitable).</p><p>In light of this logic, one of the areas our group identified as high potential for further research and donor intervention was digital livelihoods which give people a chance to improve their income directly. We hope to see more work in this area down the&nbsp;road.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/what-are-the-limits-of-the-private-sector-in-serving-the-poor-3ee9a9a468fc">What are the limits of the private sector in serving the poor?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is a guest post featuring Vadim Slavin, director of the credentials platform at GlobaliD.</p><p>“So what is your digital trust halo?” — you ask. It is the combination of different traits and qualities of your digital footprint comprising your digital identity.</p><p>“Can you be more&nbsp;… umm… clear?” I’ll&nbsp;try.</p>Image: James St.&nbsp;Louis Your trust halo is the amount of trust others attribute to your identity&nbsp;online. <p>Consider a Facebook profile requesting access to your Facebook group. The profile was created yesterday and already has 300 friends. Take a look at another one. It was created 11 years ago and has a long history of Facebook posts, friends commenting on its feed, and a carefully curated album of travels around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Both of these are someone’s identities. Which of these will you trust more? You instinctively assess the trust halo of each profile/identity to answer this question.</p><p>So how can we distill this instinctive measure into a formulated approach?</p><p>Consider the following 7 attributes which help determine the size of the trust halo of your digital identity. As you read about these, think about your own identity, digital or not, and how these concepts apply to&nbsp;it.</p> Community. <p>From the early days of human collectivization, the participation in a community has been a great indication of trust. A new member of the tribe would not be trusted as much as older&nbsp;members.</p><p>A smaller community enables greater visibility and transparency. Collectively, members of the community who know us well can vouch for us and can quickly call out behavior not typically attributed to us. One can suppose that in a digital community, the longer you stay a part of it, the longer the members&nbsp;… tolerate your presence, the more trust one can attribute to your&nbsp;persona.</p><p>Of course it all depends on each particular case:</p>  how long you have been a&nbsp;member  how reputable the group&nbsp;is  how selective the group was to admit&nbsp;you  how engaged you have been to be visible to the group (see&nbsp;below)   Engagement. <p>The collective reputation of the community will influence your trust halo more if you are an active member of this community. This means that engagement and visibility will greatly enhance the trust attributed to your presence in this community (see&nbsp;below).</p> Leadership. <p>The ultimate measure of trust transferable to your identity is whether you actually started the community which others consider reputable. Have you heard of a fella by the name of Brian Epstein [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Beatle">ref</a>]? Would you ever trust the management of your band to this guy? Now look him up. How about&nbsp;now?</p> Reputation. <p>Perhaps nothing is more synonymous with trust than reputation. It is easier to earn reputation through engagement and leadership in a community. Reputation speaks not only about who vouches for you, it is also about what you have done. Perhaps it’s the predictions you made that came true, or maybe it’s the people you helped that are grateful or the length of time you kept your reputation unspoiled.</p> Vouches. <p>What is the best way to represent your reputation? Get vouched by someone who has a great deal of it themselves. Part of that reputation may just rub off on you. But be careful, negative reputation is transferable via a vouch as&nbsp;well.</p> Investment. <p>Yes, you can invest in your identity—curate it, build your reputation over time, avoid unnecessary confrontation and backlashes, and protect it from takeover by malicious actors. You have a LinkedIn account for 10 years with a healthy pattern of recommendations? There is more trust in whether this account is real. Why? Because you showed proof of&nbsp;work!</p> Verifications. <p>Last but not least — verifications. What can you prove about yourself or what others, trusted by the community, can prove about you. Have a real passport verified? It matches your verified driver’s license and a selfie you just took? What if you can verify that the face on the passport matches the face most commonly found on your account’s pictures? Now we’re&nbsp;talking.</p><p>Can you be trusted not to say mean things online? Not directly, but hey, if you value your identity, if you built a reputation and invested in your digital footprint, you are more likely to be a good guy with your real information verified rather than a bad&nbsp;actor.</p><p>Final thoughts. No single factor will influence your trust halo. Just like there isn’t a single definition of trust — it’s in the eye of beholder. Trusting someone to predict the rise and fall of the XRP isn’t the same as trusting someone not to pretend to be someone else. And yet, you can’t help but score each identity you come across online according to some formula. Just like everyone else does to&nbsp;you.</p><p>Have any notes on how you manage YOUR trust halo? Share! Remember, participation counts.&nbsp;:)</p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/veeslavin">Vadim on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/what-determines-your-digital-trust-halo-6448e2095fd2">What determines your digital trust halo?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Inroads are made and celebrated and then a paradigm shift halts progress. Think about when the world got internet-connected mobile devices. Suddenly we were more connected than ever and less private than ever. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart home devices and artificial intelligence (AI) are today’s paradigm shifts. Data is proliferating at mind-boggling speeds—we generate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-5?aid=ogsm072517_1&amp;sf100871281=1">2.5 quintillion bytes of data</a>&nbsp;a day, and created&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/?sh=3a2c926060ba">90 percent</a>&nbsp;of the world’s data in the past two years.&nbsp;The data privacy issue is now discussed in terms of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">crisis</a>.</p>



<p>A 2020&nbsp;<a>report</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;The Brookings Institution’s Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology (AIET) Initiative says,&nbsp;“As artificial intelligence evolves, it magnifies the ability to use personal information in ways that can intrude on privacy interests by raising analysis of personal information to new levels of power and speed.”</p>



<p>And then we have the human factor. Despite knowing the risks to their privacy and safety from leaving their&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>&nbsp;unchecked, many consumers fail to take any sort of remedial action (such as using&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>).&nbsp;This is known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404818303031">privacy paradox</a>, that disconnect between&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer concerns</a>&nbsp;about privacy and their actual actions to protect it. Users can make all sorts of other privacy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/human-error-cybersecurity-stats/">missteps</a>&nbsp;too, like falling for phishing and other scams, failing to properly secure accounts with strong and unique passwords and 2FA, mishandling sensitive corporate information, and using unsecured Wi-Fi networks. As long as humans are fallible, a comprehensive privacy solution will remain elusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020 we made some optimistic but cautionary&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">predictions</a>&nbsp;for privacy out to 2030. We believe the next eight or nine years can bring step change towards a brighter privacy future, but a neat package of solutions tied with a bow, not so much. Any one of the factors at play—</p>



  the data collecting machines and the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">business models</a>&nbsp;driving them  consumer rights and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">expectations</a>  <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">regulatory advancements</a>  <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">criminal activity</a>  corporate social responsibility  the rise of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/07/the-business-benefits-from-using-decentralized-identity-technologies-for-customer-identity-management/">decentralized identities</a>  ongoing fallout from&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/businesses-face-rising-cybersecurity-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>  



<p>—could change the privacy game at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>No privacy system is perfect. That’s the basis of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;as a data (and military) protection strategy: no system is perfect, breaches are always possible, so it’s wise to manage the risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So long as change is constant, humans are humans, and capitalism is alive and well, the privacy problem can never be fully solved. And with no airtight privacy solution in sight, consumers won’t have much choice but to protect their own data privacy. Risks to privacy and safety will increasingly become the cost of admission to the digital landscape. And&nbsp;tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and the capabilities in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, our business toolkit for rapidly deploying branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions, will thus become essential.</p>

			 DeFi vs Regulation: Round One<br>
 
<p>Due to their decentralized nature, the crypto and DeFi markets have always been complicated subjects when it comes to legislation.</p>
<p>It is currently becoming a big mess: in the last few months, we have seen legislators in Europe, and more recently in the US, struggling to bring compliance and control in the space, mostly because they are trying to regulate wallets like bank accounts. Let me tell you: it is not going to work that way. Blockchain participants are not financial institutions and the information is either private or public, for all participants. If a law is not applicable, I guess it loses its meaning at some point.</p>
<p>Debates about the Infrastructure Bill in the US are really fun (and scary) to follow because the capabilities of the technology are not considered at all. How could blockchain participants declare to the IRS if they don’t know who their counterparties are? In the same way, discussions about MiCA and new rules for AML in Europe are going in the wrong direction. Why? Because wallets are actually browsers for the internet of value, not vaults. Controlling your own wallet (as a sole owner of the private key) doesn’t prevent other parties from sending tokens to you, or even taking them back! Wallets don’t contain the tokens, they are just access points. What if someone else (person or smart contract) has access as well?</p>
<p>So, what is the solution? The answer is simple: identities on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Let’s dream about a secure system to identify investors, agents, assets, and things on the blockchain. This system would ensure the confidentiality of data, and at the same time, ensure the eligibility of the identity owners for the permissioned tokens or permissioned DeFi protocols they want to use. One or several wallets could be connected to each onchain identity. It would act as a compliance layer on top of wallets.</p>
<p>The good news is that we have made this system, it’s called <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/">ONCHAINID</a>. It is already used for the management of €8B+ of tokenized compliant and controllable securities on public blockchain networks.</p>
<p>ONCHAINID is a blockchain-based identity system that allows users to create and manage self-sovereign identities on DLT. This identification solution allows the enforcement of regulatory legal and other compliance processes and rules on digital assets or on any other web-based system that requires identity validation. The main added value of ONCHAINID is that it enables compliance and identity verifications within the pseudonymous framework of public blockchain networks.</p>

<p>Requirements for identity verification to travel across borders or enter amenities is an everyday fact of life. Whether you’re collecting cinema tickets or hopping on a plane, you will be required to provide some kind of identification. As the world begins to see progress in its fight against COVID-19, debates are abounding about the next level of identification and the benefits of vaccination passports, as proof that an individual has been inoculated against the virus. In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56812293">Denmark</a> zoos, theme parks and other attractions have reopened with requirements for vaccination passes as verification upon entry. Elsewhere, the European Union is reportedly developing a digital green certificate to permit citizens who have been vaccinated to travel freely among its member nations. In the United States, individual states will decide how they want to police vaccination, while elsewhere in the developing world, countries are still fighting the brutal virus and have yet to consider what a recovery plan will look&nbsp;like.</p><p>There is much controversy around the topic. While many have questioned the right of governments to promote vaccination plans in this way, others have questioned the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/covid-vaccine-passports-health-experts-are-deeply-concerned.html">fairness</a> in requiring them when less wealthy countries may be unable to commit to significant vaccine plans at this point. At this stage though, in order to ensure the swift recovery of the global economy, plans must be put in place that will help the world to reopen in a safe and secure manner. There is huge pent up demand for air travel, with a recent study by <a href="https://www.redpointglobal.com/press-releases/67-of-consumers-frustrated-by-travel-industrys-messaging-throughout-the-pandemic/">Redpoint Global </a>showing that nearly half of vaccinated Americans plan to travel this summer. Vaccination passports will play a part in these plans and they must be administered in the right way in order to ensure we aren’t taking away one problem and creating&nbsp;another.</p><p>The options for verification vary greatly. In Denmark for example, as well as using QR codes and identification features to allow holders to enter public spaces, they will accept paper verification, while in Iceland they are accepting American travelers who can produce ‘vaccination cards’. The risks of physical passes are strong; they are highly susceptible to forgery and much easier to copy than digital entities. The innate value of a COVID-19 passport is high, meaning that criminals will be incentivized to forge and sell fakes or stolen ones on the black market. A recent event in I<a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/covid-vaccine-scam-texts-and-calls-5376336-Mar2021/">reland</a>, whereby scammers used fake vaccination appointment calls to steal sensitive personal information, reflected how criminals are on the lookout for opportunities to use the current crisis as a means to conduct illicit activity, make money and steal personal information. In order to ensure their ability to do so is limited we must look to digital identity solutions.</p><p>That isn’t to say that digital solutions don’t have their flaws. Covid-19 tracker apps and online vaccination passports pose inherent safety risks. Placing public health information onto large internal databases requires individuals to have significant trust in the parties they are sharing their information with. Unless controlled properly, users will be required to hand over significant amounts of data to third parties, with little oversight of how it is being used and who is controlling it. Recently, tech giant Microsoft offered its technologies to assist with the vaccination program in the United States. While its resources are significant, there are inherent moral and technological risks associated with involving a massive conglomerate into public health matters, as they may become privy to highly sensitive public health information.</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions offer an ideal solution to the data privacy and identity risks associated with COVID-19 passports and other verification methods. End-to-end solutions that run on blockchain enable private information to be shared securely, while users remain in full control of their data. Growing privacy concerns, as exasperated by intricate global supply chains and the challenges of the pandemic, mean that we must look to decentralized identity and blockchain technology to help us manage the huge swathes of sensitive information necessary to keep the world open. Reflecting its faith in the benefits of using blockchain for COVID-19 passports, the state of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nys-blockchain-based-covid-19-passport-is-now-live">New York</a> recently launched a blockchain passport built in conjunction with IBM. Using this technology, the passport allows individuals’ information to exist on the platform but requires them to give verification to anyone trying to access it. Its immutable format means that third parties involved in the platform, such as IBM, will not be able to access or see this sensitive information.</p><p>In essence, blockchain ensures that data remains immutable, secure and cannot be edited or (to some extent) copied. Using this technology, hospitals will be able to upload vaccine statuses and health information, but only the owner (i.e the person who is vaccinated), will be able to give access to the data, making it inherently compliant with GDPR and other regulatory requirements. These solutions can be integrated onto any platform, while remaining decentralized and secure. This therefore makes it possible for different applications and unconnected jurisdictions to use the same function despite using different platforms. It is important to note that individuals must also take responsibility for protecting their sensitive data by investing in decentralized identity solutions. Through these technologies, users can securely manage their digital identity by storing it on a phone or on a trusted cloud storage with a private key that grants access to the verified user&nbsp;only.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>Introduction<br>
Why not take the best practices from a real world National Digital ID ecosystem that is live and thriving? In today’s episode, we dive into what’s happening within the Digital ID landscape within Europe. Sebastian Manhart is very well positioned between policy and technology in the European Union. In this episode of SSI Orbit, he shares his experiences and future projections.</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 How it all started: Estonia’s 2014 Digital ID program. 
 What’s happening in SSI within Germany today – how Germany moved from being a tech laggard to an innovator within 1 year. 
 The recent Germany &amp; Spain announcement 
 How the Public and Private sector need to work together to achieve adoption of SSI. 
 Does overregulation kill technology progress? How are EU countries working around that? 
 Regulations in EU that are important for Digital ID (eIDAS, EBSI, GDPR). 
 The Digital Wallet Landscape and future projections.

Collators are located in orange coloured&nbsp;areas.<p>13 August 2021, Berlin — KILT Protocol today announced the selection of the first 16 collators that will comprise the Initial Collators Programme. This cohort represents a distributed network of collators from around the world who are well known in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems.</p><p>The number of active collators will gradually increase to 75 after KILT’s mainnet launch, and become permissionless as the network matures. The Initial Collators include:</p>  <a href="https://botlabs.org/">BOTLabs GmbH</a>,&nbsp;Germany  B.T.E BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH,&nbsp;Germany  Canontech, Switzerland  <a href="https://twitter.com/__c0d3">Cody King</a> of Codenode, Canada  <a href="http://www.dwellir.com/">Dwellir AB</a>,&nbsp;Sweden  <a href="https://galaniprojects.de/">galaniprojects GmbH</a>,&nbsp;Germany  <a href="https://zcloak.network/">Glacier Blockchain Technology Co.</a>, Ltd.,&nbsp;China  <a href="https://martin222.medium.com/">Martin</a>, Germany  Pacobits of <a href="https://stakely.io/">Stakely</a>,&nbsp;Spain  Petr of <a href="https://polkadotters.medium.com/">Polkadotters</a>, Czech&nbsp;Republic  Shez of <a href="https://www.staking4all.org/">Staking4All</a>, South&nbsp;Africa  Skedley, Germany  <a href="https://stakenode.medium.com">STAKENODE</a>, Poland  <a href="https://stakin.com/home">Stakin</a>, Estonia  Tjwelde, Germany  Yarco Hayduk of <a href="http://pragma-invest.com/">Pragma Ventures</a>, Ukraine  <p>KILT’s mainnet will launch after it secures a Kusama parachain slot. As mentioned in our earlier <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilts-parachain-plans-an-update-efb9a9e35394">blog post</a>, KILT’s parachain will include staking and our <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-token-economy-an-update-db207611f5ce">initial token economy</a> at launch. This means the first phase of staking will be possible on KILT from&nbsp;genesis.</p><p>To prepare for KILT’s launch, we selected and onboarded this first group of collators over recent weeks. In the near future we anticipate the number of collators will be gradually increased to 75 active collators, with a possible maximum of 150 collators (active and candidates). Collator selection will become permissionless when decided by governance, after the Sudo key is removed and KILT is decentralised.</p> Collator and Delegator Framework <p>Kusama uses a Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) system, with validators securing the Relay Chain and validating blocks. KILT uses a modified version of DPoS called <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48">Limited Delegated Proof of Stake</a> (LDPoS). In this system, collator nodes hold the data of the blockchain, collect transactions and build&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Delegators can choose a collator to back with their stake, thus increasing the total stake on that collator. One collator can have a maximum of 25 delegators backing them, where delegators with higher stakes for one collator displace delegators with smaller amounts at stake for the same collator.</p><p>Block rewards go to the collator who produces an actual block, and their delegators. By putting their stake on a collator, delegators signal their trust in quality performers. As recognition for bootstrapping and maintaining the system, the delegator rewards are higher in the first years and then decrease as&nbsp;follows:</p>  At the start, collators receive rewards up to 10% per annum on their stake from the first year. The reward rate decreases by 2% per year (which would mean that in the second year, the rewards will be up to 9.8% per&nbsp;annum).  Delegators receive rewards up to 8% per annum on their stake in the first year, 6% in the second year. From the beginning of the third year there will be no reward for delegators, as it is anticipated that by then other KILT functions will be in place that will provide opportunities for token holders to support the system and earn&nbsp;rewards.  <p>We chose this LDPoS mechanism as part of a carefully-considered token economy that aims to have relatively low inflation, starting at 5% and decreasing to 1% within the first 6 years and slowly moving to 0% afterwards.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials for Web 3.0. KILT enables innovative business models around identity and privacy, addressing the need for reliable identity solutions in the digital world. It allows users to claim personal attributes, have them attested by trusted entities, and store the claims as self-sovereign credentials. KILT Protocol is developed by BOTLabs GmbH in Berlin and is the technology on which SocialKYC, a decentralised identity verification service, is&nbsp;built.</p><p>Press contacts:</p><p>Christine Mohan, christine@kilt.io</p><p>Elisa Dratsdrummer, elisa@kilt.io</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-first-cohort-of-kilts-initial-collators-programme-4e4b65159246">Announcing First Cohort of KILT’s Initial Collators Programme</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The first in a series of articles on Ontology’s contribution to the coming Web 3.0&nbsp;era. <p>From how we communicate with one another, to how we work, to how we consume entertainment and acquire knowledge, the internet has pervaded practically every aspect of our lives. The internet’s rise has coincided with a corresponding rise in the influence of what has become known as “Big Tech”, a collection of technology companies responsible for the online platforms and services we use on a daily basis. These companies created platforms that attracted millions (in some cases, billions) of users. In order to use such platforms, users are required to provide information in the form of email addresses, phone numbers, etc. The tech companies discovered that they could monetize these data points by using them to create targeted advertisements and also by selling them to third-parties.</p><p>The current Web 2.0 world has come to represent the era of “Big Data”, a world in which users provide private data to centralized tech platforms that utilize the data to enrich themselves. In essence, these “free” platforms have transformed their users into a kind of product. You, the user, have very little (if any) control over how your data is utilized once it is shared with a given tech platform. And since it is stored on a centralized platform, it is prone to hacking. Numerous data breaches have occurred in recent years, exposing the private information of millions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>We are currently in a transition phase between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. The Web 3.0 era promises a world in which we are no longer at the mercy of centralized platforms. It is a decentralized world; one that will allow people to reclaim ownership and control over their private&nbsp;data.</p> What is Web&nbsp;3.0? <p>There are different opinions on what Web 3.0 is with no clear definition. The “Semantic Web”, “Global Brain”, and “IoE” proposed by Tim Berners-Lee still seems out of reach. According to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte</a>’s 2019 report on The Spatial Web, compared with Web 2.0, the era of Web 3.0 will undergo qualitative changes at three levels: interaction, computation, and information.</p>Source: Deloitte analysis adapted from Gabriel René and Dan Mapes, The Spatial Web: How Web 3.0 Will Connect Humans, Machines, and AI to Transform the World (Amazon,&nbsp;2019).<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=70aa418758df">Forbes</a>, the rise of technologies such as distributed ledgers and storage on blockchain will allow for data decentralization and create a transparent and secure environment. This helps to address the centralized Internet quandary described above. When users are able to control their data (and decide who can access it) independently, centralized platforms will be unable to covertly harvest private data. In addition to improving privacy, this should also help prevent data breaches, as the data will no longer be stored on centralized servers. In sum, Web 3.0 puts the power back in the hands of users, bidding farewell to the data hegemony and data exploitation of the centralized platforms.</p><p>Ontology, a blockchain for self-sovereign identity and data, is helping bring about the Web 3.0 era. Thanks to Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, ONT ID, netizens no longer need to place their trust in centralized platforms. If a person needs to verify aspects of his identity online, he can do so knowing that his data remains private and secure. Right now, individuals unknowingly provide huge swaths of data to centralized platforms that store it on centralized servers. Ontology enables users to create a decentralized identity that they can carry with them and utilize across multiple platforms. Decentralized identity is a core pillar of the coming Web 3.0 infrastructure and Ontology is poised to provide the tools necessary to facilitate the transition away from Web 2.0, characterized by centralized data platforms, and towards the decentralized and open Web 3.0&nbsp;era.</p> Web 3 and&nbsp;Ontology <p>Compared with the current Web 2.0 landscape characterized by centralized platforms that store and monetize user data, Web 3.0 represents a more open, transparent, and decentralized future. Blockchain has been an open and collaborative project from the very beginning. When Ethereum emerged, it was known for its neutrality, open source, and programmability, and thus became one of the largest and most active blockchain communities in the world. The blockchain industry still needs time to mature if it is to become a truly decentralized and interoperable network for Web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>In line with the openness of Web 3.0, Ontology was based on the concept of “multi-chain compliance, multi-layer expansion, and on-chain and off-chain hybrid application mode”, Ontology is an interoperable public chain supporting cross-chain transactions and Layer 2 solutions that enhance performance. It is also equipped to work with a variety of industries, both traditional and blockchain-based.</p><p>Ontology’s smart contract system utilizes a universal multi-virtual machine solution, being the first to support NeoVM, Native Ontology, and Wasm contracts in 2020. This year, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support was added, giving developers the widest variety of VM options currently available. After the EVM tests are completed, Ontology will become the first public chain to support four virtual machines.</p><p>As a highly interoperable chain network and the multi-virtual machine solution, Ontology is equipped for the coming transition to Web 3. Whether you are a senior blockchain developer or a traditional web developer, you can quickly become familiar with the Ontology development environment, easily deploy blockchain applications, and enjoy fast block confirmation speeds and low deployment costs. Ontology has matured into a comprehensive system with multifunctional, lightweight, highly available, concurrent, multi-language, cross-contract, cross-virtual machines all in one place and compatible with any region, any ecology, any language, and any business.</p><p>Our exploration of Ontology and Web 3.0 continues next week in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/can-web-3-0-awaken-the-internets-true-potential-part-two-48562cbd5bfb">Part 2</a> of this&nbsp;series.</p><p>References</p><p>1.

He is eligible to travel but has to present his vaccination details to the airport authorities to get the boarding&nbsp;pass.</p><p>So, there are three parties involved here — the healthcare facility that issued vaccination details (<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>), Frank, and the airport official who will check the credential. In other words, the healthcare facility is the issuer of a credential, Frank is the owner, and the airport official is the verifier.</p><p>Now, let’s get down to the implementation. How can the airport official verify the credibility of Frank’s vaccination, given that the healthcare facility is not in the same network as that of the verifier?</p><p>One possibility is to use blockchain technology to store the credential because it is immutable and&nbsp;secure.</p> Using Blockchain for&nbsp;SSI <p>No discussion of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> is ever complete without questions about blockchain. This is because blockchain provides the perfect alternative to centralized repositories as the credentials can be stored on blocks and linked to the larger&nbsp;network.</p><p>Since the blockchain network is spread across multiple computers, there’s no single owner. Also, the very nature of blockchain makes it impossible to change data, and this means you have high levels of online security and credibility.</p><p>In all, blockchain is a secure way to store and share your credentials and be in complete control of your data at all times, thereby enabling&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>That said, blockchain is not the only option for enabling SSI as there are other ways of implementing it such as IPFS, DID anchoring, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/peer-dids-an-off-ledger-did-implementation-5cb6ee6eb168">peer DIDs</a>, public-key cryptography, and more. You can even use gateways to avoid interacting with blockchains directly.</p><p>To give you an idea, let’s look at how <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public-key cryptography</a> is used for enabling&nbsp;SSI.</p> Using Public Key Cryptography <p>Public key cryptography secures the communication among entities, and in the process, enables the implementation of&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>Here’s a brief workflow of how it&nbsp;works.</p>  The healthcare facility issues the credential and signs it with its private key, and encrypts it with Frank’s public&nbsp;key.  Frank decrypts the credential using his private key and stores it in his digital wallet. When it’s time to present it to the airport authorities, he signs it with his private key and encrypts it with the verifier’s public&nbsp;key.  Finally, the verifier decrypts the credential using its private key and validates both the holder and the issuer using their respective public&nbsp;keys.  <p>As you can see, blockchain is not needed to implement SSI&nbsp;here.</p> Using IPFS <p>Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a versioned file system that stores files and tracks their versions. It is a distributed file network where the file URL of the actual file is shared among&nbsp;users.</p><p>For example, let’s say the vaccination details are stored in /ipfs/ZTmu48720mlp/vaccinations/frank.txt and this file can be shared directly with the concerned authorities. Here, the URL is similar to HTTP requests, except that the actual file name is used instead of the location where it is stored. Here, the cryptographic hash on the file is a part of the URL, and this is also what secures its contents.</p><p>Blockchain is not needed here as&nbsp;well.</p> Using Peer&nbsp;DIDs <p>In a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/peer-dids-an-off-ledger-did-implementation-5cb6ee6eb168">peer DID</a>, there’s no network involved. Here, the healthcare center creates a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifier</a> (DID), puts it in a DID document, and sends it directly to the airport authority. Likewise, the airport authority creates a DID, puts it in a DID document, and sends the doc to the healthcare facility</p><p>So, both entities create their records and send the metadata of their records to each other, so one can use that metadata to look up the record of the other. This information can also be cryptographically encrypted for security.</p><p>Again, no blockchain here.</p><p>To conclude, blockchain can be used for enabling SSI, but it is not the only way to implement SSI. The choice depends on the company/developer who is implementing it.</p><p>We hope this will get you thinking about enabling SSI using an option that best suits your application or business requirement.

  <p>Modern applications must work smoothly on high loads and with a high number of concurrent users. Traditional Java applications run blocking code and a common approach for scaling is to increase the number of available threads. When latency comes into the picture, many of these additional threads sit idle, wasting resources.</p>

<p>A different approach increases efficiency by writing asynchronous non-blocking code that lets the execution switch to another task while the asynchronous process completes.</p>

<p>Project Reactor is a Java framework from VMware that implements the <a href="https://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</a> specification. This initiative provides a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure for the JVM and JavaScript runtimes. It is the foundation of the reactive stack in the Spring ecosystem and WebFlux applications. Some studies suggest that performance differences are negligible in Spring applications unless the application makes more than 500 API requests per second. Thus, it’s not mandatory to do asynchronous programming, but it is the right approach for specific use cases.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll summarize some core Reactor concepts, introduce the Scheduler abstraction, and describe how it is used to encapsulate blocking code and prevent Java reactive applications from stalling.</p>

 Reactor Execution Model 

<p>Reactor is an API for doing asynchronous programming. You describe your data processing as a flow of operators, composing a data-processing pipeline.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Using the assembly line analogy, the initial data flow from a source, known as the <code>Publisher</code>, goes through transformation steps and eventually the result is pushed to a consumer, known as the <code>Subscriber</code>. A <code>Publisher</code> produces data, and a  <code>Subscriber</code> listens to it. Reactor also supports flow control via backpressure, so a <code>Subscriber</code> can signal the volume it’s able to consume.</p>

 Nothing Happens Until You Subscribe 

<p>In general, when you instantiate a <code>Publisher</code> (a <code>Flux</code> or a <code>Mono</code>) you are describing an asynchronous processing pipeline. When combining operators, no processing happens–you are describing the intent. This is called assembly time. You only trigger the data flow through that pipeline when you <code>subscribe</code>. The <code>subscribe</code> call emits a signal back to the source, and the source starts emitting data that flows through the pipeline. This is called execution time or subscription time.</p>

<p>A cold publisher generates data for each subscription. Then, if you subscribe twice, it will generate the data twice. All the examples that follow below will instantiate cold publishers. On the other hand, a hot publisher starts emitting data immediately or on the first subscription. Late subscribers receive data emitted after they subscribe. For the family of hot publishers, something does indeed happen before you subscribe.</p>

 Operators <code>map</code> and <code>flatMap</code> 

<p>Operators are like workstations in an assembly line. They make it possible to describe transformations or intermediate steps along the processing chain. Each operator is a decorator, it wraps the previous <code>Publisher</code> into a new instance. To avoid mistakes, the preferred way of using operators is to chain the calls. Apply the next operator to the last operator’s result. Some operators are instance methods and others are static methods.</p>

<p>Both <code>map()</code> and <code>flatMap()</code> are instance method operators. You might be familiar with the concept of these operations from functional programming or Java Streams. In the reactive world, they have their own semantics.</p>

<p>The <code>map()</code> method transforms the emitted items by applying a synchronous function to each item, on a one-to-one basis. Check the example below:</p>

   <code>public class MapTest {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MapTest.class);

    @Test
    public void mapTest() {
        Flux.range(1, 5)
                .map(v -&gt; transform(v))
                .subscribe(y -&gt; logger.info(y));

    }

    private String transform(Integer i){
        return  String.format("%03d", i);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Note: You can find this test and all the code in this tutorial in <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-reactive-service-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In the code above, a flux is created from a range of integers from 1 to 5. The <code>map()</code> operator is passed a transformation function that formats with leading zeros. Notice that the return type of the transform method is not a publisher and the transformation is synchronous–a simple method call. The transformation function must not introduce latency.</p>

<p>The <code>flatMap()</code> method transforms the emitted items asynchronously into Publishers, then flattens these inner publishers into a single <code>Flux</code> through merging, and the items can interleave. This operator does not necessarily preserve original ordering. The mapper function passed to <code>flatMap()</code> transforms the input sequence into N sequences. This operator is suitable for running an asynchronous task for each item.</p>

<p>In the example below, a list of words is mapped to its phonetics through the Dictionary API, using <code>flatMap()</code>.</p>

   <code>@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class FlatMapTest {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FlatMapTest.class);

    public static class Word {

        private String word;

            this.phonetics = phonetics;
        }

            return meanings;

<p>There is a rich vocabulary of operators for <code>Flux</code> and <code>Mono</code> you can find in the reference documentation. This handy guide can help you choose the right operator: <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#which-operator">“Which operator do I need?”</a>.</p>

 Reactor Schedulers for Switching the Thread 

<p>Project Reactor provides the tools for fine-tuning the asynchronous processing in terms of threads and execution context.</p>

<p>The <code>Scheduler</code> is an abstraction on top of the <code>ExecutionService</code>, which allows submitting a task immediately, after a delay or at a fixed time rate. We’ll share some examples below of the various default schedulers provided. The execution context is defined by the <code>Scheduler</code> selection.</p>

<p>Schedulers are selected through <code>subscribeOn()</code> and <code>publishOn()</code> operators, they switch the execution context. <code>subscribeOn()</code> changes the thread where the source actually starts generating data. It changes the root of the chain, affecting the preceding operators, upstream in the chain; and also affects subsequent operators.</p>

<p>Using <code>publishOn()</code> switches the context for the following operators in the pipeline description, downstream in the chain, overriding any the scheduler assigned with <code>subscribeOn()</code>.</p>

<p>The scheduler examples ahead will use <code>TestUtils.debug</code> for logging the thread name, function, and element:</p>

   <code>public class TestUtils {

    public static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TestUtils.class);

    public static &lt;T&gt; T debug(T el, String function) {
        logger.info("element "+ el + " [" + function + "]");
        return el;
    }
}
</code>   
 No Execution Context 

<p><code>Schedulers.immediate()</code> can be seen as the no-op scheduler, which the pipeline executes in the current thread.</p>

   <code>@Test
public void immediateTest() {

    logger.info("Schedulers.immediate()");

    Flux.range(1, 5)
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map"))
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.immediate())
            .subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe"));
}
</code>   

<p>The test above will log something similar to:</p>

 <code>2021-07-29 09:36:05.905 - INFO [main] - element "1" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "1" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "2" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "2" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "3" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "3" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "4" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "4" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "5" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "5" [subscribe]
</code> 

<p>Everything executes in the main thread.</p>

 Single Reusable Thread 

   <code>@Test
public void singleTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.single()");

    Flux.range(1, 5)
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map"))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.single())
            .subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
</code>   

<p>When running the test above, you will see a log similar to this:</p>

 <code>2021-07-13 23:19:16.456 - INFO [main] - element 1 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 2 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 3 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 4 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 5 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [single-1] - element 1 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.465 - INFO [single-1] - element 2 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.465 - INFO [single-1] - element 3 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.466 - INFO [single-1] - element 4 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.466 - INFO [single-1] - element 5 [subscribe]
</code> 

<p>As you can see, the <code>map()</code> function executes in the main thread, and the consumer code passed to <code>subscribe()</code> executes in the single-1 thread. Everything after the <code>publishOn()</code> will execute in the passed scheduler.</p>

<p>You may have noticed there is a <code>Thread.sleep()</code> call at the end of the test. As part of the work is passed to another thread, the <code>sleep()</code> call delays the application exit, so the worker thread can complete the task.</p>

 Bounded Elastic Thread Pool 

<p>A bounded elastic thread pool is a better choice for I/O blocking work, for example, reading a file, or making a blocking network call. It serves to help with legacy blocking code if it cannot be avoided.</p>

   <code>@Test
public void boundedElasticTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.boundedElastic()");

    List&lt;String&gt; words = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    words.add("a.txt");
    words.add("b.txt");
    words.add("c.txt");
    Flux flux = Flux.fromArray(words.toArray(new String[0]))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .map(w -&gt; scanFile(debug(w, "map")));

    flux.subscribe(y -&gt; debug(y, "subscribe1"));
    flux.subscribe(y -&gt; debug(y, "subscribe2"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}

public String scanFile(String filename){

    InputStream stream = getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(filename);
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(stream);
    String line = scanner.nextLine();
    scanner.close();

    return line;
}
</code>   

<p>The test above should log something similar to this:</p>

 <code>2021-07-15 00:41:51.443 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "a.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.443 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "a.txt" [map]

2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file b.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "c.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.448 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file c.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.448 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file a.txt" [subscribe1]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.449 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "b.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.451 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file b.txt" [subscribe1]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.452 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "c.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.453 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file c.txt" [subscribe1]
</code> 

<p>As you can see in the code above, the <code>flux()</code> is subscribed twice. As the <code>publishOn()</code> is invoked before any operator, everything will execute in the context of a bounded elastic thread. Also, notice how the execution from both subscriptions can interleave.</p>

<p>What might be confusing is that each subscription is assigned one bounded elastic thread for the whole execution. So in this case, “subscription1” executed in boundedElastic-1 and “subscription2” executed in boundedElastic-2. All operations for a given subscription execute in the same thread.</p>

<p>The instantiation of the <code>Flux</code> above produced a Cold Publisher, a publisher that generates data anew for each subscription. That’s why both subscriptions above process all the values.</p>

 Fixed Pool of Workers 

<p><code>Schedulers.parallel()</code> provides a pool of workers tuned for parallel work, with as many workers as there are CPU cores.</p>

   <code>@Test
public void parallelTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.parallel()");

    Flux flux = Flux.range(1, 5)
            .publishOn(Schedulers.parallel())
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map"));

    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe1"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe2"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe3"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe4"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe5"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
</code>   

<p>The test above will log something similar to the following lines:</p>

</code> 

<p>As you can see, different subscription executions interleave, and as I am testing with only four CPU cores, four workers seem to be available: parallel-1, parallel-2, parallel-3, and parallel-4. The <code>subscription5</code> operations, execute in parallel-1.</p>

<p>Again, observe how all operations for a given subscription are executed in the same thread.</p>

 Using Both <code>publishOn</code> and <code>subscribeOn</code> 

<p>When the <code>publishOn()</code> and <code>subscribeOn()</code> operators are used, the <code>subscribe</code> call accepts a consumer. The consumer will execute in the context selected by <code>publishOn()</code>, which defines the scheduler for downstream processing, including the consumer execution. At first, this might be confusing to understand, so check the following example:</p>

   <code>@Test
public void subscribeOnWithPublishOnTest() throws InterruptedException {
    Flux.range(1, 3)
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map1"))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.parallel())
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v * 100, "map2"))
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
</code>   

<p>The log should look like the following lines:</p>

   <code>2021-07-29 08:40:30.583 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "1" [map1]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.584 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "100" [map2]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "100" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "2" [map1]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "200" [map2]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "200" [subscribe]
...
</code>   

<p>As you can see, the first <code>map()</code> operator executes in the boundedElastic-1 thread, the second <code>map()</code> operator and the <code>subscribe()</code> consumer execute in the parallel-1 thread. Notice that the <code>subscribeOn()</code> operator is invoked after <code>publishOn()</code>, but it affects the root of the chain and the operators preceding <code>publishOn()</code> anyways.</p>

<p>A probably simplified <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#howtoReadMarbles">marble diagam</a> for the example above might look like this:</p>

 Reactive Java Spring Services 

<p>In Spring WebFlux, it is assumed applications don’t block, so non-blocking servers use a small fixed-size thread pool to handle requests, named event loop workers.</p>

<p>In an ideal reactive scenario, all the architecture components are non-blocking, so there is no need to worry about the event loop freezing up (reactor meltdown). But sometimes, you will have to deal with legacy blocking code, or blocking libraries.</p>

<p>So now, let’s experiment with Reactor Schedulers in a Reactive Java application. Create a Spring WebFlux service with Okta security. The service will expose an endpoint to return a random integer.</p>

<p>The implementation will call Java <code>SecureRandom</code> blocking code. Start by downloading a Spring Boot Maven project using <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>. You can do it with the following HTTPie command:</p>

   <code>http -d https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  bootVersion==2.5.3 \
  baseDir==reactive-service \
  groupId==com.okta.developer.reactive \
  artifactId==reactive-service \
  name==reactive-service \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.reactive \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==webflux,okta
</code>   

<p>Unzip the project:</p>

   <code>unzip reactive-service.zip
cd reactive-service
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.reactive.service</code>, and add the <code>SecureRandomService</code> interface:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

public interface SecureRandomService {

    Mono&lt;Integer&gt; getRandomInt();
}
</code>   

<p>And the implementation <code>SecureRandomServiceImpl</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import java.security.SecureRandom;

@Service
public class SecureRandomServiceImpl implements SecureRandomService {

    private SecureRandom secureRandom;

    public SecureRandomServiceImpl() {
        secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    }

    @Override
    public Mono&lt;Integer&gt; getRandomInt() {
        return Mono.just(secureRandom.nextInt());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Think for a moment about the <code>getRandomInt()</code> implementation. It’s hard to resist the temptation to wrap anything whatsoever in a publisher. <code>Mono.just(T data)</code> creates a <code>Mono</code> that will emit the specified item. But the item is captured at instantiation time. This will invoke the blocking code at assembly time, perhaps in the context of an event loop thread.</p>

<p>For now, let’s move forward to create the package <code>com.okta.developer.reactive.controller</code>, and add a <code>SecureRandom</code> class for the data:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

public class SecureRandom {

    private String value;

    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public SecureRandom(Integer value){
        this.value = value.toString();
    }
}
</code>   
<p>Create the <code>SecureRandomController</code> class:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

import com.okta.developer.reactive.service.SecureRandomService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@RestController
public class SecureRandomController {

    @Autowired
    private SecureRandomService secureRandomService;


    @GetMapping("/random")
    public Mono&lt;SecureRandom&gt; getSecureRandom(){
        return secureRandomService.getRandomInt().map(i -&gt; new SecureRandom(i));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add <code>spring-security-test</code> dependency to the pom:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>SecureRandomControllerTest</code>:</p>
   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.AutoConfigureWebTestClient;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.mockOidcLogin;

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class SecureRandomControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient webTestClient;

    @Test
    public void testGetSecureRandom() {
        webTestClient.mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
            .get()
            .uri("/random")
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run with:</p>
   <code>./mvnw test -Dtest=SecureRandomControllerTest
</code>   
<p>The test should pass, but how can you make sure the REST call won’t freeze up the service’s event loop? Use <a href="https://github.com/reactor/BlockHound">BlockHound</a>!. Blockhound is a Java agent that detects blocking calls from non-blocking threads, has built-in integration with Project Reactor, and supports the JUnit platform.</p>

<p>Add the Blockhound dependency to the <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.projectreactor.tools&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;blockhound-junit-platform&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.0.6.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>It has been reported that when <a href="https://github.com/reactor/BlockHound/issues/173">Spring Security is enabled, BlockHound does not detect blocking calls</a>.</p>

<p>Disable security for the test profile. Add the file <code>src/test/resources/application-test.yml</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>spring:
  autoconfigure:
    exclude:
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.client.reactive.ReactiveOAuth2ClientAutoConfiguration
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.resource.reactive.ReactiveOAuth2ResourceServerAutoConfiguration
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.reactive.ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration
</code>   

<p>Rerun the test, and you should see the following error:</p>

 <code>reactor.blockhound.BlockingOperationError: Blocking call! java.io.FileInputStream#readBytes
	at java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.readBytes(FileInputStream.java) ~[na:na]

</code> 

<p>As the log above shows, <code>SecureRandom.next()</code> produces a call to <code>FileInputStream.readBytes()</code>, which is blocking.</p>

<p>The <code>SecureRandomService</code> returns a <code>Mono</code> publisher, but it is an Impostor Reactive Service!</p>

   <code>return Mono.just(secureRandom.nextInt());
</code>   

<p>The implementation above has logic up front, first the calculation <code>secureRandom.nextInt()</code> and then the assembly.</p>

<p>What is the right way to wrap a blocking call? Make the work happen in another scheduler.</p>

 Encapsulation of Blocking Calls 

<p>Blocking encapsulation needs to happen down into the service, as explained in the <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#faq.wrap-blocking">Reactor documentation</a>. The scheduler assignment must also happen inside the implementation.</p>

<p>Create the class <code>SecureRandomReactiveImpl</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;
import reactor.core.scheduler.Schedulers;

import java.security.SecureRandom;

@Service
@Primary
public class SecureRandomReactiveImpl implements SecureRandomService {

    private SecureRandom secureRandom;

    public SecureRandomReactiveImpl() {
        secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    }

    @Override
    public Mono&lt;Integer&gt; getRandomInt() {
        return Mono.fromCallable(secureRandom::nextInt)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the test again and the BlockHound exception should not happen. Avoid the logic up front and assemble the pipeline. Everything should be fine.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s do an end-to-end test. Run the application with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080/random</code> and you should see the Okta sign in page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sign in with your Okta account and you should see a response similar to this:</p>

   <code>{

}

 Interview CFO of Credify MAURIZIO RAFFONE 



<p>With over 20 years of experience in capital markets and international finance, Maurizio Raffone had worked in various leading roles at renowned banks and in different environments including corporates, academics, and start-ups. Thus, he has been witnessing the development of global finance through diverse lenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing such potential of Fintech development, Maurizio Raffone has been taking a role as a Fintech consultant, and now, he is our Chief Financial Officer at Credify. In this interview, we had a discussion with him about the impacts of the pandemic on the global financial market and the opportunities for Fintech’s development in this period. In addition,&nbsp; Maurizio Raffone also shares some lessons that we could learn from developed countries to revive emerging markets.</p>



”..it is truly game-changing, putting the user firmly at the center of all innovation.”



 How does the global financial market react under the impact of COVID-19? 



<p>Global financial markets have been incredibly resilient in the face of the pandemic. Stock markets are solidly up, there has not been any banking crisis and we have seen continued investments in privately-funded companies. This has been mainly thanks to an aggressive monetary policy and fiscal support by many of the leading world economies.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the actions that the global financial market has been taking in order to overcome the COVID recession? 



<p>Leading central banks have been pumping money into their economies for years and as this was about to slow down, COVID hit and their loose monetary policies were extended. I think it is a bit more difficult for emerging economies to match the developed countries’ strategies, however, they indirectly benefit from them too, given developed markets are open for exports and corporates continue their global investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my opinion, emerging markets’ governments need to take this opportunity to support the rapid modernization of the regulatory, financial, and technology infrastructure of their countries, in order to implement leaner and more efficient means of economic growth. The key to successfully combating the COVID-induced difficulties is to make it easier to do business for people and companies.</p>







 Please share your opinions on the role of Fintech in recovering and developing developed countries’ financial market during and post COVID-19. 



<p>Fintech firms can play a crucial role in kick-starting the economy and ensuring less privileged people can also improve their economic situation. Access to credit, for example, is fundamental for people and businesses at a time of economic hardship: I believe fintech companies can help by being able to provide support when perhaps some of the traditional financial institutions aren’t willing or capable to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not because fintech companies necessarily take more risks than traditional lenders, but because they generally operate with a much lower cost base and are able to provide more customized services, meaning that their clients can be offered a financial service that they actually afford.</p>



<p>Furthermore, fintech firms have a strong track record in providing very clear solutions to specific problems their clients face and are able to turn an idea into a service fast. I see this characteristic of fintech companies as being particularly useful in this COVID climate as there is a lot of uncertainty over lockdowns, travel bans, and so forth.</p>







 In terms of developing countries, what internal and external factors do you think could support or hinder Fintech development? 



<p>Many emerging economies have not fully embraced fintech from a regulatory perspective, so some of the potential innovation and developments are either taking place in a bit of a grey zone or not at all. I think it is crucial for governments to create a framework where fintech innovation is promoted whilst protecting retail clients/users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in some countries, generally in the more developed economies, financial regulators have launched fintech sandboxes, essentially allowing selected fintech firms to test their solutions and technology, collaborate with established financial institutions, and get limited access to clients. This way, they can evaluate the suitability of their services and the legal and regulatory approach that may be required. These sandboxes not only help the selected fintech firms understand better how to operate their business model but also help regulators learn about new technologies and come up with regulations that can help the introduction of new services and financial products to the market.</p>



 What is your advice for financial and non-financial firms from emerging countries to catch up with Fintech’s development in the future? 



<p>Financial and non-financial firms from emerging countries need to educate themselves with the latest technologies and business models and applications and experiment a little more. It is very natural to feel more defensive at a time of difficult market conditions such as now. However, that’s exactly the time to push on with innovation and bring better solutions to their clients.</p>



 About the CFO 



<p>Maurizio Raffone has more than 20 years of experience in capital markets and international finance with a track record of structuring, trading, originating and selling structured finance transactions.</p>



<p>He worked in leading positions at many large and prestigious banks, namely Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank AG, Bear Stearns &amp; Co., and UniCredit.</p>



<p>Acknowledging the emergence of technology into the financial market and its developing trend in decentralization, Maurizio Raffone has made a major turn to the Fintech industry for the last couple of years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maurizio obtained his master’s degree in Financial Economics from the University of Cambridge, and a first-class honors degree in Economics and Management from Royal Holloway College of the University of London.</p>

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Mike some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why use the history of a color as an analogy for identity?  </p>
<p>
Great question. I think as I tend to think about identity and other technology and innovation, what fascinates me most is not even how much the technology works, but how it impacts society, how it impacts culture and the semantic value that that technology has. I was looking at museum artifacts because I'm actually on vacation, as you can see. And I started to notice that there was a lack of blue everywhere I look. And so reading more about the trajectory of blue, it really was an easy analogy there to think about how blue has impacted society over the years. And the growth in its semantic use by the culture and by society at large, and by taking lessons from Blue's narrative path, we can see kind of where identity is and where it may be going and how we want, or don't want it to wind up like the color blue as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How does the rise of the color blue, specifically, parallel identity?   </p>
<p>
Well, blue, as I said was particularly fascinating because in the old days, old, old, really old days, it wasn't really used for technological reasons and for cultural impact reasons as well. And so over time, innovation hit, wave after wave of technological innovation. And along with that, the culture started to appropriate blue. It went from kind of non-existence – not even used to describe the sea like you see behind me. Terms like green or even brown or yellow, believe it or not, were used to paint the sea or to talk about the sea. And then this changed 13 hundreds or so when some innovation hit and it became massively popular among a niche group of people – the wealthy, the affluent – and so what that already showed was that the early adopters had an advantage and the early adopters have had an advantage in identity, as well.</p>
<p>As blue progressed, it became the color of normalcy, kind of a normal color. There weren't a lot of outliers. It was still too new to have a lot of cultural weight. And so it was kind of an open Greenfield for people to inject it with their own meaning. It was a safe color. And so it became from the rich, the affluent and powerful, it transitioned into something more common and more accepted by society because it didn't have any negative earlier connotation. And then finally blue exploded in the last century or two into one of the West's most popular color of all colors of all time. I see identity kind of going through a similar progression, maybe cyclical progression, where it doesn't quite exist in a culture or a subculture, and then innovation and culture work together to foster adoption and to drive new use cases to where ideally in the future, I think identity. And it would benefit everyone in terms of being ubiquitous and not just ubiquitous, but also popular. And so I'm wanting to propose in my talk at the European Identity and Cloud Conference this year, a parallel between the two and then people can come find me and we can argue about it later and discuss it regardless of whether or not you agree with me. It's a great framework for discussing the technology and the cultural impact of something like identity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is driving the progression of identity today: innovation or cultural significance? </p>
<p>
If you had asked me 5, 10 years ago, I would have said innovation. In part because I was younger, in part because the world was different. I think now it's almost impossible to split apart those two notions – or one drives the other, drives the other. We've seen in the past year how quickly the world can change. You look at the impact of COVID for instance, and COVID mandates, and identity being used to validate who's vaccinated, who's not. What your health status is. These things can turn on a dime. And so I think it's kind of a false question in a way to say, is it one or the other? I think it's an unholy weaving of both together – and one takes the lead and then the other takes the lead. But by knowing that they're equally powerful or can be equally powerful then we can seek to harness that and try and steer the path of identity towards a beneficial, good direction, rather than one that might be more malicious. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What obstacles stand in the way of identity becoming as popular as blue? </p>
<p>
Great question. I think one of the primary obstacles standing in the way of identity continuing its ascendancy and it's move towards popularity is quite frankly, ease of use. The people we're talking about here are not identity professionals, they’re not practitioners, they're not even technologists. Think of someone who you would not think of interacting with identity, and that's the target audience that I'm thinking about or contemplating in terms of identity being popular. For that to work, it's not going to be technology as such that is going to move them to adopt that. I think what it's going to be is something that's natural, part of their daily process, where they don't think about it. And so I think we haven't achieved that yet. And that's one of the main barriers, as opposed to, say, the next wave of innovation or technology. If it's not as easy to use – as a friend of mine says – as a spoon, then we've kind of lost the battle there already.  </p>

<p>IDnow enables an automated identity verification solution for highly regulated use cases, complying with Anti-Money-Laundering-Law in Europe.</p>
<p>IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, is expanding its automated solution AutoIdent for additional highly regulated use cases, including areas regulated by the Anti Money Laundering Act (AML), such as banks and financial service providers.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent is an AML Act compliant identity verification solution that operates as an automated process and meets the high-security requirement. It serves a wide range of industries and use cases, such as onboarding a player for online gaming, opening a bank account, or signing a loan agreement. Taking advantage of a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES), IDnow AutoIdent seamlessly blends state-of-the-art technologies into an easy, secure and fully compliant identity verification process.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent including QES, is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1) d). If the use case requires an even higher level of assurance IDnow AutoIdent including QES could be combined with a bank transfer, turning it into a fully compliant remote onboarding solution in accordance with the German AML Act – Geldwäschegesetz (GwG), under Section §12 sentence 1 Nr 3.</p>
<p>“Our belief in providing an advanced identity verification platform which increases security improves conversion and streamlines our customers’ onboarding process across geographical borders drives us forward. By making our automated solution AML-compliant with additional regulations, our customers can offer a faster process and therefore a better user experience while ensuring high security and regulatory standards. This gives our customers, who operate in a constantly evolving environment, the peace of mind and the flexibility to choose the solution that meets their needs best,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO at IDnow.</p>
<p>The IDnow platform, which includes AutoIdent as a building block, effortlessly orchestrates all necessary components into a seamless, secure and AML-compliant identity verification.</p>
<p>Depending on the customer’s needs, the onboarding process offers total flexibility. Further components of the IDnow platform can added, e.g., eSign, the add-on for the digital contract signing opening up additional use cases such as taking out a consumer loan in a wholly digital process.</p>
<p>In recent years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 800 customers worldwide. In 2021, IDnow acquired the French market leader for identity technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German identity Trust Management AG, enabling IDnow to offer its customers one of the broadest identification solutions through a single, integrated platform.</p>

<p>Summary: We explore how to issue credentials using secure messaging.</p><p>At MATTR, we’ve pioneered a way to request and receive credentials using <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a> capability.</p><p>However, if you already have a robust mechanism in place to authenticate users, then setting up additional OIDC capability is unnecessary. Sending credentials using secure Decentralized Identifier (DID) messaging or directly with a QR code is a safe, convenient alternative. In this article, we’ll explore this alternative method in more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>The MATTR mobile wallet supports two main channels for issuing a credential:</p>  OpenID Credential Provider  Secure DID messaging  <p>Note: We’re building DID messaging on the JOSE stack to facilitate signing and encryption.</p><p>OpenID Credential Provider</p><p>If you haven’t yet authenticated a user, using OpenID Credential Provider offers a secure way to authenticate a user at the point of credential creation. It involves setting up and configuring an OpenID Provider to work alongside the MATTR VII OIDC Bridge Extension — simple if you’re already using OIDC infrastructure, but more complex to set up from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Secure DID messaging</p><p>If you’ve already authenticated a user through another method, issuing a credential through a secure DID message is a reliable alternative to OIDC. This approach works well if you’re authenticating users through a website login or even in person (like a classroom or training&nbsp;centre).</p><p>Let’s see how this might work in practice.</p><p>1. Authentication</p><p>Before issuing a credential, you need to authenticate the user. The most common way to do this is having a user login to a session on your&nbsp;website.</p><p>2. Linking</p><p>Now that you’ve authenticated the user, you need to link their DID to the session of the user. This DID will be generated by the wallet they are using to hold the credential. You can obtain it in a few different ways:</p>  If the user already has a credential you’ve issued, and you trust they are still in control of the subject DID in the credential, you can create a new credential based off the DID inside the credential.  If the user needs to link their DID from their mobile wallet, you can use a <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/dids/did-auth-oidc">DID Auth</a> flow to make sure you’re obtaining a validated DID that the user can prove they&nbsp;own.  If you needed to verify credential data from the user as part of the transaction anyway, you’ll need to use the Holder DID from the Verifiable Presentation as the determining DID.  <p>For very simple use cases like demo and testing, if a user has the MATTR mobile wallet they can use a Public DID — they can simply copy the DID and pass it to you out-of-band.</p><p>3. Constructing the credential and&nbsp;message</p><p>Now that the DID is ‘known’ and we’ve authenticated the user, a Verifiable Credential is <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/issue-basic">created</a> using the MATTR VII platform. This credential is then packaged into a secure DID message format to be delivered to the recipient. Because the subject DID is known, the DID message can be encrypted to ensure the data is safe in transit. Use the <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/api-reference/v1.0.1#operation/encryptMessage">messaging endpoints</a> to easily perform this&nbsp;step.</p><p>4. Delivery</p><p>The MATTR mobile wallet can read DID messages in either a secure DID message, QR code or deep-link.</p><p>Sending a secure DID message is an easy way to push messages to mobile wallet holders. Once the message has been encrypted, it can be <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/messaging/messaging-send">sent to the subject DID</a> and the MATTR VII platform will route the encrypted message to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>QR codes and deep-links typically make the messages too large to be reliably read by most smartphones. To solve this, we embed a URL to an endpoint hosting the DID message. Then, the MATTR mobile wallet simply follows a redirect to obtain the&nbsp;message.</p><p>5. Storing the credential</p><p>Once the MATTR mobile wallet receives the message, the user can view the credential to make sure it’s correct, then store the credential in the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>At this stage, the wallet will also perform some checks to verify the credential, including:</p>  Validation of the credential proof  Resolving the issuer DID&nbsp;document  Checking that the issuer is publishing a valid DID-to-Domain linkage credential.  <p>The checks are clearly visible to the user, and there’s assurance that when it comes time for a user to present their credential, it’ll be accepted by trusted verifiers.</p><p>Wrap up</p><p>If you’re already using a secure mechanism to authenticate your users, then setting up OIDC capability isn’t necessary. As we’ve explored, sending credentials using secure DID messaging directly or via a QR code or deep-link is safe, convenient and allows users to obtain their credentials directly.</p><p>Try this out for yourself now on the MATTR VII platform and in the MATTR mobile&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>MATTR VII&nbsp;trial</p><p>Sign up today for a <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">free trial of our MATTR VII platform</a> to experience the powerful capabilities that can be deployed in the context of your organization.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/issuing-credentials-directly-to-the-mattr-mobile-wallet-8e8cab931e2e">Issuing credentials directly to the MATTR mobile wallet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

611 Million Dollars Was Stolen Today In The Largest DeFi Hack In Cryptocurrency History<p>Introduction: What Is&nbsp;DeFi?</p><p>Decentralized finance, otherwise known as DeFi, has revolutionized the paradigm of traditional finance as we know it. But what is decentralized finance, and how has it impacted the way monetary instruments operate? Decentralized finance is, in essence, an umbrella term that consolidates cryptocurrency or blockchain applications geared towards disrupting traditional financial intermediaries. Centralized financial intermediaries are non-existent in the world of DeFi and non-custodial applications are the embodiment of how DeFi operates. Such intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges or banks are traditional financial entities that operate as an intermediary, enabling your finances to be at the mercy of organizations other than yourself; although this maybe enticing, many individual’s wish to have complete autonomy and control over their own finances.</p><p>DeFi utilizes smart contract technology, such as Ethereum to allow individuals to borrow, lend, speculate on the price of securities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, real estate etc. and earn interest at rates unheard of in your traditional savings account. Decentralized finance is no longer exclusive to Ethereum; many blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Aergo, ICON, Vechain (and many more) have conceived of their own blockchain applications dedicated to decentralized finance.</p><p>DeFi Exposure: Are Your Coins At&nbsp;Risk?</p>This Chart Above Analyzes How, In Accordance To How Fast DeFi Has Taken Off, The Amount Of Hacks That Have Occurred Coinciding With It: Notice, Todays Hack Hasn’t Been&nbsp;Included<p>As DeFi has risen as a dominant force in the blockchain space, hackers and malevolent entities have capitalized on such a paradigm and over the course of the last two years (including Tuesday’s attack), DeFi hackers have effectively stolen over 1 billion dollars since 2020. Put that into perspective, one billion dollars in less than two years has been stolen by numerous investors and that could be you if you ignore the risks of not securing your cryptocurrency assets. Just because a DeFi application has been audited, doesn’t mean that it can’t be hacked; this is an unfortunate truth within the web of blockchain technological applications, especially ones in their infancy. It is important to highlight the numerous attacks that have occurred in 2021 alone to garner perspective on how much of a risk you can be in if you don’t take necessary precautions.</p><p>In February 2021, DeFi platform Yearn Finance had a flash loan attack; as Yearn Finance is one of the largest aggregators in the space, this comes as no surprise. Being one of the largest aggregators in the space, this allowed hackers to siphon 11 million dollars worth of users funds from the Dai Vault through a smart contract exploitation. This allowed the hackers to garner approximately 2.7 million dollars in profit after having to spend over 8 million dollars in fees. The hackers were able to successfully attack the platform by exploiting the flash loan feature on Yearn Finance, which arbitraged from other DeFi platforms within the blockchain sphere. Not only did Yearn Finance suffer an exploitation, but Alpha Homora’s Iron Bank Exploit also occurred during the same month because of their very own flash loan feature as well. This time, the protocol lost a whopping 37 million dollars. The hackers borrowed millions of stablecoins from Cream Finance’s IronBank, doubling their loans after every succeeding one. It is evident that these hacks are a result from smart contract exploits, which many thought were indominable. Fast forward to March and we saw the Meerkat Finance Exploit which was a yield farming protocol on the Binance Smart Chain which was reported being hacked one day after it went live resulting in approximately 73,000 BNB being lost (approximately 13 million dollars). Paid Network had an infinite mint attack where the hackers resulted in 180 million dollars being lost by minting PAID tokens causing massive inflation, sending its value down 85% within a few hours. Easy Fi, another DeFi platform on Polygon, was hacked for 75 million dollars and the team had to initiate a hard fork to recover most of the lost funds. These are just a FEW DeFi hacks that have occurred in 2021 alone, and many more have been reported (like the one that happened today, the largest in DeFi history). Many investors have also suffered from DeFi rug pulls since the inception of decentralized finance, but what exactly is a rug&nbsp;pull?</p>The Infamous Rug Pull: A Dominant Malevolent Action In&nbsp;DeFi<p>Imagine a rug being pulled from under you, you fall and possibly fail to get back up, think as this as a synonymous notion towards your cryptocurrency finances resulting from rug pulls. A rug pull is an event where a protocol token is launched on a decentralized exchange such as Pancake or Uniswap and paired with a prominent cryptocurrency asset such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. Liquidity providers known as yield farmers are then actively pursued by anonymous hackers and social media magnets that promise absurd Annual Percentage Yields. Smart contracts, unfortunately being able to be exploited, once they have enough funds locked into the smart contract, the developer, who has complete authority and control over the operation of the smart contract, withdraws all the funds from the liquidity pools and disappears with the&nbsp;funds.</p><p>611 Million In Cryptocurrency Stolen: The Great DeFi Hack: Tuesday, August 10th,&nbsp;2021</p>The Biggest DeFi Hack In History Occurred Today: But Why, And&nbsp;How?<p>Today, over 611 million dollars was stolen in a massive hack that will go down as the largest DeFi hack in blockchain history up until this point in time. This hack, reporting over 600 million dollars in losses, outweighs all the DeFi hacks from February-April combined! But how did this happen and why? It started with Poly Network, a network dedicated to swapping cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Poly Network was attacked on three different chains, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon and were transferred to the hacker’s addresses. Poly Network swaps tokens across different blockchains, which include Ethereum, Ontology, Binance and Polygon. Based on the statement created by Poly Network, over 273 million dollars in Ethereum assets were taken, 253 million dollars in Binance Smart Chain assets and 85 million in USDC. The hack was so massive that Tether, a controversial stablecoin, even got involved and freezed 33 million dollars worth of the coin to prevent further exploitation. The hack, forced O3, a trading pool that utilizes the Poly Network to trade tokens on different blockchains, to cease functionality, disrupting the cross-chain interoperability that was created on the Poly Network. This hack wasn’t a result of a rug-pull, but of an issue with cryptography which enabled the hacker to take these funds. This hack is eerily similar to the AnySwap attack, which resulted in 7.9 million stolen in July because the hacker was able to exploit the private key. This quote creates perspective on how incumbent it is to secure your coins “just eight month into 2021, more DeFi hacks and exploits have occurred than throughout the years 2020 and 2019.” As DeFi, blockchain and cryptocurrency markets expand, so will malevolent entities, and crimes will rise as a result which is why we must stay vigilant.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425073987164381196">@PolyNetwork2</a></p></blockquote><p>How To Secure Your Coins From DeFi&nbsp;Exploits</p>Protect Your Coins From Exploitation Or Face The Consequences!<p>While DeFi protocols have initiated rapid innovation and transformation of traditional and blockchain finance, their is numerous rooms for error and exploitation. It is incumbent that you, the investor, understand the risks and consequences thereof of participating in decentralized finance applications. The first and obvious method of securing your cryptocurrency assets is to get a hardware wallet. Whether your coins are on an exchange or within a DeFi protocol, I’m sorry to say, they’re not your coins. Hardware wallets negate the risk of your coins being exposed as they store your cryptocurrency assets&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Such cryptocurrency wallets such as Trezor run on open source coding, which many argue makes them more secure because open source codes are consistently watching for vulnerabilities and being open source makes it impossible for any entity to open up a “back-door.” The Ledger is also another hardware wallet that is fantastic for security, however, their database was breached in 2020, which was irresponsible and absurdly ridiculous; you would think a secure digital asset wallet company would know better to not keep customers information on their databases. My advice to you as an investor, is to never use your real name when buying these hardware wallets, make sure you’re buying them from the real Trezor or Ledger website, don’t have it mailed to your house and use a fake burner email address. Consistently keep your keys stored offline and never stored on your computer or cell-phone, never trust, always verify websites and never vaunt your cryptocurrency holdings on social media (we all have egos, but they can be a detriment to your finances and mental health). There are also some DeFi protocols that offer insurance risks in case of a smart contract vulnerability or hack (think of this as if your money was in an FDIC insured bank account but your bank goes under, your funds will still be safe). In short, keep your private keys safe, offline and buy a hardware wallet and be wary of any DeFi protocols that have been previously hacked.</p><p>Conclusion: DeFi, A Massive Innovation With Unfortunate Risks</p>All Innovations Are Accompanied By Risks: As DeFi Grows, So Will Hacks: Secure Yourself!<p>This article was not meant to bash or to create a negative perspective on DeFi: decentralized finance is a massive innovation within the web of blockchain and the financial paradigm as a whole. But with any innovation comes massive risks, and it is incumbent that investors are aware of such risks when participating in these activities. Always remember, not your keys, not your&nbsp;coins!</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>At Onfido we’re continually innovating and thinking about how we can improve important things like our communication, customer experience, processes and services. After all, one of our core values is ‘find a better way’ and Onfidoers practice this in their daily work. When Patrick Cahill from the Onfido legal team attended an Onfido University session ‘Introduction to Design Thinking’, hosted by the fantastic design team, it sparked a discussion about how in the legal team we could learn from this approach and adopt it in different ways in our interactions with customers, Onfidoers and external lawyers (to name a&nbsp;few).</p><p>Queue the fantastic Adam Bradley from the design team, who put his hand up to help turn legal minds upside down and facilitated replacing wigs and gowns with post it notes and sharpies! Adam worked with Patrick in developing and facilitating a series of workshops which explored legal design thinking. Legal design isn’t a new concept and there’s even a fab <a href="https://www.legalgeek.co/legaldesign/">Legal Geek conference</a> where you can learn more about it. Margaret Hagan from Stanford Law School’s Legal Design Lab <a href="https://www.legalgeek.co/learn/legal-design-wtf/">summarises legal design</a> really&nbsp;well.</p><p>“Legal Design is an innovation approach — that means focusing on the humans within the legal system to understand where the crucial breakdowns in the system right now exist — and to make the creative leap to define what a better system might&nbsp;be.</p><p>It means a priority on who the ‘users’ of the system are — whether it be people who are ‘lay’ outsiders trying to use it to solve problems, or the ‘professionals’ who work inside it. A legal design approach has us talk to these people, observe them, co-create with them, and test with them — so that we can make a system that actually solves problems, and does so in the most usable, useful, and engaging way possible.</p><p>A legal design approach can help us create small changes to huge overhauls. You can use it to make better documents, products, services, organisations, or policies. It is about using creative, human-centered strategies to find better ways forward, to serve people&nbsp;better.”</p><p>With Adam’s help and guidance, the first step was to figure out how we’d facilitate the workshops and what areas the workshops should cover. Planning was key for this step and using <a href="https://miro.com/">miro</a>, we identified objectives and outcomes for the team and created a structure of how to achieve those outcomes. As design thinking was a relatively new concept for the team, we kicked off with a 101 in design thinking approach, so the legal team were armed with the right tools, encouraged to put aside any preconceptions and prejudices and to come to the workshops with a user centred problem solving&nbsp;mindset.</p>A screen grab of part of the miro board that we worked&nbsp;on<p>The following workshop focused specifically on who the users of Onfido’s legal terms: (i) who they were, taking a broad brush approach beyond the obvious users (characteristics and expertise); (ii) the context in which they engage with legal terms; (iii) what they hope to achieve in using the legal terms; and (iv) potential challenges they face when using the legal terms. From distilling this information, in our next workshop we moved onto reviewing some of the problems that we wanted to solve for each of our users. For example, receiving lots of redline and that the context/background of a clause may not be&nbsp;clear.</p><p>Our last workshop looked at solution ideation and we were encouraged by Adam to think outside of the box and come up with ideas that pushed boundaries. There was definitely no right or wrong answer at this stage of the process. Taking the problems above, we looked at potential solutions such as providing an explanation of each clause to external lawyers, adopting a pre-contract intake form and doing more internal education to our Growth team to foster a deeper understanding of contract positions.</p><p>The workshops were hugely beneficial to the legal team and we’ve now got lots of ideas and insights in how to solve some of the problems that our users face. Having an awareness and understanding of design led thinking also means that we’ll continue to view problems through a user-centred lens and continue to collaborate cross functionally to improve and iterate on the service and systems we provide as a legal team, pushing boundaries and innovating as we grow with our wig, gowns, post it notes and sharpies.</p><p>If you’re interested in finding out more about our experience and legal design thinking, please feel free to reach&nbsp;out.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-cahill-23865461/">Patrick Cahill</a> is Legal Counsel at Onfido and a Visiting Fellow at the Centre for Commercial Law Studies,&nbsp;QMUL.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adambradleyuxr/">Adam Bradley</a> is UX Researcher at&nbsp;Onfido.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/onfidos-legal-design-journey-7b950950af2e">Onfido’s Legal Design Journey</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Automated Vending Technology Showcased in Black Fire Innovation’s Living Lab</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO and LAS VEGAS (August 11, 2021) — <a href="https://www.civic.com/">Civic Technologies</a>, a leading innovator in digital identity solutions, and Black Fire Innovation, the hospitality technology hub created by Caesars Entertainment, Inc., and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), today announced that a vending machine using Age Verification by Civic will be serving up an assortment of non-alcoholic beverages to Black Fire’s tenants. The technology is based on Identity.com’s open source identity verification ecosystem.</p>



<p>Designed specifically to dispense beer, canned wine and similar age-restricted beverages, the vending machine being piloted at Black Fire is filled with sparkling water, energy drinks and canned espresso for demonstrative purposes only.</p>



<p>The vending machine is housed in Black Fire to demonstrate the importance and utility of private identity verification to the top innovators who work in Black Fire’s concept-testing lab.</p>



<p>“Now, we’re finding new ways to assist the hospitality industry within Black Fire, the home of disruptive innovations. By making digital identity verification easy — without sacrificing privacy — Civic offers forward-looking technology that will help foster more breakthroughs across gaming and entertainment,” said Robert Rippee, Executive Director of UNLV’s Black Fire Innovation Hub.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make an age-restricted purchase at the vending machine, a user simply signs up for Civic Wallet and is authenticated as a real person. Civic verifies the user’s age at the vending machine using Identity.com’s open-source identity verification ecosystem. Users have more control over their personal information and the ability to purchase age-restricted products anonymously.</p>



<p>“We’re delighted that our groundbreaking identity-verification vending machine has found a new home in Black Fire Innovation’s Living Lab,” said Vinny Lingham, CEO and co-founder of Civic. “We’re proud to bring automated age verification technology to innovation leaders in the gaming, hospitality and entertainment industries.”</p>



<p>A vending machine selling age-restricted products, including beer, is just one application of private identity verification. Other real-world opportunities for identity verification technology abound, especially when it comes to enhancing the entire customer experience — both online and offline — including opportunities for product enhancement across vendors and properties without collecting any personal data. Civic and Black Fire Innovation are confident that this collaboration will lead to new customer insights and better casino rewards programs. Vending machines with Age Verification by Civic are currently in use around the United States in partnership with a large vending partner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Anonyome Labs, our solutions help mitigate violence and abuse that is&nbsp;tech-facilitated&nbsp;(via a computer, device or app). We empower people to be able to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. We provide survivors and those at risk of harassment, violence and abuse, real and effective tools for protecting their personal information.</p>



<p>In May 2020, we proudly became a partner of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/anonyome-labs-joins-global-fight-against-stalkerware/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>,&nbsp;a global working group uniting advocacy groups, software developers, security firms, victims and survivors, in the fight to protect consumers against stalkerware and to eliminate abusive technology and software.</p>



<p>We are also growing our own safety initiative, known as Sudo Safe.&nbsp;Through Sudo Safe, we partner with organizations that promote safe use of the Internet as well as those organizations that support at-risk people who may have a specific need for privacy and security in their life.&nbsp;Our goal is to support at-risk users, and to be a privacy resource for organizations supporting their members.</p>



<p>Sudo Safe encourages the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, to help people keep their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;private.&nbsp;MySudo enables people to communicate and interact with other people and services without using their own information such as personal phone number, email address and credit card, which mitigates the risk of that information being used for tracking or stalking.</p>



<p>See how an&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/why-i-use-mysudo-as%e2%80%afan%e2%80%afeducator/">educator uses MySudo</a>&nbsp;to privately and safely communicate with students and their families.</p>

<p>Finicity’s open banking platform delivers consumer-permissioned data, the foundation of a more comprehensive, more accurate risk assessment. Lenders need to enhance their assessment capabilities in order to remedy these five problems in today’s credit decisioning market:</p>
 
 Traditional credit scoring is a lagging indicator of financial health 
 Credit scores do not follow individuals across borders 
 62 million Americans have a thin credit file or are credit invisible 
 Millennials are lagging behind other generations in building credit 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed problems with traditional credit scoring

<p>Open banking data augments the foundation of credit histories and credit scores by providing real-time insights into cash flow, stable income and the actual room in someone’s monthly budget to afford a loan or a new purchase.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans have thin credit files meaning they don’t have enough data in the credit bureaus to even create a score. By looking at data from their bank account, lenders can determine if they are able to to pay back a loan based on income and expenses, not the lack of data.</p>
<p>Above all, consumer-permissioned data helps to empower consumers with control over their data, access to better financial products and a simple way to connect with fintech apps or financial services.</p>

<p>UPDATE, 19 August 2021:<br>We have made two updates to the Token Metrics document, originally published on 11 August&nbsp;2021:</p>  Page 1: Initial circulating supply: 34 million (revised from 32.5&nbsp;million)  Page 2: Composition of crowdloan reserve is now divided between the two categories “Unvested and unlocked” and “Vested linearly over 6&nbsp;months”.  <p>_________________________________________________________________</p><p>It’s exciting times for KILT as we get closer to <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-plans-for-crowdloan-coins-reserved-to-thank-community-3ed48ab3a63d">crowdloan</a> and mainnet launch on KILT’s continuous path to decentralisation. In addition to building and auditing our technology, we have been fine-tuning our token economy in order to incentivise functionalities in the network, while simultaneously aiming to avoid the pitfalls of high inflation.</p><p>We are delighted to present our <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19_KILT_Token_Metrics_Revised_Version.pdf">updated token metrics</a> to you, the KILT community. These tokenomics are revised from KILT’s initial framework.</p><p>The KILT Coin is critical to operating KILT; it is needed to perform credential verification transactions on KILT’s blockchain and also powers governance. There will be a limited supply of KILT Coins that are gradually introduced into the system over&nbsp;time.</p> Key Metrics   Total supply at Token Generation Event (TGE): 150 million pre-minted KILT&nbsp;Coins.  Initial circulating supply: 32.5&nbsp;million.  The remaining pre-minted coins will be gradually unlocked over a period of 6 to 60&nbsp;months.  Initial inflation will be around 5% per annum, dropping to 1% per annum within the first 6 years and then slowly moving towards&nbsp;0%.  There would be only one KILT network and one KILT Coin, regardless of whether KILT moves from Kusama to a Polkadot parachain, as determined by community governance.  <p>And it’s important to remember that <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilts-parachain-plans-an-update-efb9a9e35394">KILT’s parachain will launch</a> with significant activated functionality — staking for collators and delegators, and the initial token economy outlined in our tokenomics document. This means the first phase of staking will be possible on KILT from&nbsp;genesis.</p> Migration of KILT from Kusama to Polkadot Parachain <p>The tokenomics is designed to reward the KILT Treasury with 10 million KILT Coins linearly over the first five years. In the future, governance may decide to exchange these accumulated KILT Coins for DOT and use them to bid for a Polkadot parachain slot.</p><p>If KILT moves from Kusama to Polkadot, we assume that governance would transfer the existing KILT Coins without changing the balances or owners of these KILT Coins, and without changing the metrics and economics.</p><p>We hope the community finds this tokenomics update useful. By carefully designing the framework for the KILT system, we aim to enable a new economy around the KILT&nbsp;Coin.</p><p>Finally, we want to thank our builders and partners for supporting KILT’s mission of restoring digital identity and dignity to the individual.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-token-economy-an-update-db207611f5ce">KILT Token Economy: An Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Hello Monethians! We’ve are hard at work accomplishing the goals set in Monetha’s Roadmap for 2021. These past months proved to be fruitful and we would like to share with you what has been achieved since we last spoke. So, let’s get into&nbsp;it.</p> Validation of the&nbsp;concept <p>Our main goal for H1 2021 was to validate the concept of the Monetha Identity and make sure that it is valuable both for businesses and consumers. As stated in the roadmap, we aimed to fulfill three main objectives:</p>  Onboard advisors,  Determine data points with high value for businesses,  Engage early adopters from eCommerce businesses.  <p>We have been working closely with several eCommerce shops from the United Kingdom and Baltic states, testing our ideas and assumptions under real-life conditions to find out what value zero-party and first-party data can bring and what exactly it should be to have the best&nbsp;effect.</p><p>As a result, we have shaped a solid basis to the B2B side of the Monetha Identity platform. Its value goes far beyond simply bringing businesses zero-party data from Monetha Identity users. Instead, it aims to bring businesses ready-to-use marketing insights based on all data they have. The solution enriches first-party data that businesses already have with Monetha’s zero-party data and analyzes it as a whole using machine learning algorithms.</p><p>We also have onboarded affiliate and loyalty program advisors from Italy, Spain, France and Poland. They will be handling regional markets and validating our product-market fit&nbsp;there.</p> Monetha Identity application <p>The team is currently focused on the analytical part of the solution, i.e., turning raw data into valuable insights while keeping it in accordance with GDPR and other privacy acts. All development works on the improved MVP are going to begin in September.</p><p>Starting from October, a new Product Director of Monetha Identity with vast experience in eCommerce loyalty will join Monetha. He will be leading the development of the consumer part of the solution and, among other things, help to design the most effective utilization of MTH token within the whole ecosystem.</p><p>The Monetha team thanks you for your continued support and we can’t wait to share more news with you when they will be ready for a public announcement. In the meantime, you can reach us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Monetha.io">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Monetha_io">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monetha/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://t.me/monethagroup">Telegram</a>.

<p>IDnow enables an automated identity verification solution for highly regulated use cases, complying with Anti-Money-Laundering-Law in Europe, including Germany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, August 12th, 2021, IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, is expanding its automated solution AutoIdent for additional highly regulated use cases, including areas regulated by the Anti Money Laundering Act (AML/GwG), such as banks and financial service providers.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent is an AML Act compliant identity verification solution that operates as an automated process and meets the high-security requirement. It serves a wide range of industries and use cases, such as opening a bank account, signing a loan agreement, or onboarding a player for online gaming. Taking advantage of a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) and existing online bank accounts of the user, it seamlessly blends state-of-the-art technologies with existing identity and banking data into an easy, secure and fully compliant identity verification process.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent including QES, is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1) d). The process can include a one-cent-bank transfer, turning it into a fully compliant remote onboarding solution in accordance with the German AML Act – Geldwäschegesetz (GwG), under Section §12 sentence 1 Nr 3. According to the AML law, automated identity proofing in connection with a reference transaction is permitted, pursuant to Article 32 eIDAS.</p>
<p>“Our belief in providing an advanced identity verification platform which increases security improves conversion and streamlines our customers’ onboarding process across geographical borders drives us forward. By making our automated solution AML-compliant with additional regulations, our customers can offer a faster process and therefore a better user experience while ensuring high security and regulatory standards. This gives our customers, who operate in a constantly evolving environment, the peace of mind and the flexibility to choose the solution that meets their needs best,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO at IDnow.</p>
<p>The IDnow platform, which includes AutoIdent as a building block, effortlessly orchestrates all necessary components into a seamless, secure and AML-compliant identity verification.</p>
<p>Depending on the customer’s needs, the onboarding process offers total flexibility. Further components of the IDnow platform can added, e.g., eSign, the add-on for the digital contract signing opening up additional use cases such as taking out a consumer loan in a wholly digital process.</p>
<p>In recent years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 800 customers worldwide. In 2021, IDnow acquired the French market leader for identity technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German identity Trust Management AG, enabling IDnow to offer its customers one of the broadest identification solutions through a single, integrated platform.</p>

				  Jointly-developed LAVCE platform solves the problems of privacy and security for sharing sensitive health data, such as COVID tests and vaccine records.   
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, August 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Indico, the leading developer of decentralized identity blockchain networks and software, in a partnership with Liquid Avatar Technologies, a publicly listed, global blockchain, digital identity and fintech solutions company and Vector Laboratories (“Vector Labs”), an Ontario, Canada licensed laboratory healthcare verification organization , have launched the first Canadian blockchain-based decentralized identity solution for issuing and verifying COVID test results. </p>
<p>Supported by Indicio’s credential exchange tools, the Liquid Avatar Verifiable Credential Ecosystem (LAVCE) enables people to receive a digital credential from Vector Labs confirming their COVID test result. This can be verified when it is presented without an individual having to share any private, personal data or be tracked. LAVCE can be integrated with healthcare facilities, testing labs, government agencies, schools,  sports arenas, transportation, trade shows, and workplaces to confirm health status and assist efforts to reduce new outbreaks. It combines a mobile app from Liquid Avatar for individuals, a SaaS model platform for healthcare issues, and a software development kit (SDK) that can power mobile apps, corporate portals, and government websites. This approach makes it possible for all types of organizations to support digital wallets and verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>“Liquid Avatar Technologies shares Indicio’s vision—the world needs technology that works for people by delivering real privacy and security,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “When we launched the Indicio Network, we saw the need for a space for innovative companies to collaborate on changing how we manage identity, enable verification, and create trust. Our partnership with Liquid Avatar Technologies, one of many, shows what can happen when innovators solve pressing problems with ground-breaking technology.”</p>
<p>Both Indicio and Liquid Avatar are steering committee members of the Linux Foundation Public Health’s Cardea project, designed to provide public health agencies around the world with open source interoperable privacy-preserving technology to manage COVID testing and vaccination. The LAVCE credential also aligns with the Global COVID Credential Network and the Good Health Pass Collaborative.</p>
<p>“LAVCE is leading the market for interoperable, privacy-preserving identity that provides a flexible yet uniform approach to revealing health and other verifications when necessary” said David Lucatch, CEO. “Privacy and security of personal data is essential to a ‘return to normal’ and a host of other activities.  Having a patchwork of systems can quickly get out of hand. Supported by the expertise of Indicio, LAVCE makes it quick and easy to handle test data and other verifiable credentials in a way that earns people’s trust, keeps them safe, and helps open up society.”</p>
<p>Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. is a minority equity holder in Indicio.tech</p>

Before we dive into explaining this amazing opportunity, we don’t want to waste your time. So,&nbsp;if you don’t have Australian&nbsp;citizenship or&nbsp;permanent residency,&nbsp;or if you are representing a&nbsp;recruitment agency or an&nbsp;offshore/provider, then this&nbsp;is not for you. We understand you may be an awesome candidate, or have access to great candidates, but we will not consider such applications at this time.




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Lead&nbsp;for&nbsp;our&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;team, where you can contribute to the success of our product team developing our globally awarded personal data platform. The Meeco platform is comprised of suite of products including a decentralised wallet, key management store, exchange for identity, credentials &amp; tokens and secure data enclave (vault).




 




At Meeco we build the tools to enable people and organisation to access, protect and create mutual value from personal data. We are personal data pioneers offering a range solutions powered by Meeco and decentralised on Hedera Hashgraph.




 




We are passionate about building a new digital economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, for the benefit of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organisations enter a relationship of mutual value and build a new, more meaningful way to personalise digital services. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more about our thinking and the vision that drives us.




 




We have built a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia, Belgium and the UK. Collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, and each bring a unique personal data story that advances our mission.




 About the role 





 




We are a global team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK. The platform team currently consists of 17, responsible for designing, implementing, supporting and documenting several services that, all together, form the backbone of our platform.




 




Currently our technology stack consists mainly of several Ruby on Rails, Elixir and Java components for the backend services. For frontend, we primarily use Javascript and Dart for smartphone and decentralised applications, based upon blockchain and distributed ledger technology.




 




We’re a company that embraces innovation, so it is likely that our technology stack will continue to evolve and change. We are not averse to adding other technologies if the need arises for specific services.




 




We take pride in building software that is easy to understand, clean, well-structured and properly tested. We have formed our own opinions on how to write good code that are a result of programming for more than two decades. Sometimes, we have even found ourselves going against the popular vote on several topics.




 




• We favour the explicit over the implicit




 




• We treat frameworks as tools and not as an unquestionable authority




 




• We embrace the relational database and its possibilities and as such treat it as a first order citizen.




 




The following will help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis:




 




• Being a technical leader; mentoring, triaging problems, offering a guiding hand




 




• Coming up with a detailed plan on how to approach high-level requirements including tasks and&nbsp;estimations




 




• Supporting the team to allocate and distribute the work according to individual capabilities




 




• Designing and implementing&nbsp;new services&nbsp;with business logic called from&nbsp;existing &amp; new&nbsp;endpoints




 




• Investigating bug reports that inevitably occur, helping a colleague identify problems




 




• Reviewing and approving Pull Requests




 




• Implementing data integrations to&nbsp;enable end-users access public&nbsp;and&nbsp;private&nbsp;data, this might include open banking,&nbsp;social, health, wearable, weather, travel or IoT&nbsp;data




 




• Working&nbsp;with the&nbsp;latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> &amp; <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a>&nbsp;Standards&nbsp;for&nbsp;implementations for distributed ledger&nbsp;implementations including Verifiable Credentials, Distributed Identity including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>




 




• Working on leading-edge payments solutions including micro-payments and tokens




 




• Contributing to a more transparent, open and trust-based personal data eco-system.




 About you 





 




We are looking for someone who has a deep understanding of how to write RESTful resources exposed as APIs, cares about clean code (a lot) and is ready to learn (a lot). It is a big plus if you have experience writing these web-based applications in Ruby on Rails and/or in building decentralized applications in blockchain technologies.




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the center, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical solutions. Google won’t help you as much in this case as it requires a combination of existing tech and emerging solutions. One class of technology that we are exploring and see great potential is in the distributed ledger space. A good understanding and professional experience building decentralised applications or dealing with DLT is a big plus.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most.




 




In addition to established experience as a developer, we expect that you have at least 2+ years experience in steering a team. using an agile methodology, be it scrum or a derivative.




 




You are able to support our executive team (Technology, Product, Design and Commercial Officers) in writing up technical proposals, along with translating Meeco’s technical vision into practical goals that support the commercialisation of our products.




 




The following is our crazy wish-list. It is not necessary that you have all this experience, but the more proven competencies you have will increase your chances of success in the role:




 




• You have taken lead on directing and implementing solutions to complex, unbounded (technical) problems based on limited scope




 




• You have a track record of setting direction for teammates




 




• You know how to take steps in improving the quality of existing and future software




 




• You are comfortable communicating your ideas both verbally as well as written. We love to create diagrams to describe future systems.




 




• You have used more than one programming language to build software, which can&nbsp;of course include&nbsp;hobby&nbsp;and passion&nbsp;projects




 




• We have a soft spot for functional programming, so maybe you have too




 




• We build both&nbsp;backend&nbsp;and frontend&nbsp;applications, so&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;any relevant frontend programming experience, especially with JavaScript, TypeScript and/or Angularjs&nbsp;would be awesome




 




• You have used languages with built-in concurrency models like Go, Erlang, or Elixir




 




• If you have a language you love, tell us about it!




 




• You have a good understanding of what goes on in a RDBMS, especially Postgresql. You are familiar with devops&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft Azure&nbsp;would be a bonus.




 




• You know how to use Docker and Kubernetes.




 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have a team to show you the ropes. A good set of solid programming skills, natural leadership and to care about our mission is all you need.




 




You might have a computer science or related degree, or you might not. This is not what we are about. We care about what you know now and how you are improving yourself every day.




 




This is a job where we&nbsp;support&nbsp;remote work.&nbsp;However, we do have an office at Stone &amp; Chalk at Docklands in Melbourne. Given the leadership and mentoring aspects of the role,– we would like you to be in the office at least three days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and self directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed. We love you asking for help!




 





 What we offer 




We pay a competitive start-up package based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 What we have achieved 




We are&nbsp;early&nbsp;pioneers&nbsp;in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012. You can read more on our achievements and announcements on our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/">blog</a>.

Awards: We have won&nbsp;eight&nbsp;international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands and Germany for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: In December 2019 we launched our secure data vault inside KBC’s (Belgium) banking app, recently we  launched a media platform&nbsp;for kids&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it</a>&nbsp;and have just shipped the first version of our new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/be/app/meeco-wallet/id1570355469">decentralised identity Wallet</a>. These are just three great examples of how enterprises and other start-ups are using our technology to developer better Privacy and Security by Design personal data solutions.




 




Innovation:&nbsp;Through&nbsp;2020&nbsp;we doubled our engineering team along&nbsp;with some really interesting&nbsp;blockchain/distributed ledger&nbsp;projects&nbsp;which we are currently&nbsp;productising&nbsp;to launch throughout&nbsp;2021.

<p>From 2015 to 2021 we have seen an upheaval in crypto regulation. In that time, regulators and supranational organizations, such as the FATF, have begun to set standards and expectations to address financial crime in crypto. As more jurisdictions issue guidance to apply their existing frameworks to the cryptoasset world, one trend has emerged: the manner in which a jurisdiction regulates cryptoasset products will likely mirror its approach to traditional financial product. Countries with laissez-faire attitudes toward market regulation have, broadly, more quickly accepted cryptoassets than those that enact stronger controls over traditional financial products.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I’ve always been a bit baffled by the enduring popularity of MySQL. I mean, it’s great and we have been using it in many internal projects for years, but what makes it so popular even nowadays, when the competition from other vendors, commercial or open-source, is so strong? And yet, 26 years after the first release, MySQL is still the most popular open-source database in the world, an integral part of every web development stack, the one product you expect to find on every hosting platform, and, of course, in every public cloud.</p>
 MySQL: a database for all applications? 
<p>Developers love MySQL because it’s easy to deploy and operate, the learning curve is extremely low, it implements a “de facto standard” connection interface, and, most importantly, it’s lightweight and fast. Well, at least to a certain extent.</p>
<p>While “vanilla” MySQL is perfectly capable for small- or medium-scale projects, its popularity extends to the enterprise world as well, with companies like Facebook or Siemens operating massive infrastructures with database instances expertly tuned for high performance and availability. Other companies opt for managed offerings offered by cloud service providers – every major CSP has its own database service based on MySQL but augmented with its native services and sometimes with proprietary advanced capabilities.</p>
<p>However, even when highly tuned for the performance of transactional (OLTP) workloads, MySQL just isn’t designed for analytical processing (OLAP), since its database engine simply lacks the necessary functionality. Thus, even the most hardcore MySQL fans must face the necessity of a data movement and integration process with a separate database optimized for analytics. This process is not only time-consuming and expensive but also prone to significant security and compliance risks, especially in a public cloud.</p>
 Same database, but 1000x faster! 
<p>Back in December 2020, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/mysql-analytics-engine-almost-too-good-to-be-true">we have already covered the solution</a> Oracle offers for this problem: the service that at the time was called MySQL Analytics Engine - renamed MySQL HeatWave soon after. Based on the in-memory database technology that the company has perfected over the years in the labs and real-world environments, the service is designed to run alongside an existing managed MySQL database, access its transactional data directly, optimize it for OLAP processing, and execute analytical queries, returning the results as if they were obtained by MySQL database itself.</p>
<p>From the user’s perspective, this works completely transparently, with the additional infrastructure fully managed by Oracle. The only metrics that change for a customer are performance (thousands of times faster than any plain MySQL) and cost (much lower thanks to the software being optimized for low-cost compute, storage, and networking on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure).</p>
<p>Fast forward to August 10th, 2021, and the company has just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUbnOTlJ7mI">announced the next major release</a> of the service with a machine learning-based automation capability called MySQL Autopilot. The unique value remains the same: Oracle Cloud customers can keep their data in the same MySQL database and still easily and efficiently run complex analytical queries against it, without any third-party tools or processes involved. However, the service is now significantly faster than before with the addition of MySQL Autopilot and the new Scale-Out Data Management layer.</p>
 Autopilot is not just for cars 
<p>The new HeatWave release incorporates multiple performance improvements thanks to its AI-based decision logic that uses a combination of automated analysis methods to identify the most efficient data management and query execution parameters, which are continuously optimized even further as the service learns on new queries. HeatWave is designed to tune its ML models separately for each user and can now even predict how the optimization will improve in the future with explainable change recommendations.</p>
<p>Other newly introduced AI-based capabilities include memory usage prediction that helps estimate the required cluster size just from a small sample of existing data; concurrent execution optimization that ensures that short queries are prioritized over the longer ones running in parallel, thus delivering interactive results earlier which is useful for mixed workloads; and significantly improved internal scalability to ensure that reload times remain constant regardless of the data size.</p>
<p>All these optimizations, according to Oracle, lead to the ability of the service to outperform its major competitors by a factor of at least 1400x, while remaining more economical in terms of overall cost than any other managed MySQL service. I’m sure you’ll find many tests and comparisons on Oracle’s website, but for me, the cost factor is not the most important by far.</p>
 Security and compliance benefits 
<p>At KuppingerCole, we focus primarily on the security of database solutions and compliance aspects of storing and processing data in the cloud. The very idea that your data no longer needs to move between data stores with different access models and security controls or that it has to be exposed to a complex and error-prone ETL process has massive security and compliance implications: this dramatically reduces the risks of accidental exposure that leads to data breaches, and, inevitably, to compliance fines. It’s also worth noting that HeatWave now enforces full data encryption, both at rest and in transit – a setting that users cannot deactivate.</p>
<p>In a way, Oracle continues to bridge the gap in functionality between MySQL, its popular open-source product, and the Oracle Database (ODB), the flagship enterprise one. One could argue that everything HeatWave can offer now, ODB already could do years ago. However, the company is making this functionality available to an entirely new audience, ensuring that people can utilize their familiar technology for new business use cases without the need to change anything in their existing applications.</p>
<p>And, of course, by being fully compatible with MySQL-based services offered by competitors (like Amazon Aurora or RDS) at the API level, HeatWave makes it easy for potential customers to migrate to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, while still avoiding the danger of vendor lock-in. After all, MySQL is MySQL on every platform, and if you ever have to move away from Oracle, you’ll face no technical difficulties whatsoever. Well, other than a 1000x performance drop, that is…</p>

A brief history of the infrastructure bill’s crypto controversy <p>Let’s catch up. Last Monday, we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-171-how-crypto-will-be-regulated-in-the-u-s-1185eddf7c6e">chatted about the U.S. infrastructure bill</a>, and how crypto found itself included as a potential source of tax revenue to help fund some of the stuff we’d like to build in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>That in and of itself is not necessarily contentious. The issue was around the use of the term “broker” and how it was too broadly defined such that anyone — developers, node operators, users might all be lumped under the umbrella of “broker.”</p><p>Around the time that I published last week’s newsletter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/us/politics/infrastructure-deal-cryptocurrency.html">last minute concessions</a> pushed by the crypto industry and its lobbyists had just made its way into the bill. It seemed like that may have been the end of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Instead, a “fierce lobbying war” ensued as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the Biden administration <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/06/crypto-bitcoin-infrastructure-senate/">fought the&nbsp;changes</a>.</p><p>And so — lines were drawn and key players emerged. Because crypto is apparently <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/09/cryptocurrency-influence-washington-infrastructure-fight-502792">a really big&nbsp;deal</a>:</p><blockquote>“This has definitely been a wake-up call to crypto,” said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbying group. “But on the flip side, I think Washington is starting to see that crypto is more of a force than anybody ever anticipated.”</blockquote><p>Jake Chervinksy has <a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1423653975459516416">a great tweetstorm explainer of the ongoing battles and warring factions</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a>) — Senators Wyden, Lummis, and Toomey on the side of crypto, Senators Portman and Warner on the other, and Yellen and the Biden administration looking nervously on.</p><p>But as of Sunday night, no agreement had been&nbsp;reached.</p> 2. An overview of Team&nbsp;Wyden <p>From <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/09/cryptocurrency-influence-washington-infrastructure-fight-502792">Politico</a>:</p><blockquote>Lobbyists scored a clear victory by winning over Wyden, the top Senate Democrat responsible for writing tax legislation. Wyden, who has served in Congress for four decades, has long had a soft spot for emerging technologies.</blockquote><blockquote>His Democratic predecessor at the helm of the Finance Committee, Max Baucus of Montana, was hired earlier this year as an adviser to the digital currency exchange&nbsp;Binance.</blockquote><blockquote>Wyden teamed up with Toomey and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) to offer an amendment to scale back the tax reporting rules so they would not capture software developers and miners. The proposal put Wyden at odds with the White House and fellow Democrats. In response, Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), in cooperation with the Biden administration, came up with an alternative amendment that would have fewer exclusions.</blockquote><blockquote>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen personally spoke with Wyden to push back against his amendment, an administration official said. She and the White House believed his language would tie Treasury’s hands when it came time to develop regulations spelling out the details of how the rules would&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>“Crypto’s success with Wyden is one of the most fascinating D.C. influence developments of 2021, and one I suspect other industries will be studying throughout the rest of the decade,” said Jeff Hauser, who tracks corporate lobbying as executive director of the Revolving Door&nbsp;Project.</blockquote><blockquote>Wyden said in a statement that he has spent his career “working from the proposition that Congress needs smart answers to tech policy that actually improve people’s&nbsp;lives.”</blockquote><blockquote>“When civil rights groups, tech experts and folks in Oregon raised concerns that this provision could be interpreted to regulate independent developers and force programmers to create government backdoors, I took their concerns seriously,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote> 3. The Toomey-Warner-Lummis-Sinema-Portman amendment <p>And then Monday afternoon, <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/toomey-warner-lummis-sinema-portman-announce-agreement-on-digital-asset-reporting-requirements-in-infrastructure-bill">a compromise emerged between the two factions</a>:</p><blockquote>“There’s broad agreement that digital asset exchanges behaving as brokers should be required to report transactions just like other kinds of brokers already do. There is also concern that tax evasion and non-compliance are becoming significant issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Some have expressed confusion concerning the underlying text of the infrastructure bill, suggesting it would result in the application of reporting requirements far too broadly and ensnare individuals, developers, and other elements of this ecosystem that could not comply with a reporting mandate.</blockquote><blockquote>“We’ve worked with the Treasury Department to clarify the underlying text and ensure that those who are not acting as brokers will not be subject to the bill’s reporting requirements.

What Gary Gensler and the SEC is up&nbsp;to Photo: Third Wave Think&nbsp;Tank<p>The new SEC chief <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03">spoke at Aspen last week</a>. First, he’s on the same page as Jay Clayton on the topic of&nbsp;ICOs.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-chair-gensler-agrees-with-predecessor-every-ico-is-a-security">They’re all securities</a>:</p><blockquote>“Generally, folks buying these tokens are anticipating profits, and there’s a small group of entrepreneurs and technologists standing up and nurturing the projects,” Gensler said in prepared remarks. “I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities, without required disclosures or market oversight.”</blockquote><p>Gensler also hinted that the SEC might start targeting exchanges next:</p><blockquote>“A typical trading platform has more than 50 tokens on it. In fact, many have well in excess of 100 tokens. While each token’s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50 or 100 tokens, any given platform has zero securities,” Gensler&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata-f62e200a-033e-41ee-a5dd-ece2362c2ef3.html">Dan Primack on&nbsp;Gensler</a>:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: While Gensler is less hard-line than Clayton on existing laws being all that are needed to regulate this new world of digital tokens, he’s quite firm in his view that much of the investment in crypto is driven by speculation and hope of profits — and should be regulated as&nbsp;such.</blockquote>  “Standing astride [of the law] isn’t a sustainable place to be,” he&nbsp;warned.  <blockquote>Details: Gensler noted that while existing laws are quite clear when it comes to figuring out if something is a security, his agency may need new laws from Congress to help better regulate new crypto trading platforms.</blockquote>  He also said that some of them “are trying to play arbitrage between the jurisdictions” of various countries, making it all the more important for his agency to have the right&nbsp;tools.  The emergence of the “decentralized finance” protocols that let participants execute various transactions directly with each other instead of using intermediaries are creating new unregulated ways for people to engage in activities that would otherwise fall under strict&nbsp;rules.  Gensler also signaled his agency could move to finally approve some form of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund — a vehicle many have tried to get approval for, unsuccessfully so far given regulators’ concerns over market manipulation risks.  Also on his watch list: stablecoins, which he noted can be used to get around regulatory oversight.  <blockquote>The bottom line: Expect to hear a lot more about cryptocurrencies from the&nbsp;SEC.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile the SEC took actions against <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-145">a DeFi protocol</a> and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-147">a crypto exchange</a> on Friday and Monday, respectively.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-will-police-cryptocurrencies-to-maximum-possible-extent-chair-gary-gensler-says-11628007567">Crypto ‘Wild West’ Needs Stronger Investor Protection, SEC Chief&nbsp;Says</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-chair-gensler-agrees-with-predecessor-every-ico-is-a-security">SEC’s Gensler Agrees With Predecessor: ‘Every ICO Is a Security’ — CoinDesk</a>   5.

 Social Agriculture — understanding Kenyan farmers’ use of social media platforms for agricultural practices Kenyan farmer using a Facebook group to sell&nbsp;produce.<p>Caribou Digital is excited to embark on a new research project to understand how Kenyan farmers use social media platforms as part of their agricultural practices. We’ve spent the last few years in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation exploring the phenomena of platform livelihoods — the <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-working-trading-renting-and-engaging-in-digital-marketplaces-b144ffcc1141">ways people earn a living by working, trading, renting, or engaging in digital marketplaces</a> — and the many diverse ways in which individuals and small businesses are engaging with digital technology. While each of these ways is distinct in its own right, they all have “digital marketplaces” and platformization at their&nbsp;core.</p><p>Beginning in 2019, our early work in this area explored “p<a href="https://mse.financedigitalafrica.org/2019/01/platform-practices/">latform practices</a>”. In 2020, our colleagues conducted a global <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QYDEL-v1.01.pdf">literature review</a> and held <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/qydel2020/">discussions with 80 young platform workers and sellers</a> to establish an overarching approach to Platform Livelihoods, encompassing eight key sectors: microwork and freelancing, local services, asset sharing, farming, micro- and small enterprises, ride-hailing, creatives, and logistics.</p><p>Since then, we have been doing deeper dives into the intersectional topics that make this so urgent — exploring Platform Livelihoods and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">Resilience in the Face of Covid</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/how-can-we-make-platform-livelihoods-better-for-young-women-especially-during-and-after-covid-19-696b3974bf61">Platform Livelihoods and Gender</a> in Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana. This new project will take a deep dive into the new form of “social agriculture” being innovated in Kenya, where Facebook and WhatsApp groups create new connections between farmers and their&nbsp;markets.</p> Research goals <p>This work is exploratory, intended to test and develop our hypothesis that the use of social media is a significant part of Kenyan farmers’ agricultural life. There is <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/micro-and-small-enterprises-mses/">growing evidence </a>of the ways micro-enterprises and entrepreneurs appropriate social media to pursue “social commerce”, and how the tech titans are rushing to fold transaction and commerce support into Instagram, Facebook, WhatApp, and TikTok. We know many farmers are using the same tools — as just two examples, the Digital Farmers Kenya group on Facebook has 431,000 members andhe Kenya Dairy Farmers Forum has 209,000 members. But we don’t know how widespread the farmers’ use of social platforms is, or how these platforms are being used. In short, while the digital development community has come to know a lot about social commerce, it needs to know more about social agriculture.</p><p>Importantly, this is a study based on exploring and understanding what Kenyan farmers are doing themselves with the tools available to them. It is not a study of instrumental (information and communication technologies for development) ICT4D; we are not examining the digitization of agricultural value chains nor studying specialized transaction marketplaces like DigiFarm or Twiga. It is explicitly grounded in our understanding of d<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-transformation-needs-a-narrative-three-takeaways-to-help-define-it-9f06dae3e3aa?source=collection_home---4------6-----------------------">igital transformation as an always ongoing process, irrespective of “developmental”interventions</a>. In this study we seek to understand digital transformation in the context of Kenyans’ use of social media platforms for agricultural practices, and to identify ways in which this might be supported with careful, intentional interventions to mitigate challenges and support Kenyan farmers to make use of the tools and capabilities they already&nbsp;have.</p><p>We’re excited about this research, the insights we anticipate will surface, and the opportunity to work with new partners. We value partnering with locally owned and led firms, and are particularly pleased to partner for this research with Agri Vikundi, owned by a farmer who also runs a large Facebook group for farmers and is a global expert on the use of social media for agriculture. We will share more of the work as we progress, and are looking forward to engaging with those working on similar questions, and welcome questions, comments, and suggestions.</p><p>For any further information, please contact Emrys Schoemaker: <a href="mailto:emrys@cariboudigital.net">emrys@cariboudigital.net</a> or on Twitter at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/emrys_s">@emrys_s</a></p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/cariboudigital">@CaribouDigital</a> on Twitter for&nbsp;more.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/social-agriculture-understanding-kenyan-farmers-use-of-social-media-platforms-for-agricultural-f48203c44b31">Social Agriculture — understanding Kenyan farmers’ use of social media platforms for agricultural…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

We encourage the $OCEAN ecosystem to apply or reapply AND to vote! Thank you to all of the participants, voters, and proposers.</p> OceanDAO Round 9 Announcements and Guidelines  Round 9 Information <p>There is $300,000 USD in grant funding available in Round 9. The maximum request limit per proposal is $17,500&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Please Note: The amount requested is in USD, but the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline (September 7th at midnight GMT). This determines how many OCEAN will be awarded if a proposal is voted to receive a&nbsp;grant.</p><p>A total of $87,500, or approx. 30%, of “Total Round Funding Available” is earmarked for New Projects. Earmarked proposals are eligible for the entire “Total Round Funding Available”; returning (general) grants are eligible for the remaining $212,500, or approx.&nbsp;70%.</p><p>As a builder, submit your project proposal to the <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-9/68">Round 9 Ocean Port Forum</a>. As a voter, this is where you can see all the expanded proposal details to make an informed vote decision.</p><p>Additionally, you can check out the OceanDAO Round 9 <a href="https://www.notion.so/Round-9-Proposals-73ef48e765de43778891faa8172c2488">Proposal Submission Dashboard</a> to see all the proposals in one place as they are submitted.</p><p>The grant proposals from the <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">snapshot ballot</a> that meet these criteria are selected to receive their Funding Amount Requested (in OCEAN) to foster positive value creation for the overall Ocean Protocol ecosystem.</p> Reporting: Updates &amp; Project&nbsp;Standing <p>To provide more transparency across the DAO and help guide projects towards completion, we are introducing a Project Standing Dashboard &amp; system to report&nbsp;updates.</p><p>If you are submitting proposals for grants and actively working on a project, you should submit updates that allow OceanDAO participants to understand your progress.</p><p>It is recommended to focus on the original Grant Deliverables and outcomes promised originally while tackling any challenges, successes, and failures.</p><p>Make sure to update your Project Deliverables to remain in good standing, and continue to Submit Proposals.</p><p>Important note: existing Projects will only be able to participate in the Voting process if their project is in a “Completed” or “Funds Returned” standing.</p><p>Please visit the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p> 1-Project / 1-Proposal: Proposal Template &amp; Advisor&nbsp;Roles <p>Coordination is important in every DAO. To increase transparency and reduce confusion, we are recommending every project reports their “Core Team” and their “Advisors”.</p>  In a given round an individual can only be on one “Core Team” but could be “Advisor” on any number of&nbsp;teams.  If any person is in &gt;1 team as a “Core Team” member, and not an “Advisor”, then every proposal that person is in will be disqualified.  If a “Core Team” member has previously received a grant, any project in the future with that participant will not be eligible for a “New Team”&nbsp;earmark.  <p>We have updated the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Grant-Proposal-Template">Grant Proposal Template</a> to make this easy for teams to communicate their project structure.</p><p>At the end of the day what matters is not how many projects you are on BUT shipping the actual project deliverables. And if you’re unable to ship your deliverables, the community has the ability to ask questions and vote how they&nbsp;choose.</p> Vote Counting: Yes minus No&nbsp;Votes <p>In Round 9 we are introducing a weight to “No Votes”. This means that “No Votes” will be used to calculate a “Final Score” for each proposal. Projects that receive greater than 50% Yes Votes, will then have a “Final Score” calculated by the formula&nbsp;below.</p><p>Final Score = Yes Votes - No&nbsp;votes</p><p>Grantees are determined by highest “Final Score”. Funds are distributed in descending order, until there are no funds remaining. Any remaining funds will be&nbsp;burned.</p> Decentralizing Rules: Bot&nbsp;Checking <p>In Round 9 we are taking initiatives to further decentralization. This means that select project deadlines will be determined by&nbsp;DAOBot.</p><p>DAOBot Deadlines:</p>  Your proposal needs to be submitted by Proposal Submission Deadline&nbsp;date.  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/project-criteria#details-of-criteria">Requiring 500 OCEAN</a> (criteria #3) will be determined by DAOBot. You need to have 500 OCEAN in specifically an ETH Wallet address (OCEAN on other blockchains will not be accepted for the 500 minimum parameter; eg BSC or Polygon are ineligible).  Existing projects need their [Proposal Standing] to be in “Completed” or “Refunded” to participate in the Voting&nbsp;process.  First time projects receive a [Proposal Standing] after Voting&nbsp;ends.  <p>Projects that submit their proposals at the very end or do not engage early enough to resolve their Project Standing may not be eligible for&nbsp;Voting.</p> Funding Round — Rules &amp; Timing&nbsp;Updates   Proposals Submission Deadline is September 7th at midnight&nbsp;GMT  A 2 day proposal due diligence window, ending Sep 9th, 2021 at 23:59&nbsp;GMT  Voting Starts &amp; Add OCEAN to Voting Wallet By Sep 9th, 2021 at 23:59&nbsp;GMT  Voting Ends on Sep 13, 2021 at 23:59 GMT (*voting window increased by 12hrs in Round&nbsp;9)  <p>If your Proposal is voted to receive a grant, please submit a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Request-Grant-Guidelines">Request Invoice</a> to the Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF) for the Ocean Granted amount, if you haven’t&nbsp;already,</p> OceanDAO Ecosystem <p>Continue to support and track progress on all of the Grant Recipients <a href="https://www.notion.so/Grant-Recipients-3cadee15c7c14ee2a6f1ab61de70dfc2">here</a>!</p><p>Much more to come — join our <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Town-Hall">Town Halls</a> to stay up to date.

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Graham some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>How would you describe the current state of the IoT industry sector?</p>
<p>
If there was one word to use to characterize the current state of the IT sector, it would be ‘exciting.’ The current situation we have is over the last few years, there has been a significant decrease in the cost of equipment, infrastructure, and there has been a significant increase in the functionality of that infrastructure. So, we are at a juncture where things that weren't viable just a few years ago now are, and I would encourage any organization to think through how they can make use of automated processes, monitoring of things that were too expensive to monitor before and see how they could improve their customer service through the use of IoT (Internet of Things). Because if they're not, it’s likely their competitors are, so focus on what you can do, analyse the cost of doing that and then run an experiment and see if it's going to generate the facilities that you'd like to. </p>
<p>I mean, if we just think back a few years, we can now in the packaging industry, track a package from here in Australia through to Munich in Germany, and we can do that real-time. It's a phenomenal capability we now have. If we think in the industry 4.0 area, we can now assist in a manufacturing process far better than we ever have been able to do before. Can I tell you a little story? Penfolds wine is a Penfold producer here in Australia, ships to China. One of the problems they do have is counterfeiting of their wine. So, one of the features now, the factors that they used in determining whether a wine is counterfeit is the level of filling in a bottle through their IoT systems. They fill a bottle to 750 ml to the micro millimeter. So obviously in comparison with the counterfeiter, that's a significant benefit. So, think through the things that you can do with IoT, give it a shot. And I think we'll find that the viability of an IoT supportive process is pretty significant these days.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A recent survey indicated that many IoT deployments fail to achieve expectations. Why is that?</p>
<p>
I think there’re several factors that lead to this level of satisfaction that you achieve from an IoT installation. One of the features that we have with IoT industries is quite fragmented, which means that you have to have a good understanding of the capability of a vendor or a consulting organization that you might engage to help with your actual deployment. And I'll be the first one to agree that that's not easy. Now, many of the vendors [and] customers that were actually part of that survey had actually done an experimental deployment. So, they had this idea and they wanted to try it and see how it worked.</p>
<p>And in doing that, they didn't really know what their expectations were. And if you don't know what your expectations are, it's pretty hard to meet them. So, I would suggest that as you enter into the IT space – if it's the first-time installation for you – that you think through what it is you want to achieve. You document what you want to achieve. You communicate to others in your organization, what you want to achieve. And then that will help make sure that that implementation will actually do what you're trying to achieve for that particular installation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can be done to increase the level of satisfaction for IoT deployments? </p>
<p>
As with many projects, good project management is very important for an IoT deployment and project management comes in two parts. First, the planning phase, and then there's the execution phase. In the planning phase, you must determine what the requirements are for the project. What are the deliverables for the project? You must engage the correct stakeholders for that. So, the more communication you do with you and your organization to tell people what you're trying to achieve, the more people will come, [be] interested in what you're doing, assist with what you're doing, and the net result then, will have a wider base to determine if it's satisfactory for what they want. The execution phase is important to have a steering committee. So again, you're engaging people within the organization. It's not just one little group in the group in the organization is going ahead and doing this.  </p>
<p>You're engaging with a wider base in your organization. And the steering committee is responsible for reviewing progress. You need to make sure that you do set the progress for what sort of schedule you’re going to be on, what are the milestones you want to achieve? What is the budget for that particular project? And once that's approved, you need to manage to that. So, the execution phase requires the review process to happen. It requires the steering committee to be active in removing roadblocks to the project. And with that wider base, that's looking at focusing on helping with the project deployment, we'll find the satisfaction going up. The number of successful projects that we're going to achieve will increase.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How important is cybersecurity to IoT deployments? </p>
<p>
I made a projection a couple of years ago that we were going to experience a catastrophic event in the IoT space. Now we have had some interesting events happen, nothing I would classify as catastrophic yet. So, I will still hold to that. If there's one area that we need to apply all the knowledge and the tools that we have, it's in IoT. So, at the device level, we need to make sure how are we managing those? Who has access to them? What sort of a process do we go through when we update them? At the controller level, we need to know who's got access to those. What's the access control list within those devices. At the SCADA level, if we've got a SCADA system, that's a computer that we need to protect just as we protect other computers within our organization.  </p>
<p>So, we need to include that in our cybersecurity strategy and tie it into the tools that we have. Now, if we've got a security operation center, it should be monitoring our IoT systems as well. Then there's the output of IoT systems. IoT systems generate a lot of data. In many cases, that data is not properly looked after. And there's people that would be competitors who would be very interested in that data. And so, we need to use the normal processes we have of protecting our data, make sure the database has the security controls on it we want. Make sure we aggregate data and then delete. The chronic problem in IoT systems is the volume of data we need to aggregate it and then delete what we don't need. We need to make sure that we anonymize data if it's going to be put into a place where other people can get a hold of it. </p>
<p>So, we need to think through all of those things that in the information technology centre side, we're pretty good at and apply them to the operational technology side when it comes to IoT data. If we look at some of the problems we've had in the cybersecurity field. So, it was an account takeover problem in a water filtration plant in Florida earlier this year, that could well have been avoided by making sure that the IoT system had the same security level supply to it as we do in the information technology side. So, there should be no remote management software on an IoT system. And please make sure you don't have any mail server anywhere close to any IoT system. And then there was the problem that we had with the software being injected, malware being injected into software, distributed to thousands of companies, you know, we need to make sure that we put the protection in place that allows that to be caught. And I think the industry has done an excellent job of making sure they close that loop. So, let's apply some of the knowledge that we have from the information technology side, in the operational technology side. </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>What advice would you give to someone deploying their first-IoT infrastructure? </p>
<p>
That it would be a very exciting time deploying the first IoT deployment solution. If there was one thing that I would say you must do is manage expectations, make sure that the people that are monitoring that project and looking at its deliverables, know what their expectations are for that particular project. I think you need to make sure that that initial deployment isn't too big. Don't try and boil the ocean on your first try. What you want to do is to have a limited deployment that allows you to gain experience and the experience that the team builds up in its initial deployment obviously is going to then feed through to the rest of the project so that we might then think of. So, segment your solution, do one bit at a time, and make sure that you communicate and celebrate the success that you have as you proceed. And so, communication is a very important part of that initial IoT deployment to make sure that people are aware of what it is you're trying to achieve. And then use that when they say, okay, we've achieved it. </p>

<p>Verifiable Credentials help you build solutions that empower customers to manage their own data. </p> Sunsetting the Attestation Protocol.<br> <p>Bloom has been at the forefront of decentralized identity development since 2017. Back then, there were no existing Decentralized Identity standards or specifications to guide the engineering efforts. Bloom created from scratch a proprietary attestation protocol and developer tooling around it. The attestation core protocol was built using Whisper and Ethereum with its main features being requesting, issuing and sharing attestations. </p><p>On November 19th, 2019 the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">Word Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">published</a> the Verifiable Credential (VC) open standard. The new W3C-VC specification became the accepted standard for building VC based applications and tools. </p><p>To transition fully to the W3C VC standard, Bloom decided to deprecate the proprietary attestation format and adopt the new open VC standard. The transition will fulfill the vision of giving Bloom users complete, secure control of their private data, while allowing interoperability with the rest of the VC ecosystem.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials?  <p><br>What is a credential?!</p><blockquote>
<p>A set of one or more claims made by an issuer. A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#ecosystem-overview">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#ecosystem-overview</a></p>
<p><br>We use various types of IDs daily. Whether it's to drive a car, apply for a job, or enter a secure building we need an ID card, a diploma or a secure badge. Today it is difficult to express education, healthcare data, bank account details, and other types of third-party personal information on the Web. The complexity of defining digital credentials on the Web makes it difficult to receive the same benefits that physical documents provide us in the physical world. </p><p>The Verifiable Credentials open standard is a data model that describes how we could handle these types of interactions using the internet privately and securely. The addition of technologies, such as digital signatures, makes verifiable credentials more tamper-evident and more trustworthy than their physical counterparts. </p> How Verifiable Credentials work?<br> <p>There are three main roles involved in a verifiable credential interaction:</p><p>Issuer. A role that is responsible for asserting claims about a subject, creating a verifiable credential based on these claims, and sending the credential to the holder.</p><p>Holder. An entity that acquires, possesses or presents a verifiable credential. Example holders include students, employees, and customers.</p><p>Verifier. A role that is responsible for receiving one or more verifiable credentials for processing. Example verifiers include employers, security personnel, and websites.</p><p>The figure below provides an example verifiable credential ecosystem. As seen in the diagram, the holder of a verifiable credential sits at the center of a triangle of trust, mediating between the issuer and the verifier:</p> 
 The Issuer trusts the Holder 
 The Holder trusts the Verifier 
 The Verifier trusts the Issuer 
 
<p>Any role in the triangle can be played by a person, an institution, a device, or a smart contract.</p><p>Note that anyone can create verifiable credentials, the person or entity verifying the credential decides if they trust the entity that issued it. For example, imagine an American university accepting an International student based on her local high-school diploma.</p> What's Next?<br> <p>The Bloom team is excited about the recent developments in the Decentralized Identity space, especially when it comes to universal Verifiable Credentials. Since publishing the open standard by W3C, Bloom has been working with the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a> and authored one of the first Verifiable Credentials wallet protocols, called WACI. The code was made open-source and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/bloom-donates-waci-790f902ac9bd">donated to the DIF</a>. <br><br>As the Bloom mobile app and its associated services fully migrate to Verifiable Credentials open standard, the users will be prompted to re-claim their credentials. Once your Verifiable Credentials have been claimed, you can sit back and be proud of the fact that you are a part of the Decentralized Identity movement.</p><p>Bloom is excited to have you on board!</p>

Description:  When you show up for work, what persona is on display? Can you truly be yourself in your role? For women in historically male-dominated fields and those with non-traditional backgrounds, it’s unfortunately common to have to hide parts of their identity at work. Richard and Helen discuss this systemic problem, how it’s contributing to the resource gap in fields like cybersecurity, and how we can build different paths for success for people with diverse identities and backgrounds. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [4:30] Helen shares the career path that led her to cybersecurity and her struggles to fit into the field. [6:55] Are you able to bring your authentic self to your workplace? [11:02] The experience that taught Richard just how hard fitting into an industry can be for underrepresented groups. [13:10] The drivers behind unacceptable behaviors among otherwise really smart people. [15:15] Proof that change is finally happening. [20:01] There is no benefit to alienating any group in any industry, even the “old white guys.” [25:22] Signals that are driving people away from the security industry, and how we can start effecting meaningful change.[31:27] The systemic problems behind the socioeconomic and cultural characteristics that lead to shortages in the industry.[32:52] Helen’s advice for leading as a strong female in any career. &nbsp; Quotes:    “My experience with coming into the field as a minority is still commonly shared with a lot of people.”—Helen   “When you show up to your job, are you able to bring your authentic self to the role? —Helen   “We seem to have gotten to a point where, as an industry, we can finally have discussions about this.”—Helen   “You’ve got to start where people are, not where you think they should  be.”—Helen    “Do what you can to be as authentic as possible, and change your environment to enable it.”—Helen     Mentioned in This Episode:  The Ohio State  Office of Compliance and Integrity

  <p>Amazon Web Services is one of the most popular cloud computing platforms on the planet. There’s a good chance you will need to work in an AWS environment, which means publishing to one of their web server services like Elastic Beanstalk. The AWS platform is enormous, and this can be an intimidating task for a developer. Luckily, Amazon has released their AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio 2013-2015 and AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio 2017-2019, which make publishing your web applications to Elastic Beanstalk a snap.</p>

<p>In this article, you will build an ASP.Net MVC web application on .Net 5 using Visual Studio 2019. You will secure this application using Okta. Okta makes it easy to create a secure application with their SSO provider. Once your application is complete you will publish it to a production Elastic Beanstalk instance using the AWS Toolkit.</p>

 What You’ll Need 

 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2019</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5</a> 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">An Okta Developer Account</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">The Okta CLI tool</a> 
   <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&amp;src=default&amp;redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start">An AWS Account</a> 
 

 Write Your MVC Application 

<p>Open Visual Studio 2019 and select Create a new project. Under Templates select ASP.Net Core Web Application and give your application a meaningful name. I named mine <code>Okta_AWSToolkit</code>, and my namespaces in code will reflect that.</p>

<p>Next, press Create then under Create a new ASP.NET Core web application select ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) and ensure that ASP.NET Core 5.0 is selected.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Wait a few moments for Visual Studio to scaffold the project.</p>

<p>Next, you will install the necessary dependencies for the application. In this instance, you will only need the Okta AspNetCore package from NuGet. You can install this with the package command <code>Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 3.5.0</code> or by using the package manager interface.</p>

<p>Your application should have a file called <code>appsettings.json</code>. You will use this as a template for your appsettings files for development and production. Add the following JSON to it.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "",
    "ClientId": "",
    "ClientSecret": "",
    "CallbackPath": "/okta/callback"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This file lacks any sensitive information, so you can check this into your source control. You will populate two files shortly: <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and <code>appsettings.Production.json</code>. For now, you can add those files and add the same template as <code>appsettings.json</code>.</p>

<p>Next, open your <code>HomeController.cs</code> file and add the following code.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Okta_AWSTookit.Models;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Okta_AWSTookit.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; _logger;

        public HomeController(ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Profile");
            }

            return View();
        }

        [ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
        public IActionResult Error()
        {
            return View(new ErrorViewModel { RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This controller has an <code>Index</code> action that will be your home page. Under the <code>Index</code> action you are checking if the user is authenticated. If they are, then you will redirect them to the <code>Profile</code> page, otherwise, they can continue to the Home page.</p>

<p>Next, create a controller called <code>AccountController.cs</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;

namespace Okta_AWSTookit.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Login()
        {
            if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult Logout()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(
            new[]
            {
                OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme
            },
            new AuthenticationProperties()
            {
                RedirectUri = "/Home/Index"
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This controller contains <code>Login</code> and <code>Logout</code> actions. There are no views here since Okta will deliver the login page for you. The <code>Login</code> action should check that the user is not authenticated before returning the <code>ChallengeResult</code>. The <code>Logout</code> action redirects the user to the Home page.</p>

<p>The last controller you need is the <code>Profile</code> controller. Add a new controller called <code>ProfileController.cs</code>. The code follows.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

namespace Okta_AWSTookit.Controllers
{
    public class ProfileController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;ProfileController&gt; _logger;

        public ProfileController(ILogger&lt;ProfileController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [Authorize]
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The only purpose of this controller is to serve the <code>Profile/Index</code> page. The <code>Index</code> action is decorated with the <code>Authorize</code> attribute, which will automatically send unauthenticated users to the Okta login page.</p>

<p>Next, you can begin to work on your views. The first thing to edit is <code>Layout.cshtml</code>. Replace the boilerplate code with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;@ViewData["Title"] - Okta with Jenkins&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-toggleable-sm navbar-light bg-white border-bottom box-shadow mb-3"&gt;
            &lt;div class="container"&gt;
                &lt;a class="navbar-brand" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent"
                        aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"&gt;
                    &lt;span class="navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex justify-content-between"&gt;
                    &lt;ul class="navbar-nav justify-content-end flex-grow-1"&gt;
                        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
                            @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
                            {
                                &lt;form asp-action="Logout" asp-controller="Account" asp-method="POST"&gt;

                                    &lt;input type="submit" value="Logout" class="btn btn-secondary" /&gt;
                                &lt;/form&gt;
                            }
                            else
                            {

                                &lt;a class="btn btn-primary" asp-action="Login" asp-controller="Account"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
                            }
                        &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;main role="main" class="pb-3"&gt;
            @RenderBody()
        &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;footer class="border-top footer text-muted"&gt;
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
            &amp;copy; 2021 - Okta_AWSToolkit - &lt;a asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Much of this code is the same as the boilerplate, with one major exception. You’ve added a <code>Login</code> button to the navbar that turns into a <code>Logout</code> button if the user is authenticated.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>Home/Index.cshtml</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

 <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="display-4"&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a brief tutorial on using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio 2019&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;.Net 5&lt;/a&gt;, Secured with &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written by &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code> 

<p>This page provides some additional information about the project and replaces the standard ASP.NET introduction.</p>

<p>Finally, add a new view for <code>Profile/Index.cshtml</code> and add the following code.</p>

 <code>@*
    For more information on enabling MVC for empty projects, visit https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=397860
*@

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Profile";
}

&lt;div class="jumbotron"&gt;
    Welcome to your Profile
&lt;/div&gt;
</code> 

<p>There’s not much going on here, we just present a page for users to understand that they are authenticated and have made it to the profile page. You can edit this page with whatever code you feel fits here.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to edit your <code>Startup.cs</code> code to enable and configure authentication with Okta. Replace the code in this file with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_AWSTookit
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
            {
                options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
            })
           .AddCookie()
           .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
           {
                // Replace these values with your Okta configuration
               OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
               ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
               ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
               CallbackPath = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:CallbackPath")
           });

            services.AddControllersWithViews();
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
                // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
                app.UseHsts();
            }
            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseStaticFiles();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
            {
                endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This file brings it all together. You have registered the Okta component using the <code>appsettings</code> file that matches your <code>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</code> variable. Now you can easily change your Okta application depending on your environment.</p>

 Create your Okta Development Application 

<p>You’ll need to create an Okta application for your development environment. You can use the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI tool</a>. Download the CLI tool and run <code>okta login</code>. This will walk you through the login process. Once that is completed run <code>okta apps create</code> and follow the prompts on the screen. Select web as your application type. For your Redirect URI, use the web address provided from your application and append <code>/okta/callback</code> to it. For your Post Logout RedirectURI, use the same domain. This time, append <code>/signout/callback</code> to it. If you have multiple authorization servers you can select default for this application. After a moment, the CLI will write your Client Id, Client Secret, and Issuer to a file called <code>.okta.env</code> in the same directory you were working in. Take these values and add them to your <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: you will only need the Domain portion of your Issuer, not the full URL. You can then delete the contents of <code>.okta.env</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time you can begin your project and ensure everything is working as you expect in development mode.</p>

 Set up the Amazon Tool Kit 

<p>Now it’s time to publish your application to your Elastic Beanstalk. You should have already installed the AWS Toolkit extension, but go ahead and install it now if you haven’t. The first time it opens, you’ll see a screen with instructions on how to set up the extension.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The screen will instruct you to log into the IAM Users page in the AWS console and create a user. Click on that link and set up a new user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Create the new user, then attach an administrator or power user policy to the user. Next, you will be presented with the Access Key and Secret Key. Copy and paste those into the AWS Toolkit, then press save, and close.</p>

 Publish to AWS Elastic Beanstalk 

<p>Next, right-click on your project and click Publish to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This will open a new wizard to guide you through the publish process.</p>

<p>First is the application tab. Select Create a new application environment and then select Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Under the Application Environment screen select the production version of your environment. This action will automatically populate the URL for your Elastic Beanstalk instance. You’ll want to check to make sure the URL is available before moving forward.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Under the Options tab, the only change you need to make is to use a t2.micro instance to maintain your free tier status. If you need to scale up later Amazon makes that easy through the AWS Toolkit.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Under the options tab you will want to select the Release configuration.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, on the view tab, click Deploy and wait a few minutes for the site to be published and the server to be live. You will receive a notification when it is ready. From there, you can click the link to your site to see the published version. However, at this time, you will notice your login screen doesn’t work as expected. This is because you still need to populate your production Okta credentials.</p>

 Create Your Okta Production Application 

<p>Open your CLI again and go through the <code>okta apps create</code> wizard. However this time, instead of using the <code>localhost</code> domain provided by Visual Studio, replace the domain in your Redirect URI and Post Logout RedirectURI with the domain at which AWS published your application. After a moment, the CLI will again write your details to <code>.okta.env</code> and you can replace your <code>appsettings.Production.json</code> values with these new ones. Again, only use the domain of your Issuer in the domain field of your appsettings file.</p>

<p>You will need to publish your application to AWS one last time to ensure that the updated <code>appsettings.Production.json</code> reaches the server. Once that is complete you should be able to log in to your application again.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The AWS Toolkit is a powerful tool that helps you integrate with AWS Cloud services easily from Visual Studio. This article is a brief introduction to the capabilities of the tool. If you use AWS for development, I recommend exploring all the features of the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio.</p>

It Is Evident That Blockchain Markets Have Seen An Unprecedented Ride Since The Beginning Of This&nbsp;Year<p>Introduction: Bullish vs. Bearish: Bullish Comeback Or&nbsp;Trap?</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, Bitcoin, Ethereum and the totality of blockchain markets have surged in value at an unprecedented rate. Bitcoin, reached an all time high in mid April of approximately $63,000 per coin and Ethereum, reaching an all time high of $4100 dollars shortly after on May 10th. Since then, cryptocurrencies have seen a major pullback, to a point where Bitcoin has tumbled down to $28,000 (although recently recovering to approximately $42,000) and Ethereum stumbling down to $1800. Although the recent Ethereum London Fork and the consistent burning of Ethereum has been identified as a major catalyst on why Ethereum is roaring back to the $3000 dollar mark. Blockchain markets surpassed two trillion dollars in total market capitalization nearly three months ago, where cryptocurrency markets at the time of writing this article has pulled back to approximately 1.72 trillion dollars. The big question is, are we in a bull market, are we in a bear market, or are we a “Goldilocks Zone” where within the next few weeks we will determine the answer to this question, only time will&nbsp;tell.</p><p>Opinion: Until Bitcoin, Ethereum And Major Altcoins Rally To Near Their All-Time-Highs, We’re Only In An&nbsp;Uptrend</p>The Cycles Of Bitcoin: Bullish And Bearish: Choose Your&nbsp;Side<p>Bitcoin has seen numerous bullish and bearish trends since its inception in 2009; the markets have seen lengthening cycles and diminishing cycles and as of right now, it is difficult to determine such a notion, hence, I will coin the term “Goldilocks Zone Of Determination” as we enter Q3 of this year. Until Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins regain their all-time-highs, it is a very imprudent call to presume we’re either in a bear market or a bull market. Although the market capitalization in totality has risen in recent weeks, and 24 hour volume is now over 100 billion once again, it is evident that only time can determine whether or not this bullish momentum will continue, or we will break down to the downside as this market did in May and late&nbsp;July.</p><p>AERGO: The Great Comeback: Valuation Resurgence Since&nbsp;June</p>AERGO Has Seen A Massive Resurgence In Monetary Valuation Since Its June Low: Regaining A 3X In Valuation As Of August&nbsp;6th<p>AERGO, the fast and scalable hybrid blockchain designed for private and public blockchain entities, has seen a massive rally since the “Great Altcoin Drop Of May-June 2021.” On June 21st, AERGO hit a yearly low of approximately&nbsp;.078 cents, but that didn’t stop the AERGO team from delivering and the fruits of their labor has become evident with the recent resurgence of price valuation of the token. Since the low in June, AERGO has regained massive monetary valuation, rallying approximately 240% into August, vaunting a price of approximately&nbsp;.196 cents at the time of writing this article. As of today, AERGO has risen approximately 1.47% on the daily timeframe and has found equilibrium between 16 and 21 cents; to put this into perspective, if an individual invested $10,000 dollars in June, as of right now, in early August, that investment would be worth approximately $24,000 dollars. The great question is, why has AERGO risen so much in valuation since June, well, there are many variables and events that have occurred that should be outlined that could be labeled as catalysts for the recent&nbsp;rise.</p><p>The AERGO Team: The Team That Never Stops Working: Mainstream Validity</p>The AERGO Team Has Capitalized On Mainstream Validity Through NFT Artistic Exhibition’s In Seoul, Being Featured In Korean News&nbsp;Networks<p>The AERGO team has recently capitalized on the NFT craze, providing artists with a mainstream and in-person digital exhibition for all to see! Provided by CCCV, a product of Blocko XYZ, is an incubated project by the AERGO Foundation which aims to anchor member data on the AERGO public mainnet. Recently, NFT technology has been consolidated into the CCCV product and exhibition; this exhibition enabled viewers to choose 3 out of 20 NFT works on display, and if the written work matched the top three votes, they win a prize. Provided below is a video of the exhibition. In person NFT inception, combination and collaboration, amalgamated with prizes of up to 2 million won, has given AERGO a cutting edge in mainstream adoption in the Korean community.</p><p>The Seoul Drama Awards: Democratized Voting Brought To You By&nbsp;AERGO</p>NEWSIS, A Korean Based News Agency, Highlighted The Recently Developed AERGO Voting Pikkle D’app: Realizing Its Potential For The Seoul Drama&nbsp;Awards<p>Democratized digital voting is an incumbent necessity during the Era of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the AERGO team understood this functional approach to democracy. The Seoul Drama Awards, first conceived in 2005, has begun utilizing Pikkle for online voting for the Asia Star Award, which will begin on the 9th and conclude on the 20th. Many famous Asian Actors and Actresses have been nominated for the Award, which include Taiwanese actress Song Woon-hwa, Indonesian Amanda Manopo, Japanese actress and model Kentaro Sakaguchi and Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi. In totality, a number of 129 male/female actors spanning 5 nations including Wang Yibo and Thai actors Kitty-Chicha Amatayakul are nominated for this award, and online voting will commence utilizing AERGO’s very own Pikkle. As of July 21st, Pikkle has become domestically live in South Korea and an international version is coming in the very near future. This is mass adoption at its core; democratized voting, domestic legitimacy, and the consolidation of the Pikkle D’app/AERGO Public Blockchain and famous Asian actors and actresses.</p><p>MOU’s In Broadcasting: Television Pastime’s Highlighted And Archived Through AERGO And&nbsp;Blocko</p>Blocko XYZ, Has Recently Signed An MOU With&nbsp;MBC<p>It isn’t everyday where blockchain projects sign MOU with one of the largest broadcasting companies in their respective nations, well, AERGO has just completed such a feat. It is important to reference how and why this event is a massive win for Blocko and AERGO as a whole. MBC (Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation) is one on the leading South Korean television and radio network companies. Munhwa actually means the word “culture” in Korean, and this word highlights the ethos of what Blocko and MBC are looking to create through NFT technology; the preservation of Korean television pastimes over the course of 60 years. MBC has existed for 60 years, founded on February 21st, 1961. The Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation is headquartered in Digital Media City in Mapo-Gu, Seoul and has the largest broadcast production facilities throughout the entirety of South Korea including digital production centers in IIsan and outdoor sets in Yongin Daejanggeum Park. Blocko, the technical partner of AERGO, has signed an MOU for the “Archive By MBC” program, which entails Korea’s first NFT broadcasting project, which aims to tokenize memorable and sentimental television moments in Korean television over the last 60 years. If this isn’t the zeitgeist of mass adoption within the blockchain space, I don’t know what&nbsp;is.</p><p>Conclusion: Whether We’re In A Bull Market, Bear Market, Or The “Great Goldilocks Zone” AERGO Continues To&nbsp;Work</p>Bull Or Bear: AERGO Aims To Become The Go-To Mass Adopted NFT And Hybrid Blockchain Platform Of&nbsp;Korea<p>AERGO has recently seen a resurgence in monetary valuation over the course of the last two months. This resurgence can be attributed to a variety of factors which include NFT mass adoption, the launch of blockchain based voting application Pikkle, and MOU’s signed with South Korea’s largest broadcasting agency. It is evident, whether this market continues to rise, or decides to fall, AERGO is here to stay, and will achieve its vision of the behemoth of South&nbsp;Korea.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>We’ve been testing the Holo hosted version of Elemental Chat for two weeks now, and so far everything is working well. Most messages arrive quickly, even as new participants join and post messages.</p><blockquote>At time of writing, there are 245 participants who’ve posted 5405 messages in 94 channels!</blockquote><p>We are seeing some performance issues; messages sometimes take a while to arrive in the browser. But we knew we’d see things like this. What we are not seeing is big slowdowns as more people join and write more messages.</p><blockquote>The 245th participant is getting pretty much the same experience as the first. In fact, performance and reliability have been better than we expected so far.</blockquote> Speed improvements coming soon with sharding <p>Currently Holochain is operating in ‘full-sync’ mode, which means that every node gets every message. This is not that different from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain (except that there's no costly consensus step), and it means there’s still room to make things faster.</p><p>If you’ve followed the Holochain project for a while, you’ll know that this isn’t the final design. Holochain intends to become fast and cheap enough for everyday applications by splitting the data processing burden up into manageable chunks or ‘shards’ (also known as ‘neighbourhoods’) of participants. We call this rrDHT. (If you want to know more about how rrDHT works and why we built it, you can read this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/#rrdht-a-relaxed-agent-centric-distributed-hash-table">tech deep dive</a>.)</p><p>Once sharding is implemented in Holochain, we expect performance to be a lot faster, even as thousands of participants join. The good news is that this work is already complete and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/834#pullrequestreview-721386771">ready to be merged</a> and tested!</p> What’s next? <p>Elemental Chat is still in pre-release testing, and we should begin inviting the public to use it once the <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">HoloPort Alpha Program</a> starts. We’ve already been taking email addresses for pre-registration; <a href="https://register.holo.host/elemental">register</a> if you’d like to try it out too!</p><p>Once the Holochain team has finished testing sharding, it’ll be included in a new Holochain release, deployed on a small set of HoloPorts, and tested by our pre-release testers. Once it passes that round of testing, it’ll be deployed on all HoloPorts.</p> Holochain v0.0.102 released (breaking changes) <p>Holochain has seen another update. The biggest item is a breaking change for validation callbacks: the <code>must_get_*</code> host functions have finally landed, which means <code>get</code> and friends can no longer be used in validation callbacks. You can read more about this change in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-holo-networks/#breaking-changes-in-develop-decryption-function-and-must_get">last Dev Pulse</a>.</p><p>Holochain now compiles on Windows too! Damien, a hApp developer and Holo alumnus, contributed a patch that fixes a compatibility bug in the Lair keystore. You can now use the Windows-native Rust toolchain to build Holochain and your DNAs. This doesn’t mean we’re officially supporting Windows yet, but it does look like you can use it as your primary development OS now.</p><p>There are also some performance improvements, bug fixes, and added/changed conductor API endpoints. Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.102/CHANGELOG.md#holochain-00102">changelog</a> for details.</p> What’s next?   <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/834#pullrequestreview-721386771">Sharding code</a> is finished and being tested. I expect there’ll be a bit of performance tuning and bug fixing before it’s released, but the core dev team is planning to include it in release v0.0.103.  The HDK is about to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/886">parallelise</a> all sorts of expensive functions — getting entries, getting links, and making zome calls to other peers, zomes, and cells. This should make those functions a lot faster if there’s a lot to do — no more looping over calls in serial. This is already in <code>develop</code> and should be included in the next release as well.  The HDK is also about to support <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/868">countersigning as a built-in feature</a>. This set of host functions and entry types will abstract away the complexity that makes countersigning difficult to do well. At first you’ll need to solicit and gather countersignatures in your code, either synchronously or asynchronously, but eventually there will be affordances to make this process even simpler. The first iteration will likely come in the release after sharding.

 #BeyondtheRules — Balanced governance and ‘behaving well’ everywhere, every&nbsp;day. <p>#BeyondtheRules is a collaborative exploration around ‘public good’ governance held from summer 2020 to summer 2021 between <a href="http://blackthrive.org/">Black Thrive</a>,<a href="https://www.yorkmcn.org/"> York MCN</a>,<a href="https://www.demsoc.org/"> Democratic Society</a>,<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/"> Dark Matter Labs</a> and<a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/"> Lankelly&nbsp;Chase</a>.</p><p>Our original enquiry for this project started with a premise that our governance and categorisation of ‘public good’ (intended collective benefit) is unfit for the (complex, systemic) challenges we face. More about that&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-e3ab44f0dc3">here</a>.</p> On Governance <p>Governance is a seemingly innocuous term, one that can seem to mean everything and nothing simultaneously. According to Alain Deneault in “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20822679-gouvernance">Gouvernance — Le Management Totalitaire</a>”, the word governance evolved in 15th century France, with the meaning of “behaving well”. Its meaning and use has been appropriated in different ways over time and today is a term that we tend to associate with ‘those in power’. It seems lofty and authoritative, rather than a question for all of us, every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Over the last year, we’ve looked at what it means to consider governance not as something separate to our day-to-day, but as a system of many interconnected parts — from individual behaviours to organising systems to structural deep codes — which together make up how we collectively behave. The question is: how can all of those interconnected parts work together towards a just, livable future? Not in theboardroom but everywhere, every&nbsp;day.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll share some of the headline factors that we notice to play a key role in a system of governance. We’ll explore how these are connected to many other parts, and invite you to consider how they show up in your own setting. The factors we focus on here are accountability, responsibility, risk-holding, power and autonomy.</p><p>We are finding that looking at how these factors are balanced and distributed across a system can help to reveal how (in)justly and/or (in)effectively governance might play out in a system, enabling us to see more clearly the parts that are connected and how these could show up in a different way.</p><p>Balance: the balance of power, autonomy, responsibility, risk-holding and accountability in one&nbsp;actor</p><p>The understandings we apply when we use those terms&nbsp;are:</p>  Power ‒ the ability to shape conditions  Autonomy ‒ the freedom to do things in a way that you deem&nbsp;fit  Responsibility ‒ the burden/ability to take&nbsp;action  Accountability ‒ the burden to justify your&nbsp;approach  Risk-holding — bearing consequences of the&nbsp;results  <p>Power, autonomy, responsibility, risk-holding and accountability show up as distinct, but deeply interconnected factors in a system that provide balance to one another. Power and autonomy, we might consider as enablers — factors that convey ability, ease and freedom. Accountability and risk-holding, we might consider as burdens — factors that place an onus on the actor (noting that this language just tries to convey whether the factor creates a freedom/ability or an onus; an enabling factor can still feel or be perceived as a burden and burdens may be embraced as an enabler, gift or honour). Responsibility can be both an enabler or/and a burden — it might be a freedom I choose to exercise; it might involve duties/actions that I need to fulfil. Where we experience an imbalance between the enablers and the burdens that actors may hold in a system, we see an environment conducive to corruption, inefficacy and/or injustice; conditions that erode trust and indeed our collective belief in that&nbsp;system.</p><p>For example, I might have the power to shape the outcome of, say, a COVID-19 procurement process, without risk-holding or accountability for the outcome ‒ this would be an imbalance in governance, in a way that allows for the prioritisation of personal interests over collective benefit.</p>An imbalance in governance conducive to corruption<p>Or I might have responsibility to, say, support somebody to secure work, without autonomy to provide that support in a way that I think would be genuinely effective and tailored to them. This would create a form of imbalance in governance which results in the loss of potential in my ability to innovate and improve things, resulting in that as a system we lose the chance to learn and&nbsp;grow.</p>An imbalance in governance undermining creativity and innovation<p>As someone facing illness, I might bear the consequences (risk-holding) of a failing health system, with minimal power or autonomy to influence whether I can receive the treatment that I need; an imbalance of governance leading to injustice.</p>An imbalance in governance leading to injustice<p>Conversely, when these factors come into balance, we can see how more fair, creative, effective and just conditions can become possible.</p><p>For example, where I have responsibility to design a programme intended for collective benefit, and also autonomy to do it in the way I see is best, I can innovate freely and bring my creativity and understanding to the challenge. This position may give me power in that system (ability to shape conditions). Where I also have risk-holding (I will directly bear consequences of negative results) and also accountability for the approach that I take, I am likely to consider risks and take informed and responsible directions. Thus, where I have a balance of power, responsibility, autonomy, risk-holding and accountability in a system, I am most likely to be able to take customised approaches that care for efficacy and plausibility of the&nbsp;result.</p>A state of balance for full&nbsp;agency<p>Distribution: the balance of power, autonomy, responsibility, risk-holding and accountability between&nbsp;actors</p><p>We also need to consider how these governance factors out between actors in a&nbsp;system.</p><p>Let us consider this in the context of an imagined charitable structure, for example, to help to illustrate what we mean by distribution. This table tries at a very headline and rough level to map out how power, accountability, power, autonomy and responsibility might lie across different actors in an example&nbsp;case.</p> Example of how governance might show up in a Charity by&nbsp;role <p>Power is spread somewhat across this structure but has particular accumulation in actors such as Trustees and senior executives. If these actors are not also the people who the charity is set up to support, we might find a scenario where power is concentrated in people who are furthest from the specifics and realities of the matter. Risks, meanwhile, may have a certain spread across the system, but since charities are by nature set up to support people who are already holding risks in the wider system — risks which can be exacerbated in the case of malfunction by the charity — the highest risk-holding may well be held by people that the charity is set up to support. Indeed, this may be more the case where that charity provides a critical function to people (for example, if a food bank is mismanaged and a result is that I can’t access food that I need, the consequences I bear could be significant. If a sports charity is mismanaged and my sports class is cancelled, the direct consequences to me might be disappointing but less&nbsp;severe).</p><p>When we look at the balance and distribution of governance in this structure we might consider:</p>  How can we better distribute the power across the system so that those closest to the details and specifics of the matter have the most power to shape direction and execution?  How can we design the system so that risk held by people who the charity is set up to support is reduced or mitigated, and more evenly&nbsp;spread?  <p>These are questions that nowadays charities are often expected to address in their fundamental governance set-up. What is clear is that trying to truly address these imbalances requires more than just some tweaks to the existing structure. Indeed, if the structure in place exists within the logic of traditional line management, rank and the bounded division of duties, this imbalance is coded into the architecture.</p><p>And yet, when we think about the huge transition that we have ahead of us for a just livable future to be possible, it is clear that we need to unleash the agency of every one of us to be able to take on responsibility, create with autonomy, be accountable, to take on risks and assume power — each uniquely, in ways that we determine — towards that&nbsp;future.</p><p>So if this rebalance in governance is critical and we truly want to address it, what sort of questions do we start to consider?</p><p>You might, say, start with a review at the structure of the organisation, starting perhaps with the Trustee Board, which — rather than holding a function of strategy and decision-making — could play a more valuable role as a governance auditor for the system. They could hold to account the integrity of the organisation’s governance to its mission, auditing the balance of power, accountability, autonomy, responsibility and risk-holding in the organisation and whether the organising methods are appropriate for&nbsp;it.</p><p>This would allow the strategic decision-making of the organisation to be concentrated in people closest to the questions they need to make decisions about. These people may be supported with information, protocols &amp; considerations from a central team. Rather than ‘line managers’, central teams could actively work to compound learning within the ecosystem and across other partners and actors; who navigate the necessary compliance and regulation that the organisation sits within; and who actively consider how we carve pathways towards justice in the way that they approach the day to day&nbsp;work.</p><p>As we begin to unravel the traditional lines of fixed hierarchy, we start to consider what this means for how we approach pay. We begin to question what pay rewards or incentivises or what function it plays in a system. By linking pay to rank in a system we create a series of incentives to accumulate power and responsibility in a system even where it may not be our place; when we start to unpack this and<a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/Framing-Provocation-Reimagining-the-Wage-1d2140e1fb1d42efa55a00cd3bbd2f57"> reimagine its role</a> it reveals questions about fairness, purpose, process, market norms, regulation and more for us to work&nbsp;through.</p><p>Decision-making, in turn, becomes a critical question, requiring us to reimagine who can take decisions and by which process in this more distributed system.</p><p>And as we start to think about shifting the processes, mechanisms and structures across an organisation or system, we quickly begin to reveal the deep codes that shape the scope of that change. The regulation, which — for example — prescribes what work a charity can engage in and the way that it must be reported and assessed. Accounting, which invites us to consider our financial progress according to profit and reserves rather than the value created for different actors in the system. Contract Law, Intellectual Property and many other codes that shape and constrain how and where we can reimagine how we show&nbsp;up.</p><p>Meanwhile, our charity does not exist in a vacuum, but rather in response to existing issues that often sit at a larger socioeconomic level. The weaker the collective infrastructure, the more risk is concentrated in particular individuals in a system. Having in place social infrastructure from universal healthcare, universal mental healthcare and universal basic income, can significantly mitigate the risk-holding that falls on individual shoulders. We begin to touch upon socioeconomic questions and what infrastructure we need to really enable a balanced governance in our&nbsp;systems.</p><p>This invites us to look at our mental models, narratives and our behaviours in this system, particularly the mental models that have underpinned structural systems of oppression — of class, gender, sexuality, health, race, ethnicity and more — that fundamentally undermine a chance at real justice. These might be mental models and narratives of stratification, white supremacy, extraction, command, control and separation.</p><p>Structural (and intergenerational) privilege facilitates actors to have more time, capacity, confidence, trust and safety, all of which in turn enable a person to accumulate (and sometimes hoard) power, autonomy, responsibility in a system over time. These inequalities aren’t just linear, but also geological; they are not behind us, they are embedded in the layers of rocks we are standing&nbsp;on.</p><p>All of these factors heavily shape the frameworks within which individual choices and their implications are shaped, all in different ways for each of us. Despite the constraints, human history is a story of constant resistance, re-imagination and reform. We can make the commitments — each in our own ways — to step into power (even where it is not welcomed), to step away from power (especially when it is not deserved), to hold oneself accountable (including when not externally mandated), to exert autonomy (including when not permissioned) and to take on or to mitigate&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Whatever the approach, one of the key threads through our enquiry is that how we show up at a personal level deeply influences how these patterns in governance shift, be that interrogating our mental models, conditions, trends, behaviours; embracing rest, joy, celebration, love; resisting, reimagining, committing and/or persisting.</p> About Beyond the&nbsp;Rules <p>In researching these question in #BeyondtheRules over the last year, we have been humbled to speak to individuals, groups and people from social organisations, movements, grantmaking bodies and others who have gradually been unpicking these questions — shifting the way they approach pay, incorporated lived experience into their decision making, taken a more distributed approach to power and accountability, reimagined the grantmaking relationship, campaigned for regulatory reform and more. Individuals and groups that, by acutely focusing on one piece of the jigsaw or looking holistically at many, have been moulding the forces at&nbsp;play.</p><p>As a group of partners in this project, we have been seeking to unravel and make sense of the interconnections between the many factors at play and how they interact, their histories and stories, who is working on them and what they are learning&nbsp;. We are currently writing up our findings to share with the hope that it might add a brick to the collective deep democratising that we need&nbsp;ahead.</p> Reflection: governance in your&nbsp;setting <p>As you head into this time over August, a period where you might have the ability to step back and listen more deeply, to breathe and have moments of silence, we invite you to reflect on some questions with us in relation to the governance in your own settings, wherever these may be (although we should note that these questions are more tailored to social organisations, movements or grantmakers than, say, public services):</p><p>On risk-holding, accountability and&nbsp;power:</p>  Who faces risks and who accrues benefits in the work that you&nbsp;do?  What type of consequences, and to what&nbsp;degree?  Who is currently asked to justify their approach and who is&nbsp;not?  <p>Bear in mind that risk-holders and accountable actors in these situations may bear consequences affecting various factors, such as physical health, mental health, finances/wealth, relationships and social capital, time and energy, reputation, and/or current and future opportunities. They may be human or non-human actors, present-day or in the&nbsp;future.</p>  How (and how much) do structural factors (relating e.g. to regulation, social security, the economic market etc) influence how risk manifests in your&nbsp;system?  How much is within your system’s scope to influence?  What does it really mean for there to be a balance between who shapes the conditions of your work and who bears the potential consequences of&nbsp;it?  <p>Consider how these questions leak into wider structural matters and how you are incorporating these factors into your work. Where are you focusing your sites of influence and are you thinking about how all of the issues interconnect.</p><p>Look to dig into ideas with curiosity. For example, somebody bearing consequences of a system may not always be well placed to have power over all parts of an action that affects them. For instance, I as a patient would bear the consequences of a poorly executed medical procedure, however it does not mean that I should carry out the procedure myself. I would, however, want to be free to decide whether I wanted that procedure, and would want to be able to trust that the person carrying it out has the sufficient knowledge and expertise to do it. I might also want patients like me to have been involved at some point in shaping some of the processes itself.</p><p>Where direct representation might not be possible, why is this (/has this been) the case, and what are the checks and balances needed to how conditions are&nbsp;shaped?</p><p>When thinking about representation, consider that groups of people are not homogenous. A woman can adopt a patriarchal ideology. A person of colour can internalise or even uphold ideas of white supremacy. A gay cis man can be unaware of his transphobia as much as anybody else outside the 2SLGBTQ+ umbrella. A working class person can be convinced to see immigrants as the economic problem in their country. So when we consider the important role of lived experience in governance, we can also ensure that decisions are shaped by people who bear or have borne consequences as well as the insights relating to the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>On responsibility and autonomy:</p>  How much autonomy is given to corresponding types of responsibility?  How do you pay people for the types of responsibility taken? Does (if so, how?) structural privilege link to the roles that you reward the&nbsp;most?  What other benefits do different people accrue as a result of the types of responsibility they hold (reputational, benefits, networks, opportunities…?)  <p>People will likely have different types of responsibility that they hold. When you hold a meeting, who takes minutes, who makes coffee, who sets the agenda. Who holds responsibility for the overall integrity of the work. Who takes responsibility to communicate, to make relationships.</p><p>Reflect on how different types of responsibilities are incentivised or rewarded and how systems of oppression may influence the frameworks of choice that we have when considering to take on these different types.</p><p>If you can, draw what you see. Step into it. Embody it, or depict it. What comes to you as the fundamental changes that you may need to be considering. What do you see and&nbsp;feel?</p><p>After a year looking at ways that many people have approached answering these kinds of questions, we are excited to share with you some of our findings and to hear what is coming up for&nbsp;you.</p><p>We will be hosting a conversation on 2nd September at 2pm (UTC+1) to share more and to invite your contributions; we hope that you can join us. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/beyond-the-rules-open-house-tickets-166296690879">Quick registration here</a></p><p>This blog was authored by Annette Dhami, Thomas Theodore and Himanshu Rohilla of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> (graphics by Sharmada Nagarajan) with the input and support from Natalie Creary of <a href="http://blackthrive.org/">Black Thrive</a>, Catherine Scott of <a href="https://www.yorkmcn.org/">York MCN</a>, Alex Zur-Clark of <a href="https://www.demsoc.org/">Democratic Society</a> and Joe Doran of<a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/"> Lankelly&nbsp;Chase</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-balanced-governance-and-behaving-well-everywhere-every-day-5aa852b4843e">#BeyondtheRules — Balanced governance and ‘behaving well’ everywhere, every day.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>È ormai di dominio pubblico l’attacco ransomware estremamente grave ai danni di una importante Pubblica Amministrazione italiana.</p>



<p>Con la crescita della digitalizzazione e dei dispositivi connessi in rete, questa tipologia di attacchi ai danni di Pubbliche Amministrazioni e grandi imprese private sta registrando una crescita esponenziale sia in Italia che all’estero.</p>



<p>Come confermato dal <a href="https://clusit.it/rapporto-clusit/">rapporto Clusit 2021</a>, nell’anno della pandemia si è registrato il record negativo di attacchi informatici nel mondo, con un incremento pari quasi al 12%&nbsp;rispetto all’anno precedente.</p>



<p>L’ultimo grave caso è quello appena registrato in Italia in cui, secondo le prime indiscrezioni, l’ingresso dell’agente malevolo all’interno dei sistemi informatici della PA, è stato possibile attraverso delle credenziali compromesse della VPN di un dipendente in smart working.</p>



<p>InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione a livello europeo, grazie al centro di competenza security di Swascan (Tinexta Cyber), ha la possibilità di verificare immediatamente l’esposizione di PA e Imprese ai rischi informatici e, soprattutto, la presenza o meno di credenziali compromesse e botnet che potrebbero, se usate, compromettere la business continuity, oltre che arrecare un grave danno alla reputazione dell’Organizzazione.</p>



<p>Tali analisi di Threat Intelligence, erogate da Swascan (Domain Threat Intelligence e Cyber Threat Intelligence), sono completamente passive e non entrano in contatto in alcun modo con gli asset digitali dell’Organizzazione, ma operano andando a ricercare, identificare e raccogliere – nel Dark web e Deep web – informazioni pubbliche e semipubbliche relative all’Azienda o all’Amministrazione ed eventuali credenziali compromesse.</p>

  <p>ASP.NET Web Forms framework has been the cornerstone technology of .Net for web development since the release of .Net Framework in 2002. ASP.NET Web Forms includes a layer of abstraction for developers so that you don’t need to care about HTML, JavaScript, or any other front-end technology. It provides a development flow similar to building desktop apps, a way for developers to build a web page by drag and drop, an event-driven programming model, and stateful controls thanks to the built-in state management. These features incurred lots of complexity, but it was worthwhile when web development was still in its infancy.</p>

<p>Web development has evolved a lot in recent years. Browsers have become more powerful and implement various standards that allow access to users’ devices. Client-side frameworks such as React and Angular simplify client-side development and have become increasingly popular. These frameworks and other benefits are available only if you can write the front-end JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Maintaining the back end and front end in two different languages comes with a cost. There isn’t much code reuse, tools and frameworks are different, and it’s challenging to keep up with constantly evolving technologies.</p>

 Introduction to Blazor 

<p>WebAssembly and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a> come into play to address the challenge of managing front-end and back-end development effectively. WebAssembly is a new open standard of byte code for the Web that runs in every modern browser. Blazor is a C# based client-side UI framework that runs directly in the browser via WebAssembly. It can also run on the server-side and process user interaction over a real-time connection with the browser.</p>

<p>Blazor and ASP.NET Web Forms have a lot in common: They are both component-oriented, event-driven, and provide a stateful programming model. If you are an ASP.NET Web Forms developer, Blazor will feel familiar.</p>

<p>In this article, I will describe how to migrate a simple ASP.NET Web Forms project to Blazor.</p>

<p>To continue, you will need:</p>

 
   A basic knowledge of C# 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio 2019</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core">.NET Core SDK</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
 

 Overview of the Web Forms Project 

<p>The project that I will migrate is a simple web app where I can track my daily intake of calories and calories burned by exercise. The project looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Web Forms markup and underlying code looks like this:</p>

   <code>&lt;asp:Content ID="BodyContent" ContentPlaceHolderID="MainContent" runat="server"&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
 &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;

<p><code>CaloriesTrackerService</code> is a class that manages data access using Entity Framework Core and SQLite for data storage:</p>

</code>   

<p>Now, let’s migrate the project to Blazor. First, I will create a new Blazor project.</p>

 Create a Blazor Project 

<p>Fire up Visual Studio, create a new project by clicking File&gt;New Project, select Blazor App, and click Next. Name the app CaloriesTracker.Blazor and click Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the next window, select Blazor Server App. Now, click Create, and Visual Studio will create a new server-side Blazor project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can create the project by running the following command in a command shell:</p>

   <code>dotnet new blazorserver -o CaloriesTracker.Blazor
</code>   

<p>Blazor Server hosts Razor components on the server in an ASP.NET Core app and handles UI updates over a SignalR connection. The Blazor runtime sends events from browser to server and applies UI updates to the components that the server sends back. This strategy is similar to the approach used by the ASP.NET AJAX <code>UpdatePanel</code> control that handles partial page updates in response to trigger events. The main difference is that Blazor Server maintains an active connection to the server, and all the UI state stays on the server instead of <code>ViewState</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see what you get when you create a new project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since the Blazor Server is hosted in the ASP.NET Core project, <code>Startup.cs</code> and <code>Program.cs</code> serve the same purpose. Specifically, <code>Startup.cs</code> configures services and the app’s request pipeline. The Pages folder contains <code>_Host.cshtml</code>, which hosts the Blazor app. The <code>razor</code> files in the Pages folder are the Blazor pages that comprise the app. Similarly, the Shared folder contains shared layouts such as the app’s main layout and reusable components such as the navigation menu. You can think of <code>MainLayout.razor</code> as a <code>Site.Master</code> file in the WebForms project and <code>NavMenu.razor</code> as some <code>ascx</code> component.</p>

<p>Click F5 in Visual Studio or run <code>dotnet run</code> to run the project. You should see:</p>

<p>NewProject Run</p>

<p>Next, I will migrate Entity Framework Core configuration and <code>CaloriesTrackerService</code> to the Blazor project.</p>

 Migrate Entity Framework Core to Blazor 

<p>Migrating non-UI-related code is pretty straightforward. I will use SQLite in the Blazor project, too, so first, add the necessary package to the project:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
</code>   

<p>Now, copy the <code>Model.cs</code> file from the WebForms project to the Data folder in the Blazor project. Next, I need to create an initial migration and apply the migration, so I will run:</p>

   <code>dotnet ef database update
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
</code>   

<p>This code creates CaloriesTracker.db database in the root of the folder.</p>

<p>Finally, copy <code>CaloriesTrackerService.cs</code> to the Data folder as well. The code works without making any changes to it, but I will go ahead and use C# 8.0 syntax to save a couple of lines:</p>

   <code>public class CaloriesTrackerService
{
    public List&lt;Food&gt; GetFood()
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        return caloriesContext.Food.ToList();
    }

    public List&lt;Exercise&gt; GetExercises()
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        return caloriesContext.Exercises.ToList();
    }

    public void AddFood(int foodId, DateTime date)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();

        caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Add(new CalorieDiary()
        { 
            AddedAt = date, 
            FoodId = foodId 
        });

        caloriesContext.SaveChanges();
    }

    public void AddExercise(int exerciseId, DateTime date)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();

        caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Add(new CalorieDiary
        {
            AddedAt = date,
            ExerciseId = exerciseId
        });

        caloriesContext.SaveChanges();
    }

    public void DeleteRecord(int id)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Remove(new CalorieDiary { Id = id });
        caloriesContext.SaveChanges();
    }

    public List&lt;CalorieDiary&gt; GetDailyList(DateTime date)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        var list = caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Where(diary =&gt; diary.AddedAt == date)
                        .Include(d =&gt; d.Food).Include(d =&gt; d.Exercise)
                        .OrderByDescending(diary =&gt; diary.Id).ToList();

    return list;
    }
</code>   

<p>Finally, I will register <code>CaloriesTrackerService</code> with the DI in <code>Startup.cs</code>. In the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method add the following line:</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton&lt;CaloriesTrackerService&gt;();
</code>   

<p>Now you are ready to migrate the UI portion of the project to Blazor.</p>

 Migrate Web Forms Markup to Blazor 

<p>First, right-click on the Pages folder, click Add, select Razor Component and call it <code>CaloriesTracking</code>. You can also create the page by running:</p>

<p><code>dotnet new razorcomponent -n CaloriesTracking -o Pages</code></p>

<p>The top section of the page will contain the markup for this page, and the <code>@code</code> section contains the code that handles events of various components on the page.</p>

<p>Now, add a <code>@page</code> directive at the top of the component, set URL to caloriestracking, and inject an instance of <code>CaloriesTrackerService</code>:</p>

   <code>@page "/caloriestracking"
@using CaloriesTracker.Blazor.Data
@inject CaloriesTrackerService CaloriesTrackerService
</code>   

<p>Next, add the <code>CaloriesTracking</code> component to the menu in <code>NavMenu</code> component:</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="@NavMenuCssClass" @onclick="ToggleNavMenu"&gt;
  &lt;ul class="nav flex-column"&gt;
    &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="" Match="NavLinkMatch.All"&gt;
        &lt;span class="oi oi-home" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Home
    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="caloriestracking"&gt;
        &lt;span class="oi oi-plus" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Calories Tracker
    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Run <code>dotnet watch run</code> in a command shell and navigate to the page by clicking on Calories Tracker in the navigation menu. Leave the app running, and every time you save a file, the app rebuilds, and the browser reloads the page.</p>

<p>Go back to the <code>CaloriesTracking.razor</code> file and add the following markup:</p>

   <code>@if (!initialized)
{
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loading...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
}
else
{
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-6"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Add Food&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;EditForm Model="addItemModel" OnValidSubmit="@HandleAddFoodValidSubmit"&gt;
        Select Food:
        &lt;InputSelect @bind-Value="addItemModel.FoodId" style="width: 150px"&gt;
        @foreach (var value in food)
            {
            &lt;option value="@value.Id"&gt;@value.Name&lt;/option&gt;
            }
        &lt;/InputSelect&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-secondary"&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/EditForm&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-6"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Add Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;EditForm Model="addItemModel" OnValidSubmit="@HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit"&gt;
        Select Food:
        &lt;InputSelect @bind-Value="addItemModel.ExerciseId" style="width: 150px"&gt;
        @foreach (var value in exercises)
            {
            &lt;option value="@value.Id"&gt;@value.Name&lt;/option&gt;
            }
        &lt;/InputSelect&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-secondary"&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/EditForm&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>In the code section, add the following code:</p>

   <code>private bool initialized = false;

private List&lt;Food&gt; food;
private List&lt;Exercise&gt; exercises;

AddItemModel addItemModel = new AddItemModel();

protected override void OnInitialized()
{
    food = CaloriesTrackerService.GetFood();
    exercises = CaloriesTrackerService.GetExercises();

    initialized = true;
}

private void HandleAddFoodValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddFood(addItemModel.FoodId, DateTime.Today);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(DateTime.Today);
    addItemModel.FoodId = -1;
}

private void HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddExercise(addItemModel.ExerciseId, DateTime.Today);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(DateTime.Today);
    addItemModel.ExerciseId = -1;
}

class AddItemModel
{
    public int FoodId { get; set; }
    public int ExerciseId { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the markup and the code. First, check if the data has been loaded. If data hasn’t loaded, display a Loading text in the browser.</p>

<p>Once the list of foods and exercises loads, the markup renders two forms: a food intake form and an exercise form. Both forms display a <code>select</code> element that shows items from a list of foods or exercises. The <code>select</code> value is bound to either the <code>addItemModel.FoodId</code> or the <code>addItemModel.ExerciseId</code> property using the <code>bind-Value</code> attribute. Both forms are bound to the <code>addItemModel</code> model, and when the form is submitted, it will invoke either the <code>HandleAddFoodValidSubmit</code> or the <code>HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>OnInitialized</code> method runs when the component initializes, and I use it to load data for the food and exercise elements. If you need to perform asynchronous initialization, override the <code>OnInitializedAsync</code> method instead. After the data is loaded, and <code>initialized</code> is set to true, Blazor will re-render the component. The <code>HandleAddFoodValidSubmit</code> and <code>HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit</code> methods handle the form submission and saving of the selected food or exercise items to the database. Switch to the browser, and you should see the two select boxes:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, let’s add a grid to show the records from the database and switch between different dates. Add the following markup at the start of the <code>else</code> code block:</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Daily consumed and burned calories&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;EditForm Model="@changeDateModel" OnValidSubmit="@FilterByDate"&gt;
    Showing data for:
    &lt;InputDate @bind-Value="changeDateModel.FilterDate" /&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Show&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/EditForm&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;

    @if (dailyList.Count != 0)
    {
    &lt;table class="table"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Calories&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        @foreach (var item in dailyList)
        {
            &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@(item.Exercise?.Name ?? item.Food.Name)&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@(-item.Exercise?.Calories ?? item.Food.Calories)&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;button @onclick="@(e =&gt; DeleteRecord(item.Id))" class="btn btn-danger"&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        }
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Total Consumed: @dailyList.Sum(d =&gt; d.Food?.Calories) Total Burned: @dailyList.Sum(d =&gt; d.Exercise?.Calories)&lt;/h3&gt;
    }
    else
    {
        &lt;h3&gt;No Records Found&lt;/h3&gt;
    }
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>The EditForm shows input for selecting a date, and the grid renders the records returned from the database. Just like the other forms, it is bound to <code>changeDateModel.FilterDate</code>, and the <code>FilterByDate</code> method loads data from the database:</p>

   <code>private void FilterByDate()
{
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}
</code>   

<p>When you click the Delete button in the grid, the <code>DeleteRecord</code> method will receive the ID of the record that you want to delete:</p>

   <code>private void DeleteRecord(int id)
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.DeleteRecord(id);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}
</code>   

<p>The final code for the <code>CaloriesTracking</code> component looks like this:</p>

   <code>private bool initialized = false;

private List&lt;Food&gt; food;
private List&lt;Exercise&gt; exercises;
private List&lt;CalorieDiary&gt; dailyList;

AddItemModel addItemModel = new AddItemModel();
ChangeDateModel changeDateModel = new ChangeDateModel { FilterDate = DateTime.Today };

protected override void OnInitialized()
{
    food = CaloriesTrackerService.GetFood();
    exercises = CaloriesTrackerService.GetExercises();
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);

    initialized = true;
}

private void DeleteRecord(int id)
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.DeleteRecord(id);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}

private void FilterByDate()
{
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}

private void HandleAddFoodValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddFood(addItemModel.FoodId, changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    addItemModel.FoodId = -1;
}

private void HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddExercise(addItemModel.ExerciseId, changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    addItemModel.ExerciseId = -1;
}

class AddItemModel
{
    public int FoodId { get; set; }
    public int ExerciseId { get; set; }
}

class ChangeDateModel
{
    public DateTime FilterDate { get; set; }
}

<p>Go back to the browser, and you should be able to track your calories:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that I have finished migrating the code from WebForms to Blazor, I will secure the app so that no one except me knows how much sweets I eat 😃.</p>

 Securing Your Blazor Application 

<p>In this tutorial, I will use Okta to quickly secure the API in order not to have to roll my own identity provider and deal with all the tricky details. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication, and all OpenID Connect flows out of the box. These features take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.</p>

<p>I will use <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> to manage my Okta account and register a new application for this project.</p>

<p>Run <code>okta start</code> if you don’t have an Okta account, or run <code>okta login</code> if you already have one.</p>

<p>Once you configure Okta CLI with your account, run <code>okta apps create</code> to create a new Okta application. I will use CaloriesTracker again as the name of the app.</p>

<p>On the Type of Application step, enter 1 to select Web, and on the next step, enter 4 for Other.</p>

<p>I will use <code>https://localhost:44360/authorization-code/callback</code> and accept the suggested URL for Post Logout Redirect URI for the redirect URI. When you hit enter, the Okta CLI creates a new app and saves the configuration to your home directory in <code>.okta.env</code> file:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, go back to Visual Studio and add <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> package:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore
</code>   

<p>Next, open the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file, add a new section <code>Okta</code> below the <code>Logging</code> section, and put in your app’s details. Copy <code>clientId</code> and <code>clientSecret</code> from the <code>.okta.env</code>:</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": ""
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now, go the <code>Startup</code> class and add this code in <code>ConfigureServices</code> method:</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
{
    OktaDomain = Configuration["Okta:Domain"],
    ClientId = Configuration["Okta:ClientId"],
    ClientSecret = Configuration["Okta:ClientSecret"]
});
</code>   

<p>Also, add the following line to the <code>Configure()</code> method after the <code>app.UseRouting();</code> line:</p>

   <code>app.UseAuthentication();
</code>   

<p>Next, let’s create <code>login</code> and <code>logout</code> pages. As Blazor uses SignalR for the client and server-side communication and Okta uses the OpenID protocol that relies on HTTP, you need to perform authentication outside of the Blazor app.</p>

<p>To solve this issue, I will create two Razor pages for these endpoints. Run the following commands in a command shell:</p>

   <code>dotnet new page -n Login -na CaloriesTracker.Blazor.Pages -o Pages
dotnet new page -n Logout -na CaloriesTracker.Blazor.Pages -o Pages
</code>   

<p>This code will create <code>Login.cshtml</code> and <code>Logout.cshtml</code> pages in the project’s Pages folder.</p>

<p>Open the <code>Login.cshtml.cs</code> and change the <code>OnGet</code> method like this:</p>

   <code>public async Task OnGet(string redirectUri)
{
    await HttpContext.ChallengeAsync(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme, new AuthenticationProperties
    {
        RedirectUri = redirectUri
    });
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>HttpContext.ChallengeAsync</code> method starts the authentication process with Okta based on the configuration I did in the <code>Startup</code> class.</p>

<p>Similarly, replace the <code>OnGet</code> method in <code>Logout.cshtml.cs</code> with this:</p>

   <code>public async Task OnGet()
{
    await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme, new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" });
    await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
</code>   

<p>This code ends the Okta session and signs out the user.</p>

<p>Now, let’s plug these pages into the Blazor app.</p>

<p>Open the <code>App.razor</code> file and replace it’s content with this:</p>

   <code>&lt;Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly"&gt;
    &lt;Found Context="routeData"&gt;
        &lt;AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
        &lt;Authorizing&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Authorizing please wait...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/Authorizing&gt;
        &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Sorry&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You're not authorized to see this page. You need to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;/AuthorizeRouteView&gt;
    &lt;/Found&gt;
    &lt;NotFound&gt;    
        &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;    
    &lt;/NotFound&gt;
&lt;/Router&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>AuthorizeRouteView</code> component ensures that you can see only the pages that the user is authorized to visit.</p>

<p>After this, open the <code>CaloriesTracking.razor</code> component and add <code>@attribute [Authorize]</code> at the top of the code so that only authorized users can view it.</p>

<p>Finally, you need a way to authenticate users. I will create a new component, <code>AccountControl</code> in the <code>Shared</code> folder and add in the following code:</p>

   <code>@inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

&lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;a href="logout"&gt;Log out&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;a href="login?redirectUri=@(NavigationManager.Uri)"&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>AuthorizeView</code> view will either display a Log out link for the user or a Log in link for authentication. The <code>AuthorizeView</code> component exposes a <code>context</code> variable, which I use to get the information about the logged-in user.</p>

<p>Put the component in the <code>MainLayout.razor</code> file above the About link and run the app. When you click the Calories Tracker you will see a message that you don’t have access to this page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Log in link, and the app will redirect you to Okta for authentication. When you log in, Okta sends you back to the app, where you’ll be able to access the page that only authenticated users can see:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open banking is rapidly growing and responding to the call for greater consumer empowerment,&nbsp; giving people and businesses across the globe easy and secure access to their financial data so they can better manage their money, secure loans, and make payments. Finicity’s connections cover 95% of direct deposit accounts in North America. Today, our signed data access agreements with most of the nation’s largest financial institutions, credit card companies, and wealth management institutions cover 63% of our open banking platform traffic with direct API access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect that our direct-API Data Access Agreements will increase coverage of our data traffic to over 80% by the end of 2021.&nbsp; Direct-API connections greatly reduce the use of user credentials in the financial services market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have clearly set the industry bar and expect to continue to lead the market with direct data access.&nbsp;</p>
 Finicity’s Continued Leadership in Financial Data Access 
<p>Signing data access agreements has always been an integral part of keeping the consumer first by enhancing simplicity, control, and security. In Q2, Finicity has continued to build strong partnerships by signing DAA’s with leading financial institutions such as <a href="https://www.navyfederal.org/resources/articles/security/securing-your-financial-data.html">Navy Federal Credit Union</a>, <a href="https://ir.jackhenry.com/news-releases/news-release-details/jack-henry-finicity-partner-empower-community-financial">Jack Henry</a>, and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/green-dot-data-access-agreement/">Green Dot</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity’s integration to Jack Henry’s&nbsp; <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3152246-1&amp;h=494671961&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fbanno.com%2Fdigital-toolkit%2F&amp;a=Banno+Digital+Toolkit">Banno Digital Toolkit</a> enables community financial institutions to provide consumers with the freedom to control, access, and share their financial data, creating a real-time picture of their financial health. The more than 400 community financial institutions using the Banno Digital Platform will be able to deliver this holistic financial experience to consumers through secure API access to third-party financial institutions, fintechs, and financial partners of their choice at zero lift and zero cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greendot.com/">Green Dot</a> and <a href="https://www.navyfederal.org/">Navy Federal Credit Union</a> will connect their customer’s bank accounts to Finicity’s open banking platform so they’ll be able to link their accounts to third-party apps to connect, manage, and move their money securely, manage how and what personal data is accessed by those third parties, revoke that access when desired, and have more transparency as they use their data.</p>
<p>These new relationships, on top of the ones that have been fostered since 2017, help expand the reach of our open banking platform and pave the path for evolution in the financial industry. With a greater network, more data can be attained providing higher quality products and services.</p>
 Finicity’s Commitment to Data Stewardship 
<p>Open banking has improved innovation, accessibility, and convenience and has changed the way people and financial institutions experience money. In the United States, Finicity is leveraging its best-in-class data connections as we continue to add direct API connectivity for financial institutions.</p>
<p>To provide access to real-time information, the network of data is expanding and providing more opportunities. Data Access Agreements (DAAs) are put in place to provide access to financial data to expedite the financial experience in the digital age, allowing for innovative services that benefit both the financial institution and consumer. The agreements also set the stage for how the parties involved will communicate and exchange financial data based on consumer consent.</p>
<p>Finicity’s commitment to responsible data practices is defined by the CATTS principles – control, access, transparency, traceability, and security. Adherence to these principles serves as the backbone for how consumer-permissioned data is treated by both parties involved in the DAA, providing the trusted safety needed in the current financial landscape.</p>

<p>As global demand for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) continues to grow, Northern Block and German-based <a href="https://esatus.com/">esatus AG</a> announce a strategic partnership that will be very beneficial for Governments and Large Enterprise.</p>
<p>New to SSI?? Here’s an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjbN9ulHXIU">Introductory Video on SSI</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this partnership is to help organizations exploring the deployment of digital wallet and verifiable credential solutions. The partnership enables organizations to continue reaping the benefits of their Identity and Access Management (IAM) investments, while parallelly moving certain processes towards SSI.</p>
<p>esatus has worked in the SSI space since 2015 and has contributed to many publications about SSI. They have developed their own identity and access management solution&nbsp;SOWL, based on Self-Sovereign Identity technology.</p>
<p>More recently, esatus has helped build the IDunion consortium, a public-private partnership of companies and institutions, which implemented and governs the Hyperledger Indy-based IDunion public identity utility. IDunion’s aim is to establish one of the leading and most secure identity networks in Europe, in harmony with the European legal framework (especially eIDAS and GDPR). See the SSI Orbit Podcast: <a href="https://northernblock.io/roles-of-government-and-private-sector-in-digital-id/">The Roles of Government &amp; The Private Sector in a Digital ID Program, with&nbsp;Sebastian Manhart</a> to learn more about Digital ID in Europe and where eIDAS is heading.</p>
<p>As Canada itself moves towards the use of Verifiable Credentials within their digital identity strategies, being able to leverage learnings from real national use cases in Europe are important things to take into consideration.</p>
<blockquote><p>“More and more countries are moving towards user-centric digital identity solutions. That means that global partnerships like these are crucial to ensure compatibility between various trust ecosystems. We’ve been long collaborators with the esatus team. They bring a wealth of IAM knowledge and expertise, which is a phenomenal use case for SSI,” – Mathieu Glaude, CEO Northern Block.</p></blockquote>
<p>Through their NB Orbit SSI Platform, the first commercial-grade&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">verifiable credential platform in Canada</a>, Northern Block has been focused on facilitating the deployment of trust ecosystems, while enabling organizations and consortiums to build decentralized business models. NB Orbit is a scalable way to build ecosystem solutions with authentic data, with the onboarding of Verified People and Verified Businesses built into the core.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Northern Block has a great platform for creating ecosystem solutions. They’ve built a large network of credential issuers in North America that make it easy to kick-start an ecosystem solution focused on authentic data. With this partnership, we will now be able to conduct quick pilot projects demonstrating how SSI and existing IAM investments complement each other and can bring value,” – Dr. André Kudra, CIO at esatus AG.</p></blockquote>
<p>Northern Block will leverage esatus’ proven technology stack that connects SSI with standard authentication and authorization sources. This means that Verifiable Credential and Digital Wallet solutions can seamlessly be deployed with workforces and customers, while integrating with SAML, AD, oAuth2, OIDC and more.</p>
<p>esatus remains focused on the European market, while Northern Block has a strong focus on the Canadian and North American market.</p>
<p>Both companies are founding members of the Trust over IP Foundation, and share a common goal of enabling digital trust in our everyday lives. For details about the Trust over IP Foundation, visit:&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">https://trustoverip.org/.</a></p>

 Julia Reinhardt, Privacy and AI Governance Professional, on data policy, GDPR, and its impact on&nbsp;SMEs <p>In the latest episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we spoke to Julia Reinhardt. She is a San Francisco-based expert in Artificial Intelligence governance and privacy and public policy consultant. As a Mozilla Fellow in Residence, Julia assesses the opportunities and limitations of European approaches on trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Silicon Valley and their potential for U.S. businesses and advocacy. During our conversation, Julia spoke about the different facets of GDPR's impact on Silicon Valley and the challenges of upcoming AI regulation. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> Impact of GDPR on Silicon&nbsp;valley <p>GDPR has had notable and immediate impacts worldwide. It has also brought awareness to Silicon Valley that privacy is important to people in Europe and other world regions. It’s a human right that in the US, many had not considered significant. The global conversation around privacy has shifted in the past three years since 2018 and so have the laws. As a direct result of GDPR in Europe, countries like Japan, Brazil, India, and China are in the process of passing GDPR inspired privacy laws. In addition, California has a new privacy law, which went into effect in 2020 due to&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>GDPR has also shown Silicon Valley that one of their biggest markets, Europe has its own set of rules, and the US has to follow them to be a player there and earn money in the region. And as a result, many US-based organizations that process personal data of people worldwide have decided to apply GDPR and extend all the rights that go with it to their customers who don’t need to be European residents and live outside of Europe. It gives them an edge in global compliance, and it’s easier for them to handle complaints and requests. In addition, GDPR offers them a legal framework and a set of standards.</p><p>“I need to mention that a disappointing factor with the GDPR laws is the enforcement. Even when tech companies do get hit with billion-dollar fines, for them, it’s a tap on the wrist. And so far, GDPR hasn’t changed the underlying business models, the way money is made on the internet, and surveilling people’s behavior. So it’s not just the business model of a company; it is the economic model on which the entire internet is based — that doesn’t have privacy, top of mind. Changing that requires fundamental and probably painful adjustments to the way things have been structured. That’s something that GDPR so far hasn’t been able to achieve. And that is definitely a bit disappointing.”</p> AI regulations in Europe and their global challenges <p>Julia worked as a German diplomat for almost 15 years, managing bilateral relations, navigating crisis, communication, heading up high-level protocol, participating in EU negotiation processes, and promoting innovation and outreach in the Western&nbsp;US.</p><p>As part of her work today, she mentions that she intends to make sure that the upcoming AI regulation from Europe does not again cause that lagging behind for small players because in the field of AI — size matters. “The more data you can gather, the better your AI system works. We’re already pretty far down the road to monopolization because big players in the market have access to an impressive range of data. They can also afford to gather high-quality data, which then enables them to build better-performing AI. And for small-scale providers, what’s most important is the clarity of the guidance. The draft that the European Commission tabled also has been a very long time in the making. It’s the most ambitious and the most comprehensive attempt at reining the risks linked to the deployment of AI that we have seen so far across the globe. It’s a bold new step.” You can read an analysis of the AI regulation proposal&nbsp;here.</p><p>Now in 2021, we’re at the stage of transforming these principles into practical rules and regulations. The rules that the European Commission proposed wouldn’t cover all AI systems. For instance, they do cover systems deemed to pose a significant risk to the safety and fundamental rights of people living in Europe. It’s a risk-based approach, and it has several layers. And those layers have different rules for different classes of AI systems; some are prohibited, some are considered high risk, and some follow specific rules only. And then others where, you know, they just say you have to be more transparent.</p> Going deeper into regulations: Code testing for Algorithms <p>You have to know in which category your AI system falls. For some uses of AI, the commission proposes an outright ban and says it’s an unacceptable threat to citizens. For example, an AI system causes physical or psychological harm by manipulating people’s behavior or exploiting their vulnerable abilities, like age or disability. Other examples are social scoring systems where people collect points and facial recognition in public spaces by law enforcement authorities — not all facial recognition is banned but those used by police in public areas. Although, there are exceptions.</p><p>Most of the regulatory draft focuses on AI, which is considered high risk, and what is high risk is defined in the regulatory draft. So that’s kind of problematic uses in the recruiting field in the employment admissions context, determining a person’s creditworthiness, or eligibility for public services and benefits, and some applications used in law enforcement and security and judiciary. And for those, these systems have to meet different requirements and undergo a conformity assessment before they are in the European&nbsp;market.</p><p>To ensure that an AI system complies with several requirements around serious risk management, it has to use data sets in training, validation, and testing that are relevant, representative, free of errors, etc. Documentation about a high-risk AI system must be really extensive and very precise — why you chose certain designs? Why you designed it in a specific way? The keyword is always human oversight. So high-risk AI systems must be designed to allow people to understand the capabilities and limitations of a system and counter so-called automation bias. Also, if necessary, reverse or override the output. It’s like code testing for algorithms.</p> Loopholes in AI regulation: Not the final&nbsp;world <p>The European Parliament and other bodies in Europe have already called for much stricter rules in some draft elements. In addition, certain member states believe that it should be more stringent in some cases. However, this is not the final&nbsp;word.</p><p>“In my personal opinion, I do think that the exceptions such as in facial recognition are too wide. It’s just difficult when you ban very specific uses of facial recognition but then actually in industry or private uses — there’s no ban at all. Even in the uses of law enforcement, you have certain areas where it can be used. Practically speaking, law enforcement in Europe will buy facial recognition systems on the market, wherever they’re produced, and use them in those specific cases that there would be allowed to. How do you really want to make sure that they don’t use them for other things? I think that’s a huge loophole.

  <p>The Networking and Cryptography library (NaCl pronounced “salt”) is a software library that provides the core operations required to build cryptographic tools. Sodium is a fork of NaCl with an extended API; it’s portable, and binaries are available to be used by various programming languages and operating systems. It comes in the form of a library called <code>libsodium</code>.</p>

<p>Although there are several Python and Go cryptography libraries, it is primarily a matter of personal choice which one to use. One advantage of <code>libsodium</code> is that it is available for many languages.</p>

<p>Today, we will use <code>libsodium</code> in Python to encrypt messages and decrypt them using <code>libsodium</code> in Go. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>NOTE: You can find the code for this project on <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/python-go-libsodium-example.git">GitHub</a>.</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a Libsodium Application 

<p>First, if you don’t already have Python on your computer, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install a recent version of Python 3</a>.</p>

<p>Next, create a directory where all of our future code will go:</p>

   <code>mkdir libsodium
cd libsodium
</code>   

<p>To avoid issues running the wrong version of Python and its dependencies, we recommend creating a virtual environment so that the commands <code>python</code> and <code>pip</code> run the correct versions:</p>

   <code>python3 -m venv .venv
</code>   

<p>This creates a directory called <code>.venv</code> containing the Python binaries and dependencies. The new directory should be added to the <code>.gitignore</code> file and then activated for use:</p>

   <code>source .venv/bin/activate
</code>   

<p>You can run the following command to see which version you are running:</p>

   <code>python --version
</code>   

<p>Next, install the PyNaCl library:</p>

   <code>pip install pynacl
</code>   

<p>Next, if you haven’t already installed Go on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Download and install - The Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, make the directory a Go module and install the Go crypto library:</p>

   <code>go mod init crypto
go get golang.org/x/crypto
go mod download golang.org/x/sys
</code>   

 What is Public Key Encryption 
<p>Public key or asymmetric encryption requires the generation of two numbers called keys. One key is the private key, which only the owner knows. The second key is public; it is published and widely known.</p>

<p>A message encrypted using the private key can only be decrypted using the public key. Anyone who possesses the public key can decrypt the message. The public key holder knows the message could only have been encrypted by the private key owner.</p>

<p>Conversely, a message encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key. You can be sure that only one person can view the message. The strength of the encryption depends on how much “effort” it takes to break the math without access to the decryption key.</p>

<p>A secure way of exchanging messages is to use two sets of keys, one for each party involved. Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob and ensure that only Bob can receive it. Bob wants to ensure that only Alice could have sent it. To achieve this, Alice first encrypts the message using her private key, then she encrypts it with Bob’s public key.  To recover the original message, Bob decrypts the message with his private key, and then with Alice’s public key.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The above explanation is simplified slightly. In the example below, Bob’s private key and Alice’s public key are used to generate an encryption key.  The same key is generated using Alice’s private and Bob’s public key, <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption#purpose">creating a shared key</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The encryption and decryption processes require complex computation. Low-level libraries do exist for doing this, but they are not very convenient to use. Using <code>libsodium</code> greatly simplifies the process.</p>

 How to Create Key Pairs with <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>First, we are going to write a Python program to generate public-private key pairs. Create a script called <code>generate_keys.py</code> containing the following code:</p>

   <code>import nacl.utils
from nacl.public import PrivateKey
from nacl.encoding import HexEncoder
import sys

def write(name, hex, sp):
    filename = 'key_' + name + '_' + sp 
    file = open(filename, 'wb')
    file.write(hex)
    file.close()

def make_keys(name):
    sk = PrivateKey.generate()
    write(name, sk.encode(encoder=HexEncoder), 'sk')
    pk = sk.public_key
    write(name, pk.encode(encoder=HexEncoder), 'pk')

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage:", sys.argv[0], "name")
    sys.exit()

make_keys(sys.argv[1])
</code>   

<p>The program uses <code>libsodium</code> to generate a key pair. It also uses <code>libsodium</code> to encode the keys as hexadecimal strings for portability. These hexadecimal key strings are written to files using <code>write()</code> function. The <code>make_keys()</code> function generates a public-private key pair. The <code>PrivateKey.generate()</code> function returns the private key.</p>

<p>Libsodium objects have an <code>encode()</code> function to encode the object. In this case, it uses <code>HexEncoder</code>. The public key is an attribute on the private key object. The name of the key owner is passed as a command-line argument.</p>

<p>Now run the program to generate keys for Alice and Bob:</p>

   <code>python generate_keys.py alice
python generate_keys.py bob
</code>   

<p>The files <code>key_alice_sk</code>, <code>key_alice_pk</code>, <code>key_bob_sk</code>, and <code>key_bob_pk</code> should have been created.</p>

 Encrypt a Message with <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>The message to be encrypted is a text file containing the poem “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll. The poem itself is somewhat cryptic, as the meaning of the words is open to interpretation! Rather fittingly, “Jabberwocky” was first published in the book Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There.</p>

<p>Download the “Jabberwocky” poem to <code>jabberwocky.txt</code>:</p>

   <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadev/libsodium/main/Jabberwocky.txt &gt; Jabberwocky.txt
</code>   

<p>Libsodium makes it very easy to encrypt messages. It uses a <code>Box</code> object constructed from your private key and the recipient’s public key. The box is then used to encrypt a message. Create a file called <code>encrypt.py</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>import nacl.utils
from nacl.public import PrivateKey, PublicKey, Box
from nacl.encoding import HexEncoder
import sys

class EncryptFile :
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver
        self.sk = PrivateKey(self.get_key(sender, 'sk'), encoder=HexEncoder)
        self.pk = PublicKey(self.get_key(receiver, 'pk'), encoder=HexEncoder)

    def get_key(self, name, suffix):
        filename = 'key_' + name + '_' + suffix
        file = open(filename, 'rb')
        data = file.read()
        file.close()
        return data

    def encrypt(self, textfile, encfile):
        box = Box(self.sk, self.pk)
        tfile = open(textfile, 'rb')
        text = tfile.read()
        tfile.close()
        etext = box.encrypt(text)
        efile = open(encfile, 'wb')
        efile.write(etext)
        efile.close()

encrypter = EncryptFile('alice', 'bob')
encrypter.encrypt('Jabberwocky.txt', 'message.enc')
print('Done!')
</code>   

<p>We use the names of the sender and the receiver to construct the  <code>EncryptFile</code> class. <code>EncryptFile</code> uses the <code>get_key()</code> helper function to read the hexadecimal encoded key from a file. Libsodium <code>PublicKey</code>and <code>PrivateKey</code> objects are constructed from the encoded keys. The <code>encrypt()</code> function constructs a <code>Box</code> object from the sender’s private key and the recipient’s public key. Then the message is read from a text file as a byte string and is encrypted by the box. The encrypted message is saved to a file for transmission.</p>

<p>Note that this generates a 24-byte random, one-time-use number called a nonce (“Number used ONCE”). The purpose of the nonce is to ensure that if the same message is encrypted more than once, the resulting encrypted message will be different. The nonce forms the first 24 bytes of the encrypted message.</p>

<p>Encrypt the poem by running:</p>

   <code>python encrypt.py
</code>   

 Decrypt a Message with Go and <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>We are going to write a simple Go program that can decrypt a message. Create a file named <code>decrypt.go</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"

	"golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box"
)

var PublicKey [32]byte
var SecretKey [32]byte

func GetKeys() {
	sk, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("key_bob_sk")
	keysk, _ := hex.DecodeString(string(sk))
	copy(SecretKey[:], keysk)
	pk, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("key_alice_pk")
	keypk, _ := hex.DecodeString(string(pk))
	copy(PublicKey[:], keypk)
}

func Decrypt() {
	enc, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("message.enc")
	var nonce [24]byte
	copy(nonce[:], enc[:24])
	crypto := enc[24:]
	message, _ := box.Open(nil, crypto, &amp;nonce, &amp;PublicKey, &amp;SecretKey)
	fmt.Println(string(message))
}

func main() {
	GetKeys()
	Decrypt()
}
</code>   

<p>Go is a strongly typed language, so we have to create 32-byte arrays to store the keys. The <code>GetKeys()</code> function reads Bob’s private key and Alice’s public key for the files. They are converted from hexadecimal strings into byte arrays and copied into the fixed-length arrays. The <code>Decrypt</code> function reads the encrypted message into a byte array. The nonce needs to be separated from the encrypted message and copied into a 24-byte array. The <code>box.Open()</code> function performs the decryption and then prints the decrypted message.</p>

<p>Run the application to see the poem “Jabberwocky” restored:</p>

   <code>go run decrypt.go
</code>   

 What is Secret Key Encryption 

<p>Secret-key encryption uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt a message. It is commonly used as a faster alternative to public-key encryption. The key itself is a fixed-length random number. As there is only a single key, both the sender and recipient need a copy of it. This requires a key exchange which is often performed out of band or by using public-key encryption.</p>

 Encrypt a Message with <code>libsodium</code> and Secret Key 

<p>We will again encrypt the poem “Jabberwocky,” but this time using secret-key encryption. For convenience, we will again generate and store the key in a file:</p>

   <code>gpg --gen-random 2 32 &gt; key_secret
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: Secure key exchange must be used between parties holding any shared secret.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Create a file called <code>encrypt_shared.py</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>import nacl.utils
from nacl.public import PrivateKey, PublicKey, Box
from nacl.encoding import HexEncoder
from nacl.secret import SecretBox
import sys

class Encrypter :
    def __init__(self):
        file = open('key_secret', 'rb')
        self.key = file.read()
        file.close()

    def encrypt(self, textfile, encfile):
        box = SecretBox(self.key)
        tfile = open(textfile, 'rb')
        text = tfile.read()
        tfile.close()
        etext = box.encrypt(text)
        efile = open(encfile, 'wb')
        efile.write(etext)
        efile.close()

encrypter = Encrypter()
encrypter.encrypt('Jabberwocky.txt', 'message.sec')
print('Done!')
</code>   

<p>This time the constructor creates a random secret key and stores it in a file. The <code>encrypt()</code> function uses a <code>SecretBox</code> to encrypt the message. Once again a 24-byte nonce is automatically created and prepended to the encrypted message.</p>

<p>Run the script to create the key and encrypted message files:</p>

   <code>python encrypt_shared.py
</code>   

 Decrypt a Message with <code>libsodium</code> and Secret Key 

<p>The Go code for decryption is quite simple. Create a file called <code>decryptsec.go</code> containing the following code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"

	"golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox"
)

var SecretKey [32]byte

func GetKey() {
	sk, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("key_secret")
	copy(SecretKey[:], sk)
}

func Decrypt() {
	enc, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("message.sec")
	var nonce [24]byte
	copy(nonce[:], enc[:24])
	crypto := enc[24:]
	message, _ := secretbox.Open(nil, crypto, &amp;nonce, &amp;SecretKey)
	fmt.Println(string(message))
}

func main() {
	GetKey()
	Decrypt()
}
</code>   

<p>In this case, only the secret key is extracted from the file using the <code>GetKey()</code> function. The program reads the encrypted message from a file and extracts the nonce. Finally, the function <code>secretbox.Open()</code> decrypts the message using the nonce and the secret key.</p>

<p>Run the program to see the “Jabberwocky” poem restored:</p>

   <code>go run decryptsec.go
</code>   

 Learn more about Python, Go, and <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>NaCl, Libsodium, and the language-specific wrappers around them simplify the process of encrypting and decrypting messages. Most cryptographic libraries provide low-level operations that are complex to use. The box mechanism performs encryption and decryption in a single function call. All you need is the data, the key or keys, and a nonce.

<p>There is a theoretical elegance to a fully transparent, informed, granular&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/consent-2/">consent</a>&nbsp;approach in consumer&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;— but is it really viable?</p>



<p>Consent is good in theory. It’s a way for an individual to give explicit permission to permit or deny particular types of data processing or sharing by a service. But in practice, consent alone falls short on many fronts.</p>



 Consent fatigue is real. 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/how-to-avoid-consent-fatigue/">Consent fatigue</a>&nbsp;is where a user grows so weary of the frequent and complex consent requests from digital interactions, they click past them to avoid the time suck and brain drain. The best example of consent fatigue is privacy notices. Back in 2008,&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/how-to-avoid-consent-fatigue/">researchers</a>&nbsp;estimated that the average US user would likely encounter 1,462 privacy policies a year and consume around&nbsp;<a href="https://techland.time.com/2012/03/06/youd-need-76-work-days-to-read-all-your-privacy-policies-each-year/">76 days</a>&nbsp;if they read them in full. Fourteen years on, privacy policies are a mainstay of our digital lives.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-attitudes-and-experiences-with-privacy-policies-and-laws/">Pew Research</a>&nbsp;reports 81 percent of adults are being asked at least monthly to agree to a privacy policy but only 9 per cent are always reading the policy before agreeing to the terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can we rely on ‘informed consent’ if the&nbsp;informed&nbsp;part is largely missing?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Consent doesn’t scale well from the consumer’s perspective. 



<p></p>



<p>Most people visit a small number of sites frequently and a large number of sites infrequently. And most don’t want a blanket setting for all the sites and services they use. Global opt-in or opt-out isn’t necessarily viable for the way many of us interact online, where we may want different choices for different types of web sites or services. Telling each site what we do and don’t want is cumbersome and resource-intensive. Circle back to consent fatigue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while the&nbsp;<a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a>&nbsp;appears to reduce the amount of effort a user needs to expend to exercise some data sharing choices consistently across multiple web sites, the web site or service must be set up to react appropriately to receiving a GPC directive from a user’s app or browser. We’re still better off with the GPC than without it, but this type of limitation voids its potential as a universal panacea without regulatory enforcement.</p>



 Consent brings an unbalanced cost-to-effort ratio.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Expanding on our last point, web tech expert&nbsp;<a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Robin</a><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/"> </a><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Berjon</a>&nbsp;says: “All that consent does is that it offloads privacy labor to the user, and only under very specific conditions does it increase the user’s autonomy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a reason why data brokers love consent so much and won’t ever stop talking about “transparency and choice“: it works in favor of whichever party has the time to invest in creating a consent funnel, and that’s never individuals.”</p>



<p>Of course, some services are trying to comply with regulations in the absence of an industry standard for consent notice design—and this inconsistency is yet another issue with a whole privacy model relying on consent.</p>



 Consent is easily manipulated.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Robin Berjon</a>&nbsp;weighs in on this point too: “Digital self-determination in the face of privacy issues is highly manipulable and that’s even&nbsp;without&nbsp;dark patterns.” Add in&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">dark patterns</a>&nbsp;by services capitalizing on fatigued consumers and suddenly users are giving up far more data and privacy than they intended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/10/most-eu-cookie-consent-notices-are-meaningless-or-manipulative-study-finds/">EU study</a>&nbsp;into cookie consent notices reveals this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“…&nbsp;the majority are placed at the bottom of the screen (58%); not blocking the interaction with the website (93%); and offering no options other than a confirmation button that does not do anything (86%). So no choice at all then.</p>



<p>A majority also try to nudge users towards consenting (57%) — such as by using ‘dark pattern’ techniques like using a color to highlight the ‘agree’ button (which if clicked accepts privacy-unfriendly defaults) vs displaying a much less visible link to ‘more options’ so that pro-privacy choices are buried off screen.</p>



<p>And while they found that nearly all cookie notices (92%) contained a link to the site’s privacy policy, only a third (39%) mention the specific purpose of the data collection or who can access the data (21%).”</p>



<p>It should come as no surprise that big platforms like Facebook and Google are masters at using dark patterns for consent. They design the process to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/07/26/privacy-debate-reveals-how-big-techs-transparency-and-user-control-arguments-fall">make it difficult</a>&nbsp;for the user to set privacy choices and understand them. Most consumers twiddle all the dials and think they’ve set all possible privacy protections, when in fact they have not.</p>



<p>What’s more, the guidance from big platforms on how to make good privacy choices is often not readily consumable and is intentionally skewed in their favor. They want to keep the data tap turned on full.</p>



 Consent can be convoluted. 



<p></p>



<p>Even when companies are trying to do the right thing, they tend to offer consumers privacy choices and implications that are difficult to grasp. In the GDPR for example, consent is spoken about in terms of criteria:&nbsp;informed,&nbsp;transparent,&nbsp;timely,&nbsp;contextual,&nbsp;granular. Regulations almost add to the convolution for the consumer.</p>



 Consent is only one (limited) tool in the toolkit. 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Berjon</a>&nbsp;reminds us: “The answer to problems caused by consent isn’t more consent, automated consent, or consent that covers more processing. It’s to use consent where and when it is the right tool to increase people’s autonomy, and to stop pretending that you can bang nails in with it in all the other cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He notes: “Lindsey Barrett summarized the situation well when she described notice and choice as ‘<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3354129">a method of privacy regulation which promises transparency and agency but delivers neither’.</a>”</p>



 So, what’s the outlook for consent? 



<p></p>



<p>Despite growing concern over consent alone as a mechanism for protecting&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>,&nbsp;no one is taking it off the table just yet. Consent is one of six lawful bases to process personal data under&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">Article 6</a>&nbsp;of the GDPR. Consent is also present in other data protection regulations too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In looking to tame the beast, IAPP contributor&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-there-a-role-for-consent-in-privacy/">Robert Gelman</a>&nbsp;wonders whether “it’s possible that consent can play a meaningful and fair role in consumer privacy if an independent third party sets the terms of consent rather than a business desperate to have consumers agree to its terms?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He says: “Perhaps a truly neutral third party standing between the consumer and the business seeking choices involving privacy might produce a better and fairer outcome.”</p>



<p>In exploring the notion of a third-party consent mechanism, Gelman cites the US Do Not Call Registry and Apple’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">ATT feature</a>&nbsp;as two data points proving a viable role for third parties: “In both cases, a third party sets the terms and the methodology for consumer choice. In the one case, Apple set the terms. In the other case, the FTC did. This is not what happens when a website unilaterally sets the terms of consent. A one-sided approach is why consent does nothing for consumers today.”</p>



 Our position on consent 



<p></p>



<p>Since Anonyome Labs started in 2014 we have felt that while nothing is wrong with consent approaches in theory, the consumer needs more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that if regulations aren’t toothy on enforcement, it will result in big companies doing the wrong thing anyway. Regulations alone aren’t going to protect consumers from insolent companies and those beyond reach (outside the jurisdiction but doing business within it).</p>



<p>Consent is unnecessary when dealing with companies whose interests are aligned with the consumers’. But if interests aren’t aligned, a company may work hard to make it difficult for the user to withhold or withdraw consent.</p>



<p>Our consumer app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;steps in when the consumer can’t make consent choices in their favor or it’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/fight-the-fatigue-data-privacy-really-does-matter/">all too hard</a>. MySudo is a useful tool because it mitigates consent where the user needs to and keeps it in check where the user wants more control over their personal data.</p>



<p>It’s unlikely the privacy problem will ever be fully solved. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and the capabilities in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, our business toolkit for rapidly deploying branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions, will always have a place and their role will grow ever more important.</p>

					<p>The worldwide adoption of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) has the potential to increase people’s access to goods and services, including for disadvantaged individuals across the globe. For example, more than one billion people in the world do not have a government ID¹, causing them to be excluded from a variety of services like banking and healthcare. If done properly, SSI can empower disadvantaged individuals with a digital identity that they control and can easily prove to others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic discussed these topics and more as we participated in a panel discussion titled “SSI for Economic Empowerment: Lessons from Africa” at the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> Global Forum 2021. Anna Johnson, Trinsic’s Director of Marketing, was the panel moderator, and the four panelists were:<br><br></p>  Fabian Portmann, CTO, <a href="https://www.farmerconnect.com/">Farmer Connect</a>  Bryan Pon, Director of Strategy, <a href="https://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a>  Thea Sommerseth Myhren, CEO, <a href="https://www.diwala.io/">Diwala</a>  Lohan Spies, CTO, <a href="https://www.yoma.africa/">Yoma</a>  <p><br>All four of the companies listed above are implementing SSI solutions within the African continent, and three of the four (Kiva, Yoma, and Farmer Connect) are using Trinsic to do so. In this event, the panelists shared insights from each of their respective SSI projects which range from empowering African youth to build a digital CV to connect them to future employers to empowering smallholder farmers with supply chain credentials that make some of them bankable for the first time. Below is the video recording and some highlights from the discussion.</p>

					<p>One of the main points of discussion revolved around identifying the unique properties of SSI that make it adept at economically empowering people in Africa. The panelists had varying thoughts and perspectives to share.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lohan from Yoma focused on the fact that many people in Africa do not have any form of identity—not even a national identity. He explained that SSI will make a massive impact from an economic perspective because SSI makes it possible for those who have no form of identity to build it up from scratch to the point where they have access to services they may have not had access to before. He also talked about the fact that people can take the credentials wherever they go (even cross-border) and use them to prove things about themselves and unlock economic opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bryan from Kiva talked specifically about two SSI properties that Kiva’s stakeholders find of value. The first is the ability to have peer-to-peer connections where the verifier of the credential doesn’t have to “phone home” to the issuing party to authenticate a credential. The second is the ability to support multiple credential issuers without having to harmonize or sync their databases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the discussion continued, the panelists talked about the current challenges they are facing with implementing their SSI solutions in Africa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fabian from Farmer Connect brought up their focus on solving the end user adoption challenge which is due to multiple factors including end users’ literacy, access to cellular networks, or lack of smart phones. He stressed the importance of making the technology inclusive enough to address these circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thea from Diwala also focused on end user adoption and specifically mentioned the challenge of onboarding. She explained that in remote areas, people may not have an email or a phone number, so standard onboarding methods become much more complicated. She emphasized the importance of teaching digital literacy where needed and the importance of building solutions that are inclusive so no one gets left behind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To wrap up the discussion, the panelists discussed what was needed for SSI to be ultimately successful in Africa. Overall, the panelists shared the same sentiment that can be summarized with a quote from Thea when she said, “I think the future for SSI [in Africa] is collaboration. We all need to work together in terms of building the standards, building open source, and understanding how we actually enable this ecosystem to work across the whole sector.”</p>

 GiD Report#171 — How crypto will be regulated in the&nbsp;U.S. <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-170-a-bombshell-in-the-battle-for-the-future-of-crypto-2eb78259300b">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p> This week:   China as a bellwether  Biden’s infrastructure bill targets&nbsp;crypto  A Ripple Test to replace the Howey&nbsp;Test?  What clear legislation might look&nbsp;like  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. Crypto is growing up — and that means regulations are&nbsp;incoming <p>With Bitcoin touching $1 trillion in market capitalization and the explosion of DeFi and NFTs this cycle, crypto has fully captured the hearts and minds — or at least the attention — of the mainstream — which includes lawmakers and regulators alike.</p><p>One indicator? China — which has become somewhat of a bellwether for where things might be heading Westward, in part due to how the government is structured over there. If China decides to do something, they’ll just do it. It’s not quite as straightforward for the Biden administration.</p><p>And what has China been doing? <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-08-01/china-tech-crackdown-communist-party-policy-changes-behind-1-trillion-selloff">Cracking down on Big Tech</a> — for starters. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/china-cracks-down-on-crypto-related-services-in-ongoing-war-on-bitcoin.html">But also&nbsp;crypto</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f6c876-22bb-498c-a425-78287455a3e1">the&nbsp;FT</a>:</p><blockquote>In contrast, China is pressing ahead with a more forceful, unified top-down vision, setting the stage for transformational dynamics that have the potential to extend well beyond the country&nbsp;itself.</blockquote><blockquote>What happens next will have profound implications for financial services, monetary policy, investment outcomes, payment platforms and the configuration of global reserve currencies. It will also influence the control and use of big data, as well as China-US technological and economic competition.</blockquote><p>The reality is that the crypto revolution matters — a lot — with plenty of long term implications. Governments around the world — from east to west — are going to want to get a handle of things. They’ll want to try to gain some semblance of control. And they’re going to want&nbsp;taxes.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-is-china-smashing-its-tech-industry">Why is China smashing its tech industry?</a>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f6c876-22bb-498c-a425-78287455a3e1">China lays down challenge to the west on&nbsp;crypto</a>  <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/battle-lines-over-cryptocurrencies-being-drawn-in-congress">Battle lines over cryptocurrencies being drawn in&nbsp;Congress</a>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0cbd5704-42fd-4c9c-b0ab-8bca212b64b8">Hedge funds back away from Binance after regulatory assault</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tether-executives-said-to-face-criminal-probe-into-bank-fraud">Tether Executives Said to Face Criminal Probe Into Bank&nbsp;Fraud</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/tether-remains-stable-amid-reports-of-doj-probe/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Tether Remains Stable Amid Reports of DOJ Probe — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazon-to-accept-bitcoin-by-end-of-2021-and-develop-own-1847360405/amp">Amazon Rumored to Accept Bitcoin by End of 2021:&nbsp;Report</a>  <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-denies-report-accepting-bitcoin-215220333.html">Amazon denies report of accepting bitcoin as&nbsp;payment</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/paypal-ceo-smart-contracts-defi-apps-part-of-companys-crypto-plans/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">PayPal CEO: Smart Contracts, DeFi Apps Part of Company’s Crypto Plans — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/goldman-files-for-defi-and-blockchain-equity-etf/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Goldman Sachs Files for “DeFi” and Blockchain Equity ETF — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-digital-yuan-puts-ant-and-tencent-in-an-awkward-spot-11627210802">China’s Digital Yuan Puts Ant and Tencent in an Awkward&nbsp;Spot</a>   2. How crypto ended up in Biden’s infrastructure bill Photo: Joe Campaigning<p>Unlike China’s top-down approach, President Biden has to deal with the legislative process. In this case, that means inserting crypto stuff into the $1 trillion infrastructure bill.</p><p>Beyond the expectation of raising $30 billion in taxes, of note is how the bill defines “brokers” (along w/the reporting requirements).</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/infrastructure-cryptocurrency-taxes-871cee3f-1e29-4888-8a06-f997e713030a.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: In an updated text of the bill, senators have narrowed the definition of “brokers” that would fall under the new transaction reporting requirements, but it’s still not specific enough, according to industry insiders.</blockquote>  The new version defines a broker as “Any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another&nbsp;person.”  The worry is that even the new definition still doesn’t explicitly (or more clearly) exclude parties like miners, node operators, and software developers.  “Such a requirement is essentially forcing miners, lightning nodes, etc., to identify others on the network,” Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1421903482693488642">tweeted</a>. “Not only is this nonsensical from a technical perspective, such a mandate would very likely be unconstitutional surveillance.”  <blockquote>Between the lines: This is yet another example of the cryptocurrencies only getting attention from lawmakers when they want something. The industry has been clamoring for clearer regulations and laws, and a slew of bills have emerged over the years, but things today are far from a neat and comprehensive set of&nbsp;rules.</blockquote><p>And this just in — after some last minute pushback from crypto lobbyists, lawmakers have amended the&nbsp;bill.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/us/politics/infrastructure-deal-cryptocurrency.html">the NYTimes&nbsp;report</a>:</p><blockquote>After receiving pushback from cryptocurrency lobbyists, lawmakers revised that section of the bill to “clarify” the definition of a broker rather than expand upon&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>The legislation also removed language that explicitly targeted “any decentralized exchange or peer-to-peer marketplace.” It replaced that with a broader definition that characterizes brokers as anyone “responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another&nbsp;person.”</blockquote><blockquote>The cryptocurrency industry has been adamant that the tougher tax enforcement should not apply to miners, or creators, of digital money, or the “node operators” that keep the software behind transactions moving.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/politics/infrastructure-cryptocurrency.html">Cryptocurrency in the Infrastructure Bill: The industry won last-minute concessions.</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/updated-infrastructure-bill">Updated US Infrastructure Bill Narrows Crypto Reporting Rule — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/infrastructure-cryptocurrency-taxes-871cee3f-1e29-4888-8a06-f997e713030a.html">Crypto industry faces $30 billion tax threat from infrastructure bill</a>  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-companies-fearful-of-28-billion-tax-plan-in-infrastructure-bill-2021-8">Crypto organizations say $28 billion tax plan in Senate infrastructure bill poses an ‘imminent threat’ to the&nbsp;industry</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/us/politics/infrastructure-deal-cryptocurrency.html">Infrastructure Deal Puts Cryptocurrencies in Washington’s Cross&nbsp;Hairs</a>   3. A Ripple Test to replace the Howey&nbsp;Test? <p>All of which is more or less fine. The U.S. government gets another revenue stream. Individuals and businesses have clarity around reporting rules (now that the “broker” thing seems to be adequately addressed).</p><p>Where there’s a clear lack of clarity, however, is with the industry at large when it comes to securities regulations — as evidenced by the ongoing SEC v. Ripple&nbsp;lawsuit.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/ripple-xrp-sec-lawsuit-impact-on-crypto-industry/">Fortune</a>:</p><blockquote>Whatever the ultimate court decision or settlement, the outcome is certain to impact the cryptocurrency world. The case is already turning up pressure on both the SEC and Congress to clarify the law and regulation governing cryptocurrency, particularly in terms of when a cryptocurrency is or isn’t a security. “We keep trying to shoehorn cryptocurrency into preexisting regulatory processes, when it’s abundantly clear it doesn’t fit well,” said Goforth. “We’re long overdue in fixing&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/07/22/toward-a-ripple-test-at-the-sec/?sh=719c75ea2e67">here’s Roslyn Layton</a> over at Forbes on a “Ripple&nbsp;Test”:</p><blockquote>At a recent <a href="https://regproject.org/podcast/deep-dive-ep-185/">event</a>, crypto policy scholars discussed the Security and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against fintech startup Ripple and how the case amounted to “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/06/30/sec-assault-on-ripple-provokes-wider-debate/?sh=595863f929e1">regulation by enforcement</a>.” They suggest that the abrupt decision was an attempt by the SEC to sidestep Congress for the needed procedural step to clarify the SEC’s authority in statute. The abrupt determination, after 7 years, that Ripple’s XRP payment protocol and distributed ledger is not a currency but rather a security, has caused many currency exchanges to delist XRP and XRP holders have lost billions of dollars in value. It is hardly the first time that a regulatory agency has overstepped its authority, causing widespread damage to markets, innovators, and consumers. The SEC justified its action under the so-called Howey Test, which comes from a 1946 Supreme Court case which defines the meaning of an “investment contract” within the Securities Act of 1933. Admittedly vague, the Howey Test defines securities as invested contracts dependent on the efforts of others. The scholars suggested that the SEC itself needs a “Ripple Test”, a set of clear, transparent, and objective guidelines on whether an asset like cryptocurrency is a security.</blockquote><blockquote>John Berlau of the Competitive Enterprise Institute suggests two minimum requirements to determine whether a digital asset is a security: (a) an explicit promise of ownership or share of the firm’s revenues or profits, and (b) an explicit promise of return on investment. Berlau suggests that these two disclosures are necessary to distinguish cryptocurrency investment from the larger world of investment in which the SEC has no jurisdiction even though vendors hawk the investment value of art, comic books, action figures, cars, and other collectibles. Notably, this determination should be defined in statue by Congress, lest the SEC will continue to freelance on ever-expanding regulatory turf as seen presently in the fractionalized non-fungible tokens (NFTs) used for the distribution of digital&nbsp;art.</blockquote><p>With rumors of a potential settlement in the works last week <a href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1421470726654148615">losing steam</a>, we might have to wait a little bit longer for that regulatory clarity.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/elizabeth-warren-sec-deadline-crypto-regulation">the SEC’s deadline</a> to respond to Elizabeth Warren’s open letter on the risks of crypto was last&nbsp;week.</p><p>By the way, SEC chief Gary Gensler just <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1419685223076347908">joined&nbsp;Twitter</a>.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/07/22/toward-a-ripple-test-at-the-sec/?sh=719c75ea2e67">Toward A Ripple Test At The&nbsp;SEC</a>  <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/ripple-xrp-sec-lawsuit-impact-on-crypto-industry/">Why Ripple’s SEC lawsuit could have a lasting impact on&nbsp;crypto</a>   4. What clear crypto regulation might look&nbsp;like <p>Or what if we didn’t have to wait for the conclusion of the Ripple lawsuit? What if we actually enacted clear legislation around crypto’s security&nbsp;status?</p><p>Seems like a novel idea — one that Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) appears to have taken to, introducing new legislation last week called the <a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307">Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act</a>:</p><blockquote>“Innovation in the digital asset sector is creating new goods and services every day as well as many new, high-quality jobs. The United States should provide a legal and regulatory environment which promotes this type of innovation and growth,” said Rep. Beyer. “Digital assets and blockchain technology hold great promise, and it is clear that assets like Bitcoin and Ether are here to stay. Unfortunately, the current digital asset market structure and regulatory framework is ambiguous and dangerous for investors and consumers. Digital asset holders have been subjected to rampant fraud, theft, and market manipulation for years, yet Congress has hitherto ignored the entreaties of industry experts and federal regulators to create a comprehensive legal framework. Our laws are behind the times, and my bill would start the long overdue process of updating them to give digital asset holders and investors basic protections.”</blockquote><p>Some of the bill’s&nbsp;goals:</p>  Create statutory definitions for digital assets and digital asset securities and provide the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with authority over digital asset securities and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with authority over digital&nbsp;assets;  Provide legal certainty as to the regulatory status for the top 90% of the digital asset market (by market capitalization and trading volume) through a joint SEC/CFTC rulemaking.  Require digital asset transactions that are not recorded on the publicly distributed ledger to be reported to a registered Digital Asset Trade Repository within 24 hours to minimize the potential for fraud and promote transparency;  Explicitly add digital assets and digital asset securities to the statutory definition of “monetary instruments,” under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), formalizing the regulatory requirements for digital assets and digital asset securities to comply with anti-money laundering, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements;  <p>So what would constitute a security under Beyer’s proposed legislation? (You can check out <a href="https://beyer.house.gov/uploadedfiles/beyer_028_xml.pdf">the full text&nbsp;here</a>.)</p> “(82) DIGITAL ASSET SECURITY — <br>“(A) IN GENERAL. — The term ‘digital asset security’ means a digital asset that:  “(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:  “(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.  “(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.  “(III) Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the digital asset) of the issuer.  “(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer’s liquidation.  “(ii) In the case of an issuer with service, goods, or platform that is not wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with respect to any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings) which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset, issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service, goods, or platform of the issuer.  “(B) RULE RELATING TO DIGITAL ASSETS. — The term ‘digital asset security’ does not include any digital asset other than the digital assets described in subparagraph (A). Any digital asset not described in subparagraph (A) shall be considered to be, and regulated as, a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a et seq.).”. <p>Seems reasonable.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307">Beyer Introduces New Legislation To Regulate Digital&nbsp;Assets</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/congressman-introduces-new-legislation-to-regulate-digital-assets">Framework to Regulate Crypto, Stablecoins Introduced in US Congress — CoinDesk</a>   5.

<p>Our new Podcast with OMFIF -DMI is live on <a href="https://www.omfif.org/podcast/requirements-for-a-fully-functional-cbdc/">https://www.omfif.org/podcast/requirements-for-a-fully-functional-cbdc/</a></p><p>Listen to our new podcast in collaboration with OMFIF’s DMI and hosted by OMFIF CEO John Orchard, where Sovereign Wallet Network CEO Seokgu (Phantom) Yun speaks about the Requirements for a fully functional CBDC, alongside Charles Kerrigan partner&nbsp;CMS</p><p>Here is an abstract from the 60 minutes long podcast:<br>Q1: What are the requirements for a functioning central bank digital currency and how could the design of CBDC support a more resilient payments landscape? How can you incorporate privacy and transparency into the design of&nbsp;CBDC?</p><p>Phantom Yun&nbsp;: Blockchain can be defined as a system that sacrifices performance for the sake of increased security and decentralization. To become a useful and deployable CBDC, any CBDC implementation should perform as faster as other competing payment systems such as credit cards. Also, it is desirable to out-perform most cryptocurrencies to compete in the cross-border payment of choice. For this, we need to solve the blockchain Trilemma also, that is performance, security and decentralization can not be achieved at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>MetaMUI has solved the blockchain trilemma by identifying the fact that the current blockchain is not truly decentralized. It is structurally decentralized but operationally centralized. By reversing this, having structurally centralized but operationally decentralized architecture, we can achieve high-performance blockchain ever possible. MetaMUI can out-perform all blockchain-based platforms and centralized payment platforms.<br>MetaMUI CBDC is the only CBDC platform that can out-perform the so-called (the world’s fastest CBDC), Chinese&nbsp;E-CNY.</p><p>Blockchain-based CBDC should not only solve the blockchain trilemma but also the CBDC design trilemma. Identity, privacy, and programmability, which cannot be easily achieved at the same time. We can not ignore privacy for the sake of achieving legal compliance and implementing programmable money. MetaMUI’s answer to this trilemma is the use of a decentralized identity system such as self-sovereign identity to find the perfect equilibrium of CBDC design trilemma. Self-sovereign identity is very famous for its advanced privacy protection. By having SSID based blockchain system we can incorporate both privacy and transparency into the blockchain-based CBDC system. Also, we use zero-knowledge encryption to protect the transaction privacy of blockchain data.</p><p>#CBDC #MetaMUI #CBPM #Identity_Based_Blockchain #OMFIF #fintech #payments #blockchain #security #Privacy #programmability</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the launch of the <a href="https://www.globalid.cards/xrp-card/">XRP Mastercard® Debit&nbsp;Card</a>!</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://global.id/">GlobaliD</a> vision, we believe that everyone has a right to not only an identity but also a wallet tied to that identity. With that wallet, they should be able to hold, trade, and spend money and assets of any kind. In essence, it’s about giving everyone a seat at the&nbsp;table.</p><p>The XRP Card takes that one step further, allowing users to spend fiat, crypto, or any other digital asset from their GlobaliD Wallet, powered by <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, anywhere Mastercard is accepted — all while earning up to 5% cash back in XRP&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The XRP Card is also the first ever community-linked debit card of its kind — it’s available exclusively to members of the <a href="http://How%20to%20get%20the%20XRP%20Mastercard®%20Debit%20Card%20Check%20out%20the%20launch%20page%20Watch%20the%20step-by-step%20instructional%20video%20Join%20the%20XRP%20Army%20Group%20on%20GlobaliD%20Read%20the%20FAQ">XRP Army Group</a> on GlobaliD. The longer term vision is to empower any community with the tools to quickly and conveniently issue their own community debit cards to their members, each with their own unique set of traits and rewards programs.</p> How to get the XRP Mastercard® Debit&nbsp;Card   <a href="https://www.globalid.cards/xrp-card/">Check out the launch&nbsp;page</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yMzh6N6xdQQ">Watch the step-by-step instructional video</a>  <a href="https://link.global.id/group-invite?short_link_id=VYaD0jAnLlgj">Join the XRP Army Group on&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <a href="https://care.global.id/en/collections/2990567-xrp-card">Read the&nbsp;FAQ</a>  <p>(For now, the card is only available to U.S. residents, but we’re working hard on international expansion. Residents of Colorado, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, New York, and Virginia are not eligible for the program at this&nbsp;time.)</p><p>All of this is made possible by GlobaliD’s Sovereignty Stack — composed of self-sovereign identity, messaging and groups, and the wallet — what we see as the core building blocks for the next chapter of the internet. It’s one reason why we were able to create the XRP Card in just five months from conception to initial&nbsp;launch.</p><p>We also couldn’t have done it without our ecosystem of partners — including <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, which powers the GlobaliD Wallet, and <a href="https://aptopayments.com/">Apto</a>, whose <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/partner-spotlight-apto-payments-launches-instant-card-issuance-3a3397e8613a">instant issuance program</a> underpins the XRP&nbsp;Card.</p><p>We caught up with two of the team leads on the XRP Card project at GlobaliD — Paul Stavropoulos and Laura Toh — to chat about the launch, the XRP Card program, and the long term&nbsp;vision.</p> How did the XRP Card get&nbsp;started? <p>Paul: We believe that identity is a combination of the credentials you have, the people you communicate with, and the value that you own. In the context of value, it’s also about how you spend it — which is very personal. It’s a big part of your identity. Right now, the main way people spend is through debit and credit cards. So, we see debit cards as the first step toward allowing folks to spend and make transactions with the value of any kind that they&nbsp;hold.</p><p>We started with the XRP Card because we happen to have a lot of fans that love the value that XRP brings. It was a natural fit to start with the XRP community because they’re active and highly engaged, allowing us to push forward not only our vision for allowing you to spend value that’s associated with identity but also for empowering communities, which we’ll talk about&nbsp;later.</p><p>Laura: Greg [Kidd, GlobaliD co-founder and CEO] has always been an advocate for XRP and crypto at large. He has a reputation for not backing away from difficult conversations around its future — for instance, his <a href="https://youtu.be/v2gLHm-4qRM">first podcast on the SEC lawsuit</a>. So it was a natural fit. We were able to get over 25,000 people on the waitlist in the first week with pretty much no marketing — just a&nbsp;tweet.</p> There’s a lot of debit and credit card programs being marketed at the moment that offer crypto rewards. The XRP Card appears unique in that regard since it’s tied to a specific community. Can you explain the thinking behind&nbsp;that? <p>Laura: The vision for GlobaliD is for everyone to have an identity that allows them to trust and be trusted online — similar to real life. For your digital identity to be worthwhile, you need to be able to do something with it. Our theory is that community (and Groups) is the best way of creating incentives for people to kickstart that approach, where the starting point for your identity is to be able to start interacting with other&nbsp;people.</p><p>Nobody gets a driver’s license for the sake of having a license. You get it because it allows you to do things — whether that’s driving a car or getting into a bar. For us, building communities is a way to make these identities valuable today. When you get your XRP Card, you’re not just getting a way to pay for things, you’re joining a community of like-minded people, who you can trust, interact with, and potentially further down the line, take collective action either socially or financially.</p><p>Paul: The biggest difference between the XRP Card and other offerings out there is that we’re not interested in just putting out a debit card. The long term vision is to empower individuals and groups — to allow them to create communities and have the ability to leverage the collective power of those communities. Eventually, GlobaliD users will be able to not only create groups, but also issue their own community-specific cards, allowing them to create their own merchant networks, reward programs, or even group funding mechanisms in order to leverage the group’s collective financial power. The next big step is implementing a noncustodial wallet — both for users and communities.</p><p>The XRP Card is essentially a reference implementation of that vision — how a decentralized community can organize and use their collective spending power, to earn rewards, and benefit from the way they interact in the real world when they spend money. The XRP Card is a way to build out these communities, and help people bridge that gap to the real world from their online community. It becomes another way to express and establish your identity.</p> What exactly do you mean by collective action? <p>Laura: There are two types of collective action that we’re exploring: first, a community could leverage its size and spending power to get better deals for its members, and second, they could pool funds in order to get access to goods, services, and investments that would be out of reach individually.</p><p>Groups could also grow pooled funds through the card itself — for instance, if they issue a card where a certain portion of the transaction fee goes to the group wallet. It could be a cause-based group aligned with some charity and in that way, the collective spending power of the community to make donations. By spending money with that group card, you’d be passively donating to your favorite&nbsp;charity.</p><p>Paul: Imagine if you’re a community focused on a particular sports team. The group could pool funds to potentially gain access to athletes and interviews. They could host special events, build out merchant rewards for jerseys or drinks at their favorite bars, or they could even help certain members of the community attend their first&nbsp;game.</p> The XRP Card was first announced earlier this year in February and has now officially launched at the end of July. It must have been a mad scramble to get this thing out in about 5&nbsp;months. <p>Paul: I think first and foremost, that’s a testament to the GlobaliD vision and framework, particularly around the Sovereign Stack — identity, messaging, wallet. We see those as the core building blocks for Web 3.0, and with some combination of those building blocks, you could, practically speaking, build anything across the spectrum of fintech products and services. We’ve spent the last few years building that foundation brick by brick so it’s incredible to see it all come together.</p><p>Laura: That being said, our team has been working incredibly hard to get this to market — so shout out to the engineering team, the product team, the design team, and the customer support team. Also, none of this could have happened without our ecosystem of partners — Apto with their instant issuance powering the card, Uphold powering the wallet. Everyone has been heads down working to make the XRP Card a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>But also a special shout out to the community. We wouldn’t be here without you — especially the beta testers! Thank you so much for your engagement, your feedback, and most of all, your positive energy and enthusiasm.</p><p>We’re just all super excited that it’s finally in people’s hands and&nbsp;wallets!</p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/pstav90">Paul</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/thelittletoh">Laura</a> on Twitter, and visit <a href="https://global.id/">Global.iD</a></p><p>You might also be interested in:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">GlobaliD joins the Linux Foundation’s Cardea&nbsp;Project</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/partner-spotlight-apto-payments-launches-instant-card-issuance-3a3397e8613a">Partner Spotlight: Apto Payments launches Instant Card&nbsp;Issuance</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-is-hipaa-compliant-1e8cdf915ab6">GlobaliD is HIPAA compliant</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-receives-soc-2-type-ii-certification-b2b6ea7a6d75">GlobaliD receives SOC 2 Type II certification</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-connects-to-the-indicio-network-2ad5688d72fd">GlobaliD connects to the Indicio&nbsp;Network</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7">GlobaliD shares SSI code at the Internet Identity&nbsp;Workshop</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/introducing-the-xrp-mastercard-debit-card-827c0b37445b">Introducing the XRP Mastercard® Debit Card</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Vittorio Bertocci,  Principal Architect at Auth0, is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4618/1" title="Browser Features vs. Identity Protocols: An Arms Race?"> Browser Features vs. Identity Protocols: An Arms Race?</a> on Tuesday, September 14 starting at 9:50 am. at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Vittorio some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why are browser vendors introducing changes in their products that impact how we do identity today?</p>
<p>
Browser vendors really mean well. What they are doing is looking out for the users and we know that today, one of the big engines of the economy is the ability of advertisers to profile people. Even without their knowledge or consent so that they can serve high-performing ads. And a lot of these tracking occurs by using low-level primitives in the browser, such as cookies, redirects, decorated links. And so, browser vendors are trying to put a stop to it by inhibiting some of those functionalities in particular scenarios, or sometimes, we have had a lot of discrimination, eliminating entire categories or features.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, identity, and in particular, federated identity is built on the same building blocks that are used by the advertisers. And so, the outcome is that any actions against tracking, that do not really understand the difference between ad tracking and federated identity will affect the federated identity scenarios. And so that is basically what is going on right now. 
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the short-term consequences people need to consider, if any? </p>
<p>
The short-term impact of this can be quite painful for a number of customers. Let's say that some changes already went [into] production, so, the famous intelligent tracking protection in Safari and, on the SameSite different defaults in Chrome. The plans that Chrome had to [completely] eliminate third party cookies, which now luckily has been delayed by a couple of years.</p>
<p>And the outcome of those is that entire scenarios can just stop working. So, if, for example, you have a web application which runs mostly in JavaScript and executes code in the browser, and it relies on the ability to access third-party cookies, to get the tokens out of band, instead of actually showing redirects to the user, then, applications might actually be unable to get to those tokens in the background. And so, the experience of the user would be disrupted and the same goes for distributed log out. 
</p>
<p>You log out from one app expecting that you would be logged out from all the apps that are using the same identity provider, but it might not happen. You might end up being logged out only from one app, but still be logged in[to] the other apps. And those are short-term consequences. There are medium-term consequences, which can be far more severe. There are talks about introducing features that limit the way in which your browsers redirect, and that will potentially break SAML, which is extraordinarily adopted.</p>
<p>
A lot of critical infrastructure relies on SAML. And the moment in which those changes will occur, again, with SAML, is basically done - it is not dead, because people are using it, but it is done. There is a longer innovation. If it imposes changes that would require products to change the way in which we do SAML, we would be in big trouble because a lot of websites, institutions, [and] universities would just stop working. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the long-term consequences people need to consider, if any? </p>
<p>
The long-term consequences are more nuanced. One of the things that we as industry are trying to do with browser vendors and identity providers, and identity vendors and similar, is to devise a new class of primitives that allow the browser to do identity explicitly instead of using low level primitives, like cookies and redirects. We could offer APIs that do identity. The challenge with that is that if you go too high in the abstraction layers, you end up with something which is very inflexible. And as we know, from a history of how identity came to be on the internet, we need what we call permissionless innovation, as in, the ability to devise new scenarios, starting from flexible primitives.</p>
<p>
If your primitives are not very flexible because they address specific scenarios – you can address today's scenarios, but there is no guarantee you would be able to address tomorrow’s scenarios. And so, we need to strike this balance and if we fail to do so, we might actually significantly hamper innovation. </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>What is the best way for people in the identity industry to help move things forward?</p>
<p>
The absolute best way is to get involved. We have been talking with the browser vendors for a couple of years at this point, all as separate entities, like separate companies, and this is not very efficient. It is not very exhaustive because we all, all identity operators in the industry, have a different perspective and different use cases. So, we have been working in collaboration with the W3C to create a tent, a forum where we can all come together [to] the table and discuss our scenarios and contribute all our points of view. And it is a community group in the W3C called the fed ID (<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">The Federated Identity</a>). And the best way is really to participate. So, to join the group, join the calls, participate in the discussion so that we can move these aspects of identity and browsers forward together. </p>

<p>CARIBBEAN – August 2, 2021 – ShareRing have today announced a pilot program to digitize the KYC (Know Your Customer) process for financial institutions based in the Caribbean region.</p>



<p>The pilot which began on June 1st, 2021, is part of ShareRing’s long term commitment to the region as they roll out their blockchain based identity and verifiable credentials ecosystem across a number of industries including health, events, financial services and travel. The ShareRing Caribbean team leading the project have over 20 years experience in the technology and financial sectors.</p>



<p>This digital ‘eKYC’ pilot will enable credit unions, insurance companies and other financial institutions to receive their customers ID and supporting documents in an encrypted digital format through their mobile device.&nbsp; The solution will eliminate much of the time-consuming aspects of account sign-up processes while still ensuring the institutions operate within the regulatory framework.</p>



<p>ShareRing’s scope includes exploring the potential for credit approvals and identity verification checks from one financial institution to be made available to other similar institutions or third parties.</p>



<p>In a quote from the President of the Barbados Teacher’s Co-operative Credit Union Limited, Ms. Sherry-Ann Scott-King stated – “We are metamorphozing our structure to embrace technological advances, and the use of blockchain technology is the solution to our KYC needs. Partnering with companies such as ShareRing reiterates this, and we’re excited to see the fruits of the project both for our members and the credit union, while ensuring we remain compliant with regulatory requirements.”</p>



<p>The key benefit for the credit union’s customer is having a streamlined digital process without compromising their data security. Using ShareRing’s encrypted ID technology, with its self sovereign and privacy-by-design features, means the customers remain in full control of their private and sensitive data.</p>



<p>“We’re very proud to deploy some of ShareRing’s core functionality to financial organizations in the Caribbean region. We are able to provide blockchain based eKYC solutions which facilitate heightened levels of security and trust between financial institutions and their customers” said Tim Bos, CEO and Founder of ShareRing.</p>



<p>—————————-</p>



<p>About ShareRing</p>



<p>ShareRing is a technology company which has created an ecosystem where individuals and organisations can transact in a secure and trusted digital environment. Central to establishing high trust levels is ShareRing’s encrypted self-sovereign ID solution, based on blockchain technology, creating an immutable “fingerprint” of an individual’s verifiable personal identity and documents. Self-sovereign means the individual retains full control over their own data since it resides solely on their personal device in an encrypted format, and is never stored centrally.</p>



<p>These features provide: security for the individual user and, confidence for the consumer of the data that the data provided has not been altered in any way since it was uploaded to the blockchain. Through the ShareRing Ecosystem, accessed via ShareRing Apps, ShareRing has created a number of products/solutions which digitize, streamline and radically improve processes across multiple industries and functions including health, financial services, events, travel &amp; hospitality.</p>

<p>Offering digital services is nothing new for the financial services industry. However, we have seen the pace of adoption has increased significantly during the COVID19 pandemic,&nbsp; and along with this has come a rise in fraud and other crime. With its basis in customer trust, security is crucial in the banking industry. Banks have to quickly adapt to the changing environment while ensuring they meet the highest levels of security and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Experts from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/webinar-banking-security-user-experience/">IDnow, Ziglu, Santander, and Scotia Bank recently discussed</a> digitalization, customer onboarding, and digital identity in banking. In particular, how to embrace these technologies to offer the best customer experience whilst maintaining security and trust as the key drivers.</p>
 Growth in digital banking services 
<p>The events of the past 18 months have led to many changes in banking. Webinar participants agreed that the use of digital services has increased significantly, as has the range of services offered – not all of them expected before the pandemic. This has brought with it higher levels of customer onboarding and verification services.</p>
<p>As highlighted during the webinar, a <a href="mailto:https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">study by McKinsey</a> suggests that companies are now seven years ahead in digital transformation due to the pandemic. &nbsp;As an evidence of this remarkable adoption, IDnow shared that it has experienced a growth of up to 1,000% in the demand of verifications.</p>
 Rise in financial crime 
<p>Both unfortunately and unsurprisingly, the rise in digitalization has been accompanied by an increase in financial crime. At IDnow, we have seen overall fraud increases of around 250%&nbsp; – and a 180% rise in document fraud.</p>
<p>James Sullivan,&nbsp;Chief Operating Officer at Ziglu, also agreed and shared his experience at his organisation. James explained how over the past 12 months, they have seen an increase in fraud. This includes a significant rise in impersonation fraud, money mule activities, and scams. The lack of digital IDs in the UK is undoubtedly a contributing factor.</p>
 Building trust is vital for banks 
<p>Data security is paramount for all companies, most importantly for banks as they are the custodians of customers’ personal information and security is the foundation in trust. Rod Boothby, Global Head of Identity at Santander, explained his view of this and the importance to banks, saying:</p>
<p>“People trust banks as a store of their value. That means things like cash, securities, but also data. They know that banks will protect their data – which is very useful when you are trying to establish trust on the internet.”</p>
<p>Rod from Santander and Zemfira Khisaeva from Scotia Bank both highlighted how building trust online is critical. Without getting it right, they are not only risking security, but they are also potentially losing out on customers and revenue. Rod explained how recent digital identity approaches are being developed with data minimisation in mind, which would enable banks to request less information to customers when performing KYC processes.</p>
 ID verification as part of a digital strategy 
<p>The importance of digital identity verification is becoming more evident especially as both the volume of online services and the level of fraud increase. Roger Tyrzyk from IDnow explained how this is a hot topic in many industries now.</p>
<p>As banks add new services and functions, they also face different challenges. This includes thinking about new sources for digital identity, embracing new technologies and ensuring a seamless experience across multiple channels and bankend systems.</p>
<p>A primary drive of the changes we see from a verification technology point of view is how to ensure that the person is who they claim to be. Just capturing a photograph on an ID might not be enough.</p>
<p>Going forward there will be the need for more advanced techniques which can authenticate documents – some examples are the use of video techniques for checking dynamic security features and Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. The use of biometrics such as face, voice, or fingerprints will continue to be widely used as it is today, but the adoption of more robust data protection and security processes will also need to be considered.</p>
<p>Rod also agreed with this and expanded about the key difference between the physical world and the digital world. An ID document or passport can be produced in the physical world, but this is radically different in the digital world. How can it be proved that a person is who they claim to be in during a digital session?</p>
 Identity standards as a catalyst for trust 
<p>During the webinar, all participants expressed how standards shared between organizations are important too. Zemfira from Scotia Bank explained how banks in Canada use the same system to perform these verifications. Rod also shared how Santander (together with other banks) is working on developing an open ID trust framework for digital identity, which is aimed to standardise the verification approach not only for financial services, but also for other industries. Ultimately, this trust framework would allow organizations to onboard customers easily and securely, but with the customer in control of what data is shared.</p>
 Providing identity insurance for banking transactions 
<p>Another new development discussed was the introduction of identity insurance. This could see a small insurance premium on a transition to insure against fraud. Rod from Santander explains how this could greatly help trust and global financial inclusion, claiming that “By transferring the risk we allow people to act as though they are trusted everywhere.”</p>
 Importance of the user experience 
<p>Security, functionality, and better services are great, but what about the customer experience?</p>
<p>Zemfira pointed out that this is not something that has been so important in the past, with security and trust the main drivers. However, the focus has changed over the years as new generations come and challenger banks arise. User experience is moving from a ‘nice to have’ to a key differentiator amongst banks going forward.</p>
 How to achieve a great user onboarding experience 
<p>Participants also shared their views on KYC and the onboarding process, and how to make this process a good one for users. The suggested main areas of interest include:</p>
 
 Ensuring speed of customer onboarding. Users can give up if the process is slow. They are there to engage with your products and services, so get them doing this as soon as possible. 
 Reduce friction points. There is a level of “friendly friction” that customers are prepared to deal with, however it is important to communicate with the customer the value of your products and the reason for this ‘friction’. 
 Aim for a reliable solution: It is also very important to choose the right identity partner which systems and processes have been widely tested 
 
 Compliance is both important and challenging 
<p>There is a real challenge between regulatory requirements and friction points for customers during onboarding and verification. The art of finding the right balance between those two will be a key differentiator.</p>
<p>The regulatory ecosystem can be cumbersome to navigate for organisations as regulatory requirements typically differ from one country to another. Due to Brexit, UK companies operating in Europe, for example, will now need to acquire a licence in the countries they wish to operate and comply with local regulations. Another example are crypto currency companies with a licence in Europe that wish to onboard customers in Germany. With the implementation of the 5MLD in Germany, now these crypto companies are required to obtain a licence in Germany and comply with BaFin regulations, where a video-based verification is required.</p>
<p>Participants raised fact that the user experience will also be limited by local regulations. &nbsp;This is the case of Germany mentioned above and another example is Mexico, where onboarding can only be performed in person or via live video.</p>
<p>The lack of government digital IDs is also a limiting factor. This varies between countries. Countries like Estonia and Sweden, are well ahead with this. Sweden which uses BankID to onboard customers and Estonia the only country with a full digital identity which enables banks to onboard customers 100% using this. On the other hand, the UK is likely to face different challenges due to the lack of and identity document &nbsp;&nbsp;– James from Ziglu believes this is a leading contributor to the UK’s high level of financial crime.</p>
<p>James also raised the point about outsourcing and bank regulatory responsibility. There is a growing trend where financial services organisations are relying on third parties to perform their KYC processes. This is mainly due to the continuous developments of technologies which makes the processes more robust and reliable. However, it is important to mention that even though this process can be outsourced banks will still be responsible to choose the right partner and be aware on how they fulfil their regulatory responsibilities.</p>
<p>Learn more in our other banking blog article on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ekyc-europe-regulation-customer-experience/">how to balance regulation and customer experience</a>.</p>
 Looking to the future 
<p>It is always helpful with any technology to look at upcoming changes. Participants agreed that in the near future, changes would mostly come through improvement and maturing of current technology and reduction of errors in verification and KYC – rather than new developments.</p>
<p>Using existing tools to better outsmart fraudsters will be a critical area as we move forward and choosing the right partner who continuously innovate is vital in order to stay one step ahead of them. Fraud sophistication is increasing – including in areas that are not seen much yet, such as deep fake technology and quantum computing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is value in getting it right. Rod drew attention to <a href="mailto:https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">data from McKinsey</a> once again, which suggests that if we can solve the challenge of fraud and trust, it could add 3% to GDP in developed countries and up to 13% in developing countries.</p>
<p>There is plenty more to understand about these new regulations and their implementation. For some more insight from the experts, watch the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/webinar-banking-security-user-experience/">full webinar</a>. </p>

 Selective Disclosure: Share Just What You&nbsp;Want <p>What’s a good approach to protecting your online privacy and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">securing your digital data</a> from unauthorized access?</p><p>Undoubtedly, a complex question, right? But the answer can be simpler than you think, and in two words, the solution is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> — a philosophy that empowers users to control the way their data is stored, accessed, and&nbsp;handled.</p><p>One of the driving principles of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> is a concept called Selective disclosure which enables individuals to share just what they want with others. It empowers the owner of a piece of data to disclose parts of a large data set, so the receiving entity knows just what’s&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. Let’s say, you want to attend a musical show in your city, and due to the COVID pandemic regulations, the authorities have mandated complete vaccination as the entry criteria.</p><p>Traditionally, you would carry a physical card or a digital copy of the vaccination certification with you that certifies that you have taken the vaccines. But along with it, the show’s authorities would also get to know your full name, date of birth, the location where you were vaccinated, home address, phone number, and more, which is exposing a lot of information which is&nbsp;private.</p><p>Such additional information puts you at risk for data thefts, gender/racial bias, and loss of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>At the same time, how can you just reveal information about your vaccination by hiding other personal information?</p><p>Selective disclosure removes this conundrum.</p> What is Selective Disclosure? <p>Selective Disclosure is a concept that empowers the owner of a piece of data to disclose parts of a large data set, so the receiving entity knows just what’s&nbsp;needed.</p><p>As a result, an individual has the freedom to choose what is shared and no longer has to choose between an all-or-none approach. Undoubtedly, selective disclosure enhances an individual’s privacy and level of control over his or her personal information, including deciding who gets to see what data and how this data is used by&nbsp;others.</p> How to Implement Selective Disclosure? <p>In the context of SSI, selective disclosure is best implemented through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> where the user has separate credentials for each piece of information such as his/her date of birth, full name, vaccination details, address, passport number,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>When required, all that the user has to do is create a verifiable presentation that contains just the data needed for verification. In our above example, the user has to create a verifiable presentation with his full name and his vaccination details and send it to the show’s authorities for verification.</p><p>Here’s how the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-vs-verifiable-credentials-vcs-cd0ebb13f1fb">VC</a> for this example can look like.

Rapid Transition Lab flow&nbsp;map<p>In a post-pandemic world, food is not just our biggest challenge, but also our biggest opportunity for sustainable change.</p><p>The ways that food is produced, distributed and consumed have major negative impacts on people and the planet. Food production is the largest human pressure on Earth, causing a mass extinction of species, and accounting for 23% of annual greenhouse emissions. Food is at the core of various social justice challenges such as working conditions, access to affordable good food, cultural diversity and burgeoning food-related health crises of both malnutrition and obesity. This means that many of the broader environmental and social challenges can be addressed if the way that food is produced and managed is transformed. As Johan Rockström, Director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in&nbsp;2016:</p><blockquote>If we get it right on food, we get it right for both people and&nbsp;planet.</blockquote><p>Food transformations will require a series of fast and slow transitions over the next decades. The world’s governments have agreed on the UN Global Goals for 2030. Here in Sweden the country plans to have net zero emissions by 2045. However, neither the world nor Sweden are on track to achieve these goals, and with every day that passes, impacts accumulate and the challenges grow.</p><p>Food is essential and a source of great pleasure. A shared meal can be a ritual or celebration, and a simple everyday pleasure. Food is a rich and meaningful expression of our shared cultural diversity, and the way we make, distribute, and enjoy it, speaks loudly as to what we stand for as a society. Food can be a generator of wealth, in numerous forms, and its cultivation can restore ecological functions. Given that food is the strongest connection humanity has with the biosphere, that our food system is productive but unequal, and that food cultures can either be enriching or destructive, transforming our global food system represents both a grand challenge and a grand opportunity. If we are able to make a just transition to food cultures that restore the biosphere rather than degrade it, we will not only improve the lives of the world’s people, and enhance the biosphere, but also learn how to become better stewards of the&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>Sweden and other Nordic countries are well-positioned to lead the way in the global transformation towards a sustainable food system. It shares many of the world’s problems, while beginning to take action to address them. Current diets in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Finland are unhealthy, carbon intensive, and harm terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, both in the Nordics and elsewhere. About half the population in Nordic countries is overweight or obese, food waste is a major problem, and meat consumption is well above amounts recommended for health or sustainability.</p><p>Sweden is also taking action to change its food system. The Nordic region has world-class dietary guidelines, strict agricultural regulations and emerging innovations to food challenges. In Sweden, diverse innovations are taking place in farming, marketing, logistics and retail. Similarly, many cities, municipalities, and national government are working to develop policy to improve the food system, for both health reasons and environmental objectives. Furthermore, there is widespread public discussion, led in particular by chefs, to build on the success of the New Nordic cuisine <a>[PO1]</a> to create a cuisine that is good for both people and the planet, exploring how to reverse these recent trends towards greater meat consumption and increased environmental damage. As Nordic populations diversify, the various cuisines in the region are enriched accordingly. This means Sweden has the potential to lead a global food system transformation.</p><p>The unequal and often unplanned impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted many flaws and fractures in the fabric of everyday life, not least because it moves as a complex system, as opposed to respecting the way Sweden is organised within health, mobility, urbanism, security, governance and other sectors. We believe that the responses to COVID-19 on the Swedish food system may reveal aspects of the resilience measures needed to meaningfully address the risks and opportunities facing Swedish food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While some of the rapid responses of food system actors to COVID-19 might accelerate a ‘just transition’ towards a sustainable and resilient food system, others may impede it. To better navigate towards sustainability, we want to understand how responses to COVID either built or eroded resilience within the Swedish food system resilience, and whether these responses enhances or reduced the transformative capacities of the Swedish food system. Such understanding can help us better align existing and future research and innovation activities, in order to enable a ‘just transition’ of Sweden’s complex food system; a system not defined by its territorial boundaries but the planetary flows that it is interlinked with.</p><p>Transformation requires significant changes in multiple dimensions of society. These changes must take place at different levels in society, from practices and behaviours, to rules and regulations, to values (financial and non-financial), and world-views. Transformation involves changing the relationships among people, but also profoundly changing the relationships between people and nature. History shows us that crises can create openings for transformation. But while positive societal transformations may arise from crises, the consequences of crises are often not positive. The risk is that opportunities created by the crisis are missed and that crisis response — despite good intentions and innovation — fail to address accumulated problems, and restore a slightly improved or a damaged status-quo. Navigating crises requires understanding of capabilities and capacities that are needed and then developing and mobilizing those capabilities and capacities for&nbsp;change.</p><p>Our project aims to learn from the current COVID-19 crisis and support the enabling of capacities for transforming towards a Swedish food system that promotes the health, equity and sustainability of people and the planet. The project will identify and map risks and opportunities emerging in the Swedish food system due to the COVID-19 pandemic through a co-creative process with public, private and civic food system actors. This process will develop understanding and articulate alternative pathways for food system transformation. It will do this through a Rapid Transition Lab.</p> Rapid Transition Lab <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will identify opportunities and pathways for Swedish food system actors to engage in a rapid transition, in response to the COVID-19 crisis. It will assess different strategies within the Swedish food systems, and support the design of more transformative strategies, practices, and institutions. Vinnova, the Swedish government’s innovation agency who fund this work, plans to connect the learning to multiple related stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in&nbsp;Sweden.</p><p>The Rapid Transition lab will consist of a sensemaking and a futuring project and be structured around three overlapping phases: First, the project will build a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of and the responses to Covid-19 in the Swedish food systems. Second, based on these insights, existing food system scenarios, and through workshops engaging multiple stakeholders, the project will build transformative food system scenarios. In the third phase, the project will use these scenarios to identify strategies and pathways and possible portfolios of experiments for actors to contribute to the transformation of the Swedish food system. These will be accomplished by developing a process of collective sense-making.</p>  Learning from the crisis to reframe food systems: By exploring the interconnected cascading risks and opportunities that have emerged from responses to COVID-19 and the 2019 drought in Sweden, in the context of Swedish food system transformation, we will create broader views of food systems and cultures.  Suggesting strategies to support the capacity building for transformation: Building exploratory scenarios, informed by the responses to the COVID-19 crises in the Swedish food system, can reveal capacity-building strategies that might better enable transformation in the Swedish food system. The scenarios, will build on previous and ongoing scenarios, to develop systemic, holistic and multidimensional scenarios that will be used to identify a portfolio of pathways and experiments.  Input into strategic policymaking and innovation practice: Key stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in Sweden, will be engaged to actively contribute and learn from these exploratory processes. The analysis of the crisis, and development of the scenarios should be relevant to these stakeholders.  <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will be linked to other ongoing transdisciplinary food system projects that Vinnova or the Stockholm Resilience Centre lead or are partners in. These include MISTRA Food Futures, Nordic Food Policy Lab, Sustainable Finance Lab, and NorthWestern Paths.

<p>Enterprises are accelerating digital transformation initiatives in response to the rapidly evolving business landscape and a remote or hybrid workforce. Greater productivity is among the core benefits of these initiatives. But to realize these efficiency gains—and the additional advantages of a digital-first culture—you need to provide your workforce with access to every application and tool they need to do their jobs. And that’s often easier said than done.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Security leaders are faced with the new challenge of securing their organizations when very few users are on the corporate network. They need to give their employees the anytime and anywhere access they need to be productive, but not at the cost of security. Striking the right balance hinges on having confidence that the people requesting access are who they say they are and that they’re granted access to only those resources and sensitive data they’re authorized to use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An Interview with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrielowe/">Katrie Lowe</a> - CEO and Co-founder of <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi&nbsp;Labs</a></p>Real-estate and Verifiiable Credentials<p>The last few years have put the spotlight on online privacy and security, driven in part by frequent data breaches coupled with the users’ growing innate need to own and protect their data and identity.</p><p>In turn, it has led to the development of an approach called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> that addresses the issue of “establishing trust” within interaction by empowering people to own their data and also determine where information is stored and with whom it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Despite being a relatively new philosophy, interest in SSI has been rapid across industries.</p><p>One sector where SSI is expected to have far-reaching implications is the real estate industry, as it has the potential to bring in a lot of transparency and trust among the stakeholders.</p><p>So, how does SSI fit into this traditional real-estate sector?</p><p>We asked Katrie Lowe, the CEO and Co-founder of <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi Labs</a>, a company that specializes in issuing rental passports using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>.</p><p>Here are the excerpts.</p> COVID has created new opportunities and challenges in the real estate industry. Can SSI address&nbsp;them? <p>Absolutely, yes! COVID has enabled flexible work options that can take us to new places around the world. But, finding a place to rent in a new city may not be enjoyable, as you’ll have to navigate through different properties and neighborhoods, understand the prevailing tenancy laws, and maybe even work through the biases of landlords and property managers.</p><p>This is where SSI fits, as it can create trust regarding a tenant’s rental capacity, and in the process, reduce the&nbsp;bias.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. Let’s say, Lisa is an individual who decides to move to Berlin from Chicago to find a job. In the traditional setup, it’s difficult for Lisa to find a place because she can’t give any rental references in Berlin that a potential landlord can verify. She doesn’t have a job, so there’s a question of how she’s going to pay the&nbsp;rent.</p><p>With SSI, she can show her potential landlord that she has not missed even a single rental payment in the past, even though she had lived in a different country. Also, she can show her education credentials and working experience to prove that she is qualified enough to quickly find a job in&nbsp;Berlin.</p><p>This creates a sense of trust in the landlord, thereby helping tenants to find rentals&nbsp;easily.</p> Do you think SSI is a gamechanger in the real-estate industry? If yes,&nbsp;why? <p>Real estate is one of the sectors that has not completely embraced digitalization, and this means, there’s a lot of potential to bring about change in this&nbsp;sector.</p><blockquote>Currently, digital means sending documents such as payslips and past rental agreements in PDF format by email. In this new age of digital identity and verifiable credentials, there’s so much more that can be done such as identifying tenants with confidence based on verified information and being able to make informed decisions about tenant selection.</blockquote><p>And this is where SSI will be a gamechanger.</p><p>Further, landlords can confidently <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">comply with GDPR</a> and lower their exposure to risks associated with <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd?gi=ee3cacaf54a7">data breaches and hacks</a>, because they have adopted a solution where tenants are in control of their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>In fact, using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-vs-verifiable-credentials-vcs-cd0ebb13f1fb">verifiable credentials</a> to check a potential tenant’s rental history is the first step. Soon, it can spill on to property management, property buying, and other aspects of real estate as&nbsp;well.</p> How can SSI address some of the urban housing challenges such as liveability? <p>Though sustainability and liveability can mean different things in different cities, there’s no doubt that every city must help its people to thrive day after&nbsp;day.</p><p>Housing is an important part of everyday life because good housing can enhance the quality of life and make living a lot less stressful. It can allow you to focus on other aspects of your life as&nbsp;well.</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> brings about transparency in the housing market and removes frictions in finding a house. More importantly, the tenant’s documents that contain his/her PII can be shared safely and securely.</p><p>Another aspect is that there isn’t a lot of data around housing now. SSI provides the opportunity for rental data to be shared anonymously, so that at a city level better policy decisions can be made, developers can better understand market needs, and citizens can be more informed about, and active in, conversations around&nbsp;housing.</p><p>All these together can enhance the quality of life in a&nbsp;city.</p> How do you envisage the future of SSI in the real estate&nbsp;space? <p>At this point, there is a lot of hesitancy to adopt digitization in the real estate market. But that is changing as <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/innovation-in-digital-identity-and-credentials-in-the-post-covid-world-f182a5743ce8">COVID</a> has necessitated a push towards digital adoption.</p><p>Further, there is a considerable effort going at the highest national levels to create more awareness about digital identity, and overall, the next 3–5 years are expected to be big for&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>As more people take up flexible working opportunities and travel for new experiences, SSI gives them a secure way to prove their financial capabilities and rental histories across countries.</p><p>Leaders in the financial and government sectors are already testing out <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">SSI</a> and there’s such an opportunity for real estate to be bold, take advantage and be a frontrunner.</p><p>Note: opinions expressed here are the writer’s&nbsp;own.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/impact-of-self-sovereign-identity-in-real-estate-11456c4b1faa">Impact of Self-Sovereign Identity in Real Estate</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

THE PRESENT&nbsp;MOMENT<p>Today, when the line between online and offline is blurred, what would it look like if we were to take a portrait?</p><p>Due to COVID-19 we have increased the proportion of the online world in our lives. Previously, the online world had a strong perception as a virtual world for entertainment such as games, but now the online world has become a reality that can offset the constraints of space and time in real public and private encounters. Participating in meetings through video conference, planning a ‘LAN drinking party’ with acquaintances, setting up a drinking table at their own home, and having a meeting are a daily scene where telecommuting and staying at home are encouraged. The trend of various metaverse worlds that are appearing one after another, provide a variety of options for self-expression. 2D and 3D avatars created according to each person’s taste become another ‘me’. Now, the portrait of ‘I’ living in ‘today’ is filled with the real me within the real landscape and the other half with the 3D avatar and unrealistic virtual world as the background.</p><p>It is not only the protagonist in the portrait that is divided into reality and virtuality. The contemporary online world completes a virtual landscape by absorbing various areas occupied by reality. Now, furniture, interior accessories, works of art, houses, buildings, and even land (real estate) fill the virtual world market, and active transactions are taking place. The emergence of ‘NFT’ in the field raises the value of virtual assets, which are digital files, to the value of real assets. NFT is an abbreviation of Non-Fungible Token, which refers to a ‘non-fungible asset’ registered in the blockchain. In the process of storing digital creations on the blockchain, a unique number such as a serial number is created, which gives rarity and uniqueness to digital creations. Digital files, which previously could be easily owned without quantitative restrictions through copy-paste, now exist as ‘the only original’ protected by a unique number, and the exchange of this technology will increase awareness of the existence of digital files and transaction methods.</p><p>In this exhibition, the NFT technology provided by CCCV was integrated into the exhibition and its various applications were exhibited. [Pick the NFT for CCCV] is designed to introduce new NFT works to the audience and check their reactions through voting. Visitors to the exhibition hall can vote for their favorite 3 out of the 20 NFT video works on display, and if the written work matches the top three final votes, they can win a prize. The total prize money for voting is 2 million won, and both the artist and the audience are given a chance to win. First, the first 1 million won will be shared among the three artists selected for the top-voted works, and the remaining 1 million won will be shared equally among the viewers who got all the top three final-vote matches&nbsp;. Next, in [Make your own NFT], you can experience the purchase and warranty of NFT works at once by requesting a portrait request. First, the visitor selects the artist who wants to create a portrait, and then purchases a portrait from the artist’s NFT page. Next, after discussing the background color and style of the work with the staff, fill a request form and submit it to the artist. The work will be delivered to the customer’s email and CCCV NFT box by the deadline specified in the request&nbsp;form.</p><p>NFT itself can be an inconvertible asset or work, but at the same time, it functions as a means of transaction for digital works and as a guarantee. In this exhibition, we would like to observe the possibilities of the integration of newly emerged NFT technology and art, and discuss the future changes based on this exhibition.</p><p>Written by Seo-Hee&nbsp;Bae</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-present-moment-cccv-first-nft-exhibition-2021-b82cf51bb307">THE PRESENT MOMENT: CCCV First NFT Exhibition 2021</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>At Magic, we love to be where developers hang out. As a Developer Advocate, it’s especially fun to connect with devs dreaming up big ideas and hacking them into&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Back in April, the HackOn2.0 team reached out to me to talk about getting Magic involved in their next hackathon. We jumped at the opportunity and were so glad to support the HackOn2.0’s vibrant community.</p><p><a href="https://hackon.tech/">HackOn 2.0</a> is a week-long, global digital hackathon organized by Aditya Oberai, Rishabh Bansal, and team to bring developer’s ideas from inception to reality. This year’s edition focused on fostering innovation and also raised awareness on mental health and diversity.</p><p>A lot of people dedicated time to participate! 8,298 people registered. In total, there were 370 teams of 2–4 members&nbsp;each.</p><p>Participants built their hackathon projects based on these&nbsp;tracks:</p><p>Magic was proud to be a platinum sponsor. In addition, I was personally psyched to also be a mentor during the hackathon. The learning session set up for May 27th helped participants understand what Magic is and how to get started with&nbsp;it.</p><p>For the mentor session, you can catch the full video recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxwf6y7F424">here</a>.</p><p>“Best Hack built with Magic” was one of the categories for participants, in addition to the primary tracks. The participants were allowed to choose more than one sponsored track. We had the following prizes for participants:</p><p>It was exciting to see that 15% of all projects were built with&nbsp;Magic!</p><p>When it came to evaluating projects, selecting the winners was not an easy task. All of the projects were amazing and well-aligned to the primary track. In the end, we landed on the top 3 hacks that were focused on solving real problems and have utilized the best possible tech stack in this short time. A key criteria considered was how appropriately the project has implemented the Magic integration.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the winners — along with the problem they are solving, the technology used, important links, and their team&nbsp;members.</p> Winners  1. WeCare by&nbsp;Eternals  Problem it&nbsp;solves <p>WeCare predicts the health risks to your body based on your daily health. The ongoing pandemic made everyone learn the importance of being healthy and how daily activities and diet play a major role in being healthy. Team Eternals wanted to alert the users of WeCare about any risk associated with a deficiency or unhealthy lifestyle by showing graphs and predictions using machine learning. WeCare has a smart predict feature that helps uncover latent diseases and predict the risk of future ones. Patients will be able to review medical conditions and reach their treatment goals much faster, lowering the risk of serious health complications.</p> Technology used <p>ReactJS, Python, Django, Apollo, GraphQL, Heroku, Firebase, Magic</p> Team Members <p>Harmanjit Singh, Kunal Khullar, Gurleen Kaur, and Paritosh&nbsp;Arora</p> Important Links <p><a href="https://wecare-h.web.app/">Frontend<br></a><a href="https://health-prediction-backend.herokuapp.com/">Backend</a><br><a href="https://youtu.be/u_vP7FN3ieM">Video&nbsp;demo</a></p> 2. ShopZop by Etherbots  Problem it&nbsp;solves <p>The Covid-19 Pandemic has hit the small and medium-size businesses hard as they relied on their in-shop customers and had very little or no digital presence at all. And with the lockdown and movement restrictions, these businesses have suffered a lot. Team Etherbots came together to help connect the shop owners with customers and helping them. A simple solution was to harness the power of an application that almost every Smartphone user uses in India — WHATSAPP!. It will increase their online reach and solve the problem along with some&nbsp;revenue.</p> Technology used <p>ReactJS, NodeJS, GraphCMS, GraphQL, WhatsApp, Magic</p> Team Members <p>Ayush Jain and Bhuvanesh Shathyan</p> Important Links <p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QqZMSzL9Mg">video demo</a> of the&nbsp;product.</p> 3. Debately by&nbsp;tier-4  Problem it&nbsp;solves <p>Team tier-4 believes that debates help us have healthy discussions and solve problems within the society, helping us build a diverse and inclusive society. In the last few years, online and TV debates have been downgraded, and Tier-4 team members paired up to build an AI-based audio chat for the web using react, magic, webRTC, and symbal.ai to conduct and practice healthy debates.

			 Key takeaways 
 
 
 
 Traditional custodians have an important role to play in digital asset custody 
 The key to compliant security token custody is digital identity 
 Digital identities enable token recovery (restitution obligations) 
 Custodians need access to the token smart contracts, not to the investors’ wallets 
 Security Token Custody = Wallets + Smart Contract Management + Digital Identities

					 Les échanges confidentiels et le partage de données sensibles : une problématique majeure en entreprise 
				 
				
			  
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Juliette Mégret 
						
					 
				  
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			  
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Pour échanger des informations entre collaborateurs, pour obtenir les statistiques de fonctionnement d’un serveur, ou bien pour que deux machines connectés d’une même ligne de production se synchronisent, l’échange de données est au cœur du fonctionnement de toute entreprise.</p>
<p>Que l’interaction ait lieu entre humains, entre humains et machines, ou entre machines, la protection des données sensibles est essentielle. Selon les échanges, l’anonymat des interlocuteurs doit autant être protégé que le contenu des échanges. Cela peut-être pour des questions de respect de la vie privée ; par exemple lorsqu’un employé communique avec la médecine du travail ; ou pour des questions de sécurité ; par exemple l’existence d’interactions avec un coffre physique ou numérique est une information qu’une entreprise souhaite généralement garder secrète.</p>
<p>La plateforme de Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) – identités numériques décentralisées entièrement contrôlées par leur propriétaire – développée par Unikname permet de répondre à cette problématique de façon simple et innovante.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les concepts de Unikname  
			   
				
				
				  Le UniknameID, un identifiants basé sur les DID  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Pour manipuler une SSI, il est nécessaire de pouvoir l’identifier. Pour cela, le W3C a établi de nouveaux standards : <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">les DID</a> : Decentralized Identifiers. Les DID sont dérivés de matériel cryptographique, souvent illisible et impossible à mémoriser pour des humains. Afin de répondre correctement aux problématiques des entreprises, Unikname a développé <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">deux méthodes DID</a>, permettant conjointement de définir ses identifiants décentralisés humainement mémorisables :<a href="https://www.unikname.com/identifiant-decentralise-unikname/"> les UniknameID</a>.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p><a href="https://github.com/unik-name/did-method-spec/blob/main/did-uns/UNS-DID-Specification.md">La première méthode DID</a> désigne un crypto-account sur<a href="https://www.unikname.network"> la blockchain Unikname Network</a>. C’est-à-dire que la méthode associe une identité au couple de clés cryptographiques asymétriques authentifiant toutes les transactions émises par le crypto-account.</p>
<p>Pour ce DID, le sujet est également le contrôleur. C’est-à-dire que l’objet qu’il identifie – le crypto-account – se contrôle lui-même. Grâce au matériel cryptographique dont est dérivé ce premier DID, toutes les transactions émises par <a href="https://www.unikname.com/my-unikname-app/">le crypto-account</a> lui seront irrévocablement rattachées.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>En particulier si un crypto-account acquiert un NFT UNIKNAME, le DID qui y est attaché contrôlera totalement ce NFT. Le NFT UNIKNAME est une chaîne de caractères d’aspect aléatoire, à laquelle il est possible de rattacher des propriétés. Les caractères encodent en réalité une forme obscuricie d’un identifiant humainement mémorisable. Nous définissons ici la deuxième méthode DID, dont le sujet est le<a href="https://docs.unikname.network/tokens.html#the-unikname-token"> NFT UNIKNAME</a> et dont le contrôleur est le crypto-account propriétaire.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Un UniknameID est un identifiant explicite, lisible et humainement mémorisable, stocké en dehors de la blockchain. Il est matérialisé sur Unikname Network par un NFT UNIKNAME ayant pour chaine de caractère la forme obscurcie de l’identifiant. Le propriétaire du UniknameID est le seul à pouvoir relier les formes explicite et obscurcie entre elles. La confidentialité d’un tel identifiant est donc totale. La première méthode DID, identifiant un crypto-account au NFT, permet de contrôler l’identité associée au UniknameID et de signer des transactions ou des messages en son nom.</p>
<p>Par la suite nous dirons qu’un UniknameID identifie une entité (Homme ou machine). Cette entité possédera les clés du crypto-account propriétaire du NFT UNIKNAME et sera contrôleur du UniknameID.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les « Verifiable Claim »  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le concept de Verifiable Claim (VC), <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-use-cases/">au sens du W3C</a>, est fortement associé à celui de SSI. Il s’agit de déclarations (claims) faites par une entité sur un sujet, et dont la paternité peut être vérifiée et datée par des mécanismes cryptographiques. Ces claims peuvent être stockées hors chaîne, de façon complètement privée et sous le contrôle des sujets. Les vérifications se font de façon autonome sans tiers de confiance centralisé.</p>
<p>Dans la solution développée par Unikname, les sujets de VC, comme les entités émettrices, sont identifiés par des UniknameID. Grâce à ces identifiants et aux DID de <a href="https://www.unikname.com/plateforme-unikname/">la plateforme de SSI Unikname</a>, la paternité de l’entité et l’authentification du sujet peuvent être établies formellement.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Par exemple, un individu peut souhaiter faire valoir un diplôme pour prouver posséder certaines compétences, sans vouloir l’afficher publiquement. Le sujet est alors l’individu, et l’entité à l’origine de l’assertion est l’université ayant attribué le diplôme. La paternité de l’université est établie grâce au tampon sur le diplôme. L’individu conserve son diplôme chez lui, et le montre uniquement à son employeur au moment de justifier son niveau d’étude. Si l’employeur a confiance dans l’université, à la fois pour attribuer à juste titre un diplôme et pour gérer correctement son tampon, il reconnaîtra le niveau d’étude déclaré par le sujet du diplôme</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Grâce au standard des assertions vérifiables, il est possible de prouver des éléments d’une SSI, sans avoir à lister publiquement tous ses attributs.</p>
<p>Les preuves cryptographiques peuvent être stockées par le sujet, ou inscrites dans les propriétés du NFT UNIKNAME représentant le UniknameID dans la blockchain selon le besoin.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Il est également possible de gérer des autorisations. Une entité capable de gérer des autorisations pourra émettre des VC pour des sujets, ce qui encadrera les opérations qui leurs sont autorisées. Par exemple, le service de sécurité délivrera des droits d’accès à une zone restreinte, ou bien une télécommande sera autorisée à actionner le démarrage d’une voiture… La vérification de ces droits se fait ici encore de façon décentralisée, directement par les intéressés. Il n’y a pas besoin de gestionnaire de droits centralisant toutes les autorisations. Il s’agit ici d’une avancée majeure : une telle entité représente une cible privilégiée pour un attaquant, et sa disponibilité est essentielle.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  La Blockchain Unikname Network  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Dans une entreprise, il peut être intéressant d’associer des UniknameID aux collaborateurs comme aux objets connectés. Le caractère lisible et humainement mémorisable du UniknameID sera un véritable plus pour les administrateurs système (qui sont encore des humains ) quelque soit l’entité qu’il désigne.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>La plateforme de SSI Unikname propose un service de partage confidentiel d’informations entre identifiants. Les mécanismes décrits ci-dessus permettent d’utiliser la blockchain unikname.network comme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure#cite_note-dpki-20">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure</a> (DPKI) pour authentifier ces échanges. Cette infrastructure décentralisée garantit un faible coût de maintenance et une haute disponibilité des identifiants. Deux points essentiels dans la gestion d’un système d’information d’une entreprise.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les nombreux cas d’échanges protégés par Unikname  
			   
				
				
				  Un chat fortement sécurisé  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>En distribuant des UniknameID à tous ses collaborateurs, une entreprise s’offre la possibilité d’établir un chat interne fortement sécurisé.</p>
<p>Par des mécanismes de DID et de VC, Unikname garantit l’intégrité des messages échangés ainsi que l’authenticité des expéditeurs. Ainsi, lorsqu’une personne reçoit un message d’un collaborateur, celui-ci est signé par son UniknameID. Le destinataire acquiert alors la certitude que le message n’a pas été falsifié et que l’émetteur déclaré est le véritable auteur du message. Il s’agit d’un point essentiel pour de nombreux échanges, en particulier pour message contenant des consignes de missions sensibles.</p>
<p>Des bots peuvent également être intégrés à la solution de chat, pour faire remonter des alertes par exemple. Un UniknameID étant attribué au serveur du bot, l’entreprise aura toujours la garantie de l’origine des informations.</p>
<p>Tous les messages échangés via la solution Unikname sont chiffrés de bout-en-bout, ce qui garantit une véritable confidentialité des échanges.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les interactions entre objets connectés  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Un objet connecté est conçu pour accomplir une tâche spécifique parfois sensible : ouvrir des portes, déclencher une alarme, désactiver une arrivée d’électricité, etc.</p>
<p>Ces tâches sont déclenchées par la réception de données, ou par l’analyse d’une situation. Il y a un risque important de failles de sécurité lorsque les garanties d’intégrité et d’authenticité sont défaillantes.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>En identifiant ces objets par des UniknameID, on apporte ces garanties. Les échanges entre les objets sont également chiffrés, afin de protéger le contenu des interactions. La sécurité globale du système exploitant ces objets est augmentée de façon significative.&nbsp;Tous les messages échangés via la solution Unikname sont chiffrés de bout-en-bout, ce qui garantit une véritable confidentialité des échanges.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Des échanges de données vérifiables  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Les messages échangés entre entités peuvent être de simples messages mais aussi s’appuyer sur des assertions vérifiables comme nous les avons définies plus haut. Grâce à ce standard, le niveau de confiance accordé à un système où chaque entité est identifiée par un UniknameID est fortement élevée.</p>
<p>Les administrateurs de ce système peuvent aisément définir les entités capables d’émettre des assertions sur des sujets, ou de leur attribuer des autorisations. Ainsi, toute instruction peut être légitimée, et toute information avancée peut être vérifiée.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Unification des systèmes de partage  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>La force de la plateforme SSI Unikname, en plus d’être « privacy by design », réside dans son universalité. Les UniknameID permettent tous les types de partage de données : échange de message, partage de document de documents, synchronisation d’objets connectés, attribution et vérification de droits… Ils ne représenteront pas un n-ème identifiant à gérer, mais bien le seul, géré dans une application simple et dédiée aux besoins de l’entreprise</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Conclusion  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Chez Unikname, nous sommes convaincus que l’utilisation des Self-Sovereign Identity dans la société deviendra rapidement incontournable. Les garanties de sécurité, de confidentialité et de confiance qu’elles apportent répondront à de très nombreuses problématiques.</p>
<p>Les UnikameID définissent des SSI d’une grande facilité d’utilisation et de déploiement pour un coût très faible. Ils ont été pensés et développés pour s’intégrer naturellement dans le milieu de l’entreprise, et pour permettre de faire circuler de façon confidentiel et authentifiée des informations sensibles.</p>

While this may seem like a huge leap from the static pages of web 1.0, in reality, there have been little to no changes to the core definition between the two versions.</p><p>What has really changed is the way we use existing infrastructure, and from this standpoint, it’s safe to say that it’s really the front-end that has seen the bulk of changes in web&nbsp;2.0</p> Salient Features of Web&nbsp;2.0 <p>In Web 2.0, users&nbsp;can</p>  Classify and sort information  Create and develop APIs for interoperability across different software  Create and share dynamic and responsive content with&nbsp;others  Send and receive information from different sources  Access content from mobile devices, multimedia consoles, televisions, and&nbsp;more  <p>From the above features, we can say that the pillars of Web 2.0 are mobile technology, social media, and the&nbsp;cloud.</p><p>Will these pillars continue their dominance in web&nbsp;3.0?</p><p>Unlikely, because these technologies don’t create a sense of trust among the entities participating in an interaction because of a lack of built-in security and authorization mechanisms.</p><p>As users and technologies become more mature, there emerged a greater need for trust, security, privacy, and control. And this need led to the evolution of web&nbsp;3.0.</p> What’s Web&nbsp;3.0? <p>Web 3.0 is truly a big leap from web 2.0 as the backend and the infrastructure are going through a transformation. Also known as the Semantic Web, this generation of the Internet uses an advanced metadata system that structures and arranges all kinds of data in such a way that it’s readable by both machines and&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Probably the biggest advantage of web 3.0 is that the information will be universal and can be found by anyone, which means no more digging through content for hours to find what you&nbsp;want.</p><p>Now, you might wonder how it overcomes the drawbacks of web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Well, the pillars of web 3.0 are artificial intelligence and decentralized networks. The use of artificial intelligence enables machine-to-machine interaction, advanced analytics, and other smart operations that were hitherto impossible on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>As for decentralized networks, it pushes data to the edges and into the hands of the entities that own it. In the process, it empowers entities to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">own their data</a> and determine how it can be shared, thereby giving rise to a philosophy called the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p><p>These networks also give privacy and security to users through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">encryption</a> and the use of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), thereby overcoming the trust barriers that were present in web&nbsp;2.0.</p> Salient Features of Web&nbsp;3.0 <p>Here’s a quick glance at the features of Web&nbsp;3.0</p>  The Semantic Web can understand the meaning of words, so content can be easily found, shared, and analyzed by both machines and&nbsp;humans  Uses artificial intelligence to provide relevant results quickly and give insights at speeds that are impossible for humans to&nbsp;match  Has the capability to leverage the power of 3D graphics and&nbsp;visuals.  Protects user identity and data through advanced authorization mechanisms such as encryption and&nbsp;DLTs  Delivers high levels of security and&nbsp;privacy  <p>Below is a bird’s eye view of the differences between Web 2.0 and Web&nbsp;3.0.</p> Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0 — A Quick&nbsp;Glance <p>In all, web 3.0 is a huge leap forward as it creates the infrastructure needed for humans and machines to interact, create, find, and share distributed data, make accurate predictions with artificial intelligence, and be empowered to control one’s identity through a web of trust, security, and&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">privacy</a>.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem and to enable the robust growth of Web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>To learn more about what Affinidi does, follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

Elemental Chat Demonstrates new P2P Possibilities<p>We have reached an important point for Holo as we progress towards the release of the hosting platform. The Pre-Release test of Hosted Elemental Chat continues successfully with more than 200 peers chatting across the world. Messages arrive quickly and participants report a real-time chat experience using the app. Elemental Chat is testing the end-to-end infrastructure of a peer-to-peer Holochain application being hosted by the peer-to-peer Holo hosting network. This demonstrates potentially massive new possibilities on the web. Why do we say&nbsp;that?</p>Current stats visible to all users in Elemental Chat<p>What this means is that each user, when they create their credentials, are creating the cryptographic keys for their instance of the application. Holo cannot write chats on their behalf — ever. Holo cannot remove an entry for a user — ever. The only thing Holo can do, as the infrastructure provider that bridges the connection to the centralised Internet, is prevent an application from being hosted on the platform. Applications of course have their own sets of rules and the creators and developers of those applications will design&nbsp;those.</p><p>I’ve asked a few team members to share about what this means — just to give everyone a sense of how important these results really&nbsp;are.</p><p>“When I use elemental chat knowing my friends and all of humanity is hosting the service I’m using, the internet feels human and fresh all over again.” — David&nbsp;Atkinson</p><p>“We’ve proven that the Holo hosting product, which is a complex system of distributed hApps and centralised infrastructure and which underpins the Holo ecosystem and HoloFuel, works.” — Alastair&nbsp;Ong</p><p>“This release is the first release where we’re delivering value to individual web users. Now, ANYONE can participate in Hosted Elemental Chat, you don’t have to be a host.” — Rob&nbsp;Lyon</p><p>“Hosted EC is a seed of digital agency using a browser and a basic internet connection.” — Lisa&nbsp;Jetton</p><p>Each of us on the Holo team have different personal reasons, drives, and perspectives as to what Holochain and Holo enable in the world and why it matters. Arthur has shared much about this in his blog series on <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-4ac6045ac894">unclosable carriers and the future of communication</a>. Many on the team see Holochain as a distributed infrastructure that can digitally support the distributed coordination required to face and overcome the most pressing global and local challenges of governance and collaboration that lie&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Some of us are excited to enable, at a structural level, the choice about how and where data is stored and who has access to it. Others in our team are concerned about the lack of transparency and the coercive tendencies associated with providers of mainstream Internet services, and are delighted that developers can now replace those apps on Holochain.</p><p>We see the positive test results from Hosted Elemental Chat as a beacon of what is to&nbsp;come.</p> So What’s&nbsp;Next   We launched an update to the <a href="https://holo.host">Holo.Host</a> website. Surprise!  We are ready for people to <a href="https://register.holo.host/elemental">pre-register to try Elemental Chat in a web&nbsp;browser</a>.  We are continuing the pre-release test and plan to add even more users in the coming&nbsp;week.  We are releasing a new version of Holochain for developers this&nbsp;week.  We are testing read-only functionality on Holo so that folks who do not want to login to chat can have visibility to the prototype.  We are working to get the HoloPort Alpha Program ready for hosts to register so that we have enough ports online to support the open release of Hosted Elemental Chat and so that they can begin accruing HoloFuel.  We are continuing to work on sharding in Holochain — moving this week to integration testing of this key scalability feature.  We are working on the new HoloFuel&nbsp;hApp.  We are testing Elemental Chess on&nbsp;Holo.  <p>This is a busy summer for Holo and Holochain. More&nbsp;soon.</p><p>– Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/holo-hosted-elemental-chat-in-a-browser-9be7ad4cbe01">Holo Hosted Elemental Chat in a Browser</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Simplifying Multi-Network on Ocean with a Unified Interface   🦑 The New&nbsp;Reality  🧜‍♀️ Multi-Network Market  🐋 Multi-Network Aquarius   🦑 The New&nbsp;Reality <p>When we launched the Ocean Market as part of v3 we had <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">just moved onto ETH Mainnet</a> from our own custom PoA Mainnet, so all focus for the user interface went into working against that one production network. As we deployed the Ocean Protocol contracts to more chains to escape rapidly rising transaction fees, the main interface paradigm, of basing the displayed metadata on the user’s connected network quickly became a pain to use. Hello, Could not retrieve asset.&nbsp;🙃</p><p>So we sat down and figured out the best patterns to solve these main pain points, focusing solely on the end user perspective:</p>  Reduce friction when following links to assets outside of ETH&nbsp;Mainnet  Retain the DID and existing URLs as the unique identifier for an asset, regardless of&nbsp;network  Increase discoverability of assets outside of ETH&nbsp;Mainnet  Increase discoverability of all networks Ocean Protocol is deployed&nbsp;to  Encourage usage of networks beyond just ETH&nbsp;Mainnet  Reduce need to switch wallet networks as much as possible when browsing the&nbsp;market  Any possible solution needs to scale easily as we continue deploying to more&nbsp;networks   🧜‍♀️ Multi-Network Market Leeloo agrees words with “multi” in front are&nbsp;better.<p>Ultimately, we arrived at a solution tackling all this, where the main new paradigm is an interface showing assets mixed from multiple networks. All the time and on every screen where assets are listed. This detaches the metadata and financial data source from the user’s wallet network as it was&nbsp;before.</p><p>The displayed networks are now controlled by the new network selector.</p>The new network selector and revised menubar in the Ocean Market interface.<p>By default, we auto-select all production networks Ocean Protocol is deployed to. As soon as you interact with this new network switcher, your selection takes over and is saved in your browser so it will be the same the next time you come to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Selecting or de-selecting networks then modifies all Elasticsearch queries going to our new Aquarius, resulting in mixed assets on&nbsp;screen.</p>Mixed assets from multiple networks.<p>All assets now indicate which network they belong to, and you are prompted to switch to the asset’s network when we detect your wallet being connected to another&nbsp;network.</p>One remaining place where user wallet switching is still important.<p>And in the case of using MetaMask, we added actions to switch your wallet network directly from the UI, which, as of right now, is pretty much the most streamlined user flow possible to switch networks with MetaMask from a&nbsp;Dapp.</p><p>With all this, wallet network switching is now only needed once you want to interact with an asset, like downloading or adding liquidity to its&nbsp;pool.</p><p>User wallet network also stays important for publishing an asset, so we based the whole publish form on the currently connected network to define onto which network an asset is published.</p>Publish form with network indicator.<p>As for our key market statistics in the footer, we switched it to show consolidated numbers as a sum of all production networks. In its tooltip, you can find the values split up by&nbsp;network.</p>New consolidated market statistics based on each&nbsp;network.<p>More assets on screen and more controls also led to further UI tweaks to get more space available to the actual main content. We completely refactored the main menu layout, added a global search box to it, and moved some warnings around. And, while we were at it, improved the mobile experience for it.&nbsp;✨✨</p>Everything you need from our menu is all there in mobile viewports<p>And finally, we also automatically migrate all your existing bookmarks from all the networks and combine them into one&nbsp;list.</p> Developer Changes <p>For developers, there are new values in app.config.js controlling the networks which are displayed in the network selection popover:</p><p>- chainIdsSupported: List of all supported chainIds. Used to populate the Networks user preferences list.<br>- chainIds: List of chainIds which metadata cache queries will return by default. This preselects the Networks user preferences.</p><p>In the background, the code base changed drastically. We now have only one Aquarius but still multiple providers and especially subgraphs, and we had to also technically detach the wallet network from the data source. E.g. for showing prices and financial data, main refactoring work went into correlating the assets based on ddo.chainId with the respective subgraph and querying multiple subgraphs at the same time as needed. For this, we also simplified our GraphQL setup and switched from <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/">Apollo Client</a> to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql">urql</a>.</p><p>If you’re interested in all the detailed code changes, you can follow along with the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/pull/628">main Pull Request</a> which has references and screenshots for all other changes done against it.

Besides numerous optimizations and stabilization, this new Aquarius indexes assets from multiple chains and delivers them all together in its API responses, with a new ddo.chainId value as part of each asset’s metadata.</p><p>In addition to making an interface with mixed assets possible, this also brings a huge maintainability advantage as now only one Aquarius instance has to be deployed and maintained instead of one for each supported network.</p><p>So multiple Aquarius instances are now reduced to one instance, where for every network a specific indexer is started. The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/references/aquarius/">Aquarius API</a> got a new endpoint exposing which chains are indexed under /api/v1/aquarius/chains/list.</p>/chains/list endpoint response exposing indexed chain&nbsp;IDs Migration to Multi-Network Aquarius <p>Aquarius v3.0.0+ is the&nbsp;one.</p><p>If you use our remote Aquarius instances, all you have to do is point your app against the new aquarius.oceanprotocol.com and then in your interface do things based on ddo.chainId, like modifying your Elasticsearch queries to include assets from specific networks.</p><p>We will keep the old dedicated network instances like aquarius.mainnet.oceanprotocol.com running until September 1st, 2021, and we encourage everybody to migrate to aquarius.oceanprotocol.com instead.</p><p>With one Aquarius indexing multiple chains it is rarely useful to return all the assets as most likely you are only interested in production network assets when listing them in an app. So we will also remove the GET /assets/ddo endpoint and suggest to replace it with a specific search query to POST /assets/ddo/query, and include the chainId you want,&nbsp;like:</p> {<br>  page: 1,<br>  offset: 1000,<br>  query: {<br>    query_string: {<br>      query: 'chainId:1 AND -isInPurgatory:true'<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>If you have your own instances deployed we suggest to deploy a new one with v3.0.0+ to have everything reindex, and finally switch your URLs in your app to this new deployment and adapt your app interface accordingly.

Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/">eftpos</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.fintechaustralia.org.au/">FinTech Australia</a>, established the <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/news/eftpos-launches-advisory-committee-to-give-FinTech-a-voice">eftpos FinTech Advisory Committee</a>. The Committee was established as a way of giving Australian FinTechs a direct avenue to discuss how they partner and collaborate to access the eftpos payments network for the betterment of Australia’s digital economy.




 




Over the past five months, ten leading FinTech companies joined the Committee, chaired by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentabell/?originalSubdomain=au">Ben Tabell</a>, eftpos’ Chief Information Officer. Together, the Committee collaborated to help create an initial report on how to best leverage the eftpos digital roadmap, API programs along with a variety of industry topics.




 





<blockquote>Enabling Australian FinTechs a direct avenue to discuss how they partner and collaborate to access the eftpos payments network through the Committee resulted in recommendations that covered a number of central themes, including consultation and engagement, regulation, and technology and solutions<p></p>Ben Tabell, eftpos Chief Information Officer and Committee Chair</blockquote>




<a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco </a>is honoured to have been one of the companies invited to join the Committee alongside <a href="https://assemblypayments.com/">Assembly Payments</a>, <a href="https://www.bleuco.com/">Bleu</a>, <a href="https://www.monoova.com/">Monoova</a>, <a href="https://www.sniip.com/">Sniip</a>, <a href="https://verrency.com/">Verrency</a>, <a href="https://www.ezypay.com/">Ezypay</a>, <a href="https://www.azupay.com.au/">Azupay</a>, <a href="https://www.polipayments.com/">POLi</a> and <a href="https://www.paypaplane.com/">Paypa Plane</a>.




 




The aim of the Committee is to advise eftpos on ways the company can build on its efforts to make it easier for FinTechs to access the eftpos network, products and services. The focus is to enable FinTechs to build experiences that can work across a broad range of connected devices in the digital economy.




 




eftpos has now released the report in collaboration with FinTech Australia, delivering ten recommendations on how Australian fintechs can best leverage the eftpos digital roadmap and API programs.




 




Of the recommendations in the report, Meeco is especially interested in the inclusion of data as the new currency, mobile wallets and digital identity. These map directly to the work Meeco has had the privilege to explore and validate together with eftpos over the past year. This includes a <a href="https://hedera.com/blog/eftpos-pioneers-new-ecommerce-micropayments-solution-using-hedera-hashgraph">micropayments Proof-of-Technology</a> using Meeco’s multipurpose wallet decentralised on Hedera and a pilot that is now underway with eftpos’ identity broker solution, <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/payment-solutions/payment-solutions-for-business/connectid">connectID</a>, for credentials verification as part of employee onboarding.<br><br>We’re delighted that this work with eftpos and <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera Hashgraph</a> has resulted in us being selected as a FinTech Australia <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/meeco-announced-as-finnies-2021-finalist/">Finnies finalist in the “Excellence in Blockchain/Distributed Ledger” category</a>. The Finnies event and announcement of winners is now delayed to September, due to the rolling COVID restrictions in Australia.




 




The eftpos FinTech Advisory Committee Report; Innovating on the domestic card rails, is now available to download.




 





 
 <a>Read the report</a> 
 





 




We would like to thank eftpos and FinTech Australia for the opportunity to have contributed to the Committee and the report.  We hope you find it interesting and useful.

Peter Busch, Product Owner Distributed Ledger Technologies Mobility at Robert Bosch Group, is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4653/1" title="Trust as the Key Concept in Future Mobility"> Trust as the Key Concept in Future Mobility</a> on Tuesday, September 14 starting at 3:30 pm. at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Peter some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the problems of the identity's status quo today?</p>
<p>
Yeah, the identity status quo today. This is a tricky question because what we see these days is we get more and more in this area where we need identity, where you need to authenticate yourself in a more deeply- and highly-connected environment. And since one of our main [areas of] focus or visions for Bosch is the Internet of Things [IoT]. And we see a more and more connected car, connected to the infrastructure, connected to the smart city, [and connected] to anything else, even to the streets and the crossroads now. There you need to have a particular idea where you can say, okay, you need to upload or download data from the car, and then the infrastructure or the car needs exactly to know who does that. Where the car data comes from and who you are.  
</p>
<p>And so today the ID is getting more and more important because without an ID, you have not the chance to do anything when it comes to smart traffic, smart city or anything like that, or anything with dealing with the IoT. So therefore it's [important]. And the problem that I see personally as well is [that] really these days, you only have these federated systems of ID. You get your ID on the internet via Apple, Google, Amazon, or any other proprietary systems. And so, if you have really, really safety critical stuff, I do not really trust these other systems when it comes to highly critical data which needs to be transmitted. And if my ID is really stored somewhere [on someone] else's computer or server or any backend, this could be getting a bigger and bigger problem in the future.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can decentralized identity solve pressing identity issues? Why is this particularly relevant to the mobility industry?</p>
<p>
Yeah, exactly. I think we definitely can shoot at these problems - what I just said, because when we talk about decentralized identity, you do not have these intermediaries in the background again anymore. So, what we have here is decentralized. We have another system of governance. We have another system of control. So, for one particular technical system like self-sovereign identity, for example, you are really self-sovereign of your data. So, you [are] controlling your own ID, your own identity, and you control what kind of data you are giving to the other site when you talk to anyone in the internet or Internet of Things. And so, when you talk about mobility, and you go into your car, not only yourself need to digital identity, the car itself - as a device - needs identity as well.</p>
<p>
And if in the future, if you think about [car] charging, for example, parking or zoning in a smart city, or anything like that, then you always – what I said before - you need to authenticate or authorize yourself to do anything and as well, maybe to buy things or to sell things, data in the car. And then absolutely it's so important that you can control what you are doing exactly with your data. Therefore, decentralized systems are quite important. And my hypothesis here, is it won't go without it in the future. Of course, Amazon, Google, or the likes can tell you, okay, trust us, the data is safe, and we can do it on premise and all that stuff, but on really the safety critical things, I do not trust anyone. I do only trust myself in these cases because when it goes about the life of the driver, for example, the safety of one, then we have to trust the person themselves, and that is possible really only with decentralized systems.     
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When will decentralized identity become a reality? </p>
<p>
If you would have asked me like a year ago, I would have said maybe like five or 10 years. We are very far from it because automated driving, as well, needs a longer time. However, things have changed because we are going now in a phase where the governments are making a lot of pressure to really enforce the industry to use these digital identities. And especially there's one very interesting development at the moment that the German government, for example, they are pressing on using self-sovereign identity. </p>
<p>And so, with that, the time is getting faster and faster, or the development time is getting faster and faster. And I expect now to be able to use these systems, like in one, two years already. And together with this, we are in a huge collaboration mode with Gaia X in Europe at the moment. And so this helps again, because we have all the industry groups, a lot of startups, [and] a lot of universities coming together, working on these problems in a very fast mode. And so this helps us maybe in having [within] two or three years’ time, really scalable and usable systems out there.   
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Could you share some insights on your presentation at EIC 2021? </p>
<p>
Right, I already started it, featured it a little bit. Trust is really the key concept because when you talk about, maybe, automated driving, then you need to trust the infrastructure. You need to trust the data which comes into the car because the car has to take some decisions. Where to drive, how to drive and as well, the driver gives some very trustworthy data to the car and to the infrastructure. And that is in a lot of different use cases. You need that trust relationship, and you need technical systems that help you with that. And so there are some use cases I would really talk about a little bit deeper and try to explain  what is the situation today. How would we solve this today, and how would we solve that problem or challenge with these new technologies we are seeing upcoming.  </p>

<p>The identity industry is evolving. Once a niche field that very few people understood, digital identity is now a strategic piece in every organization's security architecture. Organizations are successfully breaking away from monolithic, legacy systems yet one key challenge that remains is building user-centric security solutions. To build centralized authorization in an increasingly decentralized world, identity data needs to be dynamic and easily adaptable — without changing a single line of code. Join host Cameron D'Ambrosi and Director of Strategic Alliances at Cloudentity David Lee as they pave way for the next realm of "identity 3.0" and break down open data, the adoption of new identity standards, and active governance systems across the organization.</p>

<p>CoinPost: Ardor PoS blockchain technology has been the focus of many projects related to blockchain gaming and NFT. In particular, two research studies where Ignis, Ardor’s main child chain, was used as a demonstration tool conducted by Dr. Alexander Pfeiffer, post-doc fellow at Comparative Media Studies at MIT and Senior Researcher at Donau-Univeristät Krems. The first research is a demonstration experiment in the creative industry, to test whether the issuance of NFTs can be used to support the authenticity of items. The second examination within the media and publishing industry analyses the feasibility to use digital IDs to guarantee the authenticity of the source material.</p>

  <p>How many of you have looked at the SCIM specifications (IETF&nbsp;RFC&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643">7643</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644">7644</a>)&nbsp;and&nbsp;thought&nbsp;“could they be made simpler or clearer”?&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is your chance&nbsp;to make a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/agenda/">The IETF’s&nbsp;111th&nbsp;Plenary&nbsp;Meeting</a>&nbsp;is running virtually as we speak, and&nbsp;this Thursday (July 29th)&nbsp;one of the events in the plenary is a “Birds of a Feather”&nbsp;(or&nbsp;BoF)&nbsp;meeting for taking new steps with SCIM&nbsp;(the session identifier is&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/sins/meetings/">sins</a>).&nbsp; We hope to convince the&nbsp;IETF Area Directors and the community that there is further work to be done in this area, and no matter what your opinion is, you should&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/sins/about/">bring that opinion to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BoF&nbsp;meeting</a>&nbsp;and be heard!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t have to be a standards person – if you are working with SCIM and just getting stuck, that is important implementer feedback that we want to hear.&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
 The Lead Up&nbsp; 
<p>The topic has been discussed in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SCIM-Interest-Group">informal bi-weekly meetings</a>&nbsp;for the last two months&nbsp;(we call it the SCIM Interest Group), with strong participation and lots of healthy opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We started by reviewing the many different draft extensions that are out there for SCIM, and a lot of those reviews are available on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe2lm3WNUfehPOxEvZ92ygA">SCIM IG&nbsp;Youtube&nbsp;channel</a>&nbsp;if you are interested.&nbsp; We applied for the&nbsp;BoF&nbsp;meeting to get feedback from a larger audience and to judge whether we have momentum, and now we are going to find out.&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Microsoft View&nbsp; 
<p>When it comes to SCIM,&nbsp;Microsoft is&nbsp;interested in participating for several simple reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Operational Clarity&nbsp;</p>
 
 At the time SCIM was born,&nbsp;the&nbsp;cloud was&nbsp;still&nbsp;new&nbsp;and the possibilities were not known.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;very&nbsp;common assumed implementation pattern was&nbsp;a push model from on-premises to cloud, and this led to assumptions about who would be pushing what data where.&nbsp;&nbsp;These days however, the combinations of push and pull, client and server, are much more varied.&nbsp;We think that some simple updates in language and better profiling of common implementation roles could make the specification much more intuitive to adopt – thus&nbsp;helping overall interoperability&nbsp;across the identity community&nbsp;and&nbsp;getting us closer to making SCIM a must-have&nbsp;cross-domain interface.&nbsp; 
 
<p>End to End Automation as a First Order Goal&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Identity world is now&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;powered by automation and&nbsp;AI.&nbsp; Connectivity is no longer just about web single-sign on;&nbsp;the new and growing requirement today is for&nbsp;automated&nbsp;corporate oversight,&nbsp;including&nbsp;governance, provisioning, risk detection and threat intelligence.&nbsp;And we don’t only want to automate the connections, we want to automate the establishment of the connection.&nbsp; We are hoping to research&nbsp;whether there is additional&nbsp;metadata or even schema that could facilitate a more seamless bootstrapping of&nbsp;various protocols in the multi-cloud world, including&nbsp;protocols like&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sse/">Shared&nbsp;Signals and&nbsp;Events(SSE)/CAEP</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://openid.net/wg/fastfed">Fastfed</a>, with a plan to&nbsp;lay the groundwork for the explosion in multi-cloud automation that&nbsp;growing industry verticals like&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudknox.io/cloud-infrastructure-entitlement-management/">CIEM</a>&nbsp;exemplify.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Security Best Practice&nbsp;&amp; Multi-cloud&nbsp;Updates&nbsp;</p>
 
 In the API Security world, a lot has happened since the first SCIM work began.&nbsp; OAuth 2.0&nbsp;has become&nbsp;the preferred mechanism for protecting APIs and a number of extensions have evolved that increase security during access token presentation.&nbsp; We want the negotiation of industry-best security to be well specified for identity data&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Get Involved&nbsp; 
<p>The most important thing to do is to sign up for the IETF Birds of a Feather meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration is here:&nbsp;<a href="https://registration.ietf.org/111/">https://registration.ietf.org/111/.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no membership requirement, but there is a fee – a day pass costs $125 but there are fee waivers available if that cost is too great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also join our merry band in the SCIM Interest Group – connection data is on our wiki:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SCIM-Interest-Group/wiki">Explanation of our goals, how to get involved, and pages on our dedicated work efforts (github.com)</a>&nbsp;. We meet every 2 weeks, in two different times of day to encourage global participation. For updates,&nbsp;the easiest way to stay informed is to subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ietf.org%2Fmailman%2Flistinfo%2Fscim&amp;data=04%7C01%7CPamela.Dingle%40microsoft.com%7C50789b8468294876f9df08d9507d030f%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637629320743730646%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=sGI8BsjgtS2v7idTkSnr4O0QI9BlYBs9M2DGaePjr8U%3D&amp;reserved=0">SCIM Mailing list at IETF</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope your excitement about this standards work is as great as&nbsp;ours&nbsp;and we cannot strongly enough encourage your participation – the best specifications are made from diverse input, and the more breadth we have in implementation experience and point of view, the better we will do.&nbsp; Join us!&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Microsoft last week announced another acquisition, a few days after announcing the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/fisher/microsofts-threat-intelligence-play-is-good-news-for-customers-in-fight-against-ransomware" title="acquisition of RiskIQ">acquisition of RiskIQ</a>. This next acquisition is <a href="http://cloudknox.io" title="CloudKnox Security">CloudKnox Security</a>, a vendor offering unified privileged access and cloud entitlement management. These technologies, sometimes also referred to as CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management), are essential for getting a grip on entitlements and access to cloud resources in multi-cloud and multi-hybrid environments.</p>
 Permission Management for hybrid cloud infrastructures 
<p>The CloudKnox Cloud Permissions Management Platform delivers a range of capabilities for managing privileges and access for cloud resources. This includes discovery and assessment of the state of privileges. It supports managing and optimizing privileges, for enforcing principles such as least privilege and need to know. It supports monitoring, auditing, and reporting, as well as forensics and incident response. Support spans the major clouds, but also virtualization environments such as VMware NSX, and management of server operating systems.</p>
 Extending PAM and hybrid cloud support in Microsoft 365 
<p>With that acquisition, Microsoft strengthens their <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/" title="Azure Active Directory">Azure Active Directory</a> offering, by further extending the reach into multi-cloud and multi-hybrid environments, but also extending the capabilities for managing privileged access entitlements and thus the breadth of its PAM (Privileged Access Management) capabilities. We expect to see integration of these technologies into the existing Microsoft stack of identity and security solutions soon.</p>
<p>Microsoft demonstrates with these acquisitions that identity and security are, for long, not just a by-product anymore, but one of the core pillars of their portfolio. Specifically, Microsoft is consequently extending its scope of solutions beyond the own ecosystem, serving the breadth of today’s heterogeneous IT environments.</p>
