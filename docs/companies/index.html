  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>What a huge topic. The Digital Universe. Is this more than the Metaverse or less? Anyway: We live in the Digital Age. The vast majority of organizations rely on digital services to run at least parts of their business. Every one of us is consuming such digital services. They are ubiquitous. But this bigger ecosystem of connected digital services, of consumers and customers and citizens, of businesses and governments, of business partners and suppliers, of devices and things is at risk. It is under attack, continuously. The golden rule is: Once you are connected, you are under attack.</p>
 No silver bullet for security 
<p>There is no silver bullet, no single solution for securing that complex environment. But there are two good starting points, to my opinion:</p>
 
 Everyone and every organization must care for the security within their realm 
 Zero Trust (and yes, I know, it isn’t the most popular buzzword anymore, but that does not mean it is the wrong approach – in contrary) must be applied: Don’t trust, always verify 
 
<p>Some of the core components of modern security for the Digital Universe, beyond standard cybersecurity, standard IAM (Identity and Access Management) and Zero Trust, include security for Web3 and the Metaverse, Decentralized Identity, Software Supply Chain Security and Secure Development Lifecycles, but also CIAM (Consumer IAM) and IoT (Internet of Things) Security.</p>
 Security for Web3 and the Metaverse(s) – and the role of Decentralized Identity 
<p>We may discuss whether there already are metaverse(s) out there. Web3 is closer, for sure, despite being a somewhat undefined mix of different mostly decentralized technologies. The answer on how security for that brave new world will look like would by far exceed the scope of a single blog post.</p>
<p>But let me mention two important points. One is that there won’t be a single security solution for these environments. Tackling security for Web3 and the metaverses best starts with deconstructing them into the various components such as distributed ledgers or smart contracts and then addressing security per component. Recombining this and implementing policies and other common elements consistently will help us in achieving our goal. The most important of the common elements is Decentralized Identity, which is relevant to every component of metaverses and the Web3. Decentralized Identity thus is essential for securing the digital universe.</p>
 Secure Software and Secure Supply Chains 
<p>Software Security and Secure Software Supply Chains are also essential for the digital universe to work well. With close collaboration, this also impacts Supply Chain Security for partners, suppliers etc. accessing and interoperating with other organizations’ IT. Secure Development Lifecycles (SDL) are a must, where every part of the lifecycle is well-protected. SBOMs (Software Bills of Materials), which are increasingly requested, are mandatory. There is no doubt that we must get much better here, with digital services relying on secure software, but also with the risk of malicious code spreading way faster in a hyperconnected world. Beyond software security, B2B Identity Management is of utmost importance, to understand and being able to manage access of externals.</p>
 The “C” users: Customers, Consumers, Citizens 
<p>At the end, digital services are for customers, consumers, and citizens. Decentralized Identity will play an important role for their access and interaction in the near future. CIAM is equally relevant to connect traditional means of access of these “C” users as well as Decentralized Identity to the backend systems, marketing automation services, and other solutions in the organizations.</p>
 Putting it all together 
<p>Securing the digital universe requires so many different activities. Do you need a blueprint for that? Even while it surely would be fun creating such a blueprint, it appears to be too complex. It requires focus areas, some of these but not all listed above. It requires a common understanding of essential concepts, such as the role of Decentralized Identity and of Zero Trust. It must be based on a good understanding of risks, but also the impact of failure in a hyperconnected world: If security fails in one area, this can impact many other areas. Again, Zero Trust (which also implies layered security) as a foundational principle helps here.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: The digital universe as well as individual digital businesses will suffer or even fail when we fail in security.</p>
<p>The importance of securing the digital universe will take center stage at the upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> conference happening in Frankfurt this November 14-16. Attending this conference will provide valuable insights on how to effectively address this expansive subject and gain a better understanding of the steps involved in securing the digital universe.</p>

<p>CRM Connect, championed by TNC – The Nature Conservancy Centre (TNCC), India, offers valuable intelligence to farmers, agriculture sector leaders, and decision makers. Over 1,000 farmers are using this technology solution to eliminate crop residue burning, and by the end of this year, the teams are aiming to engage with 12,000 more farmers.</p>



 Promoting sustainable agriculture in India 



<p>In North India, not too far from the Himalayas, is Punjab. With an area of only 1.5% of total land in the country, Punjab is known as the “breadbasket” of India. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180092200026X">According to recent studies</a>, the rich soil in this state has contributed in the past about 40% of India’s wheat and 30% of its rice. With the surplus productivity in these two crops compared to other places in the world, Punjab has positioned itself as a major contributor of crops on a global scale.</p>



<p>However, at the end of each harvest, farmers in North India often resort to burning crop residue. This practice refers to the process of burning the leftover plant material after the main harvest, such as straw, stubble, and other agricultural residues in fields. The residue burning is mostly prevalent in paddy crop residue during the paddy harvest and subsequent sowing of wheat, which takes place in October and November. Farmers use this option as a quick and inexpensive way to clear the fields and prepare them for the next planting season. However, this process results in air pollution and soil degradation which have major consequences for public health and the environment. Burning crop residue is easy but in many ways damaging as it impacts both millions of people and acres of farmland.</p>



<p>Many farmers in North India want to change this practice and government officials, communities and organizations are looking to support them. What has been missing so far? Data and technology, two critical elements that can bring all of them together to achieve this goal.</p>



<p>In the pursuit of long-lasting solutions, TNCC has partnered with IBM to leverage the necessary technology and data resources. Together, they are trying to address this challenge with the aim of fostering agricultural sustainability and reducing the impact of climate change on communities. By leveraging advanced data analytics and accessible mobile technology, TNCC is leading the charge in transforming sustainable agriculture practices and protecting vulnerable populations from the effects of pollution and climate change.</p>



 Introducing CRM Connect: A catalyst for change 



<p>Recognizing the urgent need to transition from crop residue burning to crop residue management (CRM), TNCC partnered with IBM through the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">IBM Sustainability Accelerator</a> to develop <a href="https://crmconnect.in/home">CRM Connect</a>—a powerful public information platform. Built by IBM developers and tapping into the climate analytics expertise of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/sustainability">IBM Consulting’s</a> sustainability, climate and weather analytics expertise, CRM Connect serves as a tool to promote regenerative farming practices in India through the use of demographic insights, agricultural activity tracking, and resource mapping. Overall, CRM Connect improves agricultural sustainability and mitigates harm to the region’s air and soil quality.</p>



<p>The CRM Connect dashboard offers valuable intelligence to sector practitioners, government officials, and policy makers—analyzing data from various sources including weather patterns, soil conditions, and demographic information. CRM Connect fills the insights gap for transitioning to sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices.</p>



<p>“This solution has the potential to create maximum impact. Using technology, we have been able to analyze data sets that let us identify 2,500 villages (out of over 18,000 villages across Punjab and Haryana) that concentrate 70% of the total fire events that came from paddy residue burning over the last 4-5 years,” explains Manoj Singh, Lead for Regenerative Agriculture at TNCC. “These types of valuable insights allow decision makers to focus resources where you can make a greater impact.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the platform also creates a network through the CRM Connect web portal, facilitating collaboration among farmers. Through this application, farmers can connect, share information, find CRM service providers for their operations, and offer support, overall fostering a sense of community and empowerment.</p>



 Empowering farmers and cultivating change 



<p>Following this two-sided approach of sharing demographic insights with policymakers and information with farmers, TNCC’s collaboration with IBM via the CRM Connect platform has the potential to empower stakeholders in India to adopt more sustainable agriculture practices. By providing critical information and fostering connections, TNCC is playing a pivotal role in shifting mindsets and inspiring positive change within communities. Thousands of farmers have eagerly embraced this opportunity, demonstrating their commitment to sustainable agriculture and a desire for a healthier, more resilient future.</p>



<p>“Today, over 1,000 farmers are using the web portal covering approximately 2,200 hectares of land. And by the end of this year, the platform aims to engage 12,000 famers, thus impacting over 25,000 hectares,” says Premjit Balasundaram, IBM’s project leader. “Farmers want to tackle this problem and the practices to do it already exist. What we are doing is just bringing people together so we can support them in the transition.”</p>



 Looking ahead: A vision for greater impact 



<p>The impact of TNCC’s partnership with IBM extends beyond their current goals. With a vision to reach over two million farmers in the long term, TNCC aims to create a ripple effect throughout the region and beyond. TNCC aspires to inspire a national and global shift towards regenerative agriculture, protecting vulnerable populations and safeguarding the environment for future generations. CRM Connect is a useful tool for the path to achieve this vision.</p>



<p>As a next step, the project aims to leverage <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> to run more complex correlations that offer even more valuable and precise insights to farmers, organizations, and policymakers. The teams have identified 86 variables that could be analyzed using AI to promote these efforts further.</p>



<p>Together, TNCC and IBM are creating a better and more sustainable world for all.</p>

<p>Blockchain databases were designed to enhance trust in centralized ecosystems by incorporating tamper-evidence features into traditional databases. They are easier to use and can reduce operational and development costs compared to decentralized ledger technologies. However, existing blockchain databases lack efficient tools for multiple parties to control shared data on the ledger.</p>



<p>Orion is an open source blockchain database that provides unique capabilities, such as multi-signature and proof functionalities, along with extensive key-level access control. These features empower parties to jointly control and validate values written to the database. Orion combines these capabilities with other blockchain properties, offering tamper evidence, provenance, data lineage, authenticity and non-repudiation, all while utilizing a standard data model and transactional APIs. Orion’s technology is highly valuable in enhancing system integrity and reducing errors, disputes and fraud.</p>



<p>In this post, we explore trust requirements across various business environments, identify existing trust gaps and outline how Orion can effectively bridge those gaps. We delve into the key features of Orion and explore its potential applications across diverse domains.</p>



 Importance of trust in business ecosystems 



<p>Trust is essential for the growth and success of business ecosystems. However, establishing trust in complex environments, such as global supply chains, poses significant challenges due to the involvement of diverse parties. For instance, in response to sustainability trends, product manufacturers may need to prove the carbon footprint of their products to regulators and clients. Thus, ensuring transparency and integrity in calculating the carbon consumption of all components across the entire supply chain becomes imperative. The adoption of mutually trusted technology can assist businesses, customers, partners and government authorities in verifying the existence, authenticity and integrity of interactions among parties. By doing so, it not only serves as a safeguard against potential disputes and fraudulent activities, but also fosters an environment of trust and reliability.</p>



 Understanding trust requirements 



<p>Different business ecosystems exhibit varying levels of trust among participants, which influences their specific trust requirements. In highly trusted ecosystems, it may be enough to ensure independent, consistent and crash-tolerant recording of the data, while in limited-trust environments we may also want to verify the correctness of the recorded data, ensure authenticity and provide tamper evidence and data lineage. Finally, in low-trust environments we may need to control the transaction execution by supporting multi-party approval and parallel execution of smart contracts, and even reaching a consensus in the presence of malicious parties.</p>



<p>From a topological standpoint, ecosystems can be classified into centralized and decentralized ecosystems. In centralized ecosystems, there is usually at least one party that enjoys a certain level of trust from all participants, whereas decentralized ecosystems lack a single entity that is trusted by all. Currently, the majority of business ecosystems operate under a centralized trust assumption. In such ecosystems, a trusted party (such as a cloud provider, government organization or other influential player) plays a significant role, while other participants within the ecosystem are not required to trust each other directly. For example, organizations typically rely on trust in the cloud provider, expecting them to refrain from intentionally blocking client access to services, despite having the capability to do so.</p>



<p>However, the presence of a trusted party does not imply blind trust from other participants. Our experience highlights significant room for enhancing trust within centralized ecosystems. Transparency throughout the data lifecycle and the ability to demonstrate data integrity and consistency are critical factors for improvement. These elements play a vital role in streamlining the auditing process, particularly in highly regulated environments. Ensuring the authenticity of data is crucial in preventing potential disputes over authorship in multi-party interactions. Furthermore, even trusted parties often seek to restrict the power of their privileged users to mitigate the risks associated with mistakes and fraud. By addressing these trust gaps, centralized ecosystems can be further strengthened, fostering increased confidence and reliability in business interactions.</p>



 Technological choices to address the trust gaps 



<p>There are three major types of technologies that can help close the trust gap in business ecosystems. Classical databases with basic recording features are usually sufficient for the proper operation of highly trusted centralized ecosystems. On the other hand, blockchain databases, which extend classical database capabilities with verifications and proofs, are the best choice for limited trust centralized ecosystems. Finally, decentralized ledger technologies typically provide a full stack of trust features and are commonly used in low-trust decentralized environments. It is worth noting that the support of advanced trust features usually leads to higher complexity and may impact the performance and increase the operational cost of the solution. Consequently, it is important to match the needs of the ecosystem with the most suitable technology available. Figure 1 illustrates the topography of trust in the business ecosystems.</p>



Figure 1: Topology of trust



<p>While the use of existing blockchain database technologies can address some of the trust gaps in centralized environments, they fall short in enabling efficient control of shared data among multiple parties. Decentralized blockchain ledger technologies provide these capabilities and can be used in centralized systems, but that’s often inefficient and fails to justify increased costs and complexity. This is where Orion, our novel open-source blockchain database, comes into play. Orion differentiates itself from other centralized blockchain databases by offering a comprehensive set of blockchain properties while empowering multiple parties to govern access to shared data. It achieves this by introducing broad key-level read/write access control and multi-signature capabilities, ensuring that database transactions are approved only when jointly signed by designated parties.</p>



 Meet Orion: A centralized blockchain database with multi-party data access control 



<p>Orion is an advanced open-source blockchain database that combines the power of blockchain technology with the reliability of traditional database features. It provides a comprehensive solution for secure, transparent and trustworthy data management. By integrating a cryptography-based layer on top of a classical database, Orion offers a wide range of blockchain functionalities, including a highly available, secure, and replicated distributed database with an immutable tamper-proof ledger. The ledger delivers tamper evidence, enabling the detection of any modifications made to the data, even if carried out by privileged users. This additional layer of security ensures data integrity, while reinforcing trust and reliability. Figure 2 illustrates the blockchain functionalities that Orion offers.</p>



Figure 2: Key Orion features



<p>A key distinguishing aspect of Orion is its support for multi-signature (multi-sig) transactions, achieved through a unique read-write key-level access control mechanism. This functionality is crucial for facilitating trusted interactions among multiple parties. Transactions are committed only when signed by several designated participants, ensuring a secure and reliable environment for multi-party engagements.</p>



<p>One of Orion’s most notable features is its ability to facilitate provenance and data lineage. It records every transformation that the data undergoes, enabling history queries to extract information on when, how and by whom the data was modified. By utilizing a graph-DB-based provenance engine, Orion can provide valuable insights into the history and origin of the data, promoting transparency and accountability.</p>



<p>Orion empowers users with authenticity and non-repudiation features, providing solid evidence that the received data matches precisely what was sent by the original source. All transactions are signed, and the server generates a digital receipt that can be used to verify the data’s integrity. This capability prevents disputes regarding authorship and further enhances trust.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Orion seamlessly integrates classical database functionalities alongside its blockchain capabilities. It offers efficient queries, robust resilience and scalability. With a standard key-value JSON store and transactional APIs, Orion guarantees the execution of a set of read/write operations as an atomic transaction, preserving consistency and data integrity. Figure 3 illustrates how Orion’s architecture provides transparent insights that ensure accountability.</p>

 Key applications lead to valuable solutions 



<p>Orion caters to a wide range of key applications that address various industry needs and provide valuable solutions for businesses and organizations. One notable application is within the supply chain domain. Orion can serve as a robust repository for storing the carbon footprint data of all product components, provided by part manufacturers. Additionally, it can store the contracting terms between buyers and sellers of these parts, signed by both parties. Furthermore, Orion enables the inclusion of the formula used to compute the carbon footprint of the product, along with links to the carbon consumption data of its individual parts, which can be updated by the product owner. By leveraging Orion, organizations can ensure the authenticity, non-repudiation and integrity of this critical data. Moreover, key-level access control mechanisms guarantee data privacy between the involved parties. If necessary, privacy-preserving techniques like zero-knowledge proofs can be employed to conceal sensitive details, even from the central party. In such cases, Orion can retain only the necessary metadata required to demonstrate the accuracy of the records, which can be kept outside the system for third-party auditors.</p>



<p>In addition to the supply chain application, Orion offers numerous highly beneficial use cases that our clients have identified. For instance, within the financial sector and regulated domains, Orion can facilitate auditing processes by providing proof of authenticity, data integrity and tamper evidence for company records. Our multi-signature capabilities enable the automation of various business contracting processes and support notary services across different domains. Furthermore, Orion can be used for maintaining the authenticity and integrity of evidence collected through insurance claims processes. It can simplify the management of licenses, certificates, educational records and property ownership rights for government organizations. Orion can also serve as a secure digital platform for managing vaccination processes, records and statuses while ensuring trustworthiness. Moreover, it enables the establishment of provenance for goods and compliance with maintenance requirements in supply chains. Additionally, Orion can serve as an off-chain store for decentralized ledger ecosystems, ensuring data integrity across hybrid environments.</p>



<p>Orion has already been successfully deployed as a blockchain platform in several EU-funded projects. In the C4IIoT project, Orion enhanced the level of trust in an IoT cybersecurity platform by providing traceability, provenance and non-repudiation features to track changes in machine and production line configurations. In the COPA EUROPE project, Orion is being utilized to track the production and lifecycle of media assets, facilitating trusted and secure trading of sport videos, rights and participant incentivization. In the i4Q project, Orion is employed to safeguard the integrity of industrial IoT data, including device access policies and critical location information, supporting smart manufacturing use cases. These projects demonstrate the versatility and reliability of Orion as a blockchain database technology in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>This article, part of the IBM and Pfizer’s series on the application of AI techniques to improve clinical trial performance, focuses on enrollment and real-time forecasting. Additionally, we are looking to explore the ways to increase patient volume, diversity in clinical trial recruitment, and the potential to apply Generative AI and quantum computing. More than ever, companies are finding that managing these interdependent journeys in a holistic and integrated way is essential to their success in achieving change.</p>



<p>Despite advancements in the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical research, delivering drugs to market is still a complex process with tremendous opportunity for improvement. Clinical trials are time-consuming, costly, and largely inefficient for reasons that are out of companies’ control. Efficient clinical trial site selection continues to be a prominent industry-wide challenge. Research conducted by the Tufts Center for Study of Drug Development and presented in 2020 found that 23% of trials fail to achieve planned recruitment timelines1; four years later, many of IBM’s clients still share the same struggle. The inability to meet planned recruitment timelines and the failure of certain sites to enroll participants contribute to a substantial monetary impact for pharmaceutical companies that may be relayed to providers and patients in the form of higher costs for medicines and healthcare services. Site selection and recruitment challenges are key cost drivers to IBM’s biopharma clients, with estimates, between $15-25 million annually depending on size of the company and pipeline. This is in line with existing sector benchmarks.2,3</p>



<p>When clinical trials are prematurely discontinued due to trial site underperformance, the research questions remain unanswered and research findings end up not published. Failure to share data and results from randomized clinical trials means a missed opportunity to contribute to systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as a lack of lesson-sharing with the biopharma community.</p>



<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) establishes its presence in biopharma, integrating it into the clinical trial site selection process and ongoing performance management can help empower companies with invaluable insights into site performance, which may result in accelerated recruitment times, reduced global site footprint, and significant cost savings (Exhibit 1). AI can also empower trial managers and executives with the data to make strategic decisions. In this article, we outline how biopharma companies can potentially harness an AI-driven approach to make informed decisions based on evidence and increase the likelihood of success of a clinical trial site.</p>







 Tackling complexities in clinical trial site selection: A playground for a new technology and AI operating model 



<p>Enrollment strategists and site performance analysts are responsible for constructing and prioritizing robust end-to-end enrollment strategies tailored to specific trials. To do so they require data, which is in no shortage. The challenges they encounter are understanding what data is indicative of site performance. Specifically, how can they derive insights on site performance that would enable them to factor non-performing sites into enrollment planning and real-time execution strategies.</p>



<p>In an ideal scenario, they would be able to, with relative and consistent accuracy, predict performance of clinical trial sites that are at risk of not meeting their recruitment expectations. Ultimately, enabling real-time monitoring of site activities and enrollment progress could prompt timely mitigation actions ahead of time. The ability to do so would assist with initial clinical trial planning, resource allocation, and feasibility assessments, preventing financial losses, and enabling better decision-making for successful clinical trial enrollment.</p>



<p>Additionally, biopharma companies may find themselves building out AI capabilities in-house sporadically and without overarching governance. Assembling multidisciplinary teams across functions to support a clinical trial process is challenging, and many biopharma companies do this in an&nbsp; isolated fashion. This results in many groups using a large gamut of AI-based tools that are not fully integrated into a cohesive system and platform. Therefore, IBM observes that more clients tend to consult AI leaders to help establish governance and enhance AI and data science capabilities, an operating model in the form of co-delivery partnerships.</p>



 Embracing AI for clinical trials: The elements of success 



<p>By embracing three AI-enabled capabilities, biopharma companies can significantly optimize clinical trial site selection process while developing core AI competencies that can be scaled out and saving financial resources that can be reinvested or redirected. The ability to seize these advantages is one way that pharmaceutical companies may be able to gain sizable competitive edge.</p>



 AI-driven enrollment rate prediction 



<p>Enrollment prediction is typically conducted before the trial begins and helps enrollment strategist and feasibility analysts in initial trial planning, resource allocation, and feasibility assessment. Accurate enrollment rate prediction prevents financial losses, aids in strategizing enrollment plans by factoring in non-performance, and enables effective budget planning to avoid shortfalls and delays.</p>



 
 It can identify nonperforming clinical trial sites based on historical performance before the trial starts, helping in factoring site non-performance into their comprehensive enrollment strategy. &nbsp; 



 It can assist in budget planning by estimating the early financial resources required and securing adequate funding, preventing budget shortfalls and the need for requesting additional funding later, which can potentially slow down the enrollment process. 
 



<p>AI algorithms have the potential to surpass traditional statistical approaches for analyzing comprehensive recruitment data and accurately forecasting enrollment rates. &nbsp;</p>



 
 It offers enhanced capabilities to analyze complex and large volumes of comprehensive recruitment data to accurately forecast enrollment rates at study, indication, and country levels. 



 AI algorithms can help identify underlying patterns and trends through vast amounts of data collected during feasibility, not to mention previous experience with clinical trial sites. Blending historical performance data along with RWD (Real world data) may be able to elucidate hidden patterns that can potentially bolster enrollment rate predictions with higher accuracy compared to traditional statistical approaches. Enhancing current approaches by leveraging AI algorithms is intended to improve power, adaptability, and scalability, making them valuable tools in predicting complex clinical trial outcomes like enrollment rates. Often larger or established teams shy away from integrating AI due to complexities in rollout and validation. However, we have observed that greater value comes from employing ensemble methods to achieve more accurate and robust predictions. 
 



 Real-time monitoring and forecasting of site performance 



<p>Real-time insight into site performance offers up-to-date insights on enrollment progress, facilitates early detection of performance issues, and enables proactive decision-making and course corrections to facilitate clinical trial success.</p>



 
 Provides up-to-date insights into the enrollment progress and completion timelines by continuously capturing and analyzing enrollment data from various sources throughout the trial.&nbsp; 



 Simulating enrollment scenarios on the fly from real time monitoring can empower teams to enhance enrollment forecasting facilitating early detection of performance issues at sites, such as slow recruitment, patient eligibility challenges, lack of patient engagement, site performance discrepancies, insufficient resources, and regulatory compliance. 



 Provides timely information that enables proactive evidence-based decision-making enabling minor course corrections with larger impact, such as adjusting strategies, allocating resources to ensure a clinical trial stays on track, thus helping to maximize the success of the trial. 
 



<p>AI empowers real-time site performance monitoring and forecasting by automating data analysis, providing timely alerts and insights, and enabling predictive analytics.&nbsp;</p>



 
 AI models can be designed to detect anomalies in real-time site performance data. By learning from historical patterns and using advanced algorithms, models can identify deviations from expected site performance levels and trigger alerts. This allows for prompt investigation and intervention when site performance discrepancies occur, enabling timely resolution and minimizing any negative impact. 



 AI enables efficient and accurate tracking and reporting of key performance metrics related to site performance such as enrollment rate, dropout rate, enrollment target achievement, participant diversity, etc. It can be integrated into real-time dashboards, visualizations, and reports that provide stakeholders with a comprehensive and up-to-date insight into site performance. 



 AI algorithms may provide a significant advantage in real-time forecasting due to their ability to elucidate and infer complex patterns within data and allow for reinforcement to drive continuous learning and improvement, which can help lead to a more accurate and informed forecasting outcome. 
 



 Leveraging Next Best Action (NBA) engine for mitigation plan execution 



<p>Having a well-defined and executed mitigation plan in place during trial conduct is essential to the success of the trial.</p>



 
 A mitigation plan facilitates trial continuity by providing contingency measures and alternative strategies. By having a plan in place to address unexpected events or challenges, sponsors can minimize disruptions and keep the trial on track. This can help prevent the financial burden of trial interruptions if the trial cannot proceed as planned. 



 Executing the mitigation plan during trial conduct can be challenging due to the complex trial environment, unforeseen circumstances, the need for timelines and responsiveness, compliance and regulatory considerations, etc. Effectively addressing these challenges is crucial for the success of the trial and its mitigation efforts. 
 



<p>A Next Best Action (NBA) engine is an AI-powered system or algorithm that can recommend the most effective mitigation actions or interventions to optimize site performance in real-time.</p>



 
 The NBA engine utilizes AI algorithms to analyze real-time site performance data from various sources, identify patterns, predict future events or outcomes, anticipate potential issues that require mitigation actions before they occur. 



 Given the specific circumstances of the trial, the engine employs optimization techniques to search for the best combination of actions that align with the pre-defined key trial conduct metrics. It explores the impact of different scenarios, evaluate trade-offs, and determine the optimal actions to be taken. 



 The best next actions will be recommended to stakeholders, such as sponsors, investigators, or site coordinators. Recommendations can be presented through an interactive dashboard to facilitate understanding and enable stakeholders to make informed decisions. 
 



 Shattering the status quo 



<p>Clinical trials are the bread and butter of the pharmaceutical industry; however, trials often experience delays which can significantly extend the duration of a given study. Fortunately, there are straightforward answers to address some trial management challenges: understand the process and people involved, adopt a long-term AI strategy while building AI capabilities within this use case, invest in new machine learning models to enable enrollment forecasting, real-time site monitoring, data-driven recommendation engine. These steps can help not only to generate sizable savings but also to make biopharma companies feel more confident about the investments in artificial intelligence with impact.</p>



<p>IBM Consulting and Pfizer&nbsp;are working together to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry by reducing the time and cost associated with failed clinical trials so that medicines can reach patients in need faster and more efficiently.</p>



<p>Combining the technology and data strategy and computing prowess of IBM and the extensive clinical experience of Pfizer, we have also established a collaboration to explore quantum computing in conjunction with classical machine learning to more accurately predict clinical trial sites at risk of recruitment failure.&nbsp;Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging and transformative technology that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to solve industry critical problems too complex for classical computers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In our hundreds of generative AI engagements with clients around the world, enterprises are trying to balance massive value creation with risk mitigation—and they face a shortage of the necessary “AI for business” skills. Half of CEOs report they are already integrating generative AI into products and services, and 43% say they are using generative AI to inform strategic decisions, according to a recent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/c-suite-study/ceo">IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) CEO study</a>. Yet more than half of CEOs are concerned about the security of data, and 48% worry about bias or data accuracy.</p>



<p>Business leaders are seeking a trusted partner who:</p>



 
 Understands the particular needs of the enterprise, with hands-on experience helping clients across industries scale AI and deliver real business value 



 Can deliver any AI model, on any cloud, anywhere—and brings a strong point of view about which platform, model and deployment option is best suited&nbsp;for their needs 



 Takes a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-ibm-consulting-brings-a-valuable-and-responsible-approach-to-ai/">human-centric, principled approach</a>—with clients and internally—putting <a href="https://www.ibm.com/policy/trust-principles/">principles for trust and transparency</a> at the heart of everything 
 



<p>Our clients also recognize the value of consultants with the inside track on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">IBM watsonx</a>, the enterprise-ready AI and data platform built to enable enterprises to scale and accelerate the impact of the most advanced AI with trusted data. While watsonx started rolling out in July, it has already transformed the fan experience for IBM clients including the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/masters-tournament-transformation/">Masters</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/enhancing-the-wimbledon-fan-experience-with-ai-from-watsonx/">Wimbledon</a>.</p>



<p>IBM Consulting’s watsonx practice brings expertise in the generative AI technology stack, as well as domain and industry experience that can help accelerate clients’ business transformations. In the same way that we established our successful Hybrid Cloud services business built on the Red Hat® OpenShift® platform, IBM Consulting intends to be the leading consulting services provider for watsonx.</p>



 Solving business problems with watsonx 



<p>IBM has identified three of the most high-impact use cases for generative AI that really matter for business in this moment—talent, customer service and application modernization—and we’re already at work helping clients get results with watsonx.</p>



 AI for HR and talent 



<p>HR leaders are facing enormous challenges, from the global skills gap to labor shortages to evolving employee expectations of their employers. They’re seeing the potential of AI to help dramatically across the HR lifecycle—recruiting, retaining and developing the skills and talent every organization needs to effectively compete in the new AI era. 41% of executives report their organization is already using generative AI in HR, according to recent IBM IBV research*. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Consulting brings together deep HR, industry and technology expertise with our AI for business solutions, Watson Orchestrate and watsonx, and an open ecosystem of partners. Watson Orchestrate can help automate and enhance the acquisition lifecycle from a single user interface that integrates with applications across our partner ecosystem. Watsonx amplifies the impact of AI throughout HR workflows, while ensuring responsible AI use to meet the highest ethical, privacy and regulatory requirements. And IBM is already applying this approach <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ibm-human-resources-watson-orchestrate">internally with IBM HR</a>.</p>



 AI for customer service 



<p>The business leaders who manage sales, customer service and marketing need to meet increasingly high customer expectations for personalized and engaging experiences. Many leaders are starting to recognize that everywhere you have AI, you should combine it with an amazing experience—and everywhere you have experiences, you need to power and personalize them with AI. A recent study by Stanford and MIT Sloane found that access to AI increased customer service agent productivity, particularly among agents with the least experience and skills.</p>



<p>IBM Consulting specializes in end-to-end service transformations for customer and field service operations. Leveraging watsonx.ai, we train and fine-tune foundation models using company and customer-specific data, providing AI-driven insights for timely customer engagement and guided advice. With Watson Assistant, Watson Orchestrate, and Discovery, organizations can efficiently handle customer queries, integrate with call center technology, and adapt to preferred platforms. A 2023 Forrester Consulting Total Economic Impact™ <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/subscribe?formid=urx-43183">study</a>, commissioned by IBM, showed an ROI of 370% over three years with IBM Watson Assistant<a>.</a> IBM Consulting is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/transforming-customer-service-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-game/">already at work</a> with clients such as Bouygues Telecom, which has been working with IBM Consulting to transform its call center operations with enterprise-ready generative AI capabilities.</p>



 AI for application modernization 



<p>CIOs and CTOs are looking across an incredibly complex IT landscape, with technical debt and aging applications, siloed skills, high cost of cloud adoption, security concerns and more. Our clients are keen to tap AI to build or refactor applications, cope with skills gaps and reduce mundane, tedious tasks so staff members and teams can work more efficiently. AI can help address these challenges, improve productivity and scale quickly with decreased costs via code conversion, code generation, transformation planning and knowledge management.</p>



<p>IBM Consulting has a history of co-creating hybrid cloud strategies, fueling a deep understanding of how to modernize applications on hybrid cloud, manage hybrid cloud journeys with reduced risk and predictable outcomes, and operate IT autonomously with the help of AI. With the Red Hat <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/engage/ansible-lightspeed">Ansible Lightspeed with IBM Watson Code Assistant</a> offering, business leaders can drive the adoption of consistent and accurate generative-AI-driven IT automation throughout their organization. Using the IBM watsonx.ai foundation models, Watson Code Assistant will boost developer efficiency by suggesting code based on natural language input, simplifying the development of hybrid cloud code for IT professionals and enabling those experienced in writing automation code to work even more efficiently.</p>



<p>IBM Consulting is proud to be the only consulting organization at scale inside a technology company, at a time when technology is key for all transformations. Our team is backed by the technical depth and cutting edge capabilities of IBM Software and IBM Research. We’re honored to help our clients seize this exciting moment and bring the full power of IBM’s enterprise-ready watsonx technology to bear on our clients’ most pressing business challenges.</p>

  <p>In addition to the rise in remote and telework, people are conducting more of their personal business online — everything from getting the news to seeing the doctor to paying taxes. This move is a part of what's driving organizations in all sectors to engage in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> initiatives.</p>

<p>In the public sector, agencies are using advancements in technology to modernize websites, replace legacy software, and offer new services that are more convenient and streamlined for constituents and employees alike.</p>

<p>Of course, any significant change comes with challenges, but shying away from digital transformation is becoming impossible in an increasingly digital world. Fortunately, with proper organization and the right tools and solutions, modern organizations and public sector employees can adapt to and thrive in an era of change. Here are six new digital concerns public service sectors will have to address to get there.</p>
	
 1. Onboarding challenges 
	
<p>With new technology, agencies can streamline onboarding processes for their employees as well as new constituents signing up for services. While these technologies can accelerate by creating efficiencies and saving money, they do present challenges. The main one is that many people may not be comfortable with "self-service" IT — and others may not want to provide a lot of personal information upfront.</p>

<p>It's important to provide onboarding processes that are easy for IT teams to implement and for people to navigate, and this is where organizations in private industries and public agencies intersect: they all need to deliver experiences that are simple and secure for consumers, without requiring IT teams to custom-build registration and login journeys. View this <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/experience-center/customer-onboarding">interactive tour</a> to see a simple onboarding experience, including "progressive profiling," which enables you to get to know your consumers and constituents over time.</p>

 2. Implementing security and compliance measures 
<p>As more and more of our data is stored online, there's been a dramatic increase in attacks designed to steal constituent and employee credentials as a way to infiltrate networks and steal data or hold it for ransom. To remain safe and compliant, public sector organizations must revamp their security measures to deal with digital attacks.</p>

<p>Digital security measures — including <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>, firewalls, cloud protections, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">zero trust</a> — have become essential for preventing infiltration by unauthorized and malicious users, including bots, while providing uncomplicated access for legitimate users. This is especially true for government agencies, healthcare providers, financial institutions, and others that deal with very sensitive data.</p>

<p>In addition to using new security measures, companies must be aware of new digital <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/security-compliance">security and compliance</a> regulations meant to protect consumer and employee data.</p>

 3. Employee accessibility concerns 
	
<p>With a nearly endless list of new security updates and digital tools, public sector employers may find it difficult to grant employees access to the tools they need to do their jobs in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>While passwords are the most common method for authenticating users, they are rife with risks. In fact, password- or credential-based attacks have been the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">leading cause of breaches</a>, year after year. The problem is that any time there is a "known" secret, it is at risk of being stolen, guessed, shared, or subject to social engineering attacks like phishing.</p>

<p>Public sector organizations should consider <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> for constituent users and employees alike. Passwordless methods are becoming more readily available to consumers and include the use of passkeys, biometrics (such as fingerprints and facial scans), push authenticator apps, and more. Even where there are legacy applications and infrastructure, such as databases and VPNs that will always require passwords, there are new techniques that allow a passwordless experience, so that passwords are never seen or entered by users. Passwordless authentication provides a streamlined experience for users while delivering vastly superior security.</p>
	
 4. Legacy infrastructure 
	
<p>Many agencies use legacy applications that cannot be moved to the cloud. At the same time, there are plenty of legacy apps that can't support modern security controls. But secure access to these apps, which often drive essential services, is paramount.</p>

<p>Agencies need modern technologies that can support their legacy apps and infrastructure as well as their SaaS apps and cloud-delivered services. Learn about <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">hybrid IAM solutions</a> that provide a consistent experience for users, no matter what type of app or infrastructure they're accessing. A hybrid solution also closes the security gaps created by disparate IAM systems that don't share data.</p>

 5. Adapting to changing technology 
	
<p>Technology is constantly changing in ways that are good and bad. New capabilities offer better services and more pleasant and convenient online experiences. But malicious actors are also getting better at exploiting vulnerabilities that can expose data and erode the public's trust. Therefore, agencies must continually upgrade and adapt to new technologies that are inviting to the public — and that block uninvited attacks.</p>

<p>A great tool for organizations connecting with the public is <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-ciam">customer identity and access management</a>, or CIAM. With CIAM, organizations can better manage citizen identities while providing enhanced security. Agencies can also use identity governance and threat protection, powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, to provide enterprise-grade security and compliance. These tools allow organizations to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">protect digital identities</a> and remain compliant with security and data privacy regulations.</p>
	
 6. Scalability issues 
	
<p>Government institutions may deal with scalability issues as their legacy systems and security controls are unable to match increasing traffic and demands on online services. Upgrading these systems is costly and time-consuming, as upgrades tend to be implemented slowly and judiciously to ensure they meet security requirements.</p>

<p>Scalability is an area that can be addressed by moving certain services to the cloud, which can elastically scale with spikes in traffic and usage. But a cloud migration can create disruption, which is unacceptable for agencies delivering essential citizen services.</p>

<p>A modern IAM platform <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">accelerates cloud migration</a> by enabling you to quickly add IAM experiences and security controls on top of your legacy systems. It co-exists with these existing solutions as you migrate, minimizing disruption, and allowing you to sunset costly and inadequate capabilities.</p>

 Why digital transformation is necessary in the public sector 
	
<p>Digital transformation can streamline the production of new services, decrease wait times, reduce costs, and improve efficiency and accuracy. Although public sector organizations will see immediate benefits from upgraded software and new security systems, the steps they need to take to achieve these benefits may seem daunting — at least initially. Government agencies need to address the pressing issues of onboarding concerns, security issues, employee accessibility problems, and issues with infrastructure to take full advantage of new technology.</p>

<p>Still, legacy systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks, which could disrupt the lives of constituents who must entrust their personal information with their local, state, and national government agencies. As a result, finding a solution to these new digital concerns should be a priority for institutions and organizations within the public sector. With the appropriate tools in hand, organizations will be equipped to overcome challenges that arise on their digital transformation journeys.</p>

<p>In a bid to reduce the risks associated with gambling activities, national governments and regulatory bodies establish rules to govern different aspects of the sector.</p>



<p>Complying with gambling regulation is a never-ending challenge, especially for multi-jurisdictional operators, as they need to keep abreast of developments in the industry, and the launch of new markets and ‘games of chance’.&nbsp;</p>



 What is gambling compliance? 



<p>Gambling compliance refers to the adherence of gambling operators and gambling-related entities to the laws, regulations, and guidelines set forth by relevant authorities and governments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It ensures all aspects of gambling activities, such as financial transactions, advertising practices, and player protection measures, conform to the legal requirements of a particular country to promote fair and responsible gambling practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, gambling compliance requires ongoing due diligence, collaboration with regulatory bodies, and investment in resources to navigate the complexities of the regulatory landscape while upholding the highest standards of legality and player protection. Unsurprisingly, gambling compliance has become a significant risk management area and a necessary challenge for the gambling industry to meet.&nbsp;</p>



 Why is gambling compliance important?&nbsp; 



<p>Gambling compliance is important because it enables gambling operators to:&nbsp;</p>



  Maintain legal standing<br>  Protect players and prevent problem gambling<br>  Build a strong reputation, prevent financial and legal risks, and contribute to the responsible growth and integrity of the gambling industry.&nbsp;  



 Gambling regulations and licensing. 



<p>The goal of gambling regulation is simple: to create a <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/regulation/playing-by-the-rules-why-regulators-regulate/">sustainable</a> industry. In essence, sustainability is at the heart of gambling regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main goal of regulatory bodies is to ensure all gambling operations are conducted fairly and safely. They should prevent consumers from engaging in fraudulent activities like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse</a>, impede problem gambling, and encourage responsible gambling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling operators are required to follow the regulations and rules as laid out by regulatory bodies, such as licensing requirements, age restrictions, and affordability checks. Through such efforts, regulatory bodies maintain integrity in the industry, protecting operators and consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulatory bodies issue (and revoke) licenses to operators that comply (or fail to comply) with the stipulated requirements and rules. Below are some general licensing requirements for gambling operators:&nbsp;</p>



  A copy of the operator’s passport, proof of address, a criminal history check, and a reference from their bank<br>  Ensuring that their software is in line with jurisdiction requirements. Preparing a list including details of software functionality and games, agreements with software developers, and certification of the Random Number Generator (RNG) employed<br>  Determining whether their platform carries the information required by their regulator. Many jurisdictions seek information regarding responsible gambling, terms, and conditions, withdrawal policy, self-exclusion, etc&nbsp;  



<p>Every country has varying rules as far as gambling regulation is concerned. For instance, in regions such as the UK, gambling is heavily regulated by the government and non-governmental organizations, like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">United Kingdom Gambling Commision</a> (UKGC), to ensure safety and fairness.</p>



<p>Gambling regulations are constantly being updated to reflect changes in the industry. For example, in April 2023, after much frustration and numerous delays, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK’s Gambling Act White Paper&nbsp;</a>was finally released. The white paper, which contains proposed changes to the UK’s Gambling Act 2005, aims to more accurately reflect gambling in the digital age, by addressing issues related to VIP customers, slot limits, financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks), and other facets of the UK’s gambling sector. </p>



<p>Read more about the UKGC’s three-year plan to implement changes to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">UK’s gambling regulations</a> here.</p>



<p>Each country has their own approach to gambling compliance. In cases like Canada, even some cities have their own approach. Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">‘How to become compliant in Ontario’s iGaming market.’</a> Meanwhile, in Brazil, regulators are taking gradual steps toward implementing a regulatory regime, making sophisticated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/">KYC checks in South America</a> necessary moving forward.</p>

 The importance of AML compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>AML compliance is crucial in the iGaming industry as it helps prevent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and ensures that the industry operates fairly. Adhering to AML regulations, operators can safeguard their reputations and avoid legal consequences. AML compliance for operators also helps maintain a safe environment for players, which is essential for users to build loyalty and trust in the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money laundering is often used to conceal illegally sourced funds. Without proper regulations in place, criminals could take advantage of various loopholes and exploit online gambling platforms for their own benefit. AML compliance helps protect operators from money laundering by ensuring they adhere to all necessary laws, regulations, and policies. Below are some of common stipulations seen across different regions:&nbsp;</p>



  Conduct continual risk assessments and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/customer-due-diligence/">customer due diligence measures</a><br>  Train staff and employees on AML regulations and best practices<br>  Carry out regular independent tests to ensure the effectiveness of the operator’s programs<br>  Ensure all the necessary compliance resources are present<br>  Put systems in place to detect unusual activity and track transactions<br>  Implement new technologies for security enhancement, e.g machine learning and artificial intelligence&nbsp;<br>  Keep up to date with the latest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML laws and regulations</a>&nbsp;  



 How KYC requirements ensure gambling compliance.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> procedures are crucial to gambling compliance when acquiring a license as an operator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such requirements usually include verifying a customer’s name, place of residence, and date of birth, generally verified via the submission of an official document (passport or driving license) and proof of address (bank statement or utility bill). Such documents must be authorized during onboarding or before customers can deposit any funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In most jurisdictions, operators must carry out KYC procedures as part of their local AML regulations. The requirements for operators vary depending on the jurisdiction but usually signify the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Authorizing the source of funds<br>  Authorizing customer identities<br>  Understanding customer relationships<br>  Tracking transactions<br>  Developing risk profiles<br>  Identifying and reporting unusual transactions when applicable<br>  Developing solid AML programs  



 Sustainability, player protection, and the vital role of KYC.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">Responsible gambling</a> is crucial to the long-term sustainability of the iGaming industry. Consequently, gambling operators are required to verify the identity and activities of their customers to prevent fraud, problem gambling, underage gambling, and other negative gambling-related consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, procedures like KYC are crucial as far as responsible gambling is concerned, as they protect vulnerable players and minors, as well as the operator, from fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling operators can also offer customers tools to practice responsible gambling, such as self-exclusion programs.&nbsp;</p>

 How data protection compliance shields player data.&nbsp; 



<p>The iGaming industry handles large quantities of private user data, making it a primary target for identity theft and data breaches. Keeping customer safety and privacy at the forefront, operators are required by regulatory bodies to comply with data protection laws. Compliance regulations ensure that customer privacy requests are entertained by operators, who are also responsible for taking measures to <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/compliance/taking-cover-how-to-handle-bettors-sensitive-data/">safeguard</a> private user data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encryption, multi-factor authentication, and robust access controls to protect user data and guarantee its integrity is crucial for operators.&nbsp;</p>



 Responsible advertising and gambling compliance. &nbsp; 



<p>According to regulatory bodies such as the UK Gambling Commission, the advertising of gambling products must be <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/advertising-marketing-rules-and-regulations">undertaken</a> responsibly and comply with the relevant advertising codes. The Codes ensure that gambling advertisements do not encourage gambling behavior deemed socially irresponsible that could result in social, financial, or emotional harm. Advertising gambling to minors is also strictly prohibited and has serious repercussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must comply with relevant laws to promote responsible gambling and safeguard vulnerable individuals. Preventing harmful gambling ads, especially to minors and vulnerable individuals, is essential for operators regarding gambling compliance.&nbsp;</p>



 The importance of regular audits in ethical iGaming operations.&nbsp; 



<p>Frequent compliance audits are crucial for operators to run operations within ethical and legal boundaries. Such audits help determine potential risks and prevent violations, meanwhile avoiding legal disputes and maintaining reputation. Prioritizing compliance and conducting regular audits must be a standard procedure for operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Independent audits must audit operators’ compliance programs to determine their efficiency and avoid regulatory fines. These help operators and businesses determine their AML failures and deal with them before formal regulatory inspections get underway. This way, operators can avoid high regulatory fines as well as other serious consequences.&nbsp;</p>



 Legal challenges in cross-border online gambling.&nbsp; 



<p>Numerous legal challenges are associated with cross-border online gambling, including issues pertaining to regulation, taxation, and licensing. In many instances, operators are required to obtain licenses from multiple jurisdictions, each with varying regulations and requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Different jurisdictions have different taxation laws, making it challenging for operators to comply with all of them. There are also concerns regarding the security of online gambling, most particularly where protecting customer information and fraud are concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Creating a culture of responsible gambling. 



<p>To comply with regulatory requirements and satisfy customers, operators must offer quality customer service and always facilitate a safe environment for customers. In this case, compliance training is crucial as it ensures all employees know how to act when dealing with customers with gambling addiction or other gambling-related issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building a strong culture of compliance is crucial for numerous reasons, including avoiding potential regulatory violations, criminal charges, increasing investor/public confidence, and averting the loss of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/do-i-need-an-online-gaming-license/">gambling license</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To ensure legal gambling practices, operators must monitor employee activities and conduct regular audits. Properly introducing compliance policies via employee training and written materials is vital, and enforcement must be fair and consistent to facilitate a culture of compliance and protect against reputational and legal risks.&nbsp;</p>



 The technological revolution in gambling compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>Technology plays a vital role in gambling <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulatory-compliance/">compliance</a>. It has become crucial for operators to implement technological solutions to guarantee compliance with regulations and mitigate fraudulent activities. Such tools include age ID verification and age verification systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The application of artificial intelligence has revolutionized KYC compliance within the gambling industry, ensuring more effective processes. AI-powered verification ensures accurate yet efficient verification, and advanced facial recognition offers reliable ID verification. AI applications not only enhance compliance with KYC regulations but also enhance user experience, operational efficiency, and the overall integrity of the operator and industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gambling industry’s regulatory landscape presents various challenges for operators, such as complying with regulations in different jurisdictions, staying updated with constantly evolving laws, and ensuring customers a safe and fair gambling experience. Operators must address such challenges head-on by staying informed and embracing new technological advancements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increasing use of artificial intelligence and data analytics and the growing vitality of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">responsible gambling</a> measures are all new trends constantly shaping the future of gambling compliance.&nbsp;</p>



 Betting on gambling compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>Gambling compliance is essential, as it not only ensures the protection of customers, while offering them fair chances of winning, but it also helps maintain the integrity and sustainability of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposals set forth by the newly released UK Gambling White Paper signify that the importance of gambling compliance has only gained more importance, especially concerning new regulatory frameworks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When was the last time you looked over existing access policies in your cloud account? It’s very likely that it is not on your regular tasks (yet), but it should be done regularly to improve security.</p>



<p>In IBM Cloud, access policies define who receives which set of privileges granted on what resource. When a policy is evaluated and then applied to allow access, “last-permit” data is updated. You can utilize that data to identify unused or inactive access policies.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we provide an overview of existing IBM Cloud access policy types. Then, we show you how to retrieve information on inactive access policies and discuss how to act on that data. This will demonstrate how to clean up unused policies to enhance security for your IBM Cloud environment:</p>



Details of an access policy of an IBM Cloud IAM access group.



 Overview: Access policies 



<p>In IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM), <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-access-management-overview#access-policies-concept">access policies</a> specify what access is granted to whom for which resources. In general, there exist two types of policies, access and authorization:</p>



 
 The authorization type is used to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceauth">grant a service access to another service</a>. An example policy could be to allow a storage or database service (instance) to read an encryption key from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/key-protect">IBM Key Protect for IBM Cloud</a>. 



 The access type helps determine resource access for either all the identities as members of an access group or for individual IAM identities (e.g., a user, service ID or trusted profile). A typical policy would grant an access group reader and writer role for a specific storage bucket of an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage">IBM Cloud Object Storage</a> instance. Another example would be to grant an individual user the administrator privilege for user management in the account. 
 



<p>Policies can be scoped very narrowly—this means that only selective privileges on a specific resource are granted. More generic policies grant access to all instances of the same service type or to all resources in a resource group or region. Policies could even include <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iam-time-based">time-based restrictions</a>. I discussed them in my recent blog post, “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/for-a-short-time-only-time-based-restrictions-for-enhanced-cloud-security/">For a short time only: Time-based restrictions for enhanced cloud security</a>.”</p>



<p>The screenshot above shows the IBM Cloud console when editing the details of an access policy for an access group. It grants Viewer and Reader privileges on all identity- and access-enabled services in that resource group “cloudsec-workshop.” Moreover, access is restricted to the shown time range. A JSON representation for the access policy is available in the console. The screenshot below shows the partial JSON object for the discussed sample policy:</p>



Partial JSON object for an IBM Cloud IAM access policy.



 Identify unused access policies 



<p>As described, access policies define the privileges on resources for the members of an access group, for individual IAM identities or for services. When resource access is requested, the policies are evaluated and either no access is granted or a policy is found that permits access. In IBM Cloud, that usage of an access policy is recorded with both the timestamp as <code>last_permit_at</code> and a counter <code>last_permit_frequency</code>.</p>



<p>You can use that information to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iam-audit-policies">audit access policies</a> and identify inactive policies. The IBM Cloud console <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/inactive-policies">lists policies that have been inactive for 30 days and longer</a>. It does not show entirely unused policies.</p>



<p>An alternative to the IBM Cloud console is the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-policy-management">IAM Policy Management API</a>. It allows you to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-policy-management#list-v2-policies">retrieve all policies</a> and include the “last-permit” attributes into the result sets when setting the format parameter to <code>include_last_permit</code>. We built a small Python tool to simplify interaction with that API and support some filtering and data output as JSON or CSV data. The tool is available in the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/data-henrik/ibmcloud-iam-keys-identities">ibmcloud-iam-keys-identities</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/data-henrik/ibmcloud-iam-keys-identities/blob/main/README.md">README</a> file for how to retrieve the policy data.</p>



<p>The following shows tool output in JSON format for an infrequently used and inactive access policy. It belongs to an IAM access group (subject) and grants Viewer permissions on a specific resource group in an IBM Cloud account:</p>



Inactive IAM access policy for an access group.



 Manage inactive policies 



<p>Once you have the list of policies, the question is how to manage them. In general, you should check on their type (access or authorization) and the type and role of privilege granted. Is the privilege on a specific service instance or very broad (e.g., on a resource group or all instances of a service)? Is it a role granting minimal access or broad, like Manager or Administrator?</p>



<p>Following the principle of least privilege, it might be time to adjust and cut down on granted privileges. It is also a good time to check if all policies have a great description. Descriptions are optional but should be used as a best practice to ease administration and improve security. Be aware of service-to-service authorizations that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/share-resources-across-your-ibm-cloud-accounts/">grant cross-account access for resource sharing</a> and policies involving trusted profiles:</p>



 
 Recently used policies: You probably want to keep them because these policies should have been created for a reason and they are in use. However, you might want to check if they were defined with too broad privileges. 



 Policies inactive for 30 days and longer: You should investigate for what the policies are in place for. Maybe they are used for infrequent tasks? If not done already, you might want to consider restricting the policies with <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iam-time-based">time-based restrictions</a>. Thus, they can only be used during the assigned time window. Something to also check is whether the policy is restricted to past dates. 



 Policies that have never been used: These need to be investigated. Who created them and for what purpose? Why were they never used? There could be good and bad reasons. 
 



<p>To improve security, you should delete those policies that no longer are needed. Depending on how you analysed details for a policy—in the IBM Cloud console, or with the CLI or API—you want to continue in the same environment and delete obsolete policies. Although you can retrieve all policies with a single API call or list the inactive ones in a single list in the console, removal depends on the policy type and the subject. Each has its own command in the console and CLI.</p>



 Conclusions 



<p>Access policies define who receives which set of privileges granted on what resource. They exist in different flavors for access groups, IAM identities and service-to-service authorizations. If access policies become stale and are no longer needed, they pose a security risk and should be removed. The goal is to operate with the least set of privileges.</p>



<p>IBM Cloud offers functionality to identify inactive or unused access policies. We discussed how such policies can be identified and how to handle them. So, when was the last time you analysed your IBM Cloud account for inactive identities?</p>

<p>The demand for skilled healthcare professionals is increasing. However, the number of biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs)—the professionals who manage, repair and maintain the medical equipment—is shrinking.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://24x7mag.com/management/overcoming-biomed-tech-shortage/">2020 survey</a>, 40% of the BMET workforce is age 55 and older, with nearly 1 in 4 BMETs over the age of 60 and approaching retirement. What’s more, dozens of BMET education/certification programs have shuttered in recent years, leaving nearly <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/examining-potential-crisis-shortage-biomedical-technicians-gary-nop">20 states with no accredited BMET programs</a> to funnel new graduates into the workforce.</p>



<p>The shortage of these essential healthcare workers is having a significant impact on the industry, leaving its mark on everything from patient care to operational costs. Given the propulsive state of innovation in biomedical technology, the healthcare industry will need a sizable workforce of knowledgeable technicians to keep pace. A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-cmms">computerized maintenance management system (CMMS)</a> can help hospitals and other medical facilities bridge the asset management gap while the industry waits for the workforce to catch up.</p>



 Understanding the role of biomedical technicians 



<p>Without biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs), sophisticated medical devices like MRI machines, defibrillators, patient monitors and ventilators, among others, would fall into disrepair, potentially jeopardizing patient outcomes. If diagnostic machines and treatment equipment are out of order due to a lack of maintenance or repair, patients may face significant delays in receiving crucial services. This could mean a diagnostic result takes longer to process or a critical surgery is postponed, both of which can have negative consequences for patients.</p>



<p>Furthermore, when equipment is not properly maintained, it’s more likely to break down or require replacement, which can be costly for medical facilities already running on tight budgets. And without sufficient BMETs, hospitals may need to rely on outside service contracts for maintenance and repair, which can be prohibitively expensive. CMMSs can help organizations mitigate the impact of shortages by streamlining and automating key maintenance processes.</p>



 What is a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) and how can it help? 



<p>A computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) is a type of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/facilities-management">facility management</a> software that maintains a comprehensive database of information about an organization’s maintenance operations, helping maintenance workers do their jobs more efficiently and enabling managers to make smarter decisions.</p>



<p>A high-quality CMMS will help healthcare organizations plan, create, track and organize service requests, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/work-order">work orders</a> and routine maintenance automatically, eliminating excessive task planning duties for limited BMET staff. CMMS platforms with accompanying software for mobile devices push access a step further, allowing users to track work orders and access maintenance activities remotely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CMMS systems can help medical facilities do the following:&nbsp;</p>



 1. Improve operational efficiency 



<p>A CMMS is designed to automate many of the manual tasks (e.g., work order management, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-preventive-maintenance">preventive maintenance</a> scheduling, inventory management, workflow tracking, etc.) that can monopolize technicians’ time. Automating these often-tedious processes helps healthcare maintenance teams keep medical equipment in top shape so that medical staff has the equipment it needs when it needs it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CMMS solutions also help maintenance teams prioritize tasks based on importance and time sensitivity, ensuring that the most critical tasks are completed first. When maintenance can effectively prioritize tasks, healthcare facilities can avoid equipment failures and downtime that negatively impact patient care.</p>



 2. Provide opportunities for employee training and knowledge sharing 



<p>As BMET availability shrinks, hospitals will need to find ways to work smarter (not harder). Modern CMMSs can include features that support training and knowledge sharing among technicians so that every member of the team is optimizing their talents. For instance, healthcare CMMS software can store manuals, how-to guides and troubleshooting documentation, helping less experienced technicians learn the basics faster and experienced technicians take on more complex tasks.</p>



 3. Monitor equipment and run diagnostics remotely 



<p>Many advanced CMMS systems offer remote monitoring capabilities, allowing technicians to collect real-time data, monitor equipment performance and diagnose issues without being physically present. This feature is particularly valuable when there’s a shortage of on-site technicians. Remote monitoring enables technicians to address problems promptly and from anywhere with mobile access to CMMS platforms, reducing the need for multiple site visits and optimizing their time and resources.</p>



 4. Optimize workforce scheduling 



<p>Computerized maintenance management software can facilitate optimized workforce scheduling, integrating factors like technician availability, skillsets and workload. By efficiently assigning tasks and routes, CMMS helps ensure that technicians are utilized effectively and that critical equipment maintenance and repairs are completed in a timely manner.</p>



 5. Coordinate suppliers and vendors 



<p>CMMS software streamlines communication with suppliers and vendors, helping BMETs track maintenance contracts, warranty information and service agreements. Supplier coordination features also ensure that facilities have the support they need and can leverage external expertise efficiently.</p>



 6. Implement asset lifecycle management 



<p>CMMS provides a comprehensive view of the entire lifecycle of medical assets, including equipment procurement, installation, maintenance and retirement. By tracking asset history, maintenance activities and performance data, CMMS enables smart decision-making about critical assets. Leveraging a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/asset-lifecycle-management-strategy/">strategic approach to asset maintenance</a> can help facilities optimize how they use equipment and reduce excessive technician workload.</p>



 7. Analyze and report data 



<p>A CMMS platform can gather and analyze data on equipment performance, maintenance costs and technician productivity. An advanced CMMS takes it a step further by aggregating and displaying medical asset data according to a department’s specific needs.</p>



<p>Teams can build and view customizable reports, visualize trend data and monitor asset functionality to make troubleshooting and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/inventory-management">inventory management</a> simpler. This information helps managers identify inefficiencies, improve processes and make staffing decisions with shortages in mind.</p>



 8. Maximize equipment uptime 



<p>In healthcare, functioning high-tech equipment can make a real difference in patient health outcomes, so maximizing asset uptime is crucial, especially when working with smaller technician cohorts. CMMS software allows BMET teams to implement <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-maintenance">predictive maintenance</a> programs and track preventive maintenance tasks, shifting facilities from reactive to proactive maintenance strategies and minimizing asset breakdowns.</p>



 9. Maintain regulatory compliance 



<p>Healthcare assets have to comply with a range of stringent regulatory standards. A CMMS can help keep facilities compliant by offering comprehensive asset tracking and maintaining thorough records of inspections, maintenance tasks and repairs. These features—along with mobile apps that can send technicians real-time asset status notifications—help medical organizations easily provide documentation during audits so they can continue to serve patients in need.</p>



 Use IBM Maximo Application Suite to streamline your facility 



<p>The healthcare industry is increasingly reliant on progressive technologies to provide high-quality patient care, and biomedical equipment technicians (BMET) are integral to ensuring that this technology is operational and well-maintained. The shortage we’re witnessing—and will likely continue to witness—presents a serious challenge that requires a strategic, multi-pronged response.</p>



<p>While a CMMS can’t solve all the problems a BMET shortage creates, it can significantly reduce their impact. Advanced software solutions like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo">IBM Maximo Application Suite</a> can help your facility effectively leverage existing technician staff, extend the lifespan of equipment and ensure the highest possible levels of equipment reliability and patient safety.</p>



<p>IBM Maximo is a high-tech, user-friendly software solution that helps healthcare organizations improve asset performance and streamline day-to-day operations.

<p>Data democratization, much like the term <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> five years ago, has become a popular buzzword throughout organizations, from IT departments to the C-suite. It’s often described as a way to simply increase data access, but the transition is about far more than that. When effectively implemented, a data democracy simplifies the data stack, eliminates data gatekeepers, and makes the company’s comprehensive data platform easily accessible by different teams via a user-friendly dashboard.</p>



<p>Beyond the technical aspects, the goals are far loftier. When done well, data democratization empowers employees with tools that let everyone work with data, not just the data scientists. It can spark employees’ curiosity and spur innovation. When workers get their hands on the right data, it not only gives them what they need to solve problems, but also prompts them to ask, “What else can I do with data?” through a truly data literate organization.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of data democratization and how companies can overcome the challenges of transitioning to this new approach to data.</p>



 What is data democratization? 



<p>Data democratization helps companies make <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/the-data-differentiator">data-driven</a> decisions by creating systems and adopting tools that allow anyone in the organization, regardless of their technical background, to access, use and talk about the data they need with ease. Instead of seeing data given with consent as the output of workers clients and prospects, it’s now the company’s gateway to strategic decision-making.</p>



<p>For true data democratization, both employees and consumers need to have data in an easy-to-use format to maximize its value. It also requires <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/the-data-differentiator/data-literacy">data literacy</a> throughout the organization. Employees and leaders need to trust the data is accurate, know how to access it, as well as how it could be applied to business problems. In turn, they both must also have the data literacy skills to be able to verify the data’s accuracy, ensure its security, and provide or follow guidance on when and how it should be used.</p>



<p>Data democratization is often conflated with data transparency, which refers to processes that help ensure data accuracy and easy access to data regardless of its location or the application that created it. Data democratization instead refers to the simplification of all processes related to data, from storage architecture to data management to data security. It also requires an organization-wide data governance approach, from adopting new types of employee training to creating new policies for data storage.</p>



 Architecture for data democratization 



<p>Data democratization requires a move away from traditional “data at rest” architecture, which is meant for storing static data. Traditionally, data was seen as information to be put on reserve, only called upon during customer interactions or executing a program. Today, the way businesses use data is much more fluid; data literate employees use data across hundreds of apps, analyze data for better decision-making, and access data from numerous locations.</p>



<p>Data democratization uses a fit-for-purpose <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-architecture">data architecture</a> that is designed for the way today’s businesses operate, in real-time. It’s distributed both in the cloud and on-premises, allowing extensive use and movement across clouds, apps and networks, as well as stores of data at rest. An architecture designed for data democratization aims to be flexible, integrated, agile and secure to enable the use of data and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) at scale. Here are some examples of the types of architectures well suited for data democratization.</p>



 Data fabric 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-fabric">Data fabric</a> architectures are designed to connect data platforms with the applications where users interact with information for simplified data access in an organization and self-service data consumption. By leveraging data services and APIs, a data fabric can also pull together data from legacy systems, data lakes, data warehouses and SQL databases, providing a holistic view into business performance.</p>



<p>Data within a data fabric is defined using metadata and may be stored in a data lake, a low-cost storage environment that houses large stores of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data for business analytics, machine learning and other broad applications.</p>



 Data mesh 



<p>Another approach to data democratization uses a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-mesh">data mesh</a>, a decentralized architecture that organizes data by a specific business domain. It uses knowledge graphs, semantics and AI/ML technology to discover patterns in various types of metadata. Then, it applies these insights to automate and orchestrate the data lifecycle. Instead of handling extract, transform and load (ETL) operations within a data lake, a data mesh defines the data as a product in multiple repositories, each given its own domain for managing its data pipeline.</p>



<p>Like microservices architecture where lightweight services are coupled together, a data mesh uses functional domains to set parameters around the data. This lets users across the organization treat the data like a product with widespread access. For example, marketing, sales and customer service teams would have their own domains, providing more ownership to the producers of a given dataset, while still allowing for sharing across different teams.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/augmented-data-management-data-fabric-versus-data-mesh/">Data fabric and data mesh</a> architectures are not mutually exclusive; they can even be used to complement each other. For example, a data fabric can make the data mesh stronger because it can automate key processes, such as creating data products faster, enforcing global governance, and making it easier to orchestrate the combination of multiple data products.</p>

 Key considerations for data democratization 



<p>As more organizations seek to evolve toward a culture of data democratization and build the architecture to support a data literate culture, they’ll realize several benefits—and encounter a few challenges along the way. Here are some advantages—and potential risk—to consider during this organizational change:</p>



 Productivity 



<p>Many companies look to data democratization to eliminate silos and get more out of their data across departments. The necessary data integration it requires reduces data bottlenecks, enabling business users to make faster business decisions and freeing up technical users to prioritize tasks that better utilize their skillsets. The result is greater efficiency and productivity.</p>



 Security 



<p>Data security is a high priority. Data democratization inherently helps companies improve data security processes by requiring deliberate and constant attention to data governance and data integrity. There is a thoughtful focus on oversight and getting the right data in the hands of the right people resulting in a more comprehensive data security strategy.</p>



 Risk of data swamps 



<p>A data swamp is the result of a poorly managed data lake that lacks appropriate data quality and data governance practices to provide insightful learnings, rendering the data useless. Too many businesses struggle with poor data quality; data democratization aims to tackle this problem with comprehensive oversight and data governance. By recognizing data as a product, it creates greater incentive to properly manage data.</p>



 Agile data use 



<p>Data democratization counteracts the problem of data gravity, or the idea that data becomes more difficult to move as it grows in size. Things like massive stores of customer data are approached more strategically, allowing companies to maintain access as the company scales.</p>



 User-friendly tools 



<p>Data democratization seeks to make data more accessible to non-technical users, in part, by making the tools that access the data easier to use. This includes tools that do not require advanced technical skill or deep understanding of data analytics to use.</p>



 How to get started with data democratization 



<p>As with any major change in business operations, companies should develop a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/the-data-differentiator/data-strategy">comprehensive data strategy </a>to reach their data democratization goals. Key steps include:</p>



 
 Define business and data objectives–What are your company’s goals? What are your data and AI objectives? The alignment of data and business goals is essential for data democratization. By tapping the expertise of stakeholders, you can ensure your objectives are inclusive and realistic. 



 Perform a data audit–How is data managed today? Examine what’s working, what is not and identify bottlenecks and areas where better tools and increased access are needed. Understanding the current status of your data management helps you understand what changes the organization needs to make. 



 Map a data framework–When you achieve full data democratization, what will that look like? Design a path toward that goal, defining where application modernization, data analysis, automation and AI can help get you there. 



 Establish controls–This is where you lean on data allies to help with compliance across the organization. How will data standards and process be communicated and enforced? Use this step to create and implement data governance policies. 



 Integrate your data–It’s common for organizations to suffer from a lack of visibility between departments. Implementing data democratization means breaking down these siloes and designing a way to effectively integrate processes in a way that encourages adoption. 



 Train and empower employees–Successful implementation of data democratization requires employees to have the right level of data literacy to access and use the data effectively. Look to data leaders to drive adoption and make data literacy part of the new hiring process. Train employees on how data democratization can improve their work outcomes and improve customer experience. 
 



 Use data democratization to scale AI 



<p>Once your data democratization journey has begun, teams can begin to look at what this new data paradigm can bring, including advancing new tools like AI and machine learning. Here are some ways companies can use data democratization to enable wider AI implementation:</p>



 Define AI use cases 



<p>Discuss business analytics and automation priorities and decide where to implement AI first. For example, you may want to invest in analytics tools to develop internal business intelligence reports, real-time customer service chatbots and self-service analytics for different business teams. It’s likely you can’t manage implementing these AI tools all at once, so define the best areas to use AI first.</p>



 Identify data sets 



<p>Not all data within your company is right for AI, or use cases for that matter. Examine your data sets and determine which ones are right for further research to see if they will help you tackle relevant use cases. With data democratization in place, your company should have greater insights into the quality and availability of data to drive this process, and the ROI for each use case.</p>



 Use MLOps for scalability 



<p>The development of machine learning (ML) models is notoriously error-prone and time-consuming. MLOps creates a process where it’s easier to cull insights from business data. It also optimizes the process with machine learning operations (MLOps) which uses prebuilt ML models designed to automate the ML model-building process.</p>



 Make AI transparent 



<p>Data democratization ensures data collection, model building, deploying, managing and monitoring are visible. This results in more marketable AI-driven products and greater accountability.</p>



 IBM and data democratization 



<p>There are two key elements for data democratization: it starts with the right data architecture, but is amplified by the right automation and AI solutions. IBM offers a modern approach to designing and implementing a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/data-fabric">data fabric architecture</a> that helps organizations experience the benefits of data fabric in a unified platform that makes all data—spanning hybrid and multicloud environments—available for AI and data analytics.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">Watsonx</a> is a next generation data and AI platform built to help organizations multiply the power of AI for business. The platform comprises three powerful components: the watsonx.ai studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning; the watsonx.data fit-for-purpose store for the flexibility of a data lake and the performance of a data warehouse; plus, the watsonx.governance toolkit, to enable AI workflows that are built with responsibility, transparency and explainability.</p>



<p>Together, watsonx offers organizations the ability to:</p>



 
 Train, tune and deploy AI across your business with watsonx.ai 



 Scale AI workloads, for all your data, anywhere with watsonx.data

<p>As we move into the third quarter of 2023, we take a moment to reflect on our efforts in the ongoing mission of digital identity standardization and enhancement.</p><p> The majority of our daily interactions, both physical and digital, depend on the concept of identity, making it a critical area of focus. Yet, the absence of a native identity layer in the structure of the Internet demands careful coordination and collaboration.</p><p>To address this, SpruceID has been actively involved in various working groups of international standards bodies and foundations. We aim to contribute to open-source, interoperable solutions that will foster a user-centric, privacy-oriented internet applicable across diverse sectors. As part of this effort, we've been involved in developing key identity standards like the Verifiable Credentials 2.0 standard, the SD-JWT VC specification, and more.</p><p>The following are some key highlights of our work in the past quarter:</p><p>ISO Working Groups</p>  SpruceID is hosting the first fully remote ISO/IEC 18013:7 <a href="https://spruceid.com/iso-mdl-interop-event?ref=blog.spruceid.com">mDL interoperability test event</a> for online presentment in cooperation with AAMVA, Austroads, and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 members. The event is open for registrations until August 7th at 11:59 UTC and will take place over two weeks at the end of August. The results will inform the ISO/IEC 18013-7 specification process.  We contributed to the ISO/IEC TS 23220-3 mdoc issuance specification and demonstrated how OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) can be used to securely issuance mdocs, and helped to shape the OID4VP mdoc profile in ISO/IEC TS 203220-4.  <p>W3C Working Groups</p>  We continued our work in W3C as editors and contributors to the upcoming <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Credential Data Model (VCDM) 2.0</a> standard. The VCDM 2.0 will supersede VCDM 1.1 and will be accompanied by a series of other specifications, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Data Integrity</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jwt/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE</a>.  We started the horizontal review process of the VCDM 2.0 standard and created the first self-reviews on architecture, security, privacy, accessibility, and internationalization. In this course, we work with the W3C TAG (Technical Architecture Group), PING (Privacy and Security Interest Group), Internationalization Working Group, and Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group.  We continued to be engaged in the RDF-related working groups in W3C. Finally, we helped transition the proposed W3C Verifiable Credentials Confidence Method vocabulary to W3C CCG.  <p>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</p>  We are spearheading the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-terbu-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SD-JWT VC</a> specification in IETF that describes using Selective Disclosure JWTs (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SD-JWT</a>) to secure JSON-based Verifiable Credentials here. The High-Assurance Profile in the <a href="https://openid.net/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID Foundation (OIDF)</a> selected this SD-JWT VC as their preferred credential format. It is also under consideration by the eIDAS 2.0 <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/architecture-and-reference-framework?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Architecture Reference Framework (ARF)</a>. The specification will also be presented at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/117/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IETF 117</a> before the OAuth2 Working Group.  We are also closely following the development of the SCITT working group in IETF.  <p>OpenID Foundation Working Groups</p>  We continued contributing to the <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC)</a> series as editors of the specifications and as contributors. Amongst others, OID4VC includes <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP)</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI)</a>.  We also helped set up a new working group in the OIDF on Digital Credentials Protocols.  <p>OpenWallet Foundation (OWF)</p>  We continued our engagement in several OWF working or interest groups, such as on Architecture, OID4VC, and credential comparisons.  <p>Web3 Standards</p>  We worked with wallet vendors to address their feedback on EIP-4361 so the specification gives better guidance on how domain binding has to be implemented. The updates are already published in the Ethereum EIP repository.  We contributed to the UCAN working group regarding consistency with timestamps, signature types, and header entry restrictions.  We also contributed to the CACAO (CAIP-196) working group regarding consistent timestamp representations and paths to supporting W3C WebAuthn for signature generation and verification.  Finally, we contributed a definition for did:pkh representations to the MultiDID specification in CASA.  <p>Additional Working Groups</p>  Together with other subject matter experts in the World Economic Forum (WEF) identity working group, we published a whitepaper on <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/reimagining-digital-id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Reimaging Digital Identity</a>.  <p>We fundamentally believe this work to champion global standards is core to the success of further adoption of digital identity, allowing for more secure and privacy-preserving yet seamless interactions that build digital trust across the web.</p><p>If you're interested in discussing or contributing to any of our work outlined above, please contact our team.</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.<br></p>

<p>It’s a rare thing at a tech conference to hear cheers when someone says the internet is down. But then, <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> is a rare sort of tech conference.</p>Photo by <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a><p>To be fair, we knew that our access to the internet was going to get turned off, and we knew it was only for a day. And it was supposed to be a fun experiment, an opportunity to test all the local-friendly technologies that participants had brought with them. But for most people in the world, this is not a game; it’s a hard reality that they face daily. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet?facet=entity&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org#interactive-charts-on-internet">Almost half of us</a> don’t have any access at all, and for many of those of us who do, access to high-speed internet is not easy, cheap, or reliable.</p><p>Some might argue that isn’t such a bad thing. I imagine those cheers came from a bittersweet awareness that the internet’s effect on society hasn’t all been rosy, a sentiment that’s echoed by <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90909279/gen-xers-and-older-millennials-really-just-want-to-go-back-in-time-to-before-the-internet-existed?ref=blog.holochain.org">most generation Xers and millennials</a> in the connected world. But I think it’s also true that networked digital information technologies can be a potent force for empowerment and justice. Economic and political powers are already wielding these tools to their advantage, and those whose security is threatened by those same powers can (and sometimes must) use the same tools if they want to survive.</p>Eric Bear describes the success of the Earth Defenders Toolkit in applying technology judiciously to the contexts of indigenous groups. Photo by <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a> An urgent call to step up <p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">Last year I learned</a> about the success of <a href="https://digital-democracy.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Digital Democracy</a> and <a href="https://ahau.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Āhau</a>, two groups building tools for indigenous people around the world to map the wealth in their ecosystems and cultures and use the collected data to preserve their sovereignty — even to the point of <a href="https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/community/mapping-waorani-ancestral-lands-in-ecuador/?ref=blog.holochain.org">winning cases in federal courts</a>.</p><p>This year, however, I heard fewer new success stories and more passionate calls for working tools. The message from activists and change-makers was clear and very loud: They need what we’re building, they need it to work, and they need it yesterday. We were confronted with stories from people working to support the <a href="https://rohingyaproject.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">survival of their people</a>, stories from people striving to <a href="https://www.shareable.net/uniting-tech-and-activism-how-dweb-camp-is-elevating-decentralized-technology/?ref=blog.holochain.org">preserve bodily autonomy and gender-affirming care</a>, stories from people trying to keep the lights on when infrastructure failed. The traditional web can’t serve these needs — you can’t deliver a cloud-based solution to people who have no internet, or whose access is policed by oppressive states.</p><p>The call was both encouraging and sobering. It showed that those of us building tools for decentralisation are on the right track, but it also revealed how much work we have ahead of us.</p><p>There’s a gap between creators and practitioners. Many of us are building tools that we hope the world needs. We start out ‘scratching our own itch’, reasoning that if we need something, then others must too. And that’s where our genius comes from; our creativity gives birth to new possibilities. But our technology is still young, and we haven’t had a lot of experience testing it to see if it is, in fact, what the rest of the world needs.</p><p>In many sessions, like a <a href="https://dwebcamp2023.sched.com/event/1NuA9/thinking-differently-how-do-distributed-patterns-affect-the-way-we-do-things?ref=blog.holochain.org">workshop</a> that my colleague Collin and I hosted on questioning and testing our design choices, and a discussion circle hosted by <a href="https://dweblabs.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Labs</a>, we bridged the creator/practitioner divide to face one question together: how do we make our tech solve real problems?</p>A discussion group at DWeb Camp. Photo by <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a> Where to go next <p>The main theme I heard was that the specific tools don’t matter. What matters is that they work. The appropriate solution for a given context might be as simple as a web service running on a ten-year-old laptop, or even pen and paper, or it might be complex enough to <a href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/sarafu-network?ref=blog.holochain.org">warrant a blockchain</a>.</p><p>In uncovering what this means, I heard a few other themes:</p><p>It’s time for developers and designers to unseat themselves as authorities, presenting themselves instead as servants who <a href="https://letsstudio.substack.com/p/introducing-lets?ref=blog.holochain.org">honour the wisdom and abilities</a> of the people they’re designing for. Users are the best experts on what they need, yet the ‘culture of the expert’ undermines that and leaves them feeling disempowered.</p><p>One-size-fits-all tools are not necessarily going to work, especially if they embed assumptions that come from a <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/09/joseph-henrich-explores-weird-societies/?ref=blog.holochain.org">western, educated, industrialised, rich, and democratised</a> perspective. The key to transforming our design process is relationship — meeting the real people we intend to serve, not abstract personas, and learning to listen to them. <a href="https://okthanks.com/blog/2020/3/19/orbot-listening-groups?ref=blog.holochain.org">Co-design</a>, especially using an agile approach, is a well-established set of practices for sharing the design process.</p><p>This will result in culturally appropriate software, tailored to the needs of a specific group. But in our effort to make empowering software accessible to more people (that is, making it affordable to create and access these tools), we may also want to create <a href="https://archive.org/details/neighbourhoods-metagov">‘generic tools’ for ‘specific cultures’</a> — tools that, while one-size-fits-all, embed as few assumptions as possible. If we want to do this well, we’ll need to analyze our designs rigorously for cultural blind spots, make our tools as adaptable as possible, and most importantly, partner with real people to test them.</p><p>Solve for needs that are regular rather than rare. Rather than building with an eye toward a once-every-twenty-years type natural disaster, we can focus on creating tools and processes that help address everyday needs. From communication and coordination, to commerce or even play, people have to find a tool useful in their daily lives or they won’t adopt it. By serving everyday needs, we can ensure that these tools are already in use when one of those rare events inevitably comes along.</p><p>Build for surprise and delight. Similarly, if we build something that is all function, but isn't simple, easy, and effective in addressing the issue at hand, then people aren't going to use it. Like much of the open source software space, those of us developing distributed solutions need to get more disciplined about designing for ease of use.</p><p>I think there’s something unique in local-first tech that could actually surpass the user experience of cloud software. It makes apps ‘just work’ in ways that are challenging for the cloud to match — most DWeb stacks already give users offline mode and inbuilt privacy while making automatic scaling easy and low-cost for developers. Our next step is to close gaps that make the experience unfamiliar, complicated, and buggy. Adoption happens when the first experience is rewarding.</p><p>Better solutions are discovered when tool-makers cooperate with each other. We need a humility that’s courageous enough to step back when someone else’s tool is more appropriate for the job — even (or especially) if that tool is not digital. Rather than fix-alls, let’s see our projects (and distributed tech as a whole) as layers in a stack which shifts from use case to use case. By building greater interoperability between our tools, we can occupy ecological niches that are mutually supportive of each other. Protocol-agnostic approaches like those used by <a href="https://ad4m.dev/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ADAM</a> — which allow users to enjoy a unified experience bridging between spaces and tools — can help us leverage the richness of our ecosystem.</p><p>I was encouraged to see creators and practitioners forming coalitions; DWeb Labs was the most prominent of these. It consists of people who have separately been applying DWeb tech to big problems for years, so it’s wonderful to see them combining their experience and demonstrating the mutual respect that allows them to find the best solutions rather than compete for primacy.</p><p>There are new territories to explore. The DWeb community has long been about simply building alternative systems in the shadow of the dominant systems. There’s a subtly anarchic do-it-ourselves streak here; we prefer to “build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete”, in R Buckminster Fuller’s famous <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13119-you-never-change-things-by-fighting-the-existing-reality-to?ref=blog.holochain.org">words</a>, rather than fighting against big, top-heavy structures.</p><p>This DWeb Camp, I heard more people talking about dancing strategically with those structures. On a mere pragmatic level, governments and large corporations are the world’s biggest buyers of software, and sages like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%22ACoAAAAA7k8BO2ZeCuuDpsn9aSipkOg2uYhPqc0%22&amp;facetNetwork=%22F%22&amp;origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&amp;sid=9-l&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Mei Lin Fung</a> encouraged us to consider how we could impact people’s lives if we got these institutions to adopt our tech.</p><p>There’s also room for us to start influencing public policy, educating lawmakers about the fact that the DWeb is not just a place where nasty characters hang out but can actually empower citizens in ways that align with the values these officials claim to uphold. And when the DWeb community cooperates on this, our unified voice will carry more weight.</p><p>We can never fully anticipate the consequences of our design choices, but we can speculate intelligently about them, uncover our assumptions, identify the gaps in our knowledge, and become curious enough to explore and close those gaps. And as we build up a community of practice with its own ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language?ref=blog.holochain.org">pattern languages</a>’ — libraries of interconnected design solutions that are proven through experience to work (or not work) for given contexts — the unknown will give way to a body of best practices, and our design interventions will become progressively more life-giving and less damaging to the people we serve.</p><p>A number of us are <a href="https://decentpatterns.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">creating</a> pattern languages together for various aspects of DWeb design, ranging from online communities to cryptographic protocols. <a href="https://discord.gg/myTUswWQz?ref=blog.holochain.org">Join us on the DWeb Discord server</a> if that sort of thing gets you excited!</p>Our workshop secretly also focused on how you can't fully anticipate the consequences of our design choices. Celebrating how far we’ve come <p>In enumerating the challenges and opportunities ahead of us, I run the risk of making it sound like the decentralised web hasn’t made any progress. That is, thankfully, not true. As I mentioned before, organisations like Digital Democracy are pioneering the use of peer-to-peer tech in support of marginalised peoples around the world, and technologies like <a href="https://www.braid.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Braid</a>, <a href="https://gun.eco/?ref=blog.holochain.org">GUNdb</a>, <a href="https://holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a>, <a href="https://hypercore-protocol.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hypercore</a>, <a href="https://www.ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, <a href="https://solidproject.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Solid</a>, <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Spritely</a>, and even humble HTTP are quietly being incorporated into tools that people are using in their daily lives.</p><p>When the internet was disconnected on the last full day of DWeb Camp, many of these technologies had moments of brilliance. Here are a few:</p>  <a href="https://webofcommunity.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb of Community</a>, a simple web app made available on the local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network?ref=blog.holochain.org">mesh network</a>, did one thing and did it well: it allowed us to quickly exchange contact information with each other using our smartphones. It demonstrated that sometimes a simple off-the-shelf protocol like HTTP is all that’s needed.  Emergence, a scheduling app built by the Holochain team, was able to onboard a number of participants before the whole valley lost electricity, taking down the camp’s mesh network. You can read about our experiences building, testing, debugging, and deploying this app in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/emergence-lessons-in-contextual-complexity/">Eric’s blog post</a>.  Even after the power went out, one team was able to continue using <a href="https://github.com/tschudin/vossbol?ref=blog.holochain.org">vossbol</a>, a voicemail messaging app built with a peer-to-peer protocol that uses smartphones, Bluetooth, LoRa, and a cheap $20 microcontroller as a relay server.  After electricity was restored, people got the chance to play with a few Holochain apps (including <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a>). The camp’s mesh network wasn’t completely restored yet, so we were able to connect computers using someone’s mobile phone as a hotspot simply acting as a router, without connecting to cell service!  One participant was able to prototype and demo a <a href="https://memije.substack.com/p/dweb-camp-2023?ref=blog.holochain.org">local-first collaborative playlist app</a> using GUNdb and Braid.  The <a href="https://guardianproject.info/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Guardian Project</a> demoed their <a href="https://likebutter.app/box/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Butterbox</a> device, a hub that deploys a local network and Android app store full of privacy-preserving, local-first apps.  <a href="https://hyperhyper.space/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hyper Hyper Space</a> demoed Hyper, a web-hosted browser for their peer-to-peer asset-sharing network.  <p>The challenges we face are real, but the need is also real, the opportunities are great, and we’re beginning to show the world what’s possible. As we work to improve the user experience, local-first, peer-to-peer, and agent-centric technologies will become better, more attractive solutions than cloud technologies. At that point, developers and their users may not care that they’re using something that’s more resilient, privacy-friendly, capture-resistant, and respectful of their dignity. But if we remain diligent about meeting real needs, everyone will become empowered by default as these tools are adopted.</p>Sometimes the best tools are paper and a pen.

<p>Organizations today require every employee, application and process to work in coordination to produce value. Organizations increasingly depend on their technology stack—which comprises the totality of their network interfaces, CPUs, virtual machines, operating system information and installed applications—to deliver consistent service to the end user. This means companies especially need their software applications to perform optimally because <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/01/in-the-digital-economy-your-software-is-your-competitive-advantage">they are often a source of competitive advantage</a>.</p>



 What is application health monitoring? 



<p>This is also why application health monitoring is so critical for modern organizations. Application health monitoring is a diagnostic process that involves identifying application health issues and creating a resolution plan before they turn into greater issues for an organization.</p>



<p>Organizations cannot risk unnecessary unplanned downtime or increased latencies because an application failed or underperformed. The inherent dependencies of applications can mean that one failure can have cascading effects on the entire service offering. As such, it is critical to invest in application health monitoring and to ensure that your apps can handle the demands of an organization’s daily requirements. Since any disruption to this flow can have significant consequences for the company’s bottom line and its customer relationships, it is important to prioritize application monitoring within modern organizations.</p>



<p>Monitoring application health shares some similarities with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-performance-management">application performance monitoring</a>, which monitors digital experiences like load time, response time and uptime and availability. While both improve how applications work for end-users, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/application-performance-monitoring-and-observability">application health monitoring is primarily concerned with an application working, while application performance monitoring also focuses on improving the user experience</a>.</p>



 Seven metrics that identify the relative success of your application health monitoring process 



<p>Organizations need to have a comprehensive plan to ensure the health of their applications, but one key component of any application health monitoring process is data collection. Applications fail or underperform for many different reasons. As a result, it’s important to track several key health statuses and performance metrics so you’re not discovering performance issues too late. As such, many organizations attempt to manage their application health and track key metrics through advanced health reports.</p>



<p>Here are seven important metrics that identify the relative success of your application health monitoring process:</p>



 
 Application availability and uptime: This is the amount of time an endpoint (such as a mobile device, computer or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machine</a>) can access and use an application. Software downtime is a huge organizational risk because it decreases customer satisfaction and potentially violates a <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/274740/outsourcing-sla-definitions-and-solutions.html">service-level agreement</a> with end users. Maintaining application uptime has only become more difficult recently due to multiple applications being connected and many pulling from provider <a href="http://www.ibm.com/topics/api">APIs</a> to pull in external resources. Organizations must know when performance issues happen and how to troubleshoot them. 



 App launch time and response time: This relates to initial application load time and response time to requests or user queries. For example, a user opens an application, which queries the servers to display the application’s home screen. An app that takes a long time to open will decrease customer satisfaction and it may be a sign of a larger issue. That’s why organizations need automated, real-time health checks of how long it takes for apps to perform so they can make appropriate changes to functionality if the app response threshold is below acceptable rates. Organizations that understand their response times can likely plot proactive remediation strategies before the application fails. 



 Resource usage: This measures the percentage of available resources an application is using at any particular time. Certain applications that are resource-intensive can impact performance elsewhere. You likely have experienced something like this—for example, when your computer is slow because you have multiple applications open or one overloaded application (like a browser with dozens of opened tabs). 



 The number and severity of instances and problems: It’s also important to identify how severe each incident is and how its failure or underperformance impacts the overall system. Application health monitoring often influences incident management and problem management, which involves the remediation of those issues discovered by application health monitoring. 



 Mean time to detect (MTTD): It can take anywhere from a millisecond to several days to determine that an application failed or started underperforming beyond an acceptable margin. MTTD (also sometimes referred to as mean time to discover) measures the average time it takes to identify that an application or part of the IT system has failed. Ideally, an organization either has established automated notifications or data visualization graphs and workflows so human intervention can take place to identify issues quickly. 



 Mean time to repair (MTTR): <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mttr">MTTR</a> measures the average time it takes to repair a system or piece of equipment after it has failed. MTTR tracks the time from when the failure occurs to when the application functions properly again. MTTR is a key metric to monitor because it tracks the efficacy of repair efforts, a key component of application uptime or availability. 



 The number of cybersecurity incidents: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM research</a> finds that the global average cost of a data breach is $4.45 million in 2023, a 15% increase over 3 years. There has been a “<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-unsolved-opportunities-for-cybersecurity-providers">near-sevenfold increase in spear-phishing attacks</a>” since the beginning of the pandemic. There are many reasons why an application may fail or underperform, but one of the most worrisome is it failed because of an external <a href="http://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> threat. Using monitoring tools to detect potential security issues like malware injections, distributed denial of service (DDoS) and others can improve overall application health. 
 



<p>Organizations depend on their applications working to increase the efficiency of their operations and deliver services to their customers. The best way to improve application health is through a regimented process that identifies and tracks key metrics that illuminate how individual applications are performing and provides a holistic view of the overall system.</p>

<p>In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, organizations need to ensure their cloud infrastructure is not only efficient and scalable but also compliant with various regulatory standards. IBM Cloud provides a powerful solution with its Infrastructure as Code (IaC) capabilities and the adoption of a shift-left approach to compliance.</p>



<p>This blog explores how IBM Cloud’s IaC, when combined with shift-left compliance practices, can help organizations enhance their cloud infrastructure and maintain a strong focus on compliance.</p>



 Understanding Infrastructure as Code 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure-as-code">Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</a> is an approach to infrastructure management that uses software development techniques to automate the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure resources. Instead of manually configuring infrastructure components, IaC uses code to define infrastructure as a set of reusable templates that can be version-controlled, tested and deployed with greater speed and consistency.</p>



<p>IaC allows teams to manage infrastructure in a manner similar to software, using tools like Git, Jenkins and Ansible. With IaC, infrastructure deployments become repeatable, version-controlled and easily auditable.</p>



 Infrastructure as Code offerings from IBM Cloud 



<p>IBM Cloud offers robust services to support Infrastructure as Code (IaC). <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs">IBM Cloud Terraform provider</a> is used to manage IBM Cloud resources.</p>

<p>In a recent trend, many organizations are opting to store their sensitive data in the cloud. Others choose to keep their sensitive data on-premises or even across multiple types of environments. As a result, more and more companies are faced with the challenge of costly data breaches and data democratization.</p>



 What is data democratization? 



<p>In essence, data democratization occurs when everyone within an organization has access to sensitive and business-valuable data. Having access of data expanded to a large group of people has many benefits but also serves as a security concern because it means that there is more room for human error or risk of potential data breaches, since everyone within the company may not be well versed in data security best practices. </p>



<p>Another challenge with data being rapidly moved to the cloud and stored across multiple environments means it is highly likely for enterprises to lose visibility of their sensitive data. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">2023 Cost of a Data Breach</a> report revealed 39% of breached data was stored across multiple types of environments, which was more expensive and difficult to contain than other breaches. This is an issue because enterprises can’t possibly expect to be able to protect all their data when they are not aware of its location. This further creates a data security and compliance problem for companies, which can lead to numerous ramifications, such as costly fines, time-consuming lawsuits, damaged reputation and more.</p>



 How can companies protect their data across a hybrid environment? 



<p>When companies store their data in multiple environments, it is imperative that they have a comprehensive <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">data security</a> and compliance strategy in place. IBM Security® recommends prioritizing these processes within your data security and compliance plan:</p>



 
 Find and understand where your data is stored. 



 Monitor and protect your data across the enterprise. 



 Gain insights and analyze the usage of your data. 
 



 1. Find and understand where your data is stored 



<p>To protect data, one must first understand where it is located, which is particularly difficult when data lives in different places and is managed by various policies. Failure to understand the whereabouts and usage of sensitive data throughout an organization exposes them to risk. The risks include non-compliance to regulatory requirements and can lead to excessive hoarding of sensitive data when it’s not necessary. It’s both a data security and privacy issue.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ibm-security-discover-and-classify">IBM Security® Discover and Classify (ISDC)</a> is a data discovery and classification platform that delivers automated, near real-time discovery, network mapping and tracking of sensitive data at the enterprise level, across multi-platform environments. Using techniques that include <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing (NLP)</a> and network analytics, it generates a master inventory of sensitive data down to the PII or data-element level. The inventory associates disparate data elements with the relevant data object and provides data lineage, business context, transaction history and the location of all copies of every data element.</p>



<p>By analyzing traffic on an autonomous and continuous basis—as well as data repositories connected to the network—IBM Security Discover and Classify can detect all elements on the network that are storing, processing and sharing sensitive data both outside and inside the network. It can “crawl” any repository or database when it is confirmed to or suspected of processing sensitive data, whether it is known or unknown to the enterprise.</p>



<p>In this way, IBM Security Discover and Classify can give a truly holistic view as to how and where sensitive data is being used, whether it is in motion or at rest, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/structured-vs-unstructured-data/">structured or unstructured</a>, in the cloud, on-premises or on a mainframe.</p>



<p>Adopting a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/zero-trust">zero-trust</a> approach to data security and privacy means never assuming anyone or anything is trustworthy. This concept requires continuously verifying whether access to personal data should be granted based on each user’s contextual information. IBM Security can help put zero trust into action with unified data security and privacy workflows, strengthened by contextual insight and connected solutions. By working with IBM Security Discover and Classify, the solution’s continuous discovery, monitoring and cataloging helps round out most of the necessary security capabilities for zero trust.</p>



 2. Monitor and protect your data across the enterprise 



<p>Now that your organization is aware of where your sensitive and valuable data resides, the next step is to protect your data throughout the entire lifecycle. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ibm-guardium-data-protection">IBM Security® Guardium® Data Protection</a> empowers security teams to safeguard sensitive data through discovery and classification, data activity monitoring, vulnerability assessments and advanced threat detection. This extends comprehensive data protection across heterogeneous environments, including databases, data warehouses, mainframes, file systems, file shares, cloud and big data platforms both on-premises and in the cloud.</p>



<p>As enterprises adapt to changes in the business and technological landscapes, data sources continue to proliferate over geographical and organizational boundaries. An organization’s data—stored across on-premises and cloud environments—is increasing in volume, variety and velocity. Guardium Data Protection is equipped to scale seamlessly from one data source to tens of thousands without disrupting operations due to the following capabilities:</p>



 
 Centralize management of operations, policies and auditing to simplify the aggregation and normalization of multiple data sources for enterprise reporting. 



 Utilize agent and agentless connections to data sources that help reduce the workload on infrastructure teams. Use at-source monitoring for sensitive data with Guardium S-TAP and external S-TAP agents. 



 Monitor less-sensitive data sources with Universal Connector plugins, which offer an agentless architecture that imports native audit logs and normalizes the data to prepare it for reporting and analytics, making it fast and easy to connect to modern, cloud-based data environments. 



 Enforce security policies in near real-time that protect data across the enterprise—for all data access, change control and user activities. Guardium supports deployment on several cloud platforms, including Amazon AWS, Google, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle OCI. 



 Monitor security policies for sensitive data access, privileged user actions, change control, application user activities and security exceptions. 
 



<p>Ensuring protection of your data across multiple environments is the best way to fend off threat actors and potentially save your organization millions of dollars. The Cost of a Data Breach Report found that breach costs were around USD 750,000 more when breached data was stored across multiple environments vs. on-premises only.</p>



<p>IBM Security Guardium Data Protection offers features like data activity and monitoring, near real-time threat response workflows, and automated compliance auditing and reporting, which helps companies implement comprehensive data security across their on-premises and cloud data stores.</p>



 3. Gain insights and analyze the usage of your data 



<p>Having protection policies in place is one piece of the puzzle, but another is ensuring your organization has access to the necessary tools that will provide insights and analyze your data. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/guardium-insights">IBM Security® Guardium® Insights</a> is a data security platform designed to help clients improve visibility into user activity and behavioral risk, help meet compliance regulations, protect data more efficiently and enhance IT flexibility as organizations embrace new business paradigms like moving IT infrastructure and operations to the cloud.</p>



<p>By keeping your data inside of Guardium Insights, security organizations can streamline architecture, reduce the number of appliances, improve operational efficiencies and allow data security teams to focus on value-add data security activities rather than infrastructure management. Guardium Insights can ingest data from various sources—including Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) sources (such as AWS Aurora and Azure Event Hubs) and from Guardium Data Protection—and store it in the Guardium Insights repository.</p>



<p>To help meet data compliance goals, Guardium Insights provides out-of-the-box policy templates to simplify regulatory compliance. You also have the option to create your own custom policies. This allows administrators to define what data is monitored and how it’s captured to meet the specific security and compliance needs of your organization. You can specify and schedule audit milestones and tasks to help streamline the process of conducting and reporting on a data security audit.</p>



<p>Guardium Insights uses advanced analytics to help data security teams uncover areas of risk, emerging threat patterns and potential application hijacks. The analytics engine within Guardium Insights learns which operations and data interaction patterns are normal for a given organization, then helps identify suspicious behavior, potential fraud or threat-related activities in near-real time. Users can investigate issues by viewing granular data related to IP address, time, activity, confidence scores related to the analytics and more. The results of the analytics are processed through the Guardium Insights risk-scoring engine and tagged with a high-, medium- or low-risk score based on the type of anomaly uncovered.</p>



<p>IBM Security Guardium Insights is a data security and compliance platform designed to help clients locate, classify and take action to help protect sensitive data residing on-premises and in the cloud. Whether you’re looking for a SaaS or software option to help solve your data security and compliance challenges, Guardium Insights has the solution to support your business. </p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Many companies struggle with siloed security tools, cloud migration and data democratization—all of which add additional complexity to their already demanding data security and compliance workflows. Traditional security platforms also tend to be overwhelmed by data volume, often resulting in slow reporting and limited data retention.</p>



<p>Utilizing one single tool that can help find and protect data across the hybrid cloud is extremely important, especially during a time when data breaches are more prevalent and costly than ever. IBM Security Guardium is the perfect solution to help your enterprise boost operational efficiency, significantly reduce risk and lower costs for your organization.</p>

 Is there any wonder why crypto operators are questioning existing onboarding processes, and experimenting with alternative options like iris scans, when governments and global regulatory bodies are still deliberating correct policing procedures? 



 



<p>If there’s one thing that can’t be levelled against the often maligned and misunderstood industry of crypto, is that it’s boring. In fact, despite cryptocurrency being almost 15 years old, many countries are still wrestling with what it actually is, let alone how to properly police it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, while there are certain regions, like the European Union, that are well on their way to enforcing a crypto regulatory framework (via the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulation</a>), others, like the UK, are moving very slowly with their own proposed crypto regime. In fact, it was only recently that the UK government officially rejected a proposal to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-rejects-call-regulate-crypto-gambling-2023-07-20/">regulate crypto assets as a form of gambling</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more information on how the UK’s crypto regime may look, check out our ‘Regulations – Explained in 90 seconds’ video, with our Global Head of Crypto &amp; Fintech, Jason Tucker-Feltham.</p>



 



 

 



 Riding the crypto roller coaster. 



<p>Having seemingly recovered from the multiple downs of 2022, the crypto industry appears once again to be in its ascendancy. This month, it was revealed that the bitcoin price <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/23/the-skys-the-limit-crypto-now-braced-for-a-multi-trillion-wall-street-earthquake-after-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-litecoin-solana-tron-and-polygon-price-boom/">had doubled since the beginning of the year</a>, and the industry shows no signs of slowing, both in terms of size and scope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when is crypto’s rate of growth too fast, and will regulators ever be able to keep pace?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a sector that has never been shy about pushing the boundaries of technology and questioning the limitations of existing systems, it is understandable that crypto players would experiment with new approaches. The problem, however, is that many of these novel approaches are being conducted on unstable, unregulated ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take the recent furore surrounding Worldcoin, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spearheaded by OpenAI Chief, Sam Altham, the cryptocurrency and digital ID project verifies users’ identity through a simple retina scan. This, it claims, ensures a fair distribution process, with each individual only able to claim their<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/"> sign-up bonus once</a>, and also helps to detect deep fakes, which are increasingly being used to perpetrate fraudulent activity, and to complete customer onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A valid and admirable intention, but is it ethical?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Worldcoin boasts ambitious goals, including a potential path to AI-funded Universal Basic Income. However, many concerns have been voiced by the crypto community, particularly on Worldcoin’s targeting of individuals from developing nations. This deployment strategy calls into question whether all those who have been subject to iris scanning fully understand the implications of participating. Could the irrevocable capturing of iris data at some point work against early adopters? The ultimate usage of World IDs remains unclear,” said Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and Fintech at IDnow.&nbsp;</p>



 In the eye of the verifier.&nbsp; 



<p>Worldcoin has recorded and stored thousands of iris scans so far, which are being used to train its algorithms, but has assured users it will <a href="https://www.context.news/big-tech/what-is-worldcoin-and-what-does-it-mean-for-our-privacy">destroy and hash users’ biometric data after usage,</a> but has not yet announced when that will be or provided a deadline for when they will delete data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not just privacy considerations that are causing concern, however, but where such a bold step may lead to in the future, especially for matters relating to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a>, and to cut corners or offer a much less tried and tested approach to identity verification comes at a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">huge risk</a>.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, as with any new and novel approach, fraud experts are quick off the mark in exploiting loopholes. In China, Worldcoin has gone viral, despite local users being unable to legally downland and register for the platform. The reason for the sudden, mass popularity is that users are bypassing these restrictions by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/worldcoin-black-market-iris-data-identity-orb-1850454037">buying iris data</a> for as little as $30 from countries, such as Cambodia and Kenya. In fact, the business in biometrics is booming, leading to the Kenyan government recently banning <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/kenya-bans-worldcoin-activities-as-citizens-trade-biometrics-for-tokens">‘Worldcoin activities’</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>The incentive offered by Worldcoin – crypto in exchange for iris scans – is clearly a catalyst for user adoption. When it comes to personal data, however, many think twice before parting ways with it.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and Fintech at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>“Crypto rewards are nothing new in an ever-crowded market, and with backing from some of the world’s largest VC firms, the incentive structure has long been planned by Worldcoin to increase the likelihood of its commercial success. However, perhaps what was not initially envisaged was the ease in which World IDs could be exploited by bad actors for financial gain. A black market is emerging in the trade of World IDs and yet a way in which to prevent such trade has yet to emerge,” added Jason.&nbsp;</p>



 More than meets the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Innovation is important, especially in such a forward-looking industry like crypto. Technological innovation can be transformational for businesses and consumers, but it must always be done within the guardrails of a) regulation and b) a safe and secure environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using a layered approach and combining different identification methods, crypto platforms can be assured their customers are who they say they are. The responsible use of biometrics, when combined with video identification, in addition to collecting official documents forms part of a solid and robust KYC process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automated identity verification, powered by artificial intelligence and combined with screening mechanisms and geolocation checks, provide an unparalleled solution to mitigate risks brought by fraudsters trying to circumvent KYC processes. Adhering to KYC and AML requirements should be logical for every crypto platform, wherever they want to operate, especially whilst regulatory frameworks are still being finalized.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a>&nbsp;are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">&nbsp;identity verification solutions</a>&nbsp;work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, its online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.&nbsp;</p>

 The notion of identity – and how to balance online anonymity with accountability – has been a conundrum since the internet was invented. Indeed, the concept of digital identity is one that continually evolves alongside various regulatory and technological developments. But what exactly is digital identity? 



<p>Since 2015, France has had an identity federator called FranceConnect, and more than 40 million users have already used it. However, the digital identity offered remains a low-level identity. In 2021, FranceConnect+ was deployed to remedy this problem and offer the possibility of accessing more secure digital identities (substantial and high levels). France is one of the first countries to have introduced substantial-level identity into its national regulations, acting as a forerunner in this area.</p>



 What is digital identity? 



<p><a href="https://www.yris.eu/en/">Digital identity</a> is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-viky-manaila/">digital counterpart</a> to the evidence we can provide in the physical world. As the digital counterpart of the identity document, it can provide the same level of confidence in online and sensitive use cases as an identity document can in physical use cases.</p>



<p>It is therefore a means of proving identity, but not only that. It is also a means of secure authentication, and can be used to prove certain attributes of identity such as age or nationality. <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/particulier">CNIL</a> (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés or French Data Protection Authority) points out how, “identity is more than just civil status”. </p>



<p>Identification and authentication using a digital identity is a three-way game. The user, having created his digital identity with the help of an identity provider, will use it to authenticate himself with a public or private operator, more commonly known as a service provider.</p>



<p>The best-known use case is when entering into a remote relationship. Here, digital identity makes it possible to retrieve reliable identity data, rather than an identity document. It is also a means of accessing the different accounts we use every day. In this way, it makes our everyday lives easier, while improving the level of security of the services we access.</p>



 What are the different levels of digital identity? 



<p>Digital identity has been regulated at European level, enabling it to be transposed into national law. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS</a> regulation sets three levels for digital identity:</p>



  Low level: Most of the time, this is a username and password. However, this identity is subject to various risks, including phishing. Nevertheless, it is still interesting for uses that do not require a very high level of trust (checking the number of points on your driving license, for example);  Substantial level: This is the level of identity most expected for sensitive transactions in the world of payment and finance, but can also be useful for other uses. Substantial level identity is created face-to-face or equivalent, using a piece of identification and involving strong two-factor authentication (2FA). The first factor is the telephone used to prove ownership. The second factor involves proving what you know, such as a personal code determined when the identity was created;  High-level: Although there are still few cases of this being used, most Member States have adopted a high-level identity. Despite the fact that it is created on the same basis as a substantial-level identity, the identity card used must be fitted with a chip, which acts as a cryptographic element at the time of creation. When used, the cryptographic element must be used for verification as a strong authentication vector.  



 



 

 



 



 How does digital identity work in practice? 



<p>Digital identity can be created in one of two ways: face-to-face or face-to-face equivalent, i.e. remotely. In the second case, which represents the majority of use cases, the process only takes a few minutes to complete. To do this, you need to take a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/capture-solutions/">photo of your identity document</a> and a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">video of yourself</a> to determine whether the person creating the account is really the same person as the one on the document submitted. At this stage, a number of automated checks come into play to verify the veracity of the information submitted. Finally, when a substantial or high-level identity is created, a human operator checks these elements.</p>



<p>Once the identity has been created, it can be reused in a matter of seconds on different services using two-factor authentication. For the user, the digital identity eliminates the need to use multiple IDs/passwords, thanks to a single gateway to a wide range of uses. They will also not have to scan or provide their ID every time they enter into a new relationship.</p>



<p>Finally, it gives them greater control over their personal data. The advantage of digital identity is that it provides only the identity data needed for the service, rather than all of it. This represents a step forward in data control. In terms of privacy protection, the <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/news/france-cnil-publishes-dossier-regarding-use-digital">CNIL recommends</a> “identifying the need for trust in the service and using the lowest level of identification and authentication that meets this need”.</p>



 What are the benefits for service providers? 



<p>Digital identity offers a number of advantages not only for users, but also for service providers. Without competing with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">current identity verification solutions</a>, digital identity logically coexists with existing solutions.</p>



<p>Thanks to digital identity, the level of confidence in authentication procedures is strengthened, particularly for those who do not yet have strong authentication. By eliminating the need for back-office document verification, digital identity reduces costs and eliminates a tedious and time-consuming task. It is also a major commercial advantage, since it reduces friction during the initial contact, thereby improving the conversion rate.</p>



<p>In all areas subject to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/combating-financing-of-terrorism-cft/">Combating the Financing of Terrorism</a> (AML/CFT) regulations, digital identity makes it easier to meet <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> obligations, by correlating numerous identity elements.</p>



<p>Last but not least, digital identity has a direct impact on the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/document-fraud/">fight against fraud</a>. By being verified by identification specialists, the data submitted is more reliable and less likely to have been stolen or falsified. Digital identity thus guarantees the reliability of identity data. In addition, digital identity providers are regularly audited and must comply with strict obligations, ensuring the security of the entire value chain.</p>



 What is the outlook for digital identity? 



<p>Although there are many use cases, digital identity is still in its infancy. It is set to become the standard for authentication and identification in the next few years, and we need to be prepared for this. By offering numerous advantages for both users and service providers, digital identity will revolutionize, simplify and secure our identification habits for the long term.</p>



<p>At European level, the prospects offered by the European Digital Identity Portfolio are also opening up new horizons. In addition to making it easier to identify oneself within services in other countries thanks to the interoperability of identities, it will be able to contain additional attributes, such as driving licenses or diplomas. The arrival of such solutions will have a direct impact on the user experience and on the way we interact with all our day-to-day services.</p>

 We sat down with our Sales Director, Olivier Artus, to discuss the PVID framework, its impact on the financial market, its evolution over time and its implementation at IDnow. 



 What will the PVID certification mean for the financial market in practice? 



<p>The PVID certification offers a clear and precise reference for all remote identity verification players on the French market. It allows financial market players to integrate a certified solution of substantial level into their process, which will make the entry into a relationship consistent with a face-to-face equivalent. This is the first time that the French authorities that regulate the financial services market have proposed a solution, integrating biometrics, that is 100% compliant with the Monetary and Financial Code (CMF), without having to add any additional measures other than ID and biometrics.</p>



 What will the PVID standard add to the remote identity verification process? 



<p>The real difference is the instant compliance of the entry into the relationship. Until now, the use of biometrics in a transaction, although secure, had no substantial value, i.e. was not recognized or certified by an authority. Thanks to PVID, we finally have a solution that offers a face-to-face equivalent, in line with the requirements of the regulators.</p>



<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">PVID standard</a> makes it possible to offer online access to unbanked populations. Thanks to the certification, it is no longer necessary to add additional measures such as the first payment by bank transfer, for example, which is less inclusive and often a source of failure or even cost. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">use of biometrics</a> is now recognized as a full complementary measure.</p>



<p>The rules imposed by traditional financial institutions for opening an account have made the entry into a relationship a real challenge. If we had had a PVID standard at the time of the health crisis, for example, traditional banks would have been able to do even more business securely and therefore more transactions.</p>



 Will all players in the financial sector be affected by this certification? In particular the crypto players, the fintech world… will everyone be on the same page? 



<p>All players subject to <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr/">ACPR</a> and <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/regulation/regulation-homepage">AMF</a> regulations will now be able to include a biometric entry path in their solution: credit institutions, personal and capital insurance, fintech, payment institutions, etc. Some other sectors will not be immediately affected by PVID, such as property and casualty insurance, which does not have a KYC obligation as it is not considered a risk area.</p>



<p>Other sectors of the financial sphere such as issuers of prepaid products and so-called credit FinTechs will obviously be interested in the development of such solutions to enhance trust when entering into a remote relationship.</p>



<p>As far as crypto is concerned, the AMF in France has defined the PSAN status (Service Provider on Digital Assets) in order to better supervise the market players and requires for this the implementation of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">complete KYC path</a>, including identity verification. This is equivalent to the PVID process for banks. More globally and in order to harmonize the European crypto regulatory landscape, it is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets)</a> regulation that will enter soon, still with the objective of protecting investors and preserving financial stability.</p>



<p>The first beneficiaries of the PVID standard will therefore be banks, neo-banks, payment institutions and credit players. What is important to remember is that players who are not directly concerned by PVID will be able to accelerate their insertion into the market and strengthen confidence in the construction of a customer relationship, thanks to this type of standard.</p>



 What will be the benefits of a PVID certification for financial market participants? 



<p>The last two years have seen a significant increase in cases of online identity fraud. In our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">latest Identity Fraud Trend Report</a> we found a 144% increase in the use of fake identity documents between November and December 2021. PVID certification strengthens traditional remote identity verification solutions, and improves the fight against identity theft through the use of biometrics.</p>



<blockquote><p>Beyond the fight against fraud, the challenge of the PVID standard is to fight against financial crime during remote identification, and therefore money laundering. This involves identifying the origin of funds and the destination of funds. The PVID process completes the financial institution’s AML/CFT system.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



 Do you think that the arrival of PVID will increase confidence in the market? 



<p>Of course. The primary objective of PVID is to strengthen the trust between the financial institution and the customer when subscribing to a service or opening an account.</p>



<p>The end customer will go through a process that is based on a public repository published by a recognized government agency, which represents an additional element of trust for him. For its part, the financial institution will rely on an expert company that provides it with a solution certified by the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ANSSI</a> to a substantial level with regard to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">European eIDAS regulation</a>, in order to verify the authenticity of the identity of the customers it deals with.</p>



<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/solution-pvid/">PVID standard</a> adds control points to identity documents. The dynamic capture of the document allows the detection of security features that cannot be verified in static mode. Then, a manual analysis completes the automated verification of the captures. It is carried out by operators trained in fraud who check, correct and give a final verdict on the user data in less than 5 minutes.</p>



 What, in your opinion, are the challenges to encourage the adoption of this new type of standard? 



<p>The first challenge is the user experience, which must be simple, intuitive, fast and perfectly integrated into our customers’ acquisition flow. The use of a mobile phone in the context of a long-distance relationship can be a barrier for less technophile users. For this reason, we offer an omnichannel pathway (on smartphones, tablets and computers). Our PVID certified pathway offers an intuitive, step-by-step guided experience to simplify the identity verification process for the user, for high conversion rates.</p>



<p>Furthermore, citizens are becoming increasingly vigilant about the handling of their personal data. Here again, our solutions are compliant with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Our solutions and all processed data are securely hosted in Europe and we have our own infrastructure. Thus, we guarantee the complete confidentiality and protection of all shared data and analyses performed.</p>



<p>In addition to the user aspect, we also have a duty to support financial institutions in learning how to use the solutions and optimize their processes.</p>



 In terms of geography, who will be affected by PVID? And in your opinion, will this certification evolve? 



<p>From a technical point of view, the solution will initially apply to the entire French market under the aegis of the ACPR. As France is a recognized financial center, it is likely that the PVID process could also be recognized as compliant in other EU countries in the context of remote entry.</p>



<blockquote><p>It can be assumed that this regulation will continue to exist and that it may evolve from a functional point of view. Optional modules may be added to the solution to suit different countries and local regulators.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



<p>In the context of the emergence of digital identity and identity wallets, our near future will be to rely on a PVID certified solution for the creation of a recognized digital identity of substantial level.</p>



 What is the status of certification at IDnow? 



<p>IDnow has obtained the ANSSI Security Visa for PVID certification of its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-provider-criteria/">identity verification services</a>! Symbolizing the culmination of months of collaboration and involvement by all our teams, this certification demonstrates our determination to offer our customers secure solutions that comply with current French regulations.</p>

<p>At Fission, we believe that people and the communities they belong to deserve more agency over their data. In the Harvard Business Review article, <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/why-companies-make-it-so-hard-for-users-to-control-their-data">Why It's So Hard for Users to Control Their Data</a> by Bhaskar Chakravorti, digital agency is defined as the ability of users to own the rights to their personal data, manage access to this data and potentially be compensated fairly for such access.</p> The Case for User-Owned Data <p>Web 2.0 saw a huge rise in app platforms, and users became used to sharing their personal information to gain access. But as data breaches occurred and tracking became more sophisticated, users started pushing back against data collection and its resulting invasions of privacy. </p><p>Legislation like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> was passed to protect users by spelling out their rights over their data, but this isn't enough. How many users tick the checkbox and authorize data collection and tracking on the websites they visit simply so they can carry on with what they were doing?</p><p>Many users care about data privacy, but their actions don't always match their concerns. Chakravorti lays out three possible reasons: 1) Data is intangible, and because we're not physically handing it over, it doesn't feel as meaningful to us 2) Users have little leverage to negotiate more data agency because they feel trapped in many services 3) Managing one's own data is complex. </p><p>How can we mitigate these roadblocks and empower users to take back control of their data and privacy, but do so in a more intuitive and user-friendly way?</p> Promising Solutions <p>Local-First Apps</p><p>Local first apps adopt principles and practices prioritizing data ownership, privacy, and control. Data is stored locally on users' devices, giving them direct control over their information. Even if data is synchronized across devices or stored in the cloud, local-first apps often use end-to-end encryption to ensure it remains inaccessible to unauthorized individuals. Users can even modify their data when there is no Internet connection! &nbsp;</p><p>The way changes are made in local-first file systems also empowers users. For example, CRDTs handle data synchronization and guarantee eventual consistency while allowing users to collaborate with others and retain control over their data. </p><p>Fission's Webnative File System (<a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">WNFS</a>) is a local-first E2EE file system that developers can integrate with their apps to ensure their users are in control while they remain GDPR-compliant. It's a win-win! </p><p>Interoperable Standards</p><p>As mentioned earlier, many users feel trapped on their platforms because there is no easy way to transfer their data from one service to another. There are ways a user can download their data and request its deletion from the server, but porting that data over to another similar service and picking up where they left off has not always been that simple. It wasn't until GDPR mandated the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/">right to data portability</a> that big tech companies came together to work on the <a href="https://dtinit.org/">Data Transfer Project</a> and make downloaded data standardized. As a result, companies like Apple, Meta, and Google now interoperate with each other. </p><p>Another way of using standardization is to create a protocol. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, has been working on a new web infrastructure called Solid. &nbsp;<a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a> lets users store their data securely in "Pods". Pods are decentralized data stores that act as secure personal web servers for data. It is similar to the local-first app approach in that the data remains with the users. Applications that adhere to standard, open, and interoperable data formats and protocols, like Linked Data, can store and access data in Pods with the user's consent using the Solid Protocol.</p><p>Blockchain technologies have also empowered users to store their data with more agency. <a href="https://www.disco.xyz/">Disco.xyz</a> uses a "data backpack" to keep their data portable while transitioning from Web2 to Web3. By combining Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) with Verifiable Credentials (VCs), users can cryptographically verify their identities and share their data with their chosen communities or apps.</p><p>Data Trusts and Data Commons</p><p>A data trust looks after the data and data rights of individuals. Trustees act on behalf of the collective good of the group and can decide whether to grant or revoke access to their members' data. And according to the MIT Technology Review article <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1017801/data-trust-cybersecurity-big-tech-privacy/">How Data Trusts Protect Privacy</a> by Anouk Ruhaak, "because the data trust would represent a collective, it could negotiate terms and conditions on our behalf. Thus, it could allow us to exercise our rights as producers of data in much the same way trade unions allow workers to exercise their rights as purveyors of labor." </p><p>Furthermore, data trusts are a way to make larger data sets more available for AI training, research, and innovation while keeping users in control. This could even be a mechanism for users to get paid for their data - similar to how people are paid when participating in clinical trials. </p> <p>The growth of user-owned data solutions can lead to several benefits, such as increased transparency, privacy-centric and user-friendly applications, and more healthy competition across platforms. User data is less susceptible to breaches or unauthorized access, and users feel empowered and in control.</p><p>Which of these solutions resonates with you? Were there any solutions we didn't mention that you'd like to discuss? Leave us a comment below!</p>

<p>If you want a telling glimpse at why Singapore ranks among the world’s leaders in digital identity, look no further than this summer’s British invasion. No, this former colony and small southeast Asian city-state-turned-financial-powerhouse isn’t fending off intruding forces. It’s fighting for Coldplay tickets.</p>
<p>With six sold-out shows and online ticket queues topping more than a million for concerts that won’t be performed until January, Singaporeans are calling for more to be done to limit the number of foreigners buying up or scalping tickets for a can’t-miss concert from the chart-topping English band. Among the suggested remedies from online masses jones-ing to experience “A Sky Full of Stars” or “Viva La Vida” live and in person: Calls to use the nation’s Singpass digital identity app to purchase tickets, thereby reducing or eliminating the number of foreign fans that can attend the concerts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/singpass/">Singpass</a> (aka Singapore Personal Access) is a digital identity that Singaporean residents use to access government and private sector services online and via mobile app with the same level of trust as a face-to-face transaction. It’s also the centerpiece of Singapore’s National Digital Identity program, part of this island-state’s ambitious Smart Nation initiative to fuel digital economy inclusion and growth. With 97% penetration among this tiny island nation’s roughly 5.6 million citizens, Singpass facilitates more than <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/digital-development/how-singapores-national-digital-identity-and-government-digital-data-sharing">350 million transactions</a> annually.</p>
<p>The program is considered so successful that countries such as <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/japan-south-korea-to-speed-up-talks-over-pending-military-issues">South Korea and Japan</a> seek guidance and collaboration from Singapore in forging citizen identity architectures for verifying, managing, and securing identity. Like programs in Belgium and elsewhere worldwide, digital identity programs are proving vital as the digital world continues to transform every aspect of daily life while fostering a growing number of costly threats.</p>
 Digital Identity: Proof or Consequences 
<p>Identity verification and proofing have long played an essential role in functioning societies, enabling individuals to prove their identity in person to make purchases, manage finances, receive entitlements and services, and more. But verifying identity in digital channels through authentication based on the usernames and passwords that emerged to protect online accounts have been a goldmine for cybercriminals.</p>
<p>The problem: Organized crime syndicates and state-sponsored threat actors continue to find alarmingly effective ways to crack or pilfer users’ login credentials. A never-ending stream of phishing and spyware attacks harvest credentials en masse, leading to corporate data breaches that have made <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2023/04/buyers-beware-cybercriminals-target-your-online-credentials/">over 24 billion</a> recently-compromised login credentials and personal identity files accessible to cyber-attackers via underworld websites.</p>
<p>Thieves and malign forces leverage automated technologies to exploit these logins in credential-stuffing attacks that can test more than 22 trillion password-and-username combinations in <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/can-singapore-become-a-passwordless-nation/">less than 22 seconds</a>. Once they’ve successfully pirated an account, these cyber-bandits can drain bank funds, steal personal identity information or corporate data to sell online or impersonate account owners to defraud businesses and governments. The price tag: More than <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-to-cost-the-world-8-trillion-annually-in-2023/#:~:text=Our%20report%20provides%20a%20breakdown,%24667%20billion%20a%20Month.">US$8 trillion</a> in global losses expected just this year. That’s more than US$20 billion every single day.</p>
<p>Despite being ahead of the curve, Singapore<a href="https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/can-singapore-become-a-passwordless-nation/"> isn’t completely immune</a> to this scourge. An estimated 47.9 million phishing attacks targeting remote workers struck the country in just the first half of last year. Smishing schemes targeting customers of OCBC Bank resulted in losses of more than US$6.4 million—forcing regulators to ban bank emails and text messages. And this March, news hit that hackers had stolen thousands of logins from major tech and Fortune 500 companies after breaching a data center <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/hackers-compromised-two-large-data-centers-in-asia-and-leaked-major-tech-giants-login-credentials/">in Singapore</a> and another in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It’s no small matter. Fast, seamless transactions are crucial to the digital economy. So is security. And that requires a universally-accepted form of identity that protects privacy and prevents hackers from stealing and exploiting personal information. As Congressional Leaders in the U.S. weigh the <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/digital-identity-a-centerpiece-of-the-digital-economy-problems-challenges-and-solutions">Improving Digital Identity Act</a> passed by the House in April, officials here and elsewhere could benefit from studying Singapore’s progress.</p>
 Singapore: A ‘Smart City’ on Digital’s Cutting Edge 
<p>Made up of 63 islands and known for sleek, modern architecture, clean streets, a multicultural vibe, and bustling financial and business sectors, the Republic of Singapore is one of the “Four Asian Tigers.” It has also been dubbed “the smartest city in the world”—and it’s easy to see why. The city-state’s Smart Nation approach includes a National Digital Identity (NDI) initiative that is uniquely focused on nurturing digital innovation, infrastructure, and inclusion to enhance citizens’ lives and address their ever-changing needs.</p>
<p>Singapore does have some built-in advantages in this effort. As ThalesGroup.com reports, the populace is educated and<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide-digital-identity-and-security/iot/magazine/singapore-worlds-smartest-city"> tech-savvy</a>. Data from public transport fare cards and in-vehicle sensors is analyzed to continuously improve transport systems. Contactless payments are widely adopted.</p>
<p>Healthcare is entirely digitized and leverages AI chatbots and IoT sensors to guide residents in healing, recovery, and healthy living. And the Singpass app provides a one-stop platform that simplifies establishing identity, registering a birth, paying taxes, renewing passports, accessing government and private sector services, and more.</p>
<p>While the NDI program was first launched 20 years ago, Singpass was first introduced as a web app in 2018 and as a cryptography-based smartphone app in 2021. Citizens 15 and up can enroll, and only three percent of eligible people have yet to do so.</p>
<p>Once enrolled, citizens can register for Singpass, which allows them to use single sign-on to log into accounts, share information, conduct transactions, and sign documents. Two-factor authentication, such as a fingerprint biometric or pin code on the user’s device, is offered to provide an added layer of security, reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud.</p>
 Building an Ecosystem of Trust 
<p>In Singapore and elsewhere, digital identity is generally comprised of validated digital attributes and credentials designed for the digital world that are verified by cross-referenced government-issued physical world credentials. Think birth certificate, driver’s license, passport, etc. In this case, Singpass is underpinned by the country’s national registration identity card (<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/digital-driving-licence-singpass-app-2531601">NRIC</a>).</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of Singapore’s Singpass is convenience. Citizens don’t need to manage multiple usernames and passwords for different services or transactions. And they can easily access digital equivalents of their driver’s license and Identification Card (IC) through a feature called MyInfo.</p>
<p>By leveraging application programming interfaces (APIs), the service enables users to permit banks and financial services firms to retrieve their personal information to simplify and streamline account enrollment processes. This is also one the first public digital infrastructures to facilitate this form of verification, decreasing the time needed to complete an application by 80%. It has also resulted in a 15% higher approval rate due to better data quality and significant reductions in customer acquisition costs.</p>
<p>But Singpass isn’t yet invulnerable to all possible threats. Earlier this year, scammers allegedly used fraudulent advertising and social media promotions for services like pet grooming and groceries, and dry cleaning lured victims into downloading mobile malware that was used to make unauthorized purchases. According to news reports, money mules allegedly forked over their <a href="https://www.hackread.com/teen-arrest-android-malware-scheme/">Singpass credentials</a> and other information to receive and transfer funds.</p>
 A Step Toward Decentralized Identities 
<p>Singpass may soon give Singaporeans far more control over how their information is used while making digital identity far easier and safer to apply across all sectors of the economy. According to reports, the Government Technology (GovTech) agency that runs Singpass is working on a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#:~:text=Decentralized%20identifiers%20(DIDs)%20are%20a,the%20controller%20of%20the%20DID.">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a>-based digital wallet.</p>
<p>While Singpass already offers a digital identity wallet (DIW) that acts like a “digital twin” of hard-copy identity documents, it operates within a federated ecosystem of centralized servers belonging to large public or private organizations. In federated models like this, data or things like selfies captured for facial recognition-based authentication and stored, even for a short time, can conceivably be hacked and either ransomed or exploited to commit fraud.</p>
<p>DID-based wallets, however, use globally unique identifiers that give users a cryptographically verifiable, decentralized digital identity. This approach sets the stage for a future where authenticating users no longer requires personal data to be stored centrally. Instead, users can control what personal information they share and how it’s used—and for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/08/30/digital-identities-will-change-the-nature-of-online-reputation/?sh=663dde5a584a">how long</a>.</p>
 What Should Come Next 
<p>I couldn’t agree more with Singapore’s exploration of DID-based digital wallets. In my view, the success of digital identity is predicated on distributed technologies and the architectural advantages they deliver.</p>
<p>With distributed ledger-driven systems, for instance, someone applying for a loan could choose which personal information to share instead of granting a bank access to data about their entire financial lives. They could also share third-party trust scores that allow them to demonstrate creditworthiness without revealing personal information at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps best of all, they would no longer run the risk of having the loan denied due to inaccurate or out-of-date information stored within a federated network. That’s because when users opt to share data, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/04/04/why-zero-trust-is-all-about-identity/?sh=350d5c6e54ee">zero-trust systems</a> can apply risk, quality, or credit scores without contributing private user information or metadata to the process. It’s a perfect match with Singapore’s commitment to digital inclusion.</p>
<p>But fair warning: To be effective, digital identity wallets must also comply with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2-</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics</a>-based standards that leverage <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-multi-factor-authentication/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Digi-mfa-sl-Ext&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8JKbBhBYEiwAs3sxNyMKKDUvP5kit_UP4XbwzmqYa5SZLqdolxffbwblB9hNwZ2hzC6VihoCYMMQAvD_BwE">liveness tests</a> capable of defeating identity spoofing.</p>
<p>Had their calls for restricting purchases of top concert acts to Singpass users been in place, that’s the kind of protection more than a few Singaporean Coldplay fans might appreciate right about now.</p>

<p>Ask any CIO or CISO today what they are doing to protect their organization from the continuing threat of cyberattacks and you are likely to hear that they are implementing a Zero Trust approach. A recent Gartner study indicated that Zero Trust network access (ZTNA) is the fastest-growing segment in network security, forecasted to grow 31% this year. Adoption of Zero Trust frameworks offers a more comprehensive alternative to security that better aligns with today’s needs. As organizations transition from the traditional virtual private network (VPN) approach and increasingly adopt the Zero Trust models to secure the perimeter-less environment, one area that cannot be overlooked is the security of the virtual infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the perimeter-less remote work environment we live in today, implementing Zero Trust requires an improved governance of identity, where access to resources is not only determined based on factors such as users’ characteristics and assigned roles but also on asset status and environmental conditions like time and geolocation of the connection request. In this blog post, we describe why it is important to ensure that only authenticated users have access to the resources that they have been authorized to control. And let’s not forget that users can be individuals as well as applications, devices, and machines.</p>
<p>Zero Trust and the virtual infrastructure</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a security model designed to prevent unauthorized access to a network’s resources. It operates under the premise that no user, application, device, or machine can be trusted by default, and that every request must be authenticated and authorized before access can be granted. The Zero Trust framework for virtual infrastructure extends this model, tailoring it specifically to virtualized and multi-cloud environments. The model relies on several key security principles to deliver enhanced security at a time when the traditional perimeter is quickly disappearing and the use of virtualized applications is rapidly growing across multi-cloud deployments. Security principles addressed by the framework include least privilege, micro-segmentation, and continuous monitoring.</p>
<p>The principle of least privilege ensures that users, applications, devices, and machines are only granted the access they need to perform their specific tasks and nothing more. Tasks that users are authorized to perform can have wide-ranging implications on the operation and security of the business. Therefore, best practices should always dictate that a secondary review and approval be required for any sensitive configuration change. As a component of the least privilege principle, associated changes to the public key infrastructure (PKI), including changes to user and machine identity aspects, should always undergo a secondary review and approval process. This helps to reduce the attack surface and limit the potential damage of any accidental or deliberate misconfiguration that may be perpetrated. Micro-segmentation divides the network into smaller, isolated segments to prevent lateral movement by attackers. This means that even if a single segment is compromised, the attacker cannot easily move across the network and access other resources. Continuous monitoring ensures that any suspicious activity is detected and addressed immediately. This involves the use of advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies and potential threats in real-time.</p>
<p>Foundational security mechanisms</p>
<p>In addition to secondary reviews and approvals and the validation of machine identities through a trusted source, an effective Zero Trust framework for virtual infrastructure also relies on foundational elements, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC), encryption, and cryptographic keys and secrets management. MFA protects the organization from unauthorized access and encryption protects sensitive data, ensuring that even if a user’s credentials are ever compromised, the attacker still cannot gain access to sensitive information. Keys and secrets management provides the underpinning footing, ensuring that the keys used to encrypt data and the secrets and other credentials used to access the applications and data are always secured and in compliance with government and industry security regulations.</p>
<p>The way forward</p>
<p>The Zero Trust framework for virtual infrastructure is a comprehensive security model that protects against modern threats in cloud and virtualized environments. Entrust provides a complete suite of integrated technology solutions as required by the Zero Trust framework. Extending the security of virtual infrastructure in data centers and private clouds, organizations adopting this framework can significantly improve their security posture. This includes helping reduce the likelihood of a data breach, maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their critical assets, and supporting progress in the journey to Zero Trust maturity.

<p>I want to introduce you to a new developer tool called Kangaroo. You can use it to bundle up a hApp into an installable binary, ready for use on macOS, Windows, and Linux. It makes it easy for people to start using a hApp, because the installation experience feels like any other app install rather than having to learn about the Holochain Launcher (which is honestly fairly easy but still a bit of a shift from what people are used to).</p><p>After I introduce Kangaroo, I’ve got some upcoming events to help you in your development journey and some notes on the newest unstable release in the Holochain 0.2.x branch and its supporting tools and libraries. (Yes, you read that correctly — this is an unstable release. There are known issues with performance and possibly DHT resilience, but there have been a lot of bugfixes in that area and we wanted to get those into people’s hands.)</p> Kangaroo: Bundle up your hApp and Holochain together <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kangaroo</a> is a tool that makes it easy for you, dear dev, to make installation easy for the people using your hApp. It scaffolds a project structure that contains just enough Holochain and webview to generate a self-contained binary with your hApp in it. The included GitHub actions will then generate installers for all three major desktop OSes, with code signing on the OSes that need it.</p><p>As mentioned above, this means that the installation experience feels familiar and easy — there’s no need to install ‘some other thing’ (the Launcher) in order to install and start using a hApp. All they have to do is go to your website or GitHub repo, or their OS’ app store if that’s how you choose to distribute your hApp, download the thing, and install it.</p><p>Kangaroo is a bit like Lightningrod Labs’ <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/electron-holochain-template?ref=blog.holochain.org">electron-holochain-template</a>, but builds your hApp on a fully Rusty stack using a webview container called <a href="https://tauri.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tauri</a>. That makes binaries smaller, faster, and less resource-consuming than Electron binaries, although you do have to deal with compatibility issues for webview libraries on older OSes. (You can read more about the differences and similarities between Electron and Tauri <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/tauri-electron-comparison-migration-guide/?ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a>.)</p><p>Tauri also supports <a href="https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/updater/?ref=blog.holochain.org">auto-updating</a>; the compiled binary will automatically check for and download new hApp binaries. Keep note that, if your version bump signals a breaking change per <a href="https://semver.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">SemVer</a> rules (that is, the leftmost non-zero number increases), user data will not be ported to the new version.</p><p>Bundling your hApp with Kangaroo is pretty straightforward:</p>  Install the dev dependencies (Rust and Go).  Clone, snapshot, or fork the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo?ref=blog.holochain.org">repo</a>.  Run <code>npm install</code> in the repo’s working folder.  Add your hApp and its UI to the <code>./pouch</code> folder.  Do a project-wide search/replace to change <code>replace-me</code> to your hApp’s name.  Add an icon.  Add a version number for your hApp.  Build the hApp using <code>npm run tauri build</code>.  <p>After that, you can push the repo to GitHub and configure GitHub actions to build the installers for you.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo/blob/main/README.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">readme for the repo</a> is well-written and friendly, so you should have an easy time getting started. This tool is new, so please try it out and give the developers your feedback!</p> Holochain development environment setup support <p>This upcoming series of calls is an ‘open office hours’ sort of thing where you can come and get guided through the process of setting up all the dev tools you need to create hApps. We do ask that you try the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/quick-start/?ref=blog.holochain.org">quick start guide</a> first, but if you hit a roadblock, come to one of these calls with your needs, questions, and frustrations to get unstuck!</p><p>The first session is on Thursday, 3rd August at 13:00 UTC. Here’s the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/events/holochain-development-environment-setup-support?ref=blog.holochain.org">event page</a>, which has a registration link. See you there!</p> Developer-focused AMA in August <p>This will be the first in a new quarterly series of Holochain AMAs just for developers. Rather than a livestream, it’ll be an intimate Zoom call where developers and other dev-related folks can ask focused questions about the things that matter to them. (We will publish the recording afterwards though!)</p><p>We’ve had one or two Holo/Holochain AMAs targeted at developers in the past, but this will be a dedicated AMA just for you, with a regular rhythm that you can put on your calendar. This event joins the fabulous community-led Holochain In Action calls in fostering a community you can journey with as you develop your skills (and your applications).</p><p>The first AMA will be on Tuesday, 15th August at 17:00 UTC. Submit your questions <a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/developer-AMA-1?ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a> and register for the Zoom call <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_TNW-BVjeTnyd_3hvvwDTzw?ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a>.</p><p>Even if you can’t make the call, please register anyway. This will ensure that you will get notified right away when a link to the recording becomes available.</p> Online developer training in October <p>Along with Marcus and Guillem from our education partner Mythosthesia, we’re co-hosting another online hApp developer training course this October. Just like the first one, it’ll be four days of instruction followed by a weekend hackathon. And just like the first one, the curriculum will be fantastic and you and your fellow students will learn a lot together. Read the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-oct-2023/?ref=blog.holochain.org">landing page</a> to learn more and register. Make sure you get your application in by 18th September!</p> Holochain 0.2.1 (unstable): Bug fixes, small improvements, and big changes <p>As mentioned in previous Dev Pulses, we discovered some performance issues and other bugs in Holochain 0.2.0. We <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-5-released/#quick-update-on-holochain-021-progress">promised</a> a quick turnaround to fix these issues, but some of them have been challenging to diagnose.</p><p>We’ve recently released Holochain 0.2.1, which tackles quite a few of these issues. We’re still aware of some outstanding issues, so we’re pronouncing this release unstable. But if you’ve been itching to update your hApp to the 0.2.x series, this release is ready for development with new features and improved performance over the 0.1.x series, but do expect to run into issues. If you need stability, stick with 0.1.5 or wait for a later release in the 0.2.x series. We intend for this release to be API-stable with future 0.2.x releases, but we may need to make unanticipated breaking changes in the service of fixing bugs.</p><p>Here’s a list of changes since 0.1.5, including those that landed in 0.2.0:</p> General   Breaking/new (network protocol): This is one of the two big news items with this release — a new WebRTC-based networking protocol, which lets us rely more on off-the-shelf libraries and tools than our QUIC-based protocol did. It means we can use standard WebRTC <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interactive-connectivity-establishment-ice/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ICE</a> (interactive connectivity establishment) strategies for making peer-to-peer connections over the public internet, and reduces our burden of security compliance due to the fact that WebRTC tools and libs are more mature and better maintained.  New (conductor): The conductor now supports ‘blocking’, in which a peer adds other peers to their block list. Blocking is the foundation of everything we’ll be doing to create the validation-based network immune system in future releases, and can also be used for things that don’t involve validation, such as community moderation or removing an employee from workspaces when they leave the company.  Breaking (conductor config): Networking types <code>proxy</code> and <code>quic</code> have been removed; please transition to <code>webrtc</code> if you have any conductor config files lying around (this is likely if you’ve generated test configs with <code>hc sandbox generate</code>). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2208?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2208</a>)  Breaking (<code>holochain</code> Rust crate): The feature <code>test_utils</code>, which builds Sweettest into the resulting binary, is no longer default. If you’re relying on the <code>holochain</code> crate to use Sweettest, use <code>default-features = false</code> and the feature <code>sweetest</code> (note only one <code>t</code>). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2281?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2281</a>)  New (networking, conductor config): There’s a new network tuning param called <code>gossip_arc_clamping</code> that lets you optionally override automatic arc size tuning to be either full or empty, allowing a node to claim responsibility for all or none of the DHT. This lets resource-constrained nodes (like cell phones) offload their work to willing ‘full nodes’, and is also accompanied by a new ability of standard nodes to tune their DHT coverage to compensate for freeloading (legitimate or otherwise). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2352?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2352</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2380?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2380</a>)  New/experimental: A chain head coordinator feature allows multiple machines to share the same source chain. This will be used mainly for redundancy in the Holo hosting network. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2502?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2502</a>)  Bugfix: A bootstrap server must be reachable when a conductor with installed hApps is launched. This fixes an issue where hApps would get paused if the conductor was launched without access to a bootstrap. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2419?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2419</a>)  Bugfix: Attempts to duplicate a clone cell (that is, a cell with the same DNA and agent hashes as a cell that already exists) now fail. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1997?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1997</a>)  Bugfix (networking): A lockup on certain network layer error types has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2315?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2315</a>, tx5 <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/31?ref=blog.holochain.org">#31</a>)  Bugfix (networking): Mismatched gossip rounds, caused by rounding errors in storage arc boundaries on multi-agent conductors, has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2332?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2332</a>)  Bugfix (networking): A bug in which self-authored data couldn’t be retrieved if the author wasn’t also responsible for that region of the DHT has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2425?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2425</a>)  Bugfix (networking): A race condition that caused network instability (temporary blocking of newly joined nodes) has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2534?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2534</a>)  Optimisation: When uninstalling an app, any DNAs that are no longer used by any other app will have their DHT data removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1805?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1805</a>)  Optimisation: Capability grant verification during a zome function call is faster, which speeds up calls (especially remote calls) considerably. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2097?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2097</a>)   Bundle manifests   Breaking/bugfix (DNA manifest, conductor APIs): <code>name</code> in a DNA definition no longer affects/forks the DNA hash. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2099?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2099</a>)  Breaking (app manifest): <code>version</code> is renamed to <code>installed_hash</code>, and now only accepts a single optional DNA hash value, where previously it could accept a list of values. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2157?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2157</a>)  New (app manifest): A new cell provisioning strategy <code>clone_only</code> has been implemented, designed for situations where a cell shouldn’t be instantiated for a DNA immediately upon app installation. This is useful for when you want to create clones of a DNA but don’t want to have a ‘default’ cell. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2243?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2243</a>)  New (zome manifest): The zome manifest can now take a <code>dylib</code> argument which points to a WebAssembly module compiled specifically to work on iOS. It’s used with artifacts produced by <code>hc dna pack --dylib-ios</code> option. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2218?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2218</a>)   HDI and HDK   Breaking/new (HDI/HDK): <code>HoloHash::retype()</code> is removed from the public API, along with <code>From&lt;AnyDhtHash&gt;</code> and <code>From&lt;AnyLinkableHash&gt;</code> impls. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2191?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2191</a>) Casting can now be done via the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2191?ref=blog.holochain.org">remaining impls</a>, new <code>TryFrom</code> impls, or a new <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/prelude/struct.HoloHash.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#method.into_agent_pub_key"><code>.into_agent_pub_key()</code></a> conversion function (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2283?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2283</a>).  Breaking/new (HDI/HDK): <code>ChainQueryFilter</code> now lets you filter on multiple entry and action types in one query. The query builder API hasn’t changed, but the underlying data structures have, so you’ll still need to recompile your code. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2302?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2302</a>)  Breaking (HDI): The `DhtOp``validation rules have been significantly expanded on and changed. While the data structures and API haven’t changed, stricter rules may cause some previously accepted ops to be rejected. Run those automated tests! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2215?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2215</a>)  New (host API): <code>block_agent</code> and <code>unblock_agent</code> have been added to allow for app-level, agent-driven blocking of peers. This means that a hApp can allow an agent to add other peers to their blocklist, rejecting any signals, remote calls, or gossip attempts from them. (Their DHT neighbours may still ask them to validate and store DHT data for the blocked peers though.) This is useful for moderation of things that can’t or shouldn’t be covered by validation, especially of the <a href="https://cblgh.org/articles/trustnet.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">subjective</a> kind. (Note: as far as I can tell, these functions haven’t yet been wired up to the network plumbing, nor do they yet have convenience functions in the HDK. But the functionality that makes it possible is all there.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1828?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1828</a>)  New (HDK): <code>OpType</code> is now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.3.1/hdi/flat_op/enum.FlatOp.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>FlatOp</code></a>, and <code>Op::to_type()</code> is now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/prelude/enum.Op.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#method.flattened"><code>Op::flattened()</code></a>. The old names still exist as aliases, though, so this isn’t (yet) a breaking change. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1909?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1909</a>)  New (HDK): <code>Path</code> has a <code>String&lt;TryInto&gt;</code> conversion for easy string representation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2544?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2306</a>)  New (HDK): There’s a new <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/link/fn.count_links.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>count_links</code></a> function that works like <code>get_links</code> but only returns a number. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2430?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2430</a>)  Bugfix (HDI): Fixed a problem with validation of private entry data, where <code>Op::to_type()</code> would fail for <code>StoreEntry</code> ops. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1910?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1910</a>)   Conductor APIs   New (admin API): <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/storage_info/struct.DnaStorageInfo.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>DnaStorageInfo</code></a> gives information about the data that is being stored for a DNA across all apps/cells that use it. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2147?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2147</a>)  New (admin API): <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#variant.DumpNetworkStats"><code>DumpNetworkStats</code></a> is an endpoint that lets you do diagnostics on the conductor. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2182?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2182</a>)  Bugfix (admin API): Supplying a network seed during <code>InstallApp</code> now properly updates the network seed for roles whose provisioning strategy is set to <code>None</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2102?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2102</a>)   <code>hc</code> CLI   There have been a lot of small documentation updates and bugfixes; you should find the dev experience slightly smoother now. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2125?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2125</a>)  Breaking: <code>hc sandbox run</code> now outputs a new string when an app port is successfully provisioned. If you’ve written tools to help you manage conductors via this command and are watching for this string, you may to update your code. See <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2320/files?ref=blog.holochain.org#diff-ededbc680fd88848f49dcf0bc4c373e14c916cfdaac39839d9eee262a46614a8R56-R60">this diff</a> for details.  Bugfix: A comma-separated argument passed to <code>hc sandbox generate --directories</code> is now parsed properly as multiple directories. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2080?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2080</a>)  New: <code>hc dna schema</code>, <code>hc app schema</code>, and <code>hc web-app schema</code> output JSON schemas for integration into your favourite IDE. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2138?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2138</a>)  New: <code>hc sandbox generate</code> has a new <code>in-process-lair</code> option, which comes with an associated changes to make <code>hc sandbox run</code> respect the config and only launch an out-of-process lair instance when required.  New: <code>hc dna pack</code> now takes a <code>--dylib-ios</code> option, which produces iOS-optimised WASM files. This is paired with a new <code>dylib</code> property in the zome manifest. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2218?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2218</a>)  New: The new <code>hc run-local-services</code> command runs a local WebRTC signal server whose URL can be passed to <code>hc sandbox generate network webrtc</code>, as well as a local bootstrap server. These aren’t appropriate for use as production servers; rather, they’re meant to be used during testing. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2265?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2265</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2353?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2353</a>)  <p>For more information, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.2.1/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">read the full changelog</a> for 0.2.1 all the way back to 0.2.0-beta-rc.0.</p> JavaScript client 0.15.0: Holochain 0.2 support <p>If you’re planning to update to the unstable Holochain 0.2.1, you’ll also want to update the JavaScript client in your hApp’s UI to 0.15.0. Here’s a list of changes:</p>  Breaking: The input params for the <code>networkInfo</code> API endpoint have been changed to match changes in the conductor API.  Breaking: The client and websocket classes have been refactored to accept <code>URL</code> objects rather than strings.  Breaking: Error responses from the conductor are thrown as new instances of <code>HolochainError</code>, which extends <code>Error</code>.  New/breaking: The dependency on the encryption package <code>tweetnacl</code> has been replaced with <code>@noble/ed25519</code>, because <code>tweetnacl</code> is getting old — so old that it didn’t support modern ES modules. This may break your build pipeline because your bundler will need to target ES2020 in order to support <code>BigInt</code>. The crypto module is imported conditionally — it’s only needed in Node.js, as browsers use the Web Crypto API instead.  New: When making a <code>WsClient</code> request, the client will try to reconnect automatically if the socket is closed.  New: admin API endpoints for <code>storageInfo</code>, <code>dumpNetworkStats</code>, and <code>updateCoordinators</code>.  Changed: The default timeout for API calls has been bumped from 15 seconds to 60 seconds.  <p>Read <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">all the changelogs</a> from v0.15.0 back to v0.13.0 to see everything that’s changed.</p> Tryorama 0.15.0-rc.1: Holochain 0.2 support <p>And of course, with an update to the JS client, Tryorama needs to change too. It inherits all the changes in the client, along with:</p>  Breaking: A local signal server (provided conveniently by <code>hc run-local-services</code>) is required for Tryorama tests, but optional for tests orchestrated by TryCP.  Breaking: With the update to Holochain 0.2.1, there’s a change in Tryorama that depends on a changed output from <code>hc sandbox run</code> on conductor startup.  Breaking: <code>runScenario</code> re-throws errors that it catches rather than consuming them.  Breaking: App websockets are decoupled from conductors, to better imitate real-life scenarios, in which different agents would not be using the same websocket to connect to their own conductor.  New: <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/main/docs/tryorama.dhtsync.md?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>dhtSync</code></a> is a new utility function that waits until two players’ views of the DHT are identical.  Changed: <code>runScenario</code> catches and outputs errors.  Optimisation (TryCP): App installations for a conductor, and conductor installations for a client, are done in parallel.  <p>Read <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">all the changelogs</a> from v0.15.0-rc.1 back to v0.13.0.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@innocentrip?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Suzuha Kozuki</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/expMk3K5v_c?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Eager to close the loop on corporate assets and improve threat protection, many global enterprises are looking for new ways to approach cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-zero-trust">Zero Trust framework</a>. Originally coined by former Forrester analyst John Kindervag in 2010, this dynamic strategy has the power to harden cyber defenses and take security to the next level.</p>
<p>However, implementing Zero Trust isn’t a walk in the park. In most cases, it’s a multi-year journey that requires company-wide effort to accomplish. Luckily, organizations can assess their progress and take guidance from the Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM).</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the basics of Zero Trust and how the maturity model can help you complete a successful implementation.</p>
 Zero Trust security explained 
<p>Zero Trust is based on the principle of “never trust, always verify.” It encompasses many cybersecurity tactics where access to data, networks, and infrastructure is kept to a minimum, and the legitimacy of that access is continuously authenticated. The combination of these various techniques layered on top of one another is what’s known as a Zero Trust architecture (ZTA).</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST), a ZTA is an enterprise cybersecurity strategy that applies Zero Trust principles to component relationships, workflow planning, and access control policies. In short, organizations that implement Zero Trust security take a hard stance against implicit trust, assuming that all users, devices, and cloud applications requesting network access may be potential threats.</p>
<p>Like any data security policy, the Zero Trust model aims to protect sensitive data and other corporate assets from unauthorized access and exposure. But, unlike traditional methods, it focuses not only on the network perimeter but on any and all vulnerabilities inside and out. Simply put, Zero Trust security assumes internal traffic isn’t any more trustworthy than traffic coming from outside the network.</p>
<p>This makes all the difference in today’s environment. With users needing to leverage critical work applications from anywhere, at any time, and on any device, organizations must adopt new policies that can flexibly adapt to their changing risk landscape.</p>
 Why is Zero Trust necessary? 
<p>The truth is that cybersecurity has never been more complex. In an era of rapid digital transformation and cloud acceleration, traditional network security tools don’t stand a chance of protecting sensitive data — and certainly not at the success rate expected of today’s organizations. Beholden to both compliance regulations and consumer responsibility, enterprises are under pressure to upgrade their cyber defenses and keep information under lock and key.</p>
 Attacks on the rise 
<p>Here’s the problem: Cyber threats are evolving and becoming more sophisticated over time. Yet, perimeter-based security controls are stuck in the past.</p>
<p>Take malware, for instance. This threat vector saw a rapid resurgence in 2022, climbing to a whopping <a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/medialibrary/en/infographic/mid-year-update-2022-sonicwall-cyber-threat-report.pdf">2.8 billion attacks</a> just one year after hitting a seven-year low. However, what’s more frightening is that hackers deployed over 270,000 malware variants, the likes of which security experts had never seen.</p>
<p>Traditional detection-based techniques rely on a combination of technology and human judgment — and with that comes human error. With an infrastructure based on implicit trust, it’s only a matter of time before an attack slips through the cracks and bypasses your cyber defenses.</p>
<p>Even worse, enterprises are dealing with an increasingly high volume and velocity of threat vectors. From ransomware and phishing to DDoS attacks and insider risks, organizations are under fire like never before. In fact, <a href="https://www.keepersecurity.com/ponemon2020.html">68% of businesses</a> around the world have experienced a cyber attack in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that successful attacks can have significant consequences. According to IBM, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">average cost of a data breach</a> is almost $4.5 million per incident. By 2025, global cybercrime will cost companies a combined <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/18/2129432/0/en/Cybercrime-To-Cost-The-World-10-5-Trillion-Annually-By-2025.html">$10.5 trillion annually</a> — up from $3 trillion in 2015.</p>
<p>Regardless of size, businesses simply can’t afford the long-tail costs of poor data security. Critical events can impact organizations in many ways, whether it be a prolonged business disruption or a major compliance violation. No matter the type of attack or how it originates, the mess created can take months, if not years, to clean up.</p>
 Digital transformation 
<p>These challenges are compounded by the recent and sudden transition to hybrid, cloud-first work environments.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated cloud transformation. In fact, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">McKinsey research</a> indicates the majority of organizations speeded the adoption of digital and cloud services by an average of seven years. Now, it’s predicted that the total amount of cloud data — which includes public, private, and government clouds — will <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/the-world-will-store-200-zettabytes-of-data-by-2025/">surpass 100 zettabytes</a> by 2025. For context, that’ll be over 50% of the world’s data at that time, up from 25% of what was stored in the cloud in 2015.</p>
<p>This surge is no doubt a response to the increasingly distributed work environment. Currently, <a href="https://owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2022">78% of global employees</a> prefer remote or hybrid to in-office work. So, more likely than not, flexible arrangements are here to stay. Unfortunately, this is putting a tremendous strain on enterprise security teams.</p>
<p>Not only are distributed workforces relying on cloud applications to stay productive, they’re also accessing them — alongside other network resources — on unmanaged devices. That means security teams cannot secure data in use or in movement to and from personal endpoints, creating a glaring hole in their perimeter. Worse yet, because cloud adoption continues to rise, these vulnerabilities are growing at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>Bottom line: With attack surfaces stretched thin, existing cyber defenses are inadequate against a growing swarm of potential risks.</p>
 What is the Zero Trust Maturity Model? 
<p>Developed by the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> is a roadmap for transitioning to a Zero Trust architecture. The model, originally intended for federal agencies, aims to help organizations leverage Zero Trust principles and better protect sensitive assets.</p>
<p>CISA released version 1.0 in September 2021, as directed by President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">executive order</a> on cybersecurity. An updated version, released in April 2023, added a fourth maturity stage alongside additional guidance on Zero Trust implementation.</p>
<p>The model reflects the <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">seven tenets</a> of the Zero Trust framework, as established by the NIST:</p>
 
 All data sources and computing services are considered resources.
<p>Translation: Networks are composed of many devices, applications, and other resources that may have access to enterprise-owned assets. Therefore, they should be treated as potential risks.</p> 
 All communication is secured regardless of network location.
<p>Translation: Location alone doesn’t imply trust. Access shouldn’t be automatically granted based on the device being on enterprise network infrastructure. Regardless of where a request originates, it must meet the same security requirements.</p> 
 Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis.
<p>Translation: Just because a device is trusted in a previous session doesn’t mean it should be inherently trusted for the next. Each session must be authenticated so that the user’s identity can be continuously validated.</p> 
 Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy.
<p>Translation: Authorization decisions should take external sensors into consideration. This includes a user’s location, device, and real-time application context.</p> 
 The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated assets.
<p>Translation: No device or asset receives implicit trust. Every request triggers a security posture assessment, and all assets are continuously monitored to ensure they’re updated, safe, and uncompromised.</p> 
 All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed.
<p>Translation: Trust is granted on an ongoing basis, factoring in a myriad of elements before making an enforcement decision.</p> 
 The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of assets, network infrastructure, and communications and uses it to improve its security posture.
<p>Translation: Collecting analytics and insights on assets can enhance decision-making and avoid risky approvals.</p> 
 
<p>These tenets lay the groundwork for an effective ZTA and are therefore essential to achieving Zero Trust maturity. As we dive into the model in more detail, it’s best to keep these principles in mind.</p>
 The levels of Zero Trust maturity 
<p>CISA created the ZTMM to help agency IT departments strengthen their security postures through a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/05/the-critical-role-of-clm-for-zero-trust-today-and-pq-tomorrow/">Zero Trust strategy</a>. However, its highly prescriptive nature lends itself to organizations of all varieties, outlining actions that any enterprise can take to better protect sensitive information.</p>
<p>The four levels of Zero Trust maturity include:</p>
 
 Traditional: At the most basic level, organizations have manually configured lifecycles and attribute assignments, static security policies and solutions that only address one pillar at a time, and siloed policy enforcement capabilities. 
 
 
 Initial: Organizations at this stage start to automate configurations, attribute assignments and enforcement decisions. They begin implementing responsive changes to least privilege after provisioning and aggregate more visibility into internal systems. 
 
 
 Advanced: Enterprises use automated controls for lifecycle configurations, attribute assignments, and cross-pillar coordination. They have centralized visibility and identity control. They’re also able to enforce integrated policies across pillars and dynamically make changes to least privilege based on risk and posture assessments. They’re actively building toward enterprise-level awareness. 
 
 
 Optimal: At the most mature level, organizations have fully automated lifecycles and assignments of attributes to assets and resources that self-report with dynamic policies based on automated triggers. 
 
<p>Generally, these maturity stages represent the ideal progression from a traditional security stature to one that features dynamic updates, automated processes, integrated capabilities, and other best practices.</p>
 5 pillars of Zero Trust maturity 
<p>The ZTMM consists of five main pillars, each with its own individual and cross-functional security controls. By addressing these areas, organizations create a comprehensive and adaptive security framework.</p>
 1. Identity 
<p>Perhaps the most important pillar, identity focuses on user access management in a dynamic environment, emphasizing continuous validation and behavioral analysis. Why? Because in a post-perimeter world, people are at the forefront of security.</p>
<p>According to Verizon, <a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/">over 80% of breaches due to hacking</a> involve lost or stolen credentials. Zero Trust mitigates this risk by enforcing a policy of least-privilege access. In short, this means users are only allowed to access resources that are essential to their role, thus preventing lateral movement in case of a breach.</p>
 2. Devices 
<p>The ZTMM defines a device as any asset — including hardware, software, firmware, etc. — that connects to a network, including servers, computers, printers, mobile phones, IoT devices, and so on.</p>
<p>Regardless if the device is enterprise-owned or not, Zero Trust advocates for maintaining an inventory of all assets with network access. By enhancing visibility into these devices, organizations can keep tabs on their configurations, associated vulnerabilities, and patch requirements.</p>
 3. Networks 
<p>A network is considered any open communications medium used to transport messages. That includes internal and wireless networks, the Internet as a whole, as well as cellular and application-level channels.</p>
<p>Organizations that have a mature <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/a-zero-trust-framework-for-the-new-hybrid-workforce/">Zero Trust architecture</a> focus less on perimeter-based security and more on managing internal and external traffic flows. This allows them to isolate risks, enforce encryption, and practice “microsegmentation” — the process of breaking the network down into pieces, thereby creating boundaries that keep threats at bay.</p>
 4. Applications and Workloads 
<p>This pillar encompasses all systems, computer programs, and services that execute on-premises, on mobile devices, and in the cloud. This area is of particular importance now that the majority of businesses are adopting cloud services at lightning speeds.</p>
<p>According to the ZTMM, organizations should apply granular access control and threat protection policies capable of mitigating application-specific threats.</p>
 5. Data 
<p>Data at rest, in use, or in motion — it doesn’t matter. Zero Trust principles say that all structured and unstructured files and fragments should be continuously monitored, encrypted, categorized, and labeled regardless of where or how they’re stored.</p>
<p>Specifically, organizations should deploy mechanisms to detect and prevent data exfiltration. The ZTMM also says it’s best to craft and review governance policies to ensure security procedures are enforced across the enterprise.</p>
 Cross-cutting capabilities 
<p>Additionally, CISA’s maturity model also outlines three “cross-cutting capabilities” that organizations are meant to use throughout their Zero Trust journey. They’re intended to support interoperability and cross-functionality, thus weaving together the five pillars.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
 
 Visibility and Analytics: Increases line of sight, informs policy decision-making, and facilitates response activities in case of threat detection 
 Automation and Orchestration: Leverages analytics and other insights to streamline operations and mitigate security risks as they arise 
 Governance: Enables organizations to manage and monitor their regulatory, legal, environmental, federal, and operational requirements 
 
<p>Strengthening these abilities is key to a fast and effective Zero Trust migration. Organizations can conduct a maturity assessment to better understand where they’re currently at in their journey. Once you’ve evaluated and identified your stage, you can implement CISA’s guidance for progressing to the next phase of maturity.</p>
 Identity Access Management: The foundation of Zero Trust 
<p>Mobile and cloud-first transformations have erased the traditional security perimeter. In its place stands a distributed, decentralized, and sprawling environment. With threats looming on the horizon, secure access is a must-have for enterprises of all shapes and sizes — if only it were that easy.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is Zero Trust is a complex, multi-year commitment. The good news? There are ways to simplify the process.</p>
<p>Users are your first line of defense in today’s threat landscape, but they’re also your greatest risk. Protecting identities is key to preventing unauthorized access and exposure — that’s why Identity Access Management (IAM) is a pivotal first step in the right direction.</p>
<p>At Entrust, we designed our comprehensive IAM portfolio to empower organizations as they begin their Zero Trust journey. Our solutions use a variety of technologies to help you protect identities, secure data, and safeguard applications, including:</p>

				  Adopting new technologies can be a daunting task, tying up resources and taking much longer than planned. Better the broken system you know than the new system breaking in ways you never anticipated! Verifiable credential technology was designed to minimize all these adoption problems. How? Read on! 
<p>New to decentralized identity? A good place to start would be the <a href="https://indicio.tech/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">Beginner’s Guide!</a></p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials enable high value data to be shared seamlessly and verified instantly — without having to check in with the source of the data, or the data itself having to be stored and managed by a third party. New technologies enable you to instantly trust, cryptographically, both the source of the credential, and the authenticity of the data stored inside.</p>
<p>The ability to use this immediately actionable data to create more seamless processes is a powerful value proposition. With verifiable credentials you can create an identity and verification layer that can transform the creaky, fraud and security nightmare that is Web 2.0 — if, and only if, it’s easy to implement, right?</p>
<p>The specter haunting IT is lifting and shifting to new systems. Spiraling costs and receding deadlines make the new, shiny thing a difficult bet. And then there are the risks of sudden obsolescence (the newer, shinier thing) or vendor lock-in to a system that’s suddenly a lot more costly to run and update.</p>
<p>There are a few ways verifiable credential technology enables safer, smarter digital transformation.</p>
<p>1. You don’t need to replace your existing system. Verifiable credentials and decentralized identity can be added as a layer that orchestrates your existing identity and access management systems and cloud services. This means you can slowly transform your systems at a pace that’s comfortable and cost effective.</p>
<p>2. Off-the-shelf ecosystems and solutions are available to create this layer, you can build as much or as little as you want in-house.</p>
<p>3. You can choose open-source solutions. Open source means freedom from vendor lock-in. Not only can you build on a system you fully own in a way that meets your needs, you get to benefit from a community of developers constantly innovating on the codebase.</p>
<p>Start simple and small</p>
<p>At Indicio, we believe in starting small and picking a simple use case. It doesn’t matter whether you are an SME or a global corporation. Learn how the technology works by solving a simple problem and then expand. Often once our customers discover how easy it is to implement and use verifiable credentials, they quickly hit the scale button.</p>
<p>A typical customer journey might look something like this when learning about, experiencing, and then implementing verifiable credentials:</p>
<p>Depending on your technical background, you might want to start with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3LvHy3eIPsnRX3W06q6dpsciH1FoPFxt">demo video</a> or <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/comprehensive-introduction-to-decentralized-identity-workshop/">hands-on workshop,</a> where you get to issue, hold, and verify a credential.</p>
<p>For the next step you can explore the <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-sandbox/">Proven™ Sandbox,</a> where you can develop and demonstrate a proof-of-concept using a constrained version of our complete verifiable data ecosystem solution, Proven — with support from the Indicio team.</p>

 Purpose of Challenge <p>The objective of this data challenge was to develop machine learning models that accurately assess risk in supply chain transportation vehicles of perishable goods such as livestock and food&nbsp;items.</p><p>It’s summertime and humidity is a problem in most of the western world this summer. This data challenge sought to understand the impact temperature and humidity have on the lifecycle of a given supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Supply chain management has been in flames in recent years. This challenge scratched the surface to learn how machine learning and artificial intelligence streamline and improve efficiency and sustainable practice in the transportation of perishable goods and&nbsp;animals.</p> Winners are as&nbsp;follows: <p>First place: Mohammad Jamali ($2500&nbsp;Prize)</p><p>Mohammed took a unique approach to analyze the dataset provided and drew conclusions that were not initially thought of at the origin of this experiment hosted by Ocean Protocol. Mohammad's report included in-depth heat mats that helped us understand the geolocation and internal weather conditions in a new light. This paper sought the best way to find the correlation between the timestamp and temperature to approach the problem as a classification task. This was done by segmenting the timestamp as an example into 24 one-hour intervals or classes and assigning temperature values to these segments. By doing so, it became possible to estimate the likelihood of specific temperature ranges occurring within each time&nbsp;segment.</p><p>Second place: Marco Rodrigues ($1500&nbsp;Prize)</p><p>Marco dug deep through the data set to prove how some hours of the day are warmer than others. This makes perfect sense and is verified by sound data regression models. This metric became interesting when comparing external weather temperature to the temperature inside the shipping vehicle temperature used for this data challenge. Marco’s report used sound data polishing tactics, extensive diagrams, and data visualization. He also used the data set to expose natural weather humidity levels in the context of this challenge.</p><p>Third Place: Andrey Bessalov ($1000&nbsp;Prize)</p><p>Andrey built cutting-edge clusters by using weather features and concluded the best factors concluding the ideal conditions inside the vehicle. They are medium temperature, medium humidity, low wind, no snow, no rain. Andrey cleaned and visualized the dataset provided in terrific detail. From this report, we can assume the best conditions and humidity levels for shipping perishable goods.</p><p>There were 12 total submissions to this challenge, less than previous challenges which reach between 20–40 submissions. This challenge was a bit more challenging than others with the use of in-vehicle sensor data, IoT data, temperature and humidity metrics. Specs on the challenge itself can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://desights.ai/g/challenge/10">here</a>.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how AI and ML can impact a real-world business case like supply chain management? This challenge was an indicator of that. Or, curious about how the performance of your supply chain is mitigating risk in handling shipping logistics and humidity? Let us know in our community channels, and your protocol may be selected next to run a data challenge on.</p><p>Congratulations to the winners, and thank you to all the participants for their hard work and dedication.

<p>In early July, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/14/analysis-of-storm-0558-techniques-for-unauthorized-email-access/">Storm-0558</a> where a Chinese threat actor used forged authentication tokens to access the information – primarily email accounts – of about 25 organizations. This attack included some significant organizations including the US Department of Commerce and, reportedly, the US Ambassador to China. The attack was particularly concerning because Microsoft revealed that the attacker was forging Azure AD tokens using an acquired Microsoft account signing key. &nbsp; In Microsoft’s words, "Though the key was intended only for MSA accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be trusted for signing Azure AD tokens. This issue has been corrected."</p>  
<p>(CISA has posted guidance for addressing the threat <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-193a">here</a>.&nbsp; Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/19/expanding-cloud-logging-to-give-customers-deeper-security-visibility/">expanded licensing for Purview</a> to include companies that do not have an E5/G5 license.)</p> 
 What This Means for Defenders  
 Wiz stated in their research, “Identity provider’s signing keys are probably the most powerful secrets in the modern world.”&nbsp; As identity experts, we agree.&nbsp; Attacks like this look like entirely legitimate authentication and, without additional monitoring, can pass undetected for significant periods of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
 HYPR Adapt and Updating Monitoring  
<p>On July 26, we announced <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> which helps organizations to maintain real-time risk assessment and adaptive security controls.&nbsp; In other words, it’s entirely focused on protecting authentication by detecting anomalous activity and taking action such as requiring re-authentication.</p> 
<p>While Microsoft believes that Storm-0558 has been mitigated, it’s instructive to look at how monitoring could be employed to address scenarios where their MSA or Azure AD signing keys have been compromised.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>One of the key observations is that because of Adapt’s ability to deploy Policy as Code, it can be quickly updated with new policies based on recently identified threats known as IOC and IOA.&nbsp; Once the risk has been identified, HYPR Adapt takes targeted action against the identified risk.&nbsp; These patterns can be detected and action taken to revoke access or mitigate the impact of a newly identified identity threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 How it Works  
<p>Below are the implementation steps to prevent identity-based attacks in the event that a Microsoft signing key is compromised.&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Configuring HYPR ADAPT to ingest Azure Audit logs requires only a simple webhook client configuration, from there HYPR ADAPT will receive all Audit entries from Azure ( in the case of STORM-0558, this would be the Audit. Exchange logs.)  
  As the logs enter HYPR ADAPT they are transformed into datasets that can be leveraged for policy evaluation. As noted earlier, the flexibility of policy as code allows any of the information in these datasets to be computed and evaluated.&nbsp;  
  The HYPR Adapt policy will evaluate the user’s events by looking for the MailItemsAccessed event from Microsoft and will determine if this is an event that’s potentially generated using a token generated by a compromised MSA key. This is done using a combination of the user’s behavior such as applications, and client ids typically used, the token issuance process, and additional metadata that is evaluated in real-time.&nbsp;  
  If the HYPR Adapt policy determines the token is maliciously generated and utilized, it will terminate that token on Azure AD and the user will be asked to immediately re-authenticate. If the policy is not breached, the user will not be interrupted.&nbsp;  
  
<p></p> 
<p>The HYPR Adapt policy can also be implemented to alert the enterprise SOC or similar to be notified and react to any indicators of compromise. However, we believe that having actionable insights and policies that can be executed in real-time is critical for reacting to threats quickly and decisively with accuracy. This is what HYPR Adapt is enabling our customers to do!&nbsp;</p> 
 Maintaining Vigilance  
<p>Microsoft indicated in early July that Storm 0558 has been fully mitigated.&nbsp; Smart security teams are continuing to look for other examples where compromised tokens are being utilized to create new attack vectors.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Finding evidence of attack in the rearview mirror is now insufficient.&nbsp; Risk assessment needs to include the ability to automatically take action to defend against identity threats while minimizing the overall impact to the user experience.

<p>I must admit that I enjoy the convenience of e-commerce shopping. Grocery delivery is just incredibly convenient with my busy schedule. I value my time and want to make sure that I’m working smarter, not harder. But I sometimes find that the online payment process can take a while, especially if I do not feel comfortable storing my card details on merchant websites.</p>
<p>Consumer-preferred payment methods for e-commerce transactions are very dynamic and depend on the situation. So, to learn more about cardholder payment preferences, we recently surveyed 1,000 cardholders. We also asked the respondents how they typically complete an e-commerce transaction. We discovered that more than half of respondents (53%) indicated that they opt to either use the stored card on file or use an expedited checkout button for an easier checkout experience.</p>
<p>Providing the highest level of security for e-commerce payments is possible</p>
<p>Even though both methods are equally convenient for the cardholder, banks that provide the ability to use an expedited checkout button are providing an additional layer of security. This is because the payment information can be tokenized, if the card is pushed to the provider from the bank app.</p>
<p>Thanks to tokenization, card numbers are replaced by encrypted tokens, bringing more security to consumers when it comes to using a digital card to pay. The token is linked to a specific use case and device; e.g., the token can only be used on merchant page x and only from device y. Meaning should the data become compromised, it will not be of use for the fraudster. Providing tokenization and token management capabilities can empower the cardholder with more security and self-service options. And security is a major concern for the cardholder, as we have seen in our recent survey.</p>
<p>Banks can combine this with convenience: Expedited checkout buttons allow the consumer to pay faster online. While those options are proposed by the merchants, banks can also offer an option to push provision cards to digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, Click to Pay, Amazon Pay, PayPal, etc. from the banking app. The advantage is that the cardholder does not have to store the card information on file, and it is faster and more secure than typing in the actual PAN/card info on the merchant website.</p>
<p>Contactless payment and accelerated e-commerce checkout experiences will drive the next evolution in consumer payments, and banks will need to jump on the bandwagon if they want to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Entrust offers push provisioning to third-party wallets, and we now also <a href="https://go.entrust.com/click-to-pay-whitepaper-A">offer push provisioning to Click to Pay</a> for seamless and accelerated e-commerce checkout while providing the highest level of security. Click to Pay, and the enrollment from the banking app, gives cardholders the benefit of a seamless e-commerce checkout experience. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWITpLAlmbg">video</a> shows how the enrollment and payment experience works with Click to Pay.</p>
<p>While physical payment cards remain preferred for in-person transactions, Click to Pay will reignite competition in the virtual checkout lane. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/06/why-banks-should-offer-both-physical-and-digital-card-issuance/">Banks should consider offering a seamless payment portfolio, offering both digital and physical payment options</a>.</p>

 Everything you need to know about PVID. Discover why you need a PVID-certified identity verification provider to unlock the potential of remote identity proofing today. 



 



<p>One in four companies in France are affected by fraud.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">Identity theft</a>, which is often the preferred technique of fraudsters, affects companies disproportionately, with 14% of French companies attacked revealing they suffered <a href="https://www.allianz-trade.fr/actualites/etude-fraude-2021.html">a loss of more than €100,000</a>. In an attempt to protect companies and customers from the threat of online fraud, <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ANSSI</a> (National Safety and Security Agency) rolled out a framework in 2021: the (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) Remote Identity Verification Providers (PVID) standard.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr">ACPR</a> (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution) quickly mandated that financial and banking institutions should use this standard.</p>



<p>(We are now PVID-certified! Read more about our PVID-standard identity verification services in our recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/pvid-certification-idcheck-io-and-videoident/">press release.)</a></p>



<p>All service providers that wish to comply with the Financial Markets Code (FMC) in France for remote onboarding are also required to meet the same requirements. So how do you select the right PVID-certified  provider for you?</p>



 What is the PVID standard? 



<p>To reduce identity theft, the PVID standard requires providers to offer a certified service that is equivalent to face-to-face.</p>



<p>The PVID-standard goal was developed to add due diligence measures to the remote identity verification process to ensure financial and banking institutions comply with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5th AML Directive</a>&nbsp;by using robust and effective ANSSI-certified solutions. Key to becoming certified as a PVID-standard provider is being able to offer reliable identity verification that is equivalent to face-to-face experience, or a&nbsp;high level&nbsp;of assurance of identity theft prevention.</p>



 How can you become PVID certified? 



<p>Nowadays, all remote ID verification providers that wish to comply with the FMC’s requirements regarding remote onboarding must be ANSSI certified.</p>



<p>Service providers must prove that their services comply with all&nbsp;technical and organizational requirements&nbsp;as dictated by the March 2021 ANSSI standard.</p>



 What steps are involved in the PVID certification process? 



  The service provider submits its application to ANSSI, which delegates a certification agent to the applicant.<br>  Evaluation tasks are carried out to ensure the remote service is equivalent to the face-to-face experience, and that biometrics, ID document verification, micro payments and other aspects of the technology (including its Qualified Electronic Signature functionality) are safe and secure.<br><br>As part of the certification process, ANSSI collaborates with the Bureau of Document Fraud of the <a href="https://www.police-nationale.interieur.gouv.fr/Organisation/Direction-Centrale-de-la-Police-Aux-Frontieres">Central Directorate of Border Police</a>, and the Documents Department of the <a href="https://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/pjgn/ircgn/presentation/the-gendarmerie-forensic-institute-model-english-version">Criminal Research Institute of the National Gendarmerie</a>.  



  If the applicant meets the requirements, the ANSSI will issue a certification, and the remote identity verification provider will then be able to meet the banks’ requirements.  



 3 steps to the PVID standard. 



  Video capture of document data and user’s face: Our identity verification services enable the dynamic capture of an ID document and ID holder’s face, which is cross-referenced during analysis.<br>  Automated and manual data verification: Completed in two steps, identity verification is first conducted through automated document analysis (via optical character recognition and deep learning algorithms.) The second step is manual analysis, which is completed by trained fraud operators.<br>  Creation of evidence file and result submission: Containing the identification data as well as submission results, evidence files are kept for the duration required, and available in case of disputes. Results are also submitted to the company and includes the identity of the user, the dynamic captures of the document and ID holder’s face, and, in case of failure, the reason for the analysis failure.  



 What to consider when choosing a PVID provider. 



<p>All <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/solution-pvid/">PVID certified providers</a> are compliant with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fr/glossaire/lcb-ft-5-directive/">LCB-FT 5</a> (The French equivalent of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD)</a>. So what should you consider when choosing a provider? What sets apart a good PVID provider from a bad one?</p>



  User experience: Which provider offers the most intuitive experience?<br>  Processing time: Which provider completes the verification process the fastest?<br>  Document processing capability: The ability to process a variety of documents<br>  Geographic coverage: Does the provider have multi-geographical coverage?<br>  Size of product portfolio: What other solutions are offered by the provider?<br>  Offering <a href="https://www.idnow.io/esign/">Qualified Electronic Signature</a> functionality.<br>  Capturing documents in real time, web and mobile SDKs enable the capture process to be integrated through different channels: directly from the service provider’s website, or application, in an email path or via SMS.  



 One identity verification provider for many regulations. 



<p>Ensuring you meet the myriad of different regulatory requirements across regions, countries and jurisdictions can take significant time and effort, and stifle and inhibit growth and innovation. However, not offering a PVID-standard identity verification service could result in substantial fines, penalties, and reputational damage.</p>



<p>At IDnow, we are committed to helping global businesses navigate the complex regulatory landscape in order to drive growth and scale with ease. Adding to our&nbsp;expansive regulatory certification&nbsp;and expertise across Europe, our latest PVID certification for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">IDCheck.io</a> demonstrates once again the integrity, security and strength of our remote identity proofing services – a certified service that you can trust anytime, anywhere.</p>

<p>In an era where digital transformation is rapidly reshaping industries, businesses face mounting challenges in safeguarding their sensitive information and ensuring user authentication is both secure and seamless.Yet they cannot afford to continue treating security as an endlessly growing cost center that takes time and resources from other strategic priorities. Recognizing the strong demand for more robust security solutions that also serve as a revenue accelerator, Forrester, a renowned research firm, conducted a Total Economic Impact (TEI) study of HYPR. The study reveals impressive key findings that underscore the significance and fiscal impact of modern authentication in enhancing business performance and reducing risk.</p>

 Understanding the Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) Study  
<p>Forrester's TEI methodology is a well-regarded approach to assessing the potential economic impact of implementing specific technologies within an organization. The study analyzed data gathered from five organizations that had already adopted HYPR Authenticate. All data was gathered directly by Forrester, without HYPR involvement, so that participants would answer freely. The research evaluated the financial and operational benefits experienced by these companies, providing valuable insights into the value of passwordless MFA in real-world scenarios.</p> 
<p>Based on these interviews, Forrester constructed a composite company which models the results experienced by the real-life companies. In this case, Forrester modeled HYPR’s results by looking at a 10,000 person company with $5B annual revenue in a highly regulated industry such as banking.</p> 
 Key Findings from the TEI of HYPR Study  
 ROI of 324%  
<p>One of the most remarkable findings from the TEI study was the impressive Return on Investment (ROI) that may be experienced by organizations implementing HYPR's passwordless MFA solution. Forrester reported an ROI of 324%, indicating that the benefits far outweighed the costs associated with adoption and integration. For the composite company, this amounted to a present value (PV) of $8.1 million realized in total benefits over a three-year period.</p> 
 More than $2.7 Million Savings in Business Risk Related to Data Breaches  
<p>Data breaches and cyberattacks pose a significant threat to businesses of all sizes. Forrester's study calculated a savings of more than $2.7 million (PV) in business risk from breaches for the composite company over three years. . By eliminating passwords and adopting stronger authentication methods, organizations using HYPR Authenticate can effectively mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to critical systems and sensitive data.</p> 
 95% Reduction in Help Desk Support Costs Related to Passwords  
<p>Passwords are not only a security risk but also a common source of frustration for users. The study found that with HYPR Authenticate, organizations witnessed a 95% reduction in help desk costs related to passwords, worth more than $2.5 million (PV) in a three-year period to the composite organization. This reduction was attributed to a decline in password-related issues, such as password resets and account lockouts, which traditionally necessitate user support.</p> 
 $2.7 million Savings in End User Productivity  
<p>User experience plays a crucial role in driving business productivity and an inefficient user experience can be an immense drain on capital. The TEI study demonstrated that employees of organizations using HYPR Authenticate have less downtime and spend less time logging in , resulting in more than $2.7 million (PV) in savings over three years for the composite organization. The elimination of passwords simplifies the authentication process, enabling users to access systems and applications seamlessly and with a more streamlined workflow.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Importantly, the research demonstrated that employees using HYPR Authenticate log into their systems 30% faster than employees using traditional authentication methods. This helps to speed user acceptance and adoption of the new solution.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>Forrester's TEI study for HYPR offers valuable insights into the impact of passwordless MFA on businesses. The study's key findings demonstrate and quantify, based on real HYPR customer data, the immense potential of passwordless MFA in enhancing security, improving user productivity, and delivering substantial financial benefits.</p> 
<p>As businesses strive to meet the growing demands of a digitally driven world, adopting innovative solutions like passwordless MFA becomes a strategic imperative. By leveraging HYPR, businesses can create a more secure, efficient, and user-friendly environment for employees and customers alike, ensuring they are better equipped to navigate the challenges of the digital age.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, we take great measures to secure our physical belongings, such as locking our homes and storing valuables in safes. However, when it comes to our online safety, we often wonder how to protect ourselves effectively. The answer is simple: we need to be proactive in our internet usage. With the internet playing an integral role in our daily lives, it’s crucial to understand the risks it presents, including cyberattacks, identity theft, malware, and phishing scams. In the year 2022, India experienced a staggering 13.91 Lakh cyber security incidents, as revealed by Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the Minister of State for Electronics and Information and Technology, during his address to the Parliament on 10th Feb 2023. The accessibility of data in the digital era has made it valuable globally, but it has also exposed us to risks such as data breaches and identity theft. India has experienced significant financial losses, reputation damage, and identity theft due to data breaches. Therefore, safeguarding personal information becomes crucial for our protection.</p><blockquote>So, how can we ensure online safety? One potential solution to reduce or prevent data breaches is self-sovereign identity (SSI). Let’s explore what SSI is and how it can safeguard our digital identities and mitigate data breaches.</blockquote><p>India’s Cybersecurity Landscape: A Wake-Up&nbsp;Call:</p><p>Data breaches and identity theft have been on the rise in India, resulting in substantial financial losses, reputation damage, and identity theft. Based on real-world data gathered from 550 businesses between March 2021 and March 2022, a breach of approximately 29,500 records led to a 25% increase in the average cost of data breaches. Hackers employ various techniques like hacking, phishing, and malware to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. The consequences extend beyond financial losses, tarnishing the reputation of individuals, businesses, and entire&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>Numerous high-profile data breaches affecting millions of individuals worldwide highlight the urgency of adopting robust security measures.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): A Solution for Data&nbsp;Breaches</p><p>Can SSI protect your data from hackers? Absolutely. <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a> is a user-centric, decentralized approach to digital identity. With SSI, individuals have full control over their personal information, deciding what to share, with whom, and how. SSI utilizes blockchain technology, ensuring that all identity-related transactions are securely recorded in an immutable and tamper-evident manner. In other words, individuals no longer need to rely on centralized authorities to authenticate their identity or ownership of personal information. Users possess a portable, privacy-preserving digital identity that can be verified both online and&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Taking Control: How SSI Can Safeguard Your&nbsp;Data</p><p>How does self-sovereign identity prevent data breaches? Data breaches occur when hackers gain unauthorized access to personal information, including usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data. This stolen data can be used for fraudulent activities, identity theft, or sold on the dark web. SSI provides a highly secure and private identity and data protection solution by eliminating the reliance on centralized identity systems, making it extremely challenging for hackers to breach the system. In an SSI ecosystem, personal data is stored on an individual’s device, such as a smartphone or computer, and shared only with chosen entities. Even if a hacker gains access to a user’s device, they can only access the data explicitly authorized by the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials: Building Trust in a Digital&nbsp;World</p><p><a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials(VCs)</a> play a crucial role in SSI, allowing individuals to authenticate their identity and ownership of personal data without depending on a centralized authority. Each transaction involving personal information is securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. The public-private key architecture further enhances data protection, as individuals retain complete control over their information and sharing permissions.</p><p>In conclusion</p><p>In an era defined by digitalization, safeguarding personal information from data breaches has become a paramount concern. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) emerges as a powerful solution that empowers individuals to take control of their data while leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology. By embracing SSI and collaborating with trusted providers like AyanWorks, individuals and organizations can strengthen their digital identities and proactively combat the risks associated with data breaches.</p><p><a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> is a leading provider of user-centric solutions that enable organizations to maintain control over their digital identities and data.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>With the increase in automation, there are new cybersecurity threats that need to be addressed, and in order to address the new cybersecurity threats, there are a few technological challenges that need to be understood.</p>
<p>The first challenge is the availability and quality of training data that is required for training cybersecurity-related ML models. This data almost always contains massive amounts of sensitive information – intellectual property, PII, or otherwise strictly regulated data – which companies aren’t willing to share with security vendors. Formal verification and testing of machine learning models is a massive challenge of its own. Making sure that an AI-based cybersecurity product does not misbehave under real-world conditions, or indeed under adversarial examples specifically crafted to deceive ML models is something that vendors are still figuring out, and in many cases, this is only possible through a collaboration with customers.</p>
<p>The field of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, so while in many applications, it’s perfectly fine to train a model once and then use it for years. Cyber threat models must be continuously updated, expanded, and retrained on newly discovered vulnerabilities and attack vectors.</p>
 Recommendations 
<p>While automation is currently in the spotlight, the role of humans cannot be underestimated. In fact, automation was intended to enable humans to focus on priority tasks with reduced effort rather than replacing them. Thus, to secure the autonomous world against cyber threats, organizations and cybersecurity experts must embrace a collaborative working environment between humans and technology. By combining human expertise and automation tools, organizations can create an effective threat intelligence framework to identify, respond and mitigate threats. This can be achieved by real-time monitoring and analysis of user behavior, network traffic, and activity logs. This will allow organizations to identify threats related to data theft and bypass the automation systems using a disguise to infiltrate critical systems in real-time.</p>
<p>One thing which automation currently lacks is contextual understanding. Policies and procedures need to be robust to fill contextual gaps, which will allow the software to not cause disruption in business activities. Human expertise can support in cases of critical decision-making. Finally, cybersecurity professionals should be equipped to tackle ever-evolving cyber threats towards autonomous machines.</p>
 Moving Forward 
<p>The relevance of the autonomous world will continue to increase in the coming years. With more and more organizations from various sectors embracing initiatives such as digital transformation and the power of AI and machine learning, there will be a proportional increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks. By addressing the security challenges and reinforcing the cybersecurity infrastructure, organizations will truly be able to extract the potential of automation.</p>

 The PVID certifications issued by ANSSI for the automated IDCheck.io identity proofing service and the videochat-based VideoIdent mark a new milestone in the identity proofing service provider’s desire to become the leading European player on the digital identity market. 



<p>Munich, August 1, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, has obtained the remote identity verification <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/produits-certifies/prestataires-de-verification-didentite-a-distance-pvid/">certification known as PVID</a> (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) on the level “substantial” for its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/solution-pvid/">IDCheck.io Identity Proofing Service</a> and VideoIdent Qualified Electronic Signature. A symbol of the culmination of months of collaboration and involvement of all teams, this certification demonstrates the company’s desire to offer its customers solutions that are safe, compliant, and fully in line with the regulations in France.</p>



<p>PVID – European leadership in digital and financial security</p>



<p>In a society where transactions have become considerably digitized and are now mostly done remotely, the risk of identity theft has increased, particularly in the banking and financial sector. This is why the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information, the ANSSI) established a new framework defining stricter requirements of identity verification providers. The new standard leads the way for select identity providers to effectively fight against fraud – a singular goal across rigorous Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws in France and throughout Europe. PVID raises cybersecurity standards for traditional finance, digital finance, trust services, and beyond.</p>



<p>Introduced in March 2021, PVID certifies providers the ability to offer identity verification as defined by Europe’s Regulation on Electronic Identification and Trust Services, eIDAS Regulation. Where eIDAS establishes European levels of security to meet the equivalence of a face-to-face verification for various use cases, PVID implements these levels of security to enable compliant digital onboarding for banking and other financial services in France. The certification, issued for two years, allows highly regulated banking or FinServ players to access a robust, secure service offering, thus enabling remote identification while reducing the risk of identity fraud.</p>



<p>France is the first country in the European Union to have established an effective policy for remote identity verification, and was followed by the work of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-among-first-etsi-ts-119-461-certification/">European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) on the ETSI TS 119 461 standard</a>, which pursues a similar purpose.</p>



<p>An undeniable competitive advantage in the digital identity proofing market </p>



<p>As only the second private player to obtain the coveted certification, IDnow has a major advantage in the digital identity proofing market. The certified IDCheck.io Identity Proofing Service and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent Qualified Electronic Signature</a> offer customers a trusted onboarding process that meets the security requirements of the ACPR (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution) and supports the fight against money laundering and fraud. The solutions allow banks to offer flexible, simple, and fast digital paths to improve conversion rates through 100% remote identification, equivalent to a face-to-face process.</p>



<p>“Obtaining PVID certification is a source of great pride and validation for IDnow and a real recognition of our expertise in the digital identity market in France,” comments Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow. </p>



<p>“As the regulatory landscape aims to extend its reach to additional digital services across Europe, PVID offers national regulators an example of a consistent framework that places privacy and security at its forefront. Beyond France, PVID represents one more step for IDnow in its ambition to offer its customers the most secure solutions certified by reference organizations, such as ANSSI. Standards like PVID or TS 119 461 have the potential to be building blocks for future onboarding regulations across geographies and applications, like digital identity wallets. The experience gained from PVID or our contribution to writing TS 119 461 will prove invaluable, and few companies will be able to advise customers as well as IDnow on navigating in this sphere,” adds Rayissa.</p>

  <p>In this increasingly digital world, identity is the most attacked surface area, and the sophistication and frequency of attacks continue to rise. Manual investigations and responses can’t keep pace. We need to think differently about how we protect identities from compromise and respond rapidly to emerging threats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID Protection (recently renamed from Azure AD Identity Protection) helps stop attacks before they happen. ID Protection blocks identity takeovers in real-time and automates attack mitigation by providing advanced machine learning (ML)-based detections, risk-based access policies, and comprehensive risk reports and insights. To protect customers with our latest innovations, we’re excited to announce key enhancements to Microsoft Entra ID Protection: a brand-new dashboard to provide key insights, new detections to block existing attacks, a new mechanism for Microsoft to rapidly protect users from emerging threats, and the integration with Microsoft 365 Defender. Read below to learn more about these exciting new features. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New dashboard&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to present a brand-new dashboard in Entra ID Protection, a central hub designed to help identity admins and IT practitioners better understand their security posture and enable effective protections against identity compromises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Microsoft Entra ID Protection dashboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new dashboard surfaces in-depth insights with compelling visualizations and actionable recommendations. These will help you and your identity teams answer questions like “How well is my organization protected?” “What kinds of attacks are targeting my organization right now?” and “What should I do to address those attacks?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you &nbsp;increase security measures by using <a href="http://risk-based%20conditional%20access%20policies/">risk-based conditional access policies</a> and modern strong authentication policies, the protection of your tenant is gradually strengthened. You’ve asked for better insight into how well you’re protected over time, so we now provide four key metrics with monthly trends to demonstrate the effectiveness of your deployed protections. The number of attacks blocked and users protected metrics can demonstrate the effectiveness of your security measures, and mean time to remediate highlights how quickly your organization is able to respond to and recover from possible compromises. By adopting automated capabilities like risk-based policies and self-service password resets, you can significantly boost your recovery speed, enhancing security and operational efficiency. Finally, high risk users gives insight into how much account compromise risk you are carrying over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key metrics with monthly trends in Microsoft Entra ID Protection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate your risk exposure and where vulnerabilities lie, we’re thrilled to introduce our cool new attack graphic to help you visualize common identity-based attack patterns detected within the past 30 days for your tenant, and - more importantly - how many were successfully blocked, and how many still need to be remediated. These attack patterns are identified based on our advanced ML detections such as leaked credentials, anomalous token, password spray, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attack graphic showcasing attacks in your tenant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you take effective action, we’re offering tailored recommendations based on your risk exposure. For example, when we find that at least 20 high risk users in your tenant have gained access using valid accounts, suggesting possible compromises, a recommendation will be surfaced to suggest protecting these users with a user risk policy to bring these users back to a safe state effectively and efficiently. The attack graphic, alongside our recommendations, will equip you with targeted strategies to improve your security posture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommended actions based on risk exposure</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've also integrated a map to shed light on the geographical origins of risky events. This interactive map gives a global perspective on the threats your organization faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New map to showcase geographical origins of risky events</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, our recent activity function gives you a summary of recent risk-related activities in your tenant. You will be able to see events such as what remediations have been done by admins or by users to catch any suspicious behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent activity displayed in new Microsoft Entra ID Protection dashboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new dashboard will be an invaluable assistant to your identity teams, deriving accessible and digestible insights from complex data to enhance your understanding of your organization's security landscape. Admins and SOC teams will be able to use it on a daily basis as well as share it with their business leaders to illustrate business impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dashboard is currently in preview, and we can’t wait for you to try it out!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New advanced detections&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working on Microsoft Entra ID Protection, we always strive to provide our customers with new detections that can help protect their environment from malicious actors and activities. By leveraging the vast database of threat intelligence across Microsoft, we’ve now released two high fidelity detections that, in conjunction with risk-based conditional access policies, provide our customers with an opportunity to disrupt attacks at a very early stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first detection is verified threat actor ID. In the past couple of years, a lot of the major security incidents have been initiated by known nation state actors and cyber-crime groups. By utilizing the research carried out by the various security teams at Microsoft, we’ve created a comprehensive knowledge base of these actors, which we now use to assign <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#risk-types-and-detection">real-time sign-in risk</a> to sign-ins performed by them.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User risk detection details</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is attacker in the middle. One of the common scenarios used to gain access and compromise users is to use phishing, usually by way of a fake login experience, to get the user to enter their credentials and then proxy those credentials to a real session in Entra ID. Even if the user is prompted for multifactor authentication (MFA), since they are going through the expected login experience, it’s likely that they will successfully complete the login, thus providing the attacker with a working session and with the credentials to be used in future attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>We use signals provided by Microsoft 365 Defender, together with data from Entra ID, to accurately detect this type of attack and apply risk to both the affected sign-in and the user via the Azure AD threat intelligence detection, allowing customers to revoke the session by requiring a password reset and preventing future use of the credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both detections are now available to all ID Protection customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-time Azure AD threat intelligence&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To protect customers from emerging identity-based attacks, Entra ID Protection now offers real-time Azure AD threat intelligence detections. When new attack patterns are identified, ID Protection can now rapidly issue new, real-time detections in response to these attacks. These detections will utilize Microsoft’s threat intelligence in real-time – meaning ID Protection will detect identified patterns of compromise during sign in, and customers will be able to leverage risk-based conditional access policies to protect their identities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a user sign-in, if the properties of that sign-in match the signatures of a real-time threat intelligence detection, the real-time risk evaluation engine in ID Protection will report the detection, elevating the risk level of the sign-in and the user, and enforce the access control configured in your risk-based conditional access policies to block or challenge the user, protecting your organization from malicious actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers will be able to investigate this detection in the risk detections report in ID Protection. The specific detection rule will be noted in the Additional Info field of the existing Azure AD threat intelligence detection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on real-time threat intelligence detections, click here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Generally available: Integration of Entra ID Protection with Microsoft 365 Defender&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're also excited to announce that the integration of Entra ID Protection with Microsoft 365 Defender is now generally available. Entra ID Protection alerts are critical indicators of identity compromises and are generated by advanced detection algorithms. They’re now surfaced in Microsoft 365 Defender and are correlated into incidents along with alerts from the other security domains. Security teams will be able to investigate incidents efficiently and effectively, gaining a comprehensive understanding of end-to-end attacks and facilitating a quicker response to identity compromises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These alerts are also available via the Microsoft 365 Defender Incident API, allowing you to track incidents involving Entra ID Protection alerts in Microsoft Sentinel or any other solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Microsoft 365 Defender user page, you can now view a user’s risk score and provide feedback on potentially compromised risky users. When an investigation is concluded, the status of the incident and the alert can be updated and will automatically sync back to Entra ID Protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seamless integration empowers customers to disrupt security attacks early on when identities are at risk of being compromised. Get started today by visiting <a href="https://security.microsoft.com/">security.microsoft.com</a> and reviewing our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk#investigate-risk-with-microsoft-365-defender">documentation</a>. We look forward to your feedback on this integration!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These exciting updates are another significant step towards our goal of providing customers with best-in-class identity security, with additional features and enhancements to be added as we continue to improve Microsoft Entra ID Protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get the most value out of our product offering, customers are highly encouraged to follow the best practices and recommendations provided in the new dashboard, deploy risk-based conditional access policies, and utilize the new detections for automatic protection and remediation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay safe out there, &nbsp;</p>

 With summer in full swing, we can’t help but think of the endless queues at the various airport checkpoints. Arriving 2 or 3 hours before take-off for flights that are sometimes shorter is a frustrating experience for passengers who are often exhausted or in a hurry. What if there was a way of considerably reducing this wait and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">improving the travel experience</a>? 



 What is biometric verification? 



<p>What if travelers could <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">verify their identity</a> and passport directly from home? Well, it’s possible. Using a smartphone, passengers can capture their identity document (ID card or passport) before they even get to the airport by doing so <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/optimizing-the-online-travel-booking-experience/">during the booking process</a>. The passenger is then invited to carry out a biometric capture of their face (also known as an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">identity check by liveness detection</a>). The physical attributes resulting from the biometric capture are then compared with those on the identity document. This method of identification using biometrics is highly effective. Facial recognition or liveness detection have unique characteristics that enable us to ensure that a person is who they claim to be, and therefore that there is no attempt at identity theft.</p>



<p>Once verified, the passenger’s biometric data is stored in the airport’s or airline’s application for a specific period, enabling the traveler to pass through checkpoints without difficulty.</p>



 The advantages of biometric checks at the airport. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/biometrics/">Biometric checks</a> at airports offers a number of advantages that are revolutionizing the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel</a> experience for passengers. Here are some of the main benefits of this innovative technology:</p>



  Reduced waiting times: one of the greatest benefits of biometric control is the significant reduction in queues at the various checkpoints in the airport. Thanks to facial recognition, travelers can quickly pass through security checks and boarding gates without having to constantly present their identity documents, making the check-in and boarding process much smoother.  



  Improved passenger experience: by eliminating the tedious and repetitive steps involved in checking identity, biometric control offers passengers a smoother and more pleasant travel experience. They can concentrate more on their journey, relax and enjoy the services offered at the airport, without stress.  



  Enhanced security: biometric technologies provide a higher level of security than traditional control methods. Biometric characteristics are unique to each individual, reducing the risk of document fraud and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a>. Advanced biometric systems enable airport authorities to detect any suspicious activity or potentially dangerous behavior more effectively.  



  Seamless integration: biometric control can be seamlessly integrated into existing airport processes. Passengers can enroll their biometric data just once, enabling automatic recognition during subsequent checks. This integration facilitates collaboration between airlines, security services and airport authorities for a frictionless travel experience.  



  Respect for privacy: biometric identity verification solutions generally adopt strict standards for the protection of personal data (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>). Travelers’ biometric information is securely stored and accessible only to authorized persons, ensuring confidentiality and protection of sensitive data.  



 Biometric checks at airports: which countries are pioneers? 



<p>Due to the rapid development of technology and airport security policies, several countries have already introduced biometric control systems at their airports. Here are a few examples:</p>



  United States: The United States has deployed biometric screening programs at some major airports, such as Orlando International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International Airport, as part of the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) ‘<a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Oct/biometric-exit-process-fact-sheet.pdf">Biometric Exit</a>‘ program.  United Kingdom: Biometric screening is being trialed at a number of UK airports, including London’s Heathrow airport, as part of the Heathrow Biometrics project to facilitate the passenger screening process.  Singapore: Singapore’s Changi airport is known for its early and extensive use of biometrics for immigration and boarding controls, offering a smoother and more efficient travel experience.  United Arab Emirates: Dubai International Airport is one of the first large-scale airports to deploy biometric screening for check-in, security screening and boarding.  Netherlands: Amsterdam-Schiphol airport has also implemented biometric control systems to simplify the travel process.  



<p>Many countries around the world have adopted or are considering adopting biometric screening at airports to improve the passenger experience and enhance airport security. Implementation varies according to the specific policies and regulations of each country and airport, but there is a global drive.</p>



 In France, what are the challenges inherent in introducing biometric checks at airports? 



<p>For several years, Lyon Saint-Exupéry airport has been running a free “Biometric Experience” service for passengers travelling to Portugal, Ajaccio and Bastia. Passengers download the Lyon airport application and select their eligible flight. They then create their biometric profile by capturing their identity document and taking a selfie. The final step is to capture the boarding pass and link it to the biometric profile. This option allows access to a fast lane dedicated to biometric checks, eliminating frustrating delays before departure.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/passengers/flight-preparation/facial-recognition">In Paris, other similar systems have been in place since March 2021</a>, notably with the airlines Air Caraïbes and French Bee. Passengers can carry out biometric verification directly at the airport on dedicated kiosks. However, there are a number of obstacles to the smooth running of the project.</p>



<p>Older passports without the NFC chip required for biometric services are excluded from trials on certain routes. In addition, the verification of biometric data carried out at home differs from that carried out at a kiosk at the airport. Although the latter has the advantage of offering the possibility of local assistance in the event of a problem, passengers do not seem to be rushing to use this latest technology, because of its similarity to a traditional check-in kiosk.</p>



<p>However, the results of these remote check-in pilot projects will not hinder their development. As further trials are implemented, the benefits of biometric boarding will become increasingly clear to all parties involved, and at every stage of the passenger journey through an airport.</p>



<p>Staff shortages at check-in counters and baggage depots will be alleviated, and passengers will no longer be forced to queue.</p>



 Biometric control and digital identity: What are the prospects for travelers? 



<p>In the future, frequent travelers will be able to take advantage of a European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) containing all their personal data, including biometric data, which they will be able to use on every flight, eliminating the need to manually enter their personal details every time they fly. This wallet will enable everyone to store and manage their electronic credentials in one place (directly on their smartphone), all securely and transparently.</p>



<p>The use of biometric technology in the aviation sector has considerable potential, and airlines and airports are undoubtedly open to it as they see the results. Commercial aviation, like the mobility and tourism sectors in general, is undoubtedly undergoing a revolution that should not be missed.</p>

<p>There was once a day and age when castles and moats were considered cutting-edge defense strategies. Now, in our digital and cloud-first world, it’s safe to say that times have changed.</p>
<p>And yet, perimeter-based cybersecurity policies are still the status quo for many organizations. Why? Because they work — at least, they did until recently.</p>
<p>The truth is that traditional data security doesn’t suffice in today’s increasingly complex environment. Enterprises are facing an unprecedented array of threats, all chomping at the bit to get ahold of sensitive data. Fortunately, that’s where a Zero Trust architecture comes into play.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the value of Zero Trust security and how it can help you safeguard company assets. From its principles and components to the steps involved in the process, you’ll learn how to start implementing Zero Trust and protecting your business from its dynamic threat landscape.</p>
 Understanding Zero Trust 
<p>Security teams are excited about the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-zero-trust">Zero Trust framework</a>, and for good reason. With its fresh approach to strong authentication and access control, it’s poised to usher in a major paradigm shift when it comes to cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the ins and outs of Zero Trust architecture and why it should become a tentpole of your enterprise security policy.</p>
 What is Zero Trust? 
<p>John Kindervag, a former Forrester analyst, <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/No-More-Chewy-Centers-The-Zero-Trust-Model-Of-Information-Security/RES56682">coined the term</a> “Zero Trust” in 2010. Originally, the concept was specific to network protection, but has since evolved to encompass everything from endpoint to cloud security.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-definition-of-modern-zero-trust/">Forrester defines</a> the Zero Trust model as a data security policy that denies the user access to applications and network resources by default. It eliminates implicit trust and acknowledges that threats exist both inside and outside traditional boundaries.</p>
<p>In other words, Zero Trust security takes a guilty-until-proven-innocent approach. Rather than blindly assuming certain users are always safe, it ensures all identities are validated before granting access to company assets. Additionally, it takes a hard stance against implicit trust by continuously requiring users to authenticate themselves, even after they already have.</p>
<p>When it comes to understanding what Zero Trust is, it also helps to clarify exactly what it isn’t. More specifically, implementing Zero Trust isn’t as simple as a single solution or cybersecurity platform. It requires a layered, multi-faceted foundation of technologies and policies. With these in place, you can continuously build upon and strengthen an evolving Zero Trust architecture.</p>
 Why is Zero Trust important? 
<p>It’s an open secret that cybercrime is running rampant across the globe. In fact, a <a href="https://surfshark.com/research/data-breach-impact/statistics">recent Surfshark report</a> revealed that the online crime victim count has increased 16 times since 2001. Financial losses have grown over 570 times during the same period, now costing the world $1 million per hour.</p>
<p>With a growing swarm of attack strategies at their disposal, bad actors are targeting sensitive data like never before. These sophisticated tactics include (but aren’t limited to):</p>
 
 Malware 
 Ransomware 
 Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks 
 Phishing 
 Zero-day strikes 
 Structured query language (SQL) injections 
 Cryptojacking 
 
<p>Worse yet, security teams are encountering these threats at a greater volume and velocity than they’re able to manage. Why? Because their organization’s attack surface has expanded exponentially. Let’s consider the numbers:</p>
 
 Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the vast majority of enterprises have implemented flexible work models. Globally, about <a href="https://www.ifebp.org/store/employee-benefits-survey/Pages/default.aspx">75% of businesses</a> offer some form of hybrid work arrangement, many with a Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policy. That means employees are accessing network resources on unmanaged devices that the security team can’t protect. 
 And, to accommodate these policies and stay productive, even more organizations are investing in cloud services. According to McKinsey, many large enterprises aspire to have <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/projecting-the-global-value-of-cloud-3-trillion-is-up-for-grabs-for-companies-that-go-beyond-adoption">at least 60%</a> of their environment in the cloud by 2025. 
 
<p>In short, these factors are converging to create an expansive (and largely unprotected) attack surface. Each application, device, and network is an entry point hackers can exploit to their advantage.</p>
<p>To make matters even more complicated, many enterprises are still relying on outdated, legacy cybersecurity strategies. Per IBM’s research, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ">almost 60% of organizations</a> don’t have a Zero Trust security model. However, on average, those that do&nbsp;leverage Zero Trust save $1 million in data breach costs per incident.</p>
 Zero Trust vs. Traditional security models 
<p>Standard data security policies are based on the assumption that everything happening inside the network perimeter is inherently trusted. They’re developed to protect against external threats — not necessarily those that originate from within.</p>
 Traditional security 
<p>The main principle behind traditional security is the castle-and-moat analogy. The idea is simple: Keeping bad actors out will ensure any and all assets inside the perimeter remain safe. So, people must first cross the moat (i.e., your firewall) to access the castle (your network). Once they’re checked at the perimeter, they’re allowed to continue as they please.</p>
<p>But what happens when someone isn’t who they seem? What if a hacker gets their hands on someone’s login credentials? In this case, they’re free to roam about and access information at their convenience. Oftentimes, they can do so undetected, as they appear to be a legitimate user. And, as they do, bad actors are even taking the time to harvest encrypted data with hopes of cracking it at a later date with the help of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/post-quantum-cryptography">powerful quantum computing</a>.</p>
<p>According to IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">2023 Cost of a Data Breach report</a>, compromised or stolen credentials are the two most common initial attack vectors, responsible for 16% and 15% of breaches, respectively. Worse yet, it takes organizations, on average, about 10 months to identify and contain these types of attacks. This means, more likely than not, an ongoing data breach could be happening right under your nose.</p>
<p>This threat underscores the inherent risk created by the typical username-and-password posture. Recognizing as much, many Zero Trust enterprises are adopting <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passwordless-login">passwordless security policies</a> and certificate-based authentication procedures as a safer alternative.</p>
<p>Additionally, given the fluid nature of cloud services and how they can span many locations and providers, perimeter-based defenses simply don’t provide adequate cloud security. Employees can access resources on any number of unmanaged devices, making it inherently difficult to enforce consistent security policies across the enterprise. All things considered, it’s no surprise that 82% of breaches in 2022 involved public, private, and multi-cloud environments.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Traditional frameworks are no longer sufficient, as attackers can easily bypass defenses and gain unfettered access to critical information.</p>
 Zero Trust security 
<p>In contrast, the Zero Trust security model is designed to prevent unauthorized network and cloud application access. It requires users and devices to authenticate themselves continuously regardless of identity or location. This ensures that only verified, legitimate users can access information.</p>
<p>Overall, deploying a Zero Trust architecture has a number of tangible benefits, including:</p>
 
 Enhanced data security: Zero Trust’s continuous monitoring and verification allow you to enforce security policies at scale, no matter how the user access request originates. It ensures all users, devices, and applications are authenticated beforehand, thereby mitigating the risk of untrusted connections. 
 
 
 Greater visibility: It’s difficult to keep tabs on a cloud-first environment. Luckily, Zero Trust security offers an unparalleled line of sight into the network, allowing you to spot suspicious activity from miles away. With granular control, you can ensure security operations are performing at their best. 
 
 
 Increased scalability: Rapidly growing businesses are adopting new cloud technologies at an accelerated rate. Network security tools have difficulty scaling at pace, but a cloud-based Zero Trust model can flex to meet your changing needs. That way, you can confidently expand your tech stack without jeopardizing sensitive data. 
 
 
 Seamless user experience: Zero Trust empowers you to offer employees secure access to critical resources without hindering their productivity. Security measures work in the background, meaning that although identities are constantly verified, there’s no impact on the user experience. 
 
 
 Improved risk mitigation: The Zero Trust model aims to close security gaps and prevent lateral network movement. That means it not only augments your security team, but also enhances their risk management skills through robust capabilities and proactive policy enforcement. 
 
 
 Reduced attack surface: In contrast to traditional approaches, Zero Trust adequately defends against a wide variety of risk factors, including ransomware, malware, phishing, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). 
 
<p>That’s what you stand to gain from implementing Zero Trust. Now, let’s break down the security model and get to know the building blocks of the Zero Trust framework.</p>
 A closer look at Zero Trust architecture 
<p>The Zero Trust Maturity Model is built upon three foundational principles and five core pillars. When used in combination, they empower organizations to strengthen their cybersecurity posture and eliminate implicit trust from top to bottom.</p>
 Zero Trust principles 
<p>Based on the concept of “never trust, always verify,” the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/a-zero-trust-framework-for-the-new-hybrid-workforce/">Zero Trust framework</a> operates on three fundamental tenets:</p>
 
 Explicit verification: Organizations must establish trusted identities through strong authentication and continuous authorization. This includes evaluating context-aware risk signals and user behavior for suspicious activity, thereby verifying the entity requesting access is actually who they claim to be and has the right to do so. 
 
 
 Least-privilege access: Because credentials are often the root cause of a breach, businesses must limit access based on user roles and responsibilities. In simple terms, this Zero Trust principle ensures that employees can only access resources essential to their job — no more, no less. 
 
 
 Assume breach: The Zero Trust framework underscores the notion that breaches are inevitable. So, it’s critical for organizations to minimize the blast radius during an ongoing attack through various methods, such as microsegmentations, encryption, and so on. 
 
<p>With these three concepts in mind, remember that Zero Trust is more of an enterprise-wide strategy than it is a single solution. As the sum of its parts, an effective architecture requires a cohesive effort from all stakeholders, tools, and processes. According to the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a>, security teams can best strengthen their posture by focusing on five distinct pillars:</p>
 
 Identity: As with any cybersecurity strategy, an organization’s people are at its center. It should ensure every user has access to the right resources without granting excessive permissions. In an optimal environment, a user’s identity is constantly verified. 
 
 
 Devices: Any hardware or virtual asset that connects to the network is an entry point and can be used to infect the network with malware and other malicious threats. This pillar addresses device tracking and management and how users operate them according to rules and procedures. 
 
 
 Networks: Ideally, organizations adopt micro-parameters that prevent lateral movement and enable early threat detection. Isolating network resources can stop bad actors from accessing them, thus greatly reducing the potential blast radius. 
 
 
 Applications &amp; Workloads: This pillar refers to cloud-based resources and processes used by an organization for operational purposes. Security measures aim to protect assets and prevent unauthorized access or tampering with sensitive cloud services. 
 
 
 Data: Categorizing and classifying corporate data allows it to be isolated from all but those who need constant access. This pillar also includes the process of encrypting data at rest, in movement, and use. 
 
 Implementing Zero Trust 
<p>By now, it’s clear that the Zero Trust architecture is well worth the effort. However, it’s wise to understand the roadblocks you might encounter along the way.</p>
 Challenges of Zero Trust implementation 
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/06/achieving-zero-trust-that-works/">achieving Zero Trust</a> maturity isn’t an overnight process. More often than not, implementing Zero Trust is a multi-year journey — one that won’t always be easy to navigate. Knowing how to steer your business in the right direction effectively requires an understanding of the obstacles in your path. These most often include:</p>
 
 Complexity: Organizations may have a tough time if their IT infrastructure consists of many interconnected and distributed systems. You may have hundreds of databases, servers, and third-party applications that need consideration. 
 
 
 Cost: Implementing Zero Trust can be expensive, especially if you’re transitioning from legacy technologies. You may have to replace old hardware and deploy new solutions, which can mean a long-term, multi-phase rollout process. 
 
 
 Legacy systems: Another challenge of having dated solutions is that they’re designed specifically for implicit trust. It may be hard to configure legacy tools in a way that aligns with Zero Trust principles. 
 Stakeholder buy-in: Key stakeholders must sign off on the transition; otherwise, you won’t have the resources to get the job done right. Leaders may not always see the value in Zero Trust right away. One way to circumvent this issue is to communicate the cost of security in terms they’ll best understand: the bottom line. 
 
 Steps in the Zero Trust journey 
<p>Not sure how to get started? Don’t worry — we have you covered. Here’s a breakdown of the most critical steps you need to take as you implement a Zero Trust architecture:</p>
 
 Evaluate vulnerabilities: It’s best to assess the environment before getting ahead of yourself. Take a comprehensive inventory of devices, users, applications, and accounts that have access to your network. This helps you pinpoint vulnerabilities and determine key network flows. 
 
 
 Identify the protect surface: The “protect surface” refers to everything that must be shielded from harm. That includes sensitive data, critical assets, cloud services, and internal applications. 
 
 
 Strengthen access control: It’s not enough to implement strict policies. You should support them with specific technologies, such as phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) and risk-based adaptive verification, which make it harder for bad actors to bypass defenses even if they’ve stolen credentials. 
 
 
 Segment the network: Microsegmentation is a process of creating smaller, more secure network areas. These micro-perimeters limit the spread of a data breach and make it easier to contain the incident. 
 
 
 Practice continuous monitoring: Keep an eye on network traffic and user activity so that you can spot risks in real-time. More importantly, continue to strengthen security operations over time, as Zero Trust is an iterative process that demands dynamic enforcement.

<p>As a security professional, you understand protecting your customers and their data is critical. Customers want to trust that as a vendor, you’ve taken the appropriate precautions to ensure a secure digital experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me log in, look at my stuff, and transact, but keep others away from my account, especially those fraudsters. While you’re at it, please make it convenient as well. And then there’s the aspect of storing personal customer data, which is often like gold, oil, or maybe lithium—it's valuable and can make or break a business. It drives an organization’s product development plans and future revenue. If you don’t know your customers, then you’ll likely build a less desirable product. So organizations try to collect as much customer data as possible, but it must be well protected once collected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our digital world, your customers' primary interaction with your brand is through your website or app. With more digital interactions than ever before, you need to make gaining access as secure and seamless as possible, which most often requires a username and password. And don’t forget about registration. If it’s a prospect, you’ll want to make a good first impression. Passwords and lack of real-time threat signals are the #1 security threat to organizations today and are prime targets in cyberattacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Did you know? 
<p><a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/2016/">86% of breaches involve the use of stolen credentials (VZ)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, it's all about keeping your customers' sensitive info safe and sound. We're talking personal details, financial records, and transaction history. By locking down that data, you prevent the bad guys from pulling off identity theft, fraud, and sneaky unauthorized access. The goal is to prevent any data breaches or at least quickly identify any possible security concerns. Otherwise, you’ll incur big costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Did you know? 
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OJDVQGRY">$150 is the average cost per lost or stolen record (IBM)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that's not all. When you go the extra mile to protect consumer data, you're showing them that you're the real deal—a company they can trust. You become their go-to when it comes to privacy and ethical practices. And that trust goes a long way in building customer loyalty and boosting your brand reputation. People want to do business with companies that take their privacy seriously. Essentially, just common courtesy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Did you know? 
<p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/dpbs-2019.pdf">97% of companies are realizing benefits such as competitive advantage or investor appeal from their privacy investments (Cisco)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and let's not forget about the legal side of things. Protecting customer data is not just a good idea–it's the law. You have to stay compliant with data protection regulations, or you could be facing some hefty fines and legal troubles. So, by putting customer data protection at the top of your priority list, you're not just doing the right thing—you're also reducing major risks to your business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Did you know?

  <p>Greetings! At the recent Microsoft Secure event, we provided an early look at a new feature of conditional access which lets you strictly enforce location policies with continuous access evaluation (CAE), allowing you to rapidly invalidate tokens which violate your IP based location policies. Today, we’re delighted to announce this feature is in public preview. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, in the event of an access token theft, attackers could take advantage of the refresh interval to replay the token, regardless of whether it fell outside the location range permitted by a conditional access policy. With our ability to strictly enforce location policies and CAE, CAE enabled applications like Exchange Online, SharePoint, Teams, and Microsoft Graph can now revoke tokens in near real-time in response to network change events noticed by the app – preventing stolen tokens from being replayed outside the trusted network. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a client’s access to a resource is blocked due to CAE’s strictly enforce location policies being triggered, the client will be blocked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Here’s a brief overview of how you can enable this capability&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling Strict Location Enforcement:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before turning on strictly enforce location policies in CA you must ensure that all IP addresses from which your users can access Microsoft Entra ID and resource providers are included in the IP-based named locations policy. Otherwise, you may accidentally block your users. You can use the CAE Workbook or Sign-in logs to determine which IP addresses are seen by CAE resource providers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAE Workbook:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign-in Logs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, notice that the column “IP address” refers to “IP (seen by Azure)” versus “IP address (seen by resource).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While troubleshooting and testing how to configure your strictly enforce location policies, use the filter “IP (seen by resource)” to find scenarios where strictly enforce location policies could be blocking users with an unallowed IP seen by the CAE resource provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strictly enforce location policies is a step forward for session management. As you enable this feature, carefully consider including safe and trusted IP addresses from which your users access Microsoft Entra ID and resource providers to avoid unintentional blocks by leveraging the CAE Workbook and Sign-in logs for precise configuration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the rise of Web3, there is a renewed interest in the benefits of distributed systems. Distributed systems are scalable, fault-tolerant, cost-effective, and used to power blockchains, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, social media networks, and more. &nbsp;</p><p>But are all distributed systems truly decentralized? When it comes to authorizing users, the answer isn't always yes. Blockchains, for example, use cryptographic key signatures to provide access to resources. But what about non-blockchain examples? </p><p>If any server instances in a network are using an access control list (ACL), they are not fully decentralized. &nbsp;</p><p>So how do we handle authorization in a distributed system?</p> What is a UCAN? <p>In 2019, Fission's co-founder and CTO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a>, created the UCAN. <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec">UCAN stands for User-Controlled Authorization Network</a>. It is a user-originated authorization and revocation scheme that is trustless and secure, with no ACL required. UCANs provide public-key verifiable, delegable, expressive, and openly extensible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">capabilities</a> by extending the familiar <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519">JWT</a> structure. </p> How Do UCANs Work? <p>There are three main parts of a UCAN: Header, Payload, and Signature. </p>Source: Brooklyn Zelenka's IPFS Thing 2023 Presentation: UCAN Decentralizing Auth<p>Header</p><p>The Header is a standard JWT header. It includes the algorithm (EdDSA) used to sign the UCAN.</p><p>Payload</p><p>The Payload includes a Decentralized Identifier or DID, the period during which the UCAN is valid, the capabilities (what the receiver of the UCAN, or audience, is allowed to do), and embedded encoded UCANs used as proofs for delegated capabilities. &nbsp;</p><p>It's important to understand capabilities, as they are at the heart of the UCAN token. Below is the anatomy of a capability:</p> <code>{ $RESOURCE: { $ABILITY: [ ...$CAVEATS ] } }</code> <p>A resource is a unique URI whose associated abilities include what the UCAN receiver can or cannot do, like send a message "msg/send". &nbsp;The issuer or delegator may also include caveats only if the eventual invocation can read them.</p><p>Signature</p><p>The Signature (which must match the DID in the issuer) denotes the validity of the UCAN.</p> Authority in a Distributed System <p>To authorize a user, there must be some authority that can approve them to carry out various tasks. In the case of UCANs, the set of capabilities delegated by the UCAN is its authority. Furthermore, except for <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec#64-rights-amplification">rights amplification</a>, every unique delegation MUST have equal or narrower capabilities from their delegator. This also controls the flow of authority in the system.</p> The Lifecycle of a UCAN <p>After the UCAN is generated, there are a few ways it can be managed. &nbsp;</p><p>Delegation</p><p>The UCAN holder can delegate the capability to use a resource they have. A proof acts as authorization. Proofs are either the owner's signature or a UCAN with access to that capability in its authority. In other words, another user who has been delegated access to a resource by a UCAN can, in turn, delegate that resource to someone else. </p><p>Invocation</p><p>An important note is that delegation is a separate concept from <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/invocation">invocation</a>. Delegation is the act of granting a capability to another, not the act of using it. UCAN invocation defines a standard for authorizing, chaining, and executing compute tasks.

<p>The telecom and communications industry is undergoing unprecedented change. The ever-growing demand for higher connections speeds and lower latency means mobile and fixed-line service providers have had to significantly rearchitect their networks to support new technologies like 5G and IoT as well as wide-scale public projects such as smart cities and autonomous vehicle communication networks.</p>
<p>It’s also becoming clear that service providers are taking different approaches to their new network deployment architectures (and in some cases the same provider is taking different approaches dependent on the deployment). Some have opted to simply upgrade their base stations to support 5G and relied on their existing aggregation and backhaul networks to handle the extra network load. Others have opted for more a cloud-based service approach, allowing telecom operators to make use of the offered services instead of upgrading their existing infrastructure. Further still, many providers are looking at partitioning and sharing a common open access radio network (Open RAN) to reduce installation and maintenance cost while expanding their coverage.</p>
<p>As telecom networks become more critical for communication and infrastructure, this change creates new security challenges and compliance burdens that must be addressed in an integrated and holistic way if they are to be tackled effectively. Not only does a telecom provider have the expected duty of care to protect personal customer information, but they also must secure the communications that flow across their network and to protect the network itself from unauthorized or illegal use.</p>
<p>These security requirements exist at both an industry and regulatory level and typically cover three different aspects of security: namely preventing intrusions, detecting intrusions, and protecting the data itself. While the first two focus primarily on the network itself, the third piece of this puzzle is that of data protection, which aims to secure the data with cryptography as it crosses the network.</p>
<p>While all three of these categories should be applied to critical systems to deliver a robust, layered, and compliant security posture, for many providers’ IT security teams it is the first two that are the best understood and most well-funded. However, not only is data protection a vital pillar, but it is also an increasingly mandated function as well. Regulations such as GDPR and Schrems II in the EU, as well as the requirement for protection of subscriber identity in the 3GPP specification, are getting increasingly specific about the data protection requirements for industries such as telecom. As such, the industry bodies that define standards and protocols for communications are setting more defined parameters for compliance as well. As part of these requirements, hardware security modules (HSMs) are becoming mandatory parts of a trusted cryptographic foundation for data protection in telecommunications.</p>
<p>In any situation, requirements that are necessary but not well-understood risk being relegated to a “check the box” exercise. In the case of data protection, this can not only undermine the impact of those requirements but the overall security posture as well. We know from the Entrust Global Encryption Trends Study that <a href="https://www.entrust.com/c/global-encryption-trends-study">only half of businesses</a> have a consistent encryption strategy. Assuming the telecom industry falls broadly in line with the overall average, this means that while many providers will have some encryption tools in place, there may very well be gaps that could be exploited. This issue is exacerbated by a significant skills shortage within the IT security industry, also reflected in the study. Furthermore, cryptography is specific technology that requires a clear understanding of the underpinning key management. As such, knowledge and experience of this skillset is generally in even shorter supply than the wider cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p>Overcoming these challenges and making the most of the capabilities that a robust and well-implemented data protection solution can deliver requires not just the right technology but also the right partner. Entrust is a leader in cryptography and key management and a provider of certified HSMs. As such, Entrust has not only the depth of experience and breadth of portfolio but also the industry partnerships to enable operators to build data protection and key management into a sturdy pillar supporting a holistic network security strategy.</p>
<p>Look out for further blog posts of this series, where we will be taking a deeper dive into how to secure telecom networks at scale, the challenges of managing encryption across a distributed environment, and the role HSMs play in securing telecom networks.

  <p>Most enterprises today run hybrid IT environments. They store some data and applications locally in the data center and run others in multiple clouds, and their employees use both managed and unmanaged devices over various networks. With such complexity — and so much at stake — identity and access management (IAM) is more important than ever.</p>
	
<p>But relying on disparate IAM systems creates identity silos and with them a multitude of problems. Identity silos prevent sufficient IT visibility into all the apps and systems in operation and open the door to shadow IT. Silos create inefficiencies, redundancies, and, worst of all, the possibility of damaging and costly breaches.</p>
	
<p>Enterprises need a robust and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">unified IAM platform</a> that enables them to secure every identity and manage access privileges centrally. This is particularly true in light of the fact that identities remain the prime target of cyberattacks. With a single compromised identity, entire networks can be infiltrated and sensitive data can be exposed, stolen, or held for ransom.</p>
	
 What are identity silos? 
	
<p>Siloed identity and access management (IAM) happens when people use different systems that cannot properly communicate with one another. Siloed IAM's symptoms include inconsistent access controls, limited visibility, and manual storage provisioning.</p>
	
<p>Identity silos are common given how many different programs companies will utilize. Siloing leaves identities fragmented across the platforms people use, without any standard for access rights or user permissions. This fragmentation creates the perfect environment for social engineering and other potentially harmful situations.</p>
	
 The causes of identity silos 
	
<p>Identity silos are sometimes caused by employees using programs without informing IT. In other cases, they occur simply because an IT department doesn't request visibility into the systems people use.</p>

<p>Here are a few other causes of identity siloing:</p>

  Mergers and acquisitions: A company that merges with another company will often inherit disparate systems. These systems have their own identities, user licenses, and access permissions. 
   Departmental independence: In many cases, company departments operate independently. These conditions can naturally lead to identity silos over time, particularly when people in different departments begin using the same platform. 
   Legacy systems: IT departments often face <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ibmsecurity/2020/04/22/legacy-technology-could-prove-a-problem-for-remote-working/">challenges when securing older systems</a>. These challenges often prevent IT departments from fully unifying user identities across different systems.&nbsp; 
 <p>Many companies are already taking steps to control identity silos and prevent future occurrences. These steps begin with an IAM strategy, one that helps identify where a company's disparate identities come from.</p>
	
 Identifying and understanding your identity silos 
	
<p>An IAM assessment can provide valuable information for identifying and solving identity problems across the company. Here are a few steps companies should take to fully understand their identity silos:</p>

  Complete a comprehensive IAM assessment 
   Identify identity silos by performing network audits and interviewing employees to create a comprehensive list of programs and access rights 
   Diagnose root causes for identity problems by analyzing the history of your company's technology usage habits 
   Implement a restorative IAM policy that educates all employees on proper technology usage and compliance strategies 
 <p>Understanding identity silos helps educate employees and prevent dissociated identities. It also helps centralize departments' efforts to improve efficiency, since each department will be unified with the same programs and usage rights.</p>
	
 The impacts of identity silos on companies 
	
<p>Identity silos represent fragments in your company's strategy. They leave your organization vulnerable to wasted company resources, miscommunication, and serious security concerns.</p>
	
 Wastes company resources 
	
<p>Enterprise software almost invariably requires user authentication, but fragmented identity management creates a range of problems. For example, access rights should be terminated when an employee leaves a company. But without centralized management, that license could remain active and cost the company money. Furthermore, former employees may retain access to sensitive company information.</p>
	
 Limits the view of company data 
	
<p>Identity silos can limit IT's perspective on enterprise-wide information. For example, legacy systems in a domain controller, cloud application, or business unit often do not share information. This makes it challenging to understand who can access certain data points and sources.</p>

<p>This situation is common for companies that only partially migrate their data to the cloud. While one department might store files on local servers, another might store data in a public or private cloud. Because neither department has access to the other's files, they are limited in their ability to use information effectively. This can also lead to trouble with breach vector identification, both in disaster recovery planning and in the event of an actual breach.</p>
	
 Reduces cost efficiency 
	
<p>While siloed IAM can improve operational efficiency by consolidating disparate systems, it can be expensive to keep more specialists on staff to manage identities for different systems.</p>

<p>In some cases, departments like HR, sales, and marketing set up their own user profiles, access permissions, and rights without oversight from IT. For example, a sales representative who needs access to payroll information must request it from HR. HR will often require a complicated, time-consuming data request process before they provide access.</p>
	
 Raises security concerns 
	
<p>Perhaps most importantly, identity silos can leave companies vulnerable to security threats. Isolated permissions make it more difficult for IT to reserve access only for authorized users.</p>

<p>Siloed IAM can also delay a company's response to a data breach. Companies sometimes require time to sort out access permissions and identify the source of an issue. This delay creates a window of opportunity for hackers to steal identities and further compromise a network.</p>
	
 How to dissolve your company's identity silos 
	
<p>A comprehensive IAM roadmap is a great first step in dissolving your company's identity silos. This means identifying silos, understanding where they come from, and taking steps to eliminate them. It involves changing how access permissions are managed across your organization. You might also consider automated solutions that make it easier to protect users and platforms.</p>

 Change management 

<p>Change management should be a primary phase of your IAM roadmap. It means ensuring proper guidance, implementation, and resolution of projects that ensure all access permissions are centralized and appropriately transparent.</p>

<p>Change management also ensures that the right digital assets are protected while others are cleaned up and purged. Protecting digital assets is a difficult undertaking, especially for established organizations with large data libraries. Indeed, the process of dissolving identity siloes and preserving the right information is not dissimilar to protecting digital data following a business split-up. This is a multi-step process that typically involves:</p>

  Performing a data inventory check 
   Developing a plan to transfer data to more secure, compliant programs 
   Coordinating with the management team to ensure you share the same security strategies and priorities 
   Encrypting or re-encrypting sensitive information 
   Monitoring data before, during, and after the transfer process 
 <p>These steps help companies of all sizes end identity silos and maintain security as leadership responsibilities change hands.</p>

 Data-sharing solutions 

<p>Data-sharing strategies can also help your organization dissolve identity silos. These solutions streamline the data-sharing process, upholding security while making it easier for employees to access the right programs and information.</p>

<p>Here are some data-sharing solutions that can help:</p>

  <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/iam-101-series-federation-and-federated-sso">Identity federation</a>: This solution links your identities across several disparate systems. It gives multiple employees, even multiple companies, the ability to access programs with a single login credential. 
   <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">Single sign-on (SSO)</a>: SSO allows employees to log into multiple programs or platforms with a single username and password. 
 <p>The right solutions promote data-sharing and give the right people access to the right files. They also prevent unauthorized permissions and create centralized management for all identities.</p>

 Implementing automated solutions 

<p>Automation can go a long way in streamlining the IAM process and preventing silos. It helps improve efficiency across employees while reducing the possibility of error. The same automation solutions can also provide proactive security that monitors for cyberthreats.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Automated identity governance</a>, for example, enables IT admins to see who has access to what, enterprise-wide, and eliminate over-provisioning by automating access approvals and reviews. It also allows them to collect and analyze identity data and identify access blind spots.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-driven threat protection</a> automatically monitors login requests in real time, blocking malicious attempts and adding authentication steps when it detects anomalous behaviors.</p>

<p>And a comprehensive, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">scalable IAM platform</a> unifies and centralizes identity across the enterprise, including on-prem, multi-cloud, or hybrid. It also covers all users – <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/CIAM">customers</a>, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">machine identities</a> – to end silos and create a more unified and secure organization.</p>

 Permissioned Tokens: The Key to Interoperable Distribution 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in July 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>While the blockchain narrative fundamentally revolves around decentralization and empowerment of the individual, the realities of&nbsp;dealing with real-world assets and securities introduce a layer of complexity.</p>
<p>Particularly in financial markets – a heavily regulated industry due to the high risks involved – there are stringent guidelines and regulations that ensure the protection of all stakeholders.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, we efficiently navigate these two critical aspects – the vast potential of open blockchain infrastructure and the intricate details of securities laws. Our comprehension of these dual facets has led to the creation of&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_cA7eWEY0JKUdPoNuPKKOjDXK7AKN3i1R-qr0x0pA8MjJuZr6-TWMdHTBg8O9JJcLrbVaY">T-REX</a>, a platform designed to ensure compliant participation in this fast-evolving space.</p>
<p>Liquidity is one of the most enticing features that blockchain offers, prompting issuers to tokenize their assets. However, it’s essential to understand that tokenization alone doesn’t spontaneously generate healthy liquidity. The main takeaway is that&nbsp;while tokenization itself doesn’t guarantee liquidity, the opportunities provided by blockchain technology certainly&nbsp;can.</p>
<p>We at Tokeny are on a mission to create an open, standardized platform that will become&nbsp;the&nbsp;launchpad for highly-functional digital securities, offering the&nbsp;largest catalog of liquidity solutions for compliant security tokens.</p>
<p>In order to leverage a global ecosystem of liquidity providers to its fullest potential, several foundational activities should be performed:</p>
 
 Tokenize the asset on an EVM-compatible blockchain network and the ERC3643 standard. These are the main technical components used by the&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/dino/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_cA7eWEY0JKUdPoNuPKKOjDXK7AKN3i1R-qr0x0pA8MjJuZr6-TWMdHTBg8O9JJcLrbVaY">DINO</a>&nbsp;distribution network; 
 &nbsp;Encoding compliance rules in the token smart contracts to track ownership and eligibility of investors; 
 &nbsp;Embedding asset data, mostly valuation data, which serve as reference points for price discovery and asset credibility on trading venues. 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Once these key steps (issuance, compliance, and data) are taken, the tokenized assets may be “published” to the network and made available for any trading venue of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The necessary infrastructure, including compliance and data, is already in place thanks to the blockchain and the built-in features of the tokens.&nbsp;Only the discoverability is missing: This is the role of distributors and trading venues in a DLT-based financial system.</p>
<p>As an issuer, you now have the capability to increase the visibility and distribution of your securities through all ERC3643 compatible liquidity solutions. This, of course, is assuming that your use of these solutions is legally permitted.</p>
<p>Moreover, as your assets are tokenized, our platform also provides significant benefits with its&nbsp;automatic cap table updates&nbsp;for each transaction, no matter its origin.</p>
<p>For example, an issuer might list their token on both a South Korean centralized exchange and a decentralized exchange like Uniswap. All of these transactions will be settled on-chain and accurately recorded on their DLT-based cap table. They can then easily access this data through Tokeny’s T-REX platform since every transaction happens on the same shared IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>Tokenizing an asset enables the centralization of all the trading activity of the asset in a single ledger accessible by all authorized trading venues and distributors.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of the types of liquidity solutions an issuer has at their disposal:</p>
 
 Digital Trading Desks/Bulletin Boards:
 
 With our<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_cA7eWEY0JKUdPoNuPKKOjDXK7AKN3i1R-qr0x0pA8MjJuZr6-TWMdHTBg8O9JJcLrbVaY">&nbsp;‘Billboard’</a>&nbsp;solution, issuers enable investors to post buy or sell intentions for shares. Interested parties can accept and execute trades securely on the blockchain, with no counterparty risk, thanks to atomic swaps. 
 These bulletin boards are accessible on the investor portal of the token and/or on any digital asset marketplace(s) proposing these tokens to their audience of investors. 
 
 
 Regulated/Centralized Exchanges:
 
 Issuers can also enable their token to be traded on a regulated trading venue, which has the legal approval to operate with digital securities; however, it’s important to note these platforms are still very much the legacy infrastructure and are, in most cases, still restricted to utilizing off-chain order books and settlements. 
 
 
 Decentralized Exchanges:
 
 Like Uniswap or Quickswap you can use an automated market maker (AMM) to execute a trade without a counterparty via liquidity pools. 
 An Automated Market Maker (AMM) like Uniswap allows users to trade directly with a pool of funds (called a liquidity pool) rather than another person. 
 This is possible because other users deposit, or ‘stake’, their tokens into these pools and earn fees in return. So, if Investor A wants to swap their Security B for Stablecoin C, they can do so instantly, as long as both tokens are in the same pool. 
 
 
 DeFi Protocols:
 
 &nbsp;Investors can leverage and collateralize these highly-functional securities via DeFi protocols while retaining ownership. This enables seamless deposits and withdrawals, and guarantees lenders thanks to auto-liquidation systems. 
 
 
 
<p>As you can clearly understand now, liquidity is the holy grail of asset tokenization. In order to achieve healthy and sustainable liquidity, using a powerful token standard, enriching tokens with compliance rules and data, and having accessibility to a network of distribution providers are all integral components.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Viky Manaila and I did a podcast earlier in 2023 on everything that is happening in Europe that pertains to digital identity (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet/">Episode #51</a>). It was a very popular episode and so it felt like it was a topic that was worth exploring a bit more. So for a follow up, André Kudra and I decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>The European Union is currently witnessing a significant momentum in digital identity, with three parallel efforts underway (not forgetting the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scytales-ab-together-with-netcompany-intrasoft-wins-landmark-eu-digital-wallet-contract-301694498.html">open source wallet project</a> that the EU is funding): the new eIDAS 2.0 regulation, the EU Digital Wallet architecture reference framework, and four large-scale pilots.</p>
 
 The <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a> 1.0 regulation was a stepping stone towards an interoperable government-issued electronic identity for EU citizens. However, its implementation varied across member states, leading to a lack of uniformity and success. Now, the EU is moving towards eIDAS 2.0, which aims to correct the shortcomings of its predecessor and further digitalize identity systems. Viky had done a fantastic job in <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet/">Part 1</a> describing eIDAS and its evolution. 
 The <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/releases/tag/v1.1.0">EU Digital Wallet Architecture Reference Framework (ARF)</a> is an extension of eIDAS 2.0. It aims to make technology implementation more prescriptive, thereby facilitating adoption and interoperability. The wallet is expected to close the gap in digitalization, providing a reliable, strong, and widely accessible electronic identity. It will also extend the digital identity-based ecosystem to include other data items associated with an individual, such as diplomas, driver’s licenses, and more. 
 The Four Large-scale Pilots (LSPs) running in parallel with these efforts are expected to provide valuable insights into the practical implementation of these systems. They will help in addressing the technical and use case-driven aspects of the EU Digital Wallet and eIDAS 2.0. The pilots include, <a href="https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/">POTENTIAL for Digital Europe</a> – 148 participants from 19 EU states, invests 60+ mn € for 6 use cases – various use cases such as electronic registration, account opening, electronic driving licences, and electronic prescriptions; <a href="https://www.nobidconsortium.com/">NOBID Consortium of Nordic and Baltic countries+</a> – Payment focus, payment means by financial institutions &amp; retail payments; <a href="https://dc4eu.eu/">DC4EU – Digital Credentials for Europe</a> –&nbsp; Educational credentials, professional qualifications and Social Security; and <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EWC – EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium</a> –&nbsp; Cross-border Digital Travel Credentials and Organizational Digital Identities. 
 
<p>Existing digital ID systems in countries like Italy, Estonia, and Belgium are expected to transition to support eIDAS 2.0. These systems, which already have a critical mass of users, will likely layer the EU Digital Wallet ecosystem on top of their existing infrastructure. This approach will ensure that the benefits of the current systems are not lost during the transition.</p>
<p>However, several aspects still need clarification, such as the implementation of verifiable data registries, the security requirements of an individual identity wallet, and the management of trust lists. The large-scale pilots and ongoing work on the architecture reference framework are expected to provide answers to these questions.</p>
<p>The momentum in the digital identity space in Europe is indeed exciting. With the new eIDAS 2.0 regulation, the EU Digital Wallet, and the large-scale pilots, the EU is paving the way for a new era of digital identity. This progress is expected to significantly enhance digitalization processes, making them more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between André and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Success of eIDAS 1.0 and the Purpose of eIDAS 2.0 – whether eIDAS 1.0 was successful in enabling digital ID systems and what eIDAS 2.0 aims to correct. 
 eIDAS 2.0 and Interoperability – does eIDAS 2.0 aims to improve interoperability and technology adoption, and is the EU digital ID wallet architecture reference framework (ARF) an extension of this effort? 
 Future of Existing EU-based Digital ID Systems – what will happen to existing digital ID systems like those in Italy and Estonia, and whether they will transition to support eIDAS 2.0 or need to build a second system. 
 Importance of Identity Proofing Uniformity – the importance of uniformity in identity proofing processes across nation states and whether this has been a contentious topic under previous eIDAS legislation. 
 Prescriptive Governance and Technology Recommendations – if it’s better for the ecosystem to have more prescriptive governance and whether the technology recommendations are too prescriptive or not enough. 
 Key Decisions in the ARF Document – the key decisions made in the RF document and what was left unclear. 
 Negative Sentiment Around Blockchains or DLTs – why there might be a negative sentiment around blockchains or DLTs in the digital identity space. 
 Separation of Aries from the Hyperledger Foundation – would it make sense for Aries to be separated from the Hyperledger Foundation given its potential as an open agent. 
 EU’s Four Large-Scale Pilots – updates on the different large-scale pilots and their impact on technical and governance specifications. 
 Learnings from Large-Scale Pilots –&nbsp; learnings from the large-scale pilots, particularly from non-government bodies, and whether there’s a shift in mentality among these entities around digital credentials.

<p>Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) is a collection of security tools and practices for monitoring, identifying, and responding to identity-related cybersecurity threats. ITDR solutions can encompass straightforward security measures, risk assessment and management, machine learning algorithms, and comprehensive analytics.</p>
<p>ITDR is often integrated with other <a>identity and access management</a> systems and works within security frameworks such as <a>zero trust</a> to provide a comprehensive approach to managing and protecting access to valuable resources. It’s a key part of a defense-in-depth strategy in cybersecurity, explicitly aimed at one of the most commonly exploited vectors: user identities.</p>
 What Are Identity Threats and Why Do They Need Special Consideration? 
<p>Identity-based cybersecurity attacks involve unauthorized individuals or entities posing as legitimate users to gain access to systems, networks, or data. They are a significant threat because they exploit one of the most critical security aspects: trust.</p>
 Forms of Identity Attacks 
<p>Identity attacks are common, perhaps more so today than ever, and encompass almost every possible attack vector related to online site access and cloud computing. Some foundational identity attacks include:</p>
 
 <a>Phishing</a>: The attacker sends deceptive messages, often via email, to trick people into divulging sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details. A specific form of phishing is called “spear phishing,” or a more targeted attack that uses deep research and knowledge of targets to steal information.  
 <a>Credential Stuffing</a>: In this attack, stolen account credentials (typically from a data breach) are used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts through large-scale automated login requests. 
 Identity Theft: This attack involves someone impersonating someone to commit fraud, gain unauthorized access, or deceive other users or systems. 
 Session Hijacking: The attacker takes over a user’s session after they’ve logged in, gaining unauthorized access to their data or services. 
 
<p>Additionally, identity attacks can be a cornerstone of more complex and dangerous <a>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</a>. For example, in a “land and expand” approach, attackers first gain a foothold within an organization’s network or systems through a single compromised identity or weak security point (“land”). This could be accomplished through phishing, exploiting a vulnerability, or several methods.</p>
<p>Once inside, the attacker seeks to expand their access and control by escalating privileges, creating new accounts, or spreading malware (“expand”). The ultimate goal is to access more valuable resources, like sensitive data or control over critical systems. The process is often carried out slowly and subtly to avoid detection. </p>
 The Importance of Identity Threat Detection 
<p>ITDR relies heavily on threat detection. With the right detection tools, enterprise organizations can effectively identify, mitigate, and eliminate threats as they arise. Easier said than done, indeed, but that level of challenge doesn’t imply it’s improbable, or even prohibitively complex, to have suitable ITDR measures in place. </p>
<p>These measures include:</p>
 
 Data Collection: Identity threat detection systems monitor various data sources like network traffic, user behavior, login activities, system logs, etc. These data points help build a comprehensive picture of regular activity, and any deviations can signal a potential threat. 
 Risk Assessment: The system continuously assesses risk by looking for suspicious activities. This could include unusual login times, multiple failed login attempts, login from a new or unique location, etc.  
 Anomaly Detection: Using machine learning algorithms, the system can understand what is “normal” behavior for a given identity. Any deviation from this normal behavior can then be flagged as a potential threat.  
 Threat Intelligence Integration: Modern systems often integrate threat intelligence feeds, which provide up-to-date information on known wrong IP addresses, domains, malware signatures, etc. These feeds enhance the system’s ability to recognize potential threats. 
 
<p>Additionally, ITDR can be more effective when combined with other security measures like solid authentication practices (such as <a>multi-factor authentication</a>), regular user and privilege audits, and effective incident response procedures. It’s a vital part of a defense-in-depth strategy in cybersecurity.</p>
 How Does ITDR Relate to Zero-Trust Frameworks? 
<p>“<a>Zero Trust</a>” is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and must verify everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access. </p>
<p>While this approach seems “foolproof” (if you trust no one, then no one untrustworthy may impact your infrastructure), the truth is that all IT systems need to balance security (zero-trust) with accessibility so that people in your organization can use them. </p>
<p>By focusing on usable ITDR, you can maintain secure <a>identity management</a> within a zero-trust framework. Some of the features that support this coexistence include:</p>
 
 Verification: With zero trust, every user and device is treated as potentially hostile, even if it’s coming from inside the network. In this context, ITDR systems help verify user identities by looking for anomalies and signs of compromise. If a trusted user’s behavior changes, the system will flag it as a potential threat. 
 Least Privilege Access: Zero trust operates on a <a>“least privilege” principle</a>, granting users only the access they need to perform their jobs. ITDR helps monitor and enforce this by tracking who accessed what, when, and why. If a user attempts to access a resource they don’t usually interact with, the ITDR system can flag it. 
 Micro-Segmentation: Zero trust often involves breaking the network into smaller parts (micro-segmentation) to limit the potential impact of a breach. ITDR can monitor these segments for signs of unauthorized access or lateral movement. 
 Continuous Monitoring: Under a zero-trust model, trust verification is an ongoing process, not a one-time check. ITDR supports this by continuously monitoring user behavior and looking for potential threats. 
 
<p>In this way, ITDR enhances the effectiveness of a zero-trust strategy by providing an additional layer of security focused on one of the most commonly exploited vectors: user identities.</p>
 Where Does ITDR Fit Into Different Identity Security Approaches? 
<p>ITDR brings together several different types of authentication and identity security, and in many ways, it can seem like a replacement for, or retread, established security measures. The reality is that many security approaches we typically think of in identity management are distinct from, but part of, effective ITDR solutions.</p>
 ITDR, IAM, and PAM 
<p>ITDR, Identity and Access Management (IAM), and <a>Privileged Access Management (PAM)</a> are critical components of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, particularly around managing user identities and access. They’re closely related and often work together to enhance security. Here’s a brief overview of how they relate:</p>
 
 Identity and Access Management (IAM): This involves managing digital identities and controlling their access to resources. IAM systems ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access specific resources. They also facilitate user provisioning and de-provisioning, single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, and more. 
 Privileged Access Management (PAM): PAM is a subset of IAM focused on managing and auditing accounts with elevated privileges, such as administrators. Because these accounts can access sensitive data or critical systems, they’re attractive targets for attackers. PAM solutions control access to these accounts, monitor their activities, and can isolate their sessions to reduce risk. 
 
 ITDR, Endpoint Threat Detection, and Extended Detection and Response 
<p>Yes, ITDR systems are different from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) systems. However, they all contribute to a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. Here’s a brief overview of each:</p>
 
 Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): EDR is a subset of endpoint security technology. It focuses on detecting, investigating, and mitigating suspicious activities on hosts or endpoints (like laptops, mobile devices, or servers). It collects data from endpoint devices to identify threats or malicious activities. 
 Extended Detection and Response (XDR): XDR is a recent approach that extends EDR by collecting and correlating data across multiple security layers – endpoints, networks, email, servers, cloud workloads, and more – not just endpoint devices. Integrating multiple security controls into a unified platform aims to provide more effective threat detection and response. 
 
 What Is the Relationship Between ITDR, Identity Fabric, and Identity Orchestration? 
<p>ITDR, identity fabric, and identity orchestration are all key components of a comprehensive Identity and Access Management strategy. In essence, identity fabric provides the architectural foundation, identity orchestration automates the management tasks based on that architecture, and ITDR is a specialized function that leverages both to detect and respond to identity-based threats. </p>
<p>Together, they create a more secure and efficient approach to managing identities in an organization.</p>
 
 Identity Fabric: As discussed earlier, this refers to a unified and holistic approach to identity services across an organization. It can provide the framework that ITDR systems use to collect and analyze data from across different systems and applications. By ensuring a consistent approach to identity management, an Identity Fabric can also make it easier to spot anomalies and potential security threats. 
 Identity Orchestration: This involves automating and streamlining identity-related tasks, such as user provisioning and password resets. In the context of ITDR, identity orchestration can play a role in the response to a detected threat. For example, if a user’s account is compromised, the identity orchestration system can automatically deprovision or lock the account to prevent further unauthorized access. 
 
 What Should I Look For in ITDR Solutions? 
<p>To be clear, ITDR solutions are varied and distinct. Some are dedicated ITDR platforms that integrate with systems, while others are part and parcel with an existing identity or security solution.</p>
<p>An effective ITDR solution should include the following features:</p>
 
 Real-Time Monitoring: The system should continuously monitor user activity across various systems and applications in real-time. This includes both regular and privileged user accounts. 
 Behavioral Analytics: By employing machine learning and AI, the system should establish a baseline of normal user behavior and then identify anomalies that may suggest a potential threat. 
 Risk Scoring: A good ITDR solution should be able to assign risk scores based on user behavior and other risk indicators. This can help prioritize alerts and responses. 
 Threat Intelligence Integration: It should incorporate threat intelligence feeds to stay current with known threats, vulnerabilities, and malicious entities. 
 Automated Response: The system should be able to respond to detected threats automatically. This could involve forcing a user logout, deactivating an account, or initiating a password reset. 
 Forensic Capabilities: A good solution should have capabilities to store and analyze historical data, which can help in forensic investigations after a security incident. 
 Integration with IAM and PAM: The solution should integrate well with existing Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions to provide a comprehensive view of identity-related risks. 
 Alerting and Reporting: The system should generate alerts based on specific events or conditions and provide comprehensive reporting for audit and compliance purposes. 
 Scalability and Performance: As the organization grows, the solution should scale and perform effectively. 
 Ease of Use: The platform should be user-friendly, with an intuitive interface and easily understandable analytics and reports. 
 
<p>An ITDR solution with these features would provide robust capabilities to detect and respond to identity-related threats, helping protect an organization’s valuable assets and data.</p>

 When it comes to travel, most people are aware how stressful it can be getting to a destination. With digital identity verification at the forefront, waiting times are over allowing travelers to enjoy that cocktail on the beach sooner than expected. 



<p>With the travel industry booming once more, many people are booking their long-awaited vacation to far-off destinations around the globe. However, a majority of customers have directed their focus to booking their travels online with around <a href="https://www.condorferries.co.uk/online-travel-booking-statistics">82% of travelers booking</a> through a website or mobile app. Technology has taken the front seat when it comes to travel, and not only through booking, but the entire journey of the traveler.</p>



<p>It is estimated that around <a href="https://www.condorferries.co.uk/online-travel-booking-statistics">700 million people will make a booking online in 2023</a>, as people around the world click, book and leave on a jet plane to their dream destinations. Thus, it’s no surprise that the online travel market has been <a href="https://www.condorferries.co.uk/online-travel-booking-statistics">valued at $2.3 trillion in 2023</a> and will only go up from there with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 10.3%. But despite this surge in travel, with it comes the insecurities of fraud as well as the long waiting times throughout the journey from booking to arrival.</p>



 Online travel fraud awareness. 



<p>Travel fraud is a growing problem in the industry, with many different types facing travelers and booking platforms. Specifically in air travel, <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/99507-airline-fraud-shoring-up-defense-with-advanced-analytics-and-mlops">airlines account for 46% of all online fraudulent transactions</a>, so it’s no surprise that <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/80-billion-euros-lost-to-online-fraud-across-physical-and-digital-goods-and-e-ticketing-in-2021-reveals-fraugsters-new-payment-intelligence-report-301589345.html">airlines lost over 6.5 billion to fraud in 2021</a>. Even the <a href="https://www.iata.org/">International Air Transport Association (IATA)</a> estimates that the airline industry suffers about <a href="https://www.ravelin.com/blog/fighting-fraud-in-the-airline-industry">$858 million a year, coming out to $639 million just for the airlines</a> in payment fraud.</p>



<p>But what are the most common types of online travel fraud? Perhaps the most obvious, and what’s costing airlines millions of dollars, is stealing payment and personal information such as credit card fraud and using stolen payment information for last-minute bookings or hotel price spikes.</p>



<p>While credit card fraud and identity theft are two of the more widely known types of travel fraud, there are many other forms that can be just as damaging. Such instances include:</p>



  Travelers finding themselves victims of scams such as fake bookings or hidden fees on hotel rooms or airline tickets  Phishing attacks, where criminals attempt to gain access to sensitive personal information by pretending to represent legitimate companies  Ticketing frauds like double booking flights  Cyberattacks targeting airline loyalty programs  



<p>Additionally, data breaches on online booking platforms have become increasingly common. A data breach is when sensitive information, such as credit card details, passport or address information, is accessed without authorization. In the context of travel bookings, this information is often collected by third-party booking platforms, making it vulnerable to travel fraud. Hackers can use compromised data to book unauthorized trips or even sell that information on the dark web for monetary gain.</p>



<p>As technology continues to advance, so do the methods used by criminals to take advantage of unsuspecting travelers – making it essential for everyone involved in the travel industry to stay vigilant against these kinds of threats.</p>

 Planning ahead for a seamless journey. 



<p>But despite the threats and negative consequences that fraud causes in the travel industry, digital identity is there to step in not only to prevent fraud from occurring but to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">make travel seamless</a> for both travelers and booking platforms.</p>



<p>When it comes to digital identity verification, verifying travelers before they even check-in to a hotel, vacation rental or flight can provide security for both guest and host. By asking for a form of identity verification in advance, this allows hosts to know they are doing business with honest and responsible individuals and the guests in turn can rest assured they are using a verified site to book their travel needs. Even world-renowned rental platform <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/selfie-biometrics-for-id-verification-expand-on-airbnb">Airbnb expanded their ID verification</a> earlier this year to require all rental customers and hosts to verify themselves through an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/biometric-checks-at-the-airport-ready-to-board/">ID check with biometrics</a> and in some cases selfie, to help better manage fraud and hold guests and hosts accountable for their actions. But it doesn’t end there.</p>



<p>Along with upfront security, by asking for verification in advance, hosts and travelers can save time later when they are checking in to their rooms, homes or flights making the journey less stressful just like a vacation should be. By optimizing booking, the time that verifying identity would take up later during check-in can be spent instead already getting settled into a seat on a plane or unpacking in that nice hotel that was booked. All that is needed later is a smartphone for a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/leveraging-digital-check-ins-hotel-operations/">quick digital check-in</a>.</p>



<p>Furthermore, by preparing all verifications in advance, there will be fewer documentation requirements later and no need to continually have to search for them in bags at the airport or at the accommodation. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/eurostar-officially-launches-smartcheck-biometric-gates">Eurostar has already begun using such systems</a> at London’s St Pancras International Station where travelers have the ability to go contactless when verifying their identity at pre-departure gates. Paperless verification is just over the horizon.</p>



 Digital Identity Verification—the best travel buddy. 



<p>With the many benefits that digital identity verification has to offer, travelers and hosts can truly be at ease when booking and accessing their trips. Efficiency is reached along with improving the customer experience.</p>



<p>Hosts need only implement ID verification when booking in order to receive the peace of mind that guests are who they say they are. Once that has been approved, which only takes a couple of minutes, hosts can focus more on the customer experience which in reality they already did. By providing an easy-to-use verification system when booking, guests will know they are not only using a safe site, but also are saving time later when traveling.</p>



<p>IDnow’s verification services provide travel businesses with the assistance they need in order to implement a seamless experience for them and their guests. With fraud on the rise in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel industry</a>, especially data breaches and stolen payment and personal information, our fully automated identity proofing solutions provide the ease needed to verify customers’ IDs along with age and address verification. Our solutions protect your business in real-time and offer worldwide document coverage.</p>



<p>Waiting times are over with digital identity verification.</p>

<p>Our team has recreated popular consumer experiences you may be familiar with to demonstrate how you can integrate the power of decentralized identity into a variety of use cases: an AI chat assistant, an app for book reviews, and a social networking app. These example apps, which we call Sprouts 🌱, are designed to spark your creativity and give you inspiration for what you, as a developer, can build using SpruceKit.</p> A Brief Introduction to SpruceKit <p>Before we explore each example, what is SpruceKit? <br><br>SpruceKit is a collection of SpruceID’s open-source libraries that provide tools for implementing decentralized identity. In other words, they enable you to give your app users greater control over their digital identity and personal data by letting them:</p>  Authenticate into decentralized identity  Create and protect personal data vaults  Manage how their data are used and shared  Present verifiable facts about themselves  <p>To learn more about SpruceKit and the open-source libraries it includes, read our announcement blog:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">  Introducing SpruceKit: The Open-Source Toolkit for Decentralized Identity  We’re happy to announce SpruceKit: a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults.  SpruceSpruce    </a> ChatBot <p>ChatBot is an AI chat assistant that uses natural language processing to have human-like conversations, with decentralized identity built in.</p> <a href="https://chatbot.spruceid.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Explore Hosted App</a> <p>We integrated SpruceKit capabilities into up-and-coming ChatBot technology to show how you can offer increased control over the way ChatBot conversations can be used, stored, and shared. With this example, app users can ask a question to generate a conversation, and soon, prove that they generated the conversation by adding their digital signature and establishing credential issuance to enhance content integrity and authenticity.</p><p>SpruceKit allows you to empower users to store their data securely outside of the ChatBot app by authenticating into decentralized identity using technologies such as Sign-In with Ethereum. Rather than an app hosting the data, it is then stored in a way that enables secure data sharing, control and ownership, and increased data privacy.</p><p>Lastly, ChatBot makes it easy to share conversations with specific individuals or across other apps that use SpruceKit open-source libraries. This interoperability facilitates collaboration and innovation that feels seamless for a user who wants to access their data across multiple apps, while also allowing them more control over who has access to data, for what purpose, and when that access is revoked. </p><p>ChatBot is open source, so you can review how we built it directly in GitHub, or through the demo video below.</p> <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/chatbot?ref=blog.spruceid.com">View GitHub</a> ChatBot Demo Video Joyce <p>Joyce is a social app for finding, reviewing, and sharing books where reviews are verifiable.</p> <a href="https://joyce.spruceid.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Explore Hosted App</a> <p>Interacting with friends to share book reviews, recommendations, and more is made better when you feel a sense of increased privacy, ownership, and control over the content you generate.<br><br>SpruceKit was used to implement personal data vaults in Joyce where users can store their book ratings in their own data vault vs. in app-hosted storage, promoting a more transparent and user-centric experience around the way app data is handled.<br><br>This example also shows how you can create verification flows for users to claim ownership over book reviews that they write in order to enhance data integrity and trust. </p><p>Joyce is open source, so you can review how we built it directly in GitHub, or through the demo video below.</p> <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/joyce?ref=blog.spruceid.com">View GitHub</a> Joyce Demo Video Teal <p>Teal is a social networking app based on managing one's own BlueSky data.</p> <a href="https://teal.spruceid.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Explore Hosted App</a> <p>Protecting your privacy and sensitive information on social networking channels is critical in today’s age with data leaks, social engineering and individuals gaining unauthorized access.

<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with our VP of solutions, Vik Subramanian.</p>
<p>Vik, welcome to the vlog. It’s good to have you.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Hey, great being here too. Michael, it’s always a pleasure to speak with you.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Are you out of Chicago today?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Yes, I am. I am.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Oh, you’re wearing the very dapper 1Kosmos vest. Surprised it’s not the summer inferno a high humidity in Chicago right now.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
We’ve been having the tornadoes come and attack us these days. So better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
I remember those. Well, listen, I really appreciate you taking time. I know you’re super busy lately. I want to talk about Microsoft today and where 1Kosmos fits in. So on the marketing side, we’re seeing a lot of organizations interested in passwordless, but they have … Microsoft is their backbone and they’re either experimenting with or implementing Windows. Hello for business, but you’re knee-deep in this stuff. In your own words, what are you seeing with the companies that you’re working with on the Microsoft side?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Absolutely. So let me actually begin with telling the audience what I do for a living a little bit. So me and the team, I actually have a team of mad scientists who put solutions together, solve problems, and make sure that our platform is a great fit for the organization. Now we working with a lot of organizations that have really invested in Microsoft and rightfully so they’re investing in Azure or Entra ID and moving forward and going through that journey. Now what we’re seeing is that a lot of organizations are starting to adopt the cloud in a large way, and they are taking their on-premise infrastructure, even their domain controllers and moving it to the cloud and adopting Azure. They’re becoming an Azure-only shop. They’re starting to take their devices, put it on Azure, and they’re starting to experiment with Windows Hello for Business.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
That’s super interesting. I just read a research paper yesterday which plotted I think an eight-time increase in interest around identity access management in just the past year or so, and that speculation was that had something to do with companies moving to a hybrid or virtual … part of their infrastructure being virtual.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Yeah, I mean, it’s extremely interesting that a lot of companies going to the cloud, especially, I think everyone’s talking about the pandemic making everyone remote. Still people are coming back into the office, but they want the ability to work from anywhere, access resources, from anywhere, and the cloud allows them to do that. And I think the solutions that they’re looking at, especially going to the cloud, they want a single platform where they get everything. Microsoft or Windows Hello is kind of fitting the bill for the most part.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So these organizations have Microsoft, and there’s been this kind of full-throated market attack on passwords and eliminating SMS. So for organizations with Microsoft, where does 1Kosmos fit in?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Absolutely right. So let’s actually talk about what Windows Hello does do and doesn’t do where Block ID or the 1Kosmos solution would fit in. Windows Hello for Business is really a means for authenticating into your Microsoft assets, emphasis on Microsoft assets using biometrics. So a lot of solutions today or a lot of hardware today comes with biometric-based authentications such as your infrared cameras or fingerprint readers. Your laptops could have it.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this is applicable for Windows 10, Windows 11 systems, some of the latest pieces of software that not all organizations have are adopted just yet. Secondly, what it also requires is that your machines be joined to the Azure or to the cloud, and that takes more than a snap of a finger to deploy. So when you’re talking about an organization adopting Windows Hello, or really rolling out Windows Hello for Business, it is a large program that they need to embark on in order to enable their employees to utilize biometrics.</p>
<p>I mean, we still haven’t spoken about the human aspect about it saying, Hey, I don’t want my biometrics stored on your devices and all of those things that they are having to deal with with respect to humans having oppositions to it. These just technology constraints that organizations have to deal with.</p>
<p>The other thing is that Windows Hello for Business again on cold boot and on in certain situations it requires that a pin or a password to unlock the safe that is there on the device. So users still have to remember a password and which they can tend to forget very easily if they’re using biometrics on a daily basis. But the process to reset the password is still legacy. You’re still answering KBAs or it’s a completely separate process outside of this entire thing that needs to be managed.</p>
<p>And lastly, really, the biometrics are stored locally on one device. I mean in this day and age of hoteling where I’m going from one device to another device to another device, I should not be asked to go ahead and register by my biometrics across all of them. And also, there’s limitation on the number of users that can be enrolling their biometrics on one device. So there are some limitations that organizations do have to deal with, but it’s a very powerful solution. So this is where, like I mentioned again … so from a Microsoft asset standpoint, Windows Hello for Business can definitely be utilized. Organizations still need to start in … keep investing in Azure, integrate their applications into Azure, utilize conditional access. There’s a ton of features that Azure offers you. But think about it, you’ve got laptops in your organization that have Windows Hello for Business or Windows Hello enabled. Users are starting to use it. Great. You know what, they can be managed by Azure. You’ve got your applications that are federated, they can managed by Azure. You’ve got your devices, you can roll out MDM, managed by Azure.</p>
<p>Great, but what about the rest of your organization? You’ve got other flavors of Windows in there. You’ve got Mac, you’ve got the network devices, you’ve got your Linux devices, you’ve got legacy applications that don’t conform to standards. Then you’ve got users who simply want the flexibility or want their identity in their own hands. And the privacy-preserving method of being able to log in using passwordless. This is where 1Kosmos comes in.</p>
<p>So we have the capability of extending the Azure functionality and really working with your investment in Azure and extending that capability across your organization. We have the credential provider for Windows, which works really well, enables organizations to log in using device biometrics or I think Michael, you’ve spoken about Live ID. So Live ID is very powerful to utilize across your servers and very critical systems that are remote where again, Windows Hello would not work. Then we have the ability to deploy our passwordless technology onto Macs. So now you’re controlling the assets on the ground. Then get into your data centers. We’ve got network devices, VMware devices, you’ve got your virtualization layer, all of those things can be integrated with us. We support legacy protocols like Radius, LDAP, all of those things which will really make those systems passwordless-enabled.</p>
<p>And lastly, from a privacy standpoint, we put the power of identity in the hands of the user. It’s always in the hands. It’s protected using their biometrics. It’s stored on their device, which means that they have the confidence that they are authenticating onto their device, giving them access to an asset that’s provided to them by the organization.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. Wow. Well, that’s super interesting. So it’s sometimes convenient, maybe as some marketers just to talk about passwordless is this little thing that exists in a vacuum and how if you don’t have passwords, they can’t be stolen. Great flare for the obvious there, but what you’re mentioning here, all the edge cases, logging onto your Mac, for example, in a mixed environment, logging into the VPN. IT people have their … need to access domain controllers, maybe even what users might have different, I guess, security profiles. I mean, if you’re logging into a mission-critical system that’s got very careful permission access on it versus you’re logging to do something benign, I guess managing that scenario.</p>
<p>Another topic that’s gotten a lot of attention and maybe too much is zero trust. There’s so many claims about zero trust. Let’s start at the basic. What is zero trust when it comes to authentication?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Absolutely. So zero trust in terms of authentication would fall under the identity pillar. So there are seven pillars. We would be in the identity pillar where … I mean it forms it … We’d love to say that we’re the center of the universe of the zero trust universe. Why? Because you know what, the authentication is what determines are you who you say you are. It is the layer that really identifies the user. So authentication forms a very critical part of the zero trust strategy for an organization. Now, this is where it gets interesting. So when we are thinking about authentication till now, and even organizations that are deploying MFA and advanced MFA think they have the silver bullet, but think about it.</p>
<p>Really, what is the question you’re trying to answer? Anytime that a user is coming knocking on your door and wants to authenticate, you’re really asking the question, who are you? And then you want to validate, are you really telling me the right thing about who you are? So how are you doing that? The organizations today utilize a combination of username and password. They accept Fido keys and then they’ve got solutions all out there. Evaluate 50 other things about you, meaning, hey, where are you coming from, what is the browser version, hey, what’s behind you at the wall, let me evaluate 10 or a hundred different things about you, and then maybe have some more assurance that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>Now, 1Kosmos BlockID is changing that. I mean, in the physical world, really, the way that I would read to you, Michael, I mean he is like, I know I can see you. I would greet you. I’d shake your hand and say, Hey, show me your ID and probably I’ll look at your picture and then do it that way. I know that you’re Michael. So we’ve just digitized that process. So we’re taking the identity, helping a user enroll that identity, hold it within their wallet, the point of authentication, they’re able to prove it, really provide a piece of that identity that’s enough for the authentication. And now the system has a great deal of confidence that it is Vikram who’s authenticating, and now the authentication has a high degree of assurance, which means the other systems or the other pillars in zero trust at least can knock off one checkbox going, yes, I know who’s coming into my organization, now determine what they can do or cannot do.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. So my iPhone knows who I am. I look at my iPhone, it knows who I am. I put my finger on a fingerprint reader, it knows me, right?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Hey, I mean it knows you, but it doesn’t tell me that it is actually Michael who’s authenticating. That’s the difference. But it knows that it’s a human. Yes, that’s all it tell the system. But that’s where a Live ID solution comes into play. We can truly say it is Michael who’s coming in, it is Vikram who’s trying to authenticate and only then allow you to get in. This is where the Live ID comes into play. Sometimes it helps introduce a little friction in authentication. Customer experience. Well, with a little friction introduces confidence.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right. So Live ID is actually the technology that we have that kind of defeats spoofing, if you will, and asks a person to make facial movements or gestures. So it’s a live or a real biometric if you will.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Well, but you know, got to remember, we’re the only solution in the market that puts a smile to people’s faces when they’re authenticating it. We get people to smile, imagine, hey, which employees smiles when they want to come in and log into their laptop? We do that.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, there’s some truth to that– it’s creating an environment of trust versus an environment of distrust. So I totally agree with you there. Listen, I don’t know if we’ve missed anything but taking 50 minutes of your time, it’s been really formative. I appreciate you stepping away from your day-to-day to do this for me.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, and you have a great day. We’ll have you back sometime soon.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
All right. Thanks, Michael.</p>

<p>There’s a familiar proverb, “everything old is new again,” which seems to be especially true as we look at data protection trends over the last few decades. As someone who’s been involved with cryptography for over 20 years, it’s always good to see a renewed interest in data encryption.</p>
<p>Many of the key drivers for data encryption over the last two decades have been compliance related. The creation and evolution of PCI data protection standards, GDPR, and widespread data breaches have all driven the use of encryption.&nbsp; For many enterprises, the use of encryption was treated as a compliance checkbox. If an organization could achieve compliance by encrypting entire storage volumes, then that was the path forward. Once column level encryption became a standard offering in major relational databases, that was another method to achieve compliance, and a bit more security. The data protection method that usually took the most effort, but provided the greatest protection, was application level encryption. This was the classic trade-off – ease of implementation vs. security.</p>
<p>Application level encryption was difficult, but provided the greatest level of security. The major advantage of application level encryption is that the protection is inherent in the data element itself. It doesn’t matter if an encrypted credit card number is in a flat file, relational database, data lake, or whether it is transmitted over a secure link — The protection travels with the data. This approach has become more appealing as organizations look at the data protection problem through a Zero Trust lens. Because the protection is now inherent in the data, access to that unencrypted data becomes more of a policy and identity problem. If I need to prove who I am, and why I need the data in order to access it, this greatly reduces the risk to the data and provides a compliance/audit trail.</p>
<p>The downside of application encryption was that it required business application developers to have some understanding of cryptography, and more importantly, key management. It was simple enough to use cryptographic functions that were included in the major development toolkits/platforms, but the management of the associated keys was always “an exercise for the reader.” Keys were stored in files, database tables, or language/OS specific software keystores – without context.</p>
<p>We’ve seen several trends emerging which reduce the burden on the application developer, and provide centralized key management. A number of large organizations we’ve worked with over the past few years have been developing cryptography as a service (“CaaS”) – utilizing a restful API to enable application developers to encrypt, decrypt, or tokenize data based on the data type. For example, rather than requiring a developer to understand which algorithm, mode, initialization vector and key length to use to encrypt a National ID number, they would call a restful API which simply required a data type – encrypt_svc(“National ID number”, id), which would return a protected blob of data. The methods used to protect a National ID number would be centrally defined by the CaaS infrastructure, based on a data protection policy – with the keys centrally managed. This is true for both the tokenization of sensitive data, as well as encryption.</p>
<p>For those applications that are not so easily modified, or that require a more standard-based interface, centralized key management can still be utilized. Many platforms and applications control their own cryptography, but do so utilizing keys managed outside of that platform. An example of this is Microsoft SQL Server. Database administrators can define columns to be encrypted, using keys that are protected from a centralized key management system.</p>
<p>Use of a centralized key management system also helps provide greater crypto agility, the ability to rapidly change the cryptographic methods used to protect data. This is particularly important as we prepare for the era of post-quantum cryptography.</p>

<p>Not only that, but with SelfKey iD, users may have complete control over their digital identities and they might exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">SSID</a> rights more easily than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
 How does SelfKey iD work? 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD is a smooth and hassle-free process that prioritizes user convenience without compromising security and privacy. The streamlined procedure may ensure that users have access to a secure and private digital identity that they can trust.</p>
 The process&nbsp; 
<p>By following the simple steps outlined by the platform, users can obtain a SelfKey iD quickly and with ease. The steps are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Users must first log in with their wallet and pay an entry fee.</p>
<p>2. The next step would be to undergo a KYC verification process. This method is designed to ensure that the user's identity is authentic and that they meet the necessary eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>The verification process typically consists of:&nbsp;</p>
 
 performing a <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">selfie check</a>. 
 providing personal information, such as name and address. 
 providing government-issued identification documents, such as a passport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, users will not be able to create duplicate accounts.</p>
<p>3. Once the KYC process is complete, legible users are automatically approved.</p>
<p>4. The final step in the process is to mint the soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT. This unique digital asset is generated using blockchain technology and is securely bound to the user's digital identity.</p>
<p>It might serve as proof of identity (POI) and it may be used to authenticate the user's identity in a variety of settings, such as:</p>
 
 online marketplaces. 
 financial institutions. 
 other digital platforms, such as social media and videogames. 
 
<p>Even more, as the concept of the metaverse gains popularity, the need for secure and reliable digital identities becomes increasingly important. SelfKey iD emphasizes privacy and self-sovereignty. Therefore, it may be the perfect identity credential for the exciting products and services of the future.</p>
 Minting soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT 
 Aggregating Multiple Credentials 
<p>By combining different SBT (soul-bound tokens) and identity credentials, SelfKey iD may provide a higher level of verification for the user's identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials which may be aggregated by a SelfKey iD include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Metaproof. 
 KYC credentials issued by SelfKey Network issuers. 
 Traditional accounts, such as: Google, Apple, Discord, Github, Twitter, and the likes. 
 Various identity tokens, such as Binance’s BAB token issued in 2022. 
 
<p>This implementation may have significant advantages over individual credentials, as it may increase the reliability and accuracy of identity verification. And, an increase in reliability and accuracy is crucial for online interactions and services that require trust between parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more credentials added to the SelfKey iD container, the more trust may be established, and the more reliable and secure the user's digital identity may become.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the integration of multiple SBTs and identity credentials within a SelfKey iD container might provide users with unparalleled flexibility. This may enable them to add as many credentials as they require to establish their identity in a variety of contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may enhance the SelfKey platform's versatility and utility. It might make it more appealing to individuals and institutions seeking a reliable and secure digital identity solution.</p>
<p>Essentially, SelfKey's implementation of an aggregated credential system in its platform may be a significant step forward in the development of a strong and reliable self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>

This feature may add a touch of personalization and uniqueness to the user's digital identity. Even more, it might reflect the growing trend of NFTs in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may also enhance the user's experience by providing them with more options to personalize and showcase their digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the addition of the NFT series feature to the SelfKey iD platform reflects the platform's continued focus on user-friendliness, personalization, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
 Access to SelfKey DAO 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD may provide users with numerous benefits that enhance their experience on the platform and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These benefits may include:</p>
 
 access to the governance of the SelfKey Protocol. 
 the ability to mint SELF tokens. 
 participating in locking a POI credential. 
 exclusive access to member-only channels on Discord. 
 obtaining exclusive collectible NFT packs. 
 registering for KEY.ETH ENS domains. 
 enjoying instant login to partner apps. 
 
 Minting SELF tokens 
<p>Having access to the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. The token might then be used for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may add value to the user's experience and may provide them with more control over their digital identity.</p>
 Locking 
<p>By locking KEY tokens on their KYC credential, users may mint SELF tokens. Locking credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials. Users may withdraw tokens at any time, although this will result in the termination of SELF token generation.</p>
 Exclusive Discord Channels 
<p>Access to member-only Discord channels may be another perk of having a SelfKey iD. It may provide users with a community to engage with other DAO members through a designated channel. DAO members may also discuss proposals for the governance of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
 NTF packs 
<p>Exclusive collectible NFT packs may also be available to SelfKey iD holders. This may add a unique and personalized touch to their digital identity. These collectibles are released by the SelfKey DAO, further enhancing their customization and originality.</p>
 KEY.ETH ENS domains and SelfKey iD 
<p>Moreover, SelfKey iD holders may register for KEY.ETH ENS domains. This might enable them to create unique and easily identifiable domains for their online identity.</p>
 Instant login to partner apps 
<p>Instant login to partner apps may be another advantage of having a SelfKey iD. This may provide users with a seamless and secure login process across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the benefits of having a SelfKey iD express the platform's commitment to providing users with a comprehensive, valuable experience. It may enhance their ability to navigate the crypto space with ease and confidence.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>In theory, SelfKey iD may be a strong and reliable form of digital identity that might be used for a broad range of use cases in the crypto world. With its focus on user-friendliness, security, and privacy, the SelfKey iD may be well-suited to the needs of decentralized societies and Web3 applications.</p>
<p>However, SelfKey iD may also be suited for traditional Web2 platforms that want to benefit from security and anti-bot features inherent to the SelfKey iD system.</p>
<p>SelfKey iD may not only empower the governance of the SelfKey DAO but it may also provide a model for other decentralized governance systems. By offering powerful, privacy-preserving identity credentials, the SelfKey iD might enable more fair and democratic governance. This way, users may have greater control over their data and identities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to provide new forms of decentralized governance, which may allow members to experiment with different approaches and explore the full potential of the SelfKey iD.&nbsp;</p>

 Predict future ETH prices, for 5000 OCEAN in prizes weekly. Now part of Ocean&nbsp;DF  Contents<br>1. <a>Abstract</a><br>2. <a>Introduction</a><br>3. <a>DF, Updated</a><br>4. <a>Challenge DF Details</a><br>5. <a>FAQ</a><br>6. <a>Conclusion</a>  1. Abstract <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>’s monthly “Predict-ETH” data challenges have become weekly “Challenge DF” <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md">challenges</a>, as part of <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Ocean Data Farming</a> (DF). Each week has 5,000 OCEAN total in prizes towards those who predict the price of ETH with the lowest error. It’s part of Active DF; Passive DF is unchanged.</p><p>Predict ETH price accurately to win! Weekly competitions and prize $. The first challenge is live now. Get started&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md">here</a>.</p> 2. Introduction  2.1 Background: Ocean Data Challenges <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/challenges">Ocean Data Challenges</a> are data science competitions run by the Ocean core team with $thousands in prize money. Past competitions include <a href="https://bit.ly/3AXVBWc">Dubai real estate prediction</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/45ymuy6">OCEAN Twitter sentiment analysis</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/3Dp6B0s">Catalunya air pollution</a>, and more. There’s a steady pipeline of future challenges. Most competitions are judged on a combination of subjective merit (e.g. data analysis) and objective merit (e.g.&nbsp;error).</p> 2.2 Background: Predict-ETH Data Challenges <p>There’s great value in being able to predict ETH well. It helps to make $ in buying / selling ETH, DeFi trading, yield farming or DeFi protocol development. Such predictions — if accurate — would be of high interest to buy, e.g. as a datafeed within Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>Accordingly, we’ve encouraged the Ocean community to get good at predicting ETH. Specifically, within Ocean Data Challenges, we’ve held monthly <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth">“Predict-ETH” Challenges</a>, running from October 2022 to July 2023 (7 total). Participants had to predict the ETH price into the near-term future: 5 min, 10 min,&nbsp;…, 60 min ahead. Reward $ goes to those with lowest prediction error. Error is a 100% objective measure.</p> 2.3 Background: Ocean Data&nbsp;Farming <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is a rewards program that incentivizes for growth of Data Consume Volume (DCV) [1] in the Ocean ecosystem. DF is like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned to drive DCV. DF emits OCEAN weekly for (a) passive rewards and (b) active&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>We <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">launched DF</a> in June 2022, and arrived at <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main</a> phase in March&nbsp;2023.</p> 2.4 DF Evolution <p>We’d set expectations that we may tune DF to include data competitions [2][3]. Now, that’s happening.</p><p>We’ve moved the ETH prediction competitions from Data Challenges framework to Ocean DF framework for two reasons. First, the competitions were 100% objective, and so could be automated to lower administration overhead; DF already had relevant weekly ops to support such a competition. Second, it sets up DF for further evolution related to predictions, stay&nbsp;tuned;)</p> 3. DF,&nbsp;Updated <p>This section describes how DF is updated, in terms of structure, budgets, and how people can earn OCEAN in&nbsp;DF.</p> 3.1 DF Structure, Updated <p>Challenge DF is a new substream of Active DF&nbsp;[4].</p><p>Here’s the updated structure of&nbsp;DF:</p>  Passive DF. Lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, for passive rewards. Reward depends on veOCEAN amount, which in turn depends on amount of OCEAN locked and for how&nbsp;long.  Active DF. Substreams:<br>– Volume DF. Here, people curate data by pointing their veOCEAN towards data assets. Reward depends on asset DCV, veOCEAN amount, and more. (This is what was previously simply called Active DF; now it’s one substream of Active DF.)<br>– Challenge DF. Here, people predict future ETH price, and rewards are a function of prediction accuracy. (This is the new substream of active&nbsp;DF.)   3.2 DF Budgets,&nbsp;Updated <p>The DF budget change is mild: 5,000 OCEAN weekly that was going towards Volume DF, is now going towards Challenge DF. Everything else stays the same. Let’s elaborate.</p><p>We’re currently in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main 1</a>, with 150,000 OCEAN per week in rewards. This gets allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 75,000 OCEAN&nbsp;(50%)  Active DF: 75,000 OCEAN (50%), allocated as:<br>– Volume DF substream: 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF substream: 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>There is no change to how DF Main ratchets up OCEAN rewards over time. Here’s a summary. In Mar 2024, rewards increase 2x to 300,000 OCEAN. Six months later, another 2x to 600,000 OCEAN. Six months later, another near-2x to 1.1M OCEAN/week, then decaying over time. It’s always a 50/50 split between passive/active DF. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">This post has&nbsp;details</a>.</p> 3.3 Earning DF Rewards,&nbsp;Updated <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the <a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean">DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards">Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF <br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards">Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once). <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md">Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p> 4. Challenge DF&nbsp;Details  4.1 Punchline <p>You can participate in Challenge DF by making ETH predictions for specific times. The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md">Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions [5]. We share key aspects&nbsp;here.</p> 4.2 Key&nbsp;dates <p>Each Challenge DF competition is weekly, in line with the rest of&nbsp;DF.</p>  Submission deadline: Every Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the Data Farming round finishes.  Prediction at times: Every Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total).  <p>Challenge DF competitions start now. Therefore the first submission deadline is Wednesday Aug 2, 2023 at 23:59 UTC, as part Data Farming Round 48&nbsp;(DF48).</p> 4.3 Criteria to&nbsp;Win <p>The winner = whoever has lowest prediction error (normalized mean-squared error, or&nbsp;NMSE).</p><p>To be eligible, competitors must produce the outcomes that the README guides. This includes:</p>  Created an Ocean data&nbsp;NFT  Filled it with (encrypted) predictions  Transferred it to the Ocean judges before the&nbsp;deadline  And a bit more; the README has full&nbsp;info   4.4 Challenge DF&nbsp;Prizes <p>Weekly Prize Pool: 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN</p>  1st place: 2,500&nbsp;OCEAN  2nd place: 1,500&nbsp;OCEAN  3rd place: 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN   4.5 Winners Reward Distribution <p>We will identify winners by the blockchain address they use in the competition (on&nbsp;Mumbai).</p><p>Rewards get distributed as part of DF rewards: we allocate OCEAN to winners’ accounts on Ethereum mainnet as part of Active Rewards contract.</p><p>If you are a competitor and want to know if you won, go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF Webapp</a> “Challenge DF” section and see the listing of winners for each previous DF&nbsp;Round.</p><p>To claim your reward, go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp “Rewards” page</a>. Then, within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button. This will claim rewards across all Active DF substreams at&nbsp;once.</p> 5. FAQ   Q: Data Farming is supposed to be about driving DCV. How does Challenge DF&nbsp;help?  A: ETH price predictions — if accurate — make for price feeds that people will readily pay for to trade against and more. Challenge DF catalyzes creating such feeds, and has more streamlined ops than the previous Predict-ETH Data Challenges.  Q: Are Challenge DF rewards a function of stake, e.g. veOCEAN&nbsp;held?  A: No. Challenge DF rewards are only a function of accuracy. (For&nbsp;now.)  Q: Predict-ETH had a blog post announcing each challenge, and another post announcing winners. Will you have the same&nbsp;here?  A: Partially. There is already a weekly DF blog post that wraps up the previous DF round and gives parameters for the next DF round. To keep ops streamlined, the blog post will not list winners. If you had submitted to Challenge DF and want to know whether you won, go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF Webapp</a> “Challenge DF” section and see the listing of winners for each previous DF Round. Your winnings are claimable as part of regular Active DF&nbsp;rewards.  Q: Going from Predict-ETH Data Challenges to Challenge DF, does the prize pool stay the&nbsp;same?  A: Approximately, yes. The changes are (a) weekly not monthly, and (b) denominated in OCEAN not USD. Let’s elaborate. Each monthly Predict-ETH competition had total 5000 USD worth of OCEAN worth of prizes. Dividing that by 4 (approx. 4 weeks in a month) gives us 1250 USD per week. Since DF is automated, it’s cleaner to calculate everything in OCEAN not USD. With <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">current OCEAN price</a> about 0.35 USD, then 1250 USD is 3571 OCEAN. We round up to 5000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Q: What’s the difference between “Predict-ETH” and “predict&nbsp;ETH”?  A: “Predict-ETH” refers to the specific set of Ocean Data Challenges to predict the price of ETH. “predict ETH” is simply a verb combined with the “what”, around someone predicting the price of ETH; it’s not referring to any given&nbsp;product.   6. Conclusion <p>Challenge DF is a new substream of Active DF, which rewards 5,000 OCEAN total in prizes towards those who predict the price of ETH with the lowest error. Expect Active DF to evolve further, towards driving DCV in Ocean ecosystem. Passive DF and total OCEAN rewards emissions are unchanged and will remain&nbsp;so.</p><p>Predict ETH price accurately to win! Weekly competitions and prize $. Get started&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md">here</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Data Consume Volume (DCV) is the USD$-denominated amount spent to purchase data assets and consume them, for a given time period (e.g. one&nbsp;week)</p><p>[2] Expectation setting in the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">DF Main launch post</a>, section 4.4 “DF Evolution”: “With each weekly cycle, the DF core team may tune the Reward Function or make other changes based on learnings.

One constraint, out of our commitment to the OCEAN community, was “don’t touch passive DF”, which has 50% of the weekly DF rewards budget. In contrast, Active DF was always meant to evolve, all towards driving DCV. This is why we made Challenge DF a new substream of Active&nbsp;DF.</p><p>[5] Challenge DF’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md">README</a> may evolve week-to-week.

			  Tiago Bértolo is a Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you?  
<p>Hey there! I’m Tiago, born in 1988 in beautiful Portugal. Currently, I’m working at Tokeny as a software engineer.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I was knee-deep in the crypto realm, working as a backend engineer in a related company. What really inspired me to make the leap to Tokeny was their innovative approach to asset tokenization. The way they strive to democratize blockchain technology truly struck a chord with me, and I knew this was a team I wanted to be a part of.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>We have a very friendly environment where everyone genuinely supports one another. The team spirit is remarkable, and it feels like we’re all working together towards something truly impactful. Plus, we get to play with cutting-edge technology, which makes the job even more fun and dynamic.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Aside from the tech world, my two biggest passions in life are my family and reading. Spending quality time with my loved ones and getting lost in the pages of a captivating book fills me with joy.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			  
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Ah, I might sound like Miss Universe, but my answer is genuine 😀. I dream of world peace. If we can achieve harmony among all people, that would be a dream come true.</p>
 
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Remember that premature optimization is the root of all evil. Keep your focus on building strong foundations, and the rest will fall into place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Well, it’s no secret that blockchain technology is here to stay, and that’s what excites me the most about Tokeny’s future. We’re right at the heart of this transformative tech revolution, and I believe that Tokeny has all the potential to be a game-changer. Being part of shaping the future with a dedicated team is incredibly exciting!</p>

  Our implementation of algorithmic choice lets users customize one of the most important parts of their social media experience: their feed.

<p>We set out to build a social network that gives users more control over what they see. Our implementation of algorithmic choice lets users customize one of the most important parts of their social media experience: their feed.</p>
<p>In May, we launched custom feeds, an interface that lets users choose between feeds and helps developers build them. Custom feeds allow third party developers to create entirely new feeds that users can install.</p>
 How Custom Feeds Work 
<p>Instead of building the social experience around a single black box algorithm controlled by a single company, we’re providing an open marketplace of feeds. This allows users to create and share their own feeds, as well as subscribe to others. A company can offer a feed, but so can a third-party developer, or any user who builds a feed using a <a href="https://skyfeed.app/#/">custom feed builder</a>. Whether you want to subscribe to a feed of only cat photos or to posts from only your mutuals, this is possible with custom feeds — think of them as super-powered, more customizable hashtags or lists.</p>
<p>You can pin your feeds to your home screen, making it easy for you to find them.</p>

Your custom feeds settings, where you can pin and sort your feeds in the app.

The Popular With Friends custom feed, with tabs for other feeds above.
<p>For now, it’ll take a bit of developer familiarity to <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator">create your own custom feed</a>. We’re still working on improving the search &amp; discovery of custom feeds, as well as the developer experience, but the basics of what it looks like to have a customizable social experience are here. In the meantime, third-party developers have built tools like <a href="https://skyfeed.app/#/">Skyfeed</a> and <a href="https://goodfeeds.co/">Goodfeeds</a>, which allows users to easily create and search for custom feeds.</p>
 Default Feeds 
<p>Early on, we put most of our development effort into supporting the ability for people to build and install custom feeds. We started off with some very simple algorithms for the default feeds offered in the app, rather than trying to build great algorithmic feeds ourselves. Now that we’ve arrived at a stable first iteration of how custom feeds will work, we’re going to start improving on the default experience.</p>
<p>The algorithm for our first What’s Hot feed was so simple it can be fully described in one line:&nbsp;any post that got 12 likes made it on! The next iteration of What’s Hot used what was essentially the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">Hacker News ranking algorithm</a>, resulting in popular posts remaining stuck at the top for a long time. Posts on Bluesky are short though, unlike articles or blog posts, so content quickly got stale when it stayed pinned all day.</p>
<p>To improve the default experience, we’re now replacing “What’s Hot” with “Discover”, a more complex feed that you can expect to evolve over time. Unlike “What’s Hot”, “Discover” will be customized for what you like to see, while still giving you a view into what’s trending in the network. The initial version of “Discover” mixes in a global view of what’s trending in the network with posts from accounts you follow and posts from accounts near your social graph. We’ll keep improving on this algorithm, with the goal of making a feed full of interesting content that refreshes often and takes your unique interests into consideration.</p>
<p>Our approach to making an algorithmic feed isn’t new. Most social networks take into account your interests and social graph to curate an unique feed for you. What’s new is our focus on algorithmic choice —&nbsp;letting you unpin feeds you don’t like, and discover and install new feeds that better suit your interests. If you don’t like our new Discover feed, you can simply remove it and replace it with any other custom feed. Our approach to how feeds work mirrors our overall design philosophy: give users sensible defaults but leave them the option to fully customize their experience if they don’t like our choices.</p>

  It is crucial to understand the risks of data breaches and to try and take steps to prevent them.

Some negative effects can last for years, with victims suffering reputational damage, identity theft, and even financial fraud. And, in some cases, the consequences of a cyberattack can be irreversible. 

However, decentralized solutions are being developed with the aim to protect individuals' privacy

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>Have you ever seriously considered the negative impacts of a data breach? Are you aware of the digital safety risks that lurk around the corners of the internet? And, did you know that cyberattacks may produce life-long consequences?</p>
<p>Nowadays, applications and websites have become so common that we consider them an integral part of our daily lives. And, because we have normalized it, individuals blindly share their private information with little thought given to the implications of doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We rarely ever stop to consider what happens to our personal data once we share it with large technology corporations. And that’s because we live with the illusion that our valuable or sensitive private information is safe. That cyber attacks cannot possibly reach us.</p>
<p>However, some serious privacy violations have occurred in the past several months. And they have exposed the severe effects of sharing personal information without proper caution to safety and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite data breaches occurring on a daily basis, they aren’t discussed as often as they should be. Individuals who have not experienced such incidents may assume that they are immune to them. But anyone can fall victim at any time, and the consequences of a data breach can be irreversibly harmful.</p>
<p>In this article, SelfKey aims to provide an in-depth analysis of data breaches, recent events, and the potential aftermath for individuals whose personal information is compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly important to spread awareness about the possible consequences of data breaches. To attempt to prevent them from happening at all. With SelfKey’s decentralized solutions, a safer digital future may await us.</p>
<p>Let us elaborate on these crucial aspects in the paragraphs below.</p>

 Victims of data breaches: Are you safe? 
 Conclusions 
 
 Defining data breaches: Meaning and Overview 
 A brief, but fundamental introduction 
<p>Data breaches are serious security violations where confidential, protected or sensitive data is accessed, stolen or used by an unauthorized person or organization. These devastating incidents are also known as data spills, data leaks, or information disclosures, and they can occur in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>These digital attacks are typically well organized and initiated by malicious players, including organized crime, political activists, and national governments. However, even individuals who accidentally gain unauthorized access to systems with poor security configurations can cause data breaches.</p>
<p>The information that hackers may disclose can range from matters that may compromise national security to information that government officials want to keep hidden. When a person who has access to such information deliberately exposes it, for political reasons, it is usually referred to as a "leak".</p>
 The negative effects of a cyber attack: What happens after? 
<p>Data breaches can have far-reaching consequences, impacting a variety of information types including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 financial data, such as credit card information and bank details. 
 personally identifiable information (PII), such as full name, full address, IDs, birth certificate information, etc. 
 personal health information (PHI), such as full name, home address, or dates related to the health or identity of individuals. 
 trade secrets, and intellectual property.&nbsp; 
 sensitive or valuable information, like photos or videos. 
 
<p>Unstructured data, such as files, documents, and private information, can also become exposed and vulnerable if proper security measures are not in place to protect them.</p>
<p>These cyberattacks aren’t limited to organizations or powerful institutions, though. Anyone could be a victim. And, worst of all, the compromise or theft of the information listed above can lead to anything from:</p>
 
 financial losses 
 identity theft 
 reputational damage 
 legal repercussions 
 
<p>It's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect their sensitive information and implement strong security measures to prevent data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey understands the devastating consequences of data breaches and emphasizes the significance of implementing preventive measures. Responding promptly and adequately in case of such incidents is also highly important.&nbsp;</p>
 Recent Data Breaches: The beginning of 2023 
<p>The frequency of data breaches has increased in recent years. Alarmingly, the past several months have seen a handful of significant incidents.&nbsp;</p>
 
 One such example is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches">TikTok’s illegal processing of data</a> belonging to 1.4 million children under 13, who were using its platform without parental consent. This breach highlights the importance of proper data management practices, particularly when dealing with children's information. 
 Another example is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kfc-pizza-hut-owner-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/">the cyberattack on Yum! Brands</a>, where attackers stole personal information belonging to some individuals, including names, driver's license numbers, and other ID card numbers. This kind of data is particularly sensitive and can be used to commit identity theft, among other crimes. 
 Finally, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kodi-discloses-data-breach-after-forum-database-for-sale-online/">the hacking of The Kodi Foundation</a> resulted in the exposure of personal information and private conversations of over 400,000 users. Such incidents can have long-term consequences for the affected individuals, including reputational damage and financial losses. These breaches emphasize the need for better cybersecurity measures and data protection practices across industries. 
 
 Factors contributing to data breaches: Why, Who, and for What? 
<p>Cyberattacks have become a prevalent threat to our digital lives, and they occur on both personal and larger scales. While most people may assume that only organizations with weak security measures are at risk, individuals are also susceptible to data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, personal cyberattacks often happen due to a lack of caution when it comes to protecting oneself online.</p>
 Why do data breaches occur? 
<p>One of the most common ways individuals make themselves vulnerable to cyberattacks is by using weak or predictable passwords. This makes it easy for hackers to access their accounts and steal sensitive information. Additionally, using the same password on multiple accounts makes it even easier for hackers to gain access to a person's entire online presence.</p>
<p>Lack of proper security measures is another way individuals put themselves at risk. Failing to have anti-malware protection on their devices can allow malware to infiltrate and infect their system. Similarly, exposing personal information publicly online, such as on social media, can provide hackers with the necessary information to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Clicking on or accessing suspicious links is another way individuals can become victims of cyberattacks. It is worth mentioning that bad players often use phishing emails to trick people into giving up sensitive information. These emails can appear legitimate, so it's important to be cautious and verify the source before clicking on any links or providing personal information.</p>
 Who is responsible for data breaches? 
<p>Anyone could carry out a cyberattack, if they have the necessary tools, and if that is their intention.</p>
<p>Data breaches are a serious concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. These breaches are often the result of bad players with malicious intent. Perpetrators can range from organized crime groups seeking financial gain to political activists looking to disrupt or expose sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some instances, national governments have conducted data breaches for espionage or other motives. Regardless of the motive, it's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect themselves from potential breaches and to respond quickly and effectively if one occurs.</p>
 What are the intentions of those who initiate cyberattacks? 
<p>Malicious individuals typically have two main intentions: financial gain or causing damage to institutions for various reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of these goals, they may carry out data breaches that can have serious consequences for their victims. These attacks can result in the exposure of personal information and sensitive data, which can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, larger feuds between hackers and their targets can result in victims becoming collateral damage and suffering the consequences of attacks that were not specifically directed at them.</p>
 Caught Off Guard: When and Where Data Breaches Strike 
<p>Data breaches can happen every second and anywhere, from major technology companies to large financial institutions, and even in our own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public places such as cafes or airports, which offer public Wi-Fi, can also provide opportunities for hackers to access personal data.</p>
<p>Recently, incidents involving Yum!Brands and TikTok have highlighted the vulnerability of powerful institutions to cyber attacks. However, individuals are also at risk in their personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any given moment, scam messages spread by viruses or hackers can target friends and family members. Weak personal security measures, such as predictable passwords and email addresses, can leave individuals vulnerable to attacks. As a result, the malware can spread to the victim’s circle of friends, family, or acquaintances via personal messages or emails.</p>
<p>One common method used by attackers is phishing emails. They appear to be legitimate messages from a trusted source but actually contain malicious links or attachments. Clicking on these links can result in the installation of malware on a device, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
 Victims of data breaches: Are you safe? 
 Who do bad players target? 
<p>The victims of data breaches can be anyone whose personal data was involved, regardless of age, gender, occupation, or level of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes children, women, men, students, teachers, and employees who trust their employers with their personal information. It also includes clients, customers, and patients who share their data with businesses and healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that anyone who uses the internet is at risk of being affected by a data breach, regardless of how small or popular they are. Constantly searching for vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them, bad actors can breach even the most seemingly secure systems.</p>
<p>That's why it's essential to take the right security measures, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and being cautious when sharing personal information online. By being proactive about data security, individuals and organizations can help protect themselves and minimize the potential impact of a breach.</p>
 How can Data Breaches affect you?&nbsp; 
<p>Individuals can be affected by data breaches in two different ways:</p>
 
 At a large scale, when a centralized system is hacked, which can affect millions of people.&nbsp; 
 On a personal level, when an individual's personal online accounts are hacked. In this case, the breach may only affect one person, but it can still have severe consequences, such as financial loss or identity theft.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In both cases, it's crucial to take steps to protect yourself and your personal information. SelfKey advises using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly monitoring your financial accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
 Large Scale: Attacking Businesses 
<p>Large-scale data breaches can have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the immediate victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While companies, institutions, and organizations are often the primary targets of such attacks, individuals can also suffer the consequences on a personal level. Even if the attack was not personally directed at them, they could still become collateral damage if the company they have trusted their PII with falls victim to a data breach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of this kind of data breach can be severe and long-lasting, for instance:</p>
 
 Companies can face financial losses, damage to their reputation, and even legal action. 
 Institutions may lose the trust of their stakeholders and customers, leading to a decline in business.&nbsp; 
 Organizations may find it difficult to attract and retain talent if they cannot demonstrate that they take data security seriously. 
 
<p>Furthermore, large-scale data breaches can lead to a loss of trust in the digital economy. If people cannot trust that their personal information is secure, they may be less likely to use online services and conduct transactions digitally. This could lead to a decline in e-commerce and other digital industries, negatively impacting the overall economy.</p>
<p>All in all, the consequences of large-scale data breaches are not limited to the immediate victims. Companies, institutions, organizations, and individuals can all suffer the effects of these attacks.</p>
<p>Below, we will examine some of these negative impacts more thoroughly.</p>
 Temporary Shut Down 
<p>Data breaches can have a significant impact on companies, not only in terms of the immediate costs but also in terms of long-term consequences. When a company experiences a data breach, it may be forced to halt its activity temporarily, which can result in millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<p>According to industry surveys, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">Gartner</a> concludes that the cost of operational downtime can be around $5,600 per minute, which translates to $300,000 per hour. This can add up quickly, especially if the breach is not resolved promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the financial costs, a data breach can also damage a company's reputation and erode the trust of its customers, leading to long-term consequences.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cyberattack-forced-a-logistics-company-to-temporarily-halt-operations-dde27a19">Expeditors International</a> is still dealing with the aftermath of a data breach that occurred in February 2022, which forced it to halt its activity temporarily. The company is likely to experience long-term consequences as a result, including a potential loss of business and damage to its reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial for companies to take proactive steps to prevent data breaches from occurring and to have a solid plan in place for responding to them if they do occur.</p>
 Financial Loss 
<p>Financial losses can arise from two main sources following a cyberattack:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ransomware 
 Legal actions 
 
<p>Ransomware attacks can result in significant financial losses for organizations, as hackers can demand large sums of money in exchange for unlocking access to their encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of ransomware attacks is a cause for concern, with experts predicting that the total cost of ransomware damages worldwide could reach <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/ransomware-payouts/">$265 billion by 2031</a>.</p>
<p>Legal actions can also result in substantial financial losses for organizations. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html">The Equifax data breach</a> in 2017 affected over 145 million people worldwide and has already cost the company more than $700 million in compensation to affected US customers. The breach also affected an estimated 15 million customers in the UK, who have launched their own separate legal action in the high court seeking £100 million in compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal actions can be costly and time-consuming, and the reputational damage caused by a data breach can have long-term consequences for an organization's financial performance.</p>
 Reputational Damage 
<p>Reputational damage is a major concern for companies that experience large-scale data breaches. Such damage can lead to revenue loss and have long-term impacts on the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a company's reputation is tarnished due to a history of data breaches, people are less likely to trust the company with their payment information, and they may choose to take their business elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loss of trust can be difficult to overcome. Therefore, companies must take steps to protect themselves and their customers from data breaches. Additionally, they must try to maintain their reputation and ensure their long-term success.</p>
 Loss of Private Data 
<p>Sensitive data and intellectual property are two key areas that hackers target in a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensitive data can include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Personal information belonging to customers, patients, and employees. 
 Private company emails that contain personal health history, home addresses, and payment information.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When this type of data is breached, it can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage for the company.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is another target of hackers, particularly designs, strategies, and blueprints. When intellectual property is stolen, the competition can take advantage of the leaked information. And this, in turn, may cause long-term damage to the company's competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Businesses within the manufacturing and construction industries are particularly vulnerable to these types of cyber threats. Therefore, many small businesses believe that they are unlikely to be targeted by hackers, but this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, 60% of all hacks target small businesses because they are often easier to attack. It is therefore crucial for businesses of all sizes to take proactive measures to protect their sensitive data and intellectual property from cyber threats.</p>
 Personal Level: Targeting the Individual 
<p>Data breaches at a personal level often occur due to a lack of caution when operating in the digital world and inadequate security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People may accidentally share sensitive information, such as their social security number or credit card details, on unsecured websites. Alternatively, they could fall victim to phishing scams that trick them into revealing their login credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, using weak passwords and not updating software and operating systems can leave personal devices vulnerable to hacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey’s decentralized solutions are centered around the individual’s privacy and security, with a strong emphasis on individuality. It is highly important for individuals to be vigilant when using digital platforms and take appropriate security measures to protect their personal data from cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
 Identify Theft 
<p>Identity theft is a serious crime that can have devastating consequences for its victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When criminals gain access to a victim's personally identifiable information (PII), such as their full name, Social Security number, and birthday, they can wreak havoc on their financial and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims can have their bank accounts emptied, credit histories ruined, and valuable possessions taken away. <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/archives/factsheets/ojpfs_idtheft.html#:~:text=Identity%20theft%20has%20profound%20consequences,crimes%20they%20did%20not%20commit.">In some cases</a>, victims have even been wrongly arrested for crimes they did not commit. This is because the criminal may use the victim's identity to commit cybercrimes or other illegal activities, leaving the victim facing legal action and potentially a criminal record.</p>
 Notable examples of identity theft 
 
 The case of <a href="https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/famous-identity-theft-cases/#nicole-mccabe-identity-theft-and-assassination">Nicole McCabe</a>, an Australian woman suspected of murder after her passport was compromised and her identity stolen.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www2.texasattorneygeneral.gov/identitytheft/real-stories-of-identity-theft">Several victims</a> of identity theft had to struggle with proving they were not responsible for the withdrawal of large amounts of cash from banks, or illegally attempting to obtain loans worth thousands.&nbsp; 
 The terrifying story of <a href="https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294978560">Andorrie Sachs</a>, whose medical identity was stolen by a pregnant woman who gave birth in Sachs' name and left the baby at the hospital, resulting in a $10,000 hospital bill.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Local authorities mistakenly reported Sachs as an unfit mother and threatened to take her children away. This could also have lifelong implications for Sachs as the perpetrator had a different blood type, and uncorrected medical records could result in Sachs' death if she ever needed a blood transfusion. A healthcare provider could even prohibit Sachs from reviewing her own medical records as they might not be in her name.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why SelfKey strongly encourages individuals to take proactive steps to protect their personal information, such as:</p>
 
 Using strong passwords. 
 Regularly checking their credit report. 
 Being cautious when sharing personal information online.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By being vigilant and taking appropriate security measures, individuals can reduce their risk of falling victim to identity theft and the devastating consequences that can follow.</p>
 Personal Health Information 
<p>The theft of personal health information (PHI) is <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">highly valuable on the Dark Web</a>, as it can be worth more than 200 times stolen credit card information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of identity theft can have serious consequences, including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 Obtaining illegal medical treatments or prescription drugs. 
 Altering the victim’s medical history. 
 Using up the victim’s medical benefits.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Hackers can also sell stolen PHI to other criminals, who can use it for a range of illegal activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given these horrifying facts, SelfKey strongly advises individuals to take steps to protect their medical identity, such as:</p>
 
 Regularly checking medical records for errors. 
 Checking for signs of fraudulent activity. 
 Ensuring that their healthcare providers have proper security measures in place to protect their PHI. 
 
 Financial loss 
<p>Once malicious individuals obtain your PII, they could potentially use it to <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">damage your credit</a> score and commit financial fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lowered credit score can make it challenging for the victim to:</p>
 
 Obtain a personal loan. 
 Secure a mortgage. 
 Even impact job prospects.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, individuals who commit identity fraud can open new bank accounts in your name, drain your existing accounts, and commit check fraud. They can also apply for credit using your information, and engage in a variety of other banking scams. All things considered, it’s important to be vigilant in safeguarding your PII. The long-term financial consequences of a data breach can be severe.</p>
 Impersonation on Social Media 
<p>Cybercriminals can use your digital identity to carry out various malicious activities that can cause significant harm. Here are only a few terrifying examples:</p>
 
 They can use your digital identity to phish for credentials from your friends and family, leading to further attacks.&nbsp; 
 They can ruin your reputation by posting obscene or profane content online, damaging your personal and professional relationships.&nbsp; 
 They may look for sensitive photos and videos in your account and use them to extort you, leading to emotional distress and financial loss.&nbsp; 
 
<p>As horrifying as this may sound, there are ways to prevent this kind of disaster from causing irreparable damage to your digital identity. For instance, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> methods may be the key to protect individuals against identity theft.</p>
 Emotional and Mental impact 
<p>A personal data breach can lead to significant mental and emotional distress. The harm caused can take a long time to recover from, depending on the extent of the damage done by the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with reputational damage, victims may also have to spend a considerable amount of time and money to mitigate the fallout. And, the steps towards recovering from such a cyberattack could be draining in themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims may have to spend endless hours or days:</p>
 
 Contacting their bank, lenders, and creditors. 
 Securing all their online accounts. 
 Replacing stolen identification documents. 
 Canceling and replacing bank accounts and credit cards. 
 Dealing with criminal charges made in their name.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Victims will also need to remove malware and viruses from their devices, while constantly proving their identity and showing that it was stolen. A process which can be emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting in itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst of all, if affected individuals fail to repair compromised information or remove malware from their devices, they will risk falling victim to the same attacks over and over again.</p>
<p>The long-lasting consequences of a data breach can be devastating, particularly if your PII or PHI end up on the Dark Web. The information could be in circulation there indefinitely, making you vulnerable to further harm.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 What is Online Identity? 
 A brief definition 
<p>The concept of online identity refers to a persona which people establish for themselves on the internet. Also called internet identity, online personality, or internet persona, it may be used in online communities and websites. It can also be a way of intentionally showing and representing oneself.</p>
<p>Although some people choose to use their real names online, some internet users prefer to be anonymous. They identify themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, an online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Identity vs Digital Identity 
<p>Even though online identity and digital identity are often found in the same context, there is a notable distinction between them. The difference between online identity and digital identity lies in their scope and focus.</p>
<p>Online identity specifically pertains to the persona and representation of a person in the online realm. It encompasses the social identity an individual establishes in online communities, websites, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>It includes elements such as:</p>
 
 Usernames and profiles. 
 Personal information. 
 Digital footprints. 
 
<p>All in all, it is the perception others have of the individual based on their online presence.</p>
<p>Digital identity, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses the information and attributes associated with any entity, not limited to individuals. It extends beyond just personal online presence and encompasses a wider range of entities and their attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes organizational identities, system identities, device identities, and more. It focuses on how entities are identified, authenticated, and represented in the digital domain.</p>
<p>In simple terms, online identity refers to how a person appears and acts online, while digital identity is a broader concept that includes representing any entity in the digital world, such as people, organizations, apps, and devices.</p>
 Digital Footprints 
<p>While navigating the internet, it's important to remember that our online actions can have lasting effects on specific websites. These effects are referred to as digital footprints.</p>
<p>Digital footprints are the marks or records of our online activities and interactions that remain after using digital devices and platforms. They can include different types of data, like personal information, online behaviors, communications, and contributions.</p>
<p>Some examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Social Media Posts 
 Web Browsing History 
 Online Purchases 
 Email Communication 
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
 
 Social Media Posts 
<p>Any content shared on social media platforms, including photos, videos, comments, and likes, contributes to a person's digital footprint. These posts can provide insights into their interests, opinions, and activities.</p>
 Web Browsing History 
<p>Every website visited and the search queries made leave a digital trace in the form of browsing history. It can include information about the types of websites visited, articles read, products searched for, and online services used.</p>
 Online Purchases 
<p>When making online purchases, individuals leave a digital footprint through transaction records. This can include payment information, shipping addresses, and product preferences. This data can be collected and analyzed to understand consumer behavior and tailor personalized advertisements.</p>
 Email Communication 
<p>Emails sent and received, including attachments, provide a digital trail of personal and professional conversations. The content of these emails can reveal information about relationships, affiliations, and communication patterns.</p>
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
<p>The creation and maintenance of online profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, dating websites, or gaming communities contribute to a person's digital footprint. These profiles often contain personal information, employment history, educational background, and connections. And they form a digital representation of an individual's identity.</p>
<p>It's important to note that digital footprints can have implications for privacy, security, and reputation management. The data accumulated over time can be used for various purposes, including targeted advertising, data analysis, and even potential misuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s vital that individuals take extra caution when browsing the internet, especially when sharing private information. Even websites that appear trustworthy may be at risk of data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
 How Online Identity Works 
<p>On a daily basis, individuals rely on their online identities to access various applications. Certain websites play a pivotal role in everyday work, communication, and education. However, there are also online domains that serve as sources of entertainment or offer delightful distractions.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples in which people make use of their online identities:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Social Media 
 Online Gaming 
 Professional Networks 
 Online Communities and Forums 
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
 
<p>Now, let's take a moment to briefly discuss them.</p>
 Social Media 
<p>On platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, online identity is built through the creation of profiles. This may also include sharing personal information, posting content, and engaging with others. For example, a person's online identity on Instagram might include their username, profile picture, bio, and the photos or videos they share.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Gaming 
<p>In the realm of online gaming, players often create unique usernames, avatars, and profiles that represent their gaming persona. Their online identity in this context is influenced by their gaming achievements, playstyle, interactions with other players, and reputation within the gaming community.&nbsp;</p>
 Professional Networks 
<p>Platforms like LinkedIn focus on professional networking and career development. Online identity on LinkedIn is shaped by an individual's professional experience. This can include work experience, education, skills, recommendations, and professional achievements. It allows professionals to establish their expertise, connect with colleagues, and showcase their qualifications.</p>
 Online Communities and Forums 
<p>Though online communities and forums centered around specific interests or hobbies, individuals have the opportunity to participate in discussions, ask questions, and share knowledge. Online identity within these communities is built based on the content contributed, expertise demonstrated, and the respect gained from other community members.&nbsp;</p>
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
<p>When engaging in online shopping, individuals create accounts and profiles on e-commerce platforms. Online identity in this context involves personal information, purchase history, reviews, and ratings given to products or sellers. It influences the trustworthiness and credibility of an individual as a buyer or seller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each of these contexts, online identity is constructed through the information individuals share, their online activities, and the interactions they have with others. It plays a role in shaping how others perceive them and how they navigate various online spaces.</p>
 The Benefits of Having an Online Identity 
<p>Because the wide majority of the world has already adopted modern technology, having an online identity has become a necessity. However, there are a multitude of benefits which come with having an online identity, namely:</p>
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
 Professional Opportunities 
 Networking and Collaboration 
 Personal Branding 
 Access to Resources and Information 
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
<p>Having an online identity allows individuals to extend their reach beyond physical boundaries. It provides a platform to share ideas, expertise, and creativity with a global audience. And this may potentially lead to increased influence and impact.</p>
 Professional Opportunities 
<p>An online identity can open doors to various professional opportunities. It allows individuals to showcase their skills, accomplishments, and qualifications to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It acts as a digital resume, making it easier for others to discover and connect with them.</p>
 Networking and Collaboration 
<p>An online identity facilitates networking and collaboration by connecting individuals with like-minded people, professionals in their field, or communities of interest. It provides a platform to engage in meaningful discussions, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects, fostering valuable connections and relationships.</p>
 Personal Branding 
<p>Online identity enables individuals to shape and manage their personal brand effectively. They can curate their online presence to reflect their values, expertise, and unique qualities.

 Web3 and SelfKey 
 Conclusions 
 
 An Introduction to Web3&nbsp; 
<p>Evolution is natural in many aspects of life. With modern technology, however, it’s especially beneficial when networking and artificial intelligence can considerably enhance the way society functions. Let us discover the concept of Web3, what it is, and how it can affect our daily lives.</p>
 What is Web3? 
<p>Web3, or Web 3.0, represents a new vision for the next phase of the World Wide Web. It aims to integrate principles like decentralization, blockchain advancements, and token-driven economies.</p>
<p>The range of emerging technologies and projects it encompasses include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 decentralized finance (DeFi) 
 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 
 decentralized applications (dApps) 
 
<p>At its core, Web3 envisions a future where individuals have greater sovereignty over their digital lives. Where trust and transparency are built into the very fabric of the internet.</p>
 Web2 to Web3: How different are they? 
<p>Web2 is the current version of the internet, encompassing all the technologies and projects people are accustomed to nowadays. While Web2 has proven to be an inclusive and dynamic form of the web, it has its limitations due to its centralized nature. In this context, Web3 aims to enhance user freedom, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>There are many differences between Web2 and Web3. For now, let us explore two of the most prominent aspects which set them apart:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
<p>Web2 platforms and services are predominantly centralized, meaning they rely on centralized servers and intermediaries to operate. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon control and manage user data and have the authority to set rules and policies. Because of this, users have limited control over their data and are dependent on these centralized entities.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, emphasizes decentralization. It operates on peer-to-peer networks and blockchain technology, where data is distributed across multiple nodes. Users have greater control over their data and can interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) without the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts and consensus mechanisms enable decentralized governance models where the community collectively makes decisions, instead of relying on a single authority.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>In Web2, user data is often collected, stored, and controlled by centralized platforms. Users typically agree to terms and conditions that grant these platforms the right to use and monetize their data. Privacy concerns arise due to the potential for data breaches, surveillance, and unauthorized access to personal information.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, prioritizes user ownership and control over data. With decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain technology provides transparency and auditability, which may reduce the risk of unauthorized manipulation or access. Users have the ability to grant and revoke access to their data on a case-by-case basis, enhancing privacy and data sovereignty.</p>
<p>All in all, these differences highlight the shift from a centralized and controlled web to a more decentralized, user-centric, and economically empowering Web3 ecosystem.</p>
 Web3 Benefits and Opportunities 
<p>Due to its decentralized nature, and not only, Web3 can offer a multitude of benefits and opportunities. Let’s examine a few:</p>
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 Economic Empowerment 
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
 Community Governance and Collaboration

<p>For instance, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to be a decentralized and trustless digital environment, due to its emphasis on limited data sharing.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>One thing that Web3 prioritizes is user ownership and control over personal data. This is also known as <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereignty</a>, and it aims to reduce the risk of data breaches by enabling individuals to be the sole owners of their data.</p>
<p>Through decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data. They can selectively grant access to their data and have more control over how it is used and shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shift towards user-centric data ownership may enhance privacy and empower individuals to protect their personal information.</p>
 Economic Empowerment 
<p>Another advantage of Web3 is that it introduces new economic models enabled by cryptocurrencies and tokens. This may allow individuals to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, where they can lend, borrow, and invest without relying on traditional financial intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization and the concept of ownership over digital assets may open new opportunities for creators, artists, and content providers to monetize their work directly. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, Web3 could potentially create more equitable economic systems.</p>
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
<p>Web3 aims to promote interoperability between different blockchain networks and protocols. This means that users may seamlessly interact with various decentralized applications (dApps) and move assets across different platforms without facing barriers or restrictions.&nbsp;It allows for a more connected and cohesive ecosystem where users may access a wide range of services and functionalities.</p>
<p>To aid this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a decentralized solution which may enhance digital security as individuals operate in these platforms.&nbsp;</p>
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
<p>Finally, Web3 enables decentralized governance models through mechanisms like smart contracts and decentralized <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">autonomous organizations (DAOs)</a>. This allows users to have a say in the decision-making processes of the platforms they engage with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can participate in voting, propose changes, and contribute to the development and evolution of the platforms they use. And this fosters a sense of community ownership and collaboration, empowering users to shape the direction of the platforms and protocols they rely on.</p>
<p>All in all, these benefits highlight Web3’s potential to transform the internet into a more user-centric, transparent, and inclusive ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that Web3 is still an emerging concept. Therefore, its actual realization and impact will depend on the development and adoption of relevant technologies and applications.</p>
 The Dark Side of Web3 
<p>While Web3 brings potential benefits, it also presents certain risks and challenges that need to be considered. It’s important to be aware of these challenges in order to take preventive measures and remain vigilant.</p>
<p>Here are five potential risks that may occur with Web3:</p>

 A Glimpse into SelfKey’s Protocol 
 Conclusions 
 
 What is Tokenization? 
 A brief definition&nbsp; 
<p>Tokenization, in the context of data security, involves the substitution of sensitive data with a non-sensitive equivalent, known as a token. The purpose of tokenization is to render the original data meaningless and devoid of exploitable value. Instead, a token is generated, which serves as a reference point linking back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system.</p>
<p>The tokenization process is designed with the aim to enhance data protection by reducing the risk associated with storing or transmitting sensitive information. By replacing sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personal identification details, with tokens, the likelihood of unauthorized access or misuse of the original data may be significantly minimized.</p>
<p>The tokenization system manages the mapping between the tokens and their corresponding sensitive data, ensuring that the original information can be retrieved when needed by authorized entities. This system may provide a secure and efficient way to handle sensitive data, reducing the exposure to potential breaches or theft.</p>
<p>Overall, tokenization plays a vital role in safeguarding sensitive information, preserving data privacy, and maintaining the integrity of systems that handle sensitive data elements.</p>
 Tokens Explained 
<p>Tokens may function as digital assets or representations of value that are built on top of existing blockchain networks. They can serve various purposes and operate within specific ecosystems.</p>
<p>Technically, tokens are programmable digital objects that are created and managed through smart contracts. These contracts dictate the rules and behaviors of the tokens, such as their supply, transferability, and functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals can create tokens on different blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana, using their respective token standards like ERC-20, BEP-20, or SPL. And, depending on their design, they can have different functionalities.</p>
<p>For instance, tokens can:</p>
 
 Be used as a medium of exchange and stores of value. 
 Represent ownership rights in a particular asset or project.&nbsp; 
 Have utility functions within decentralized applications (DApps), enabling access to specific features or services. 
 
<p>Overall, tokens operate within the framework of blockchain technology. They offer a flexible and programmable way to represent and exchange data or value within digital ecosystems.</p>
 Types of Tokens 
<p>In addition to the general definitions mentioned earlier, there are specific categories of cryptoassets that include the word "token" in their name. Here are a few examples:</p>
 
 DeFi tokens refer to crypto tokens issued by decentralized finance protocols, which aim to replicate traditional financial functions. These tokens serve multiple purposes within their respective protocols and can be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency. For instance, individuals may use them for lending, saving, insurance, and trading.&nbsp; 
 Governance tokens are specialized tokens which grant holders the ability to participate in decision-making processes for a protocol or application. As decentralized platforms lack central authorities or boards of directors, governance tokens provide voting rights.&nbsp; 
 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent ownership rights to unique digital or real-world assets. They have been utilized to combat unauthorized copying and sharing of digital creations. Additionally, NFTs have gained popularity in the art world for issuing limited editions of digital artwork or selling exclusive virtual assets like rare items in video games. 
 Finally, security tokens are cryptoassets which are designed to function as the cryptocurrency equivalent of traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Security tokens enable the sale of shares in companies or other ventures, including real estate, without the involvement of brokers. Major companies and startups are exploring security tokens as an alternative fundraising method. 
 
<p>By familiarizing oneself with these different categories of tokens, one can gain a better understanding of the diverse applications and functionalities within the crypto space.</p>
 The difference between Crypto and Tokenization 
<p>The difference between cryptocurrency and tokenization lies in their underlying concepts and functionalities.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that utilize cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies typically operate as independent entities with their own blockchain networks. They can function as a medium of exchange, a store of value, or a unit of account.</p>
<p>On the other hand, tokenization is the process of converting data, real-world assets, rights, or functionalities into digital tokens that exist and operate on a blockchain. Tokens can represent various forms of value, such as ownership rights, access to services, or participation in a project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that operate independently on their respective blockchain networks, while tokenization involves the creation and representation of data, assets or functionalities as digital tokens within a specific platform or ecosystem.</p>
 The Benefits of Tokenization 
<p>Tokenization offers several benefits for data security and efficiency. Here are a few key advantages of tokenization, which we will discuss more thoroughly below:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enhanced Data Security 
 Improved Data Processing Efficiency 
 Simplified Data Management and Migration 
 
 Enhanced Data Security 
<p>Tokenization helps protect sensitive information by replacing it with randomly generated tokens that have no intrinsic value or meaning. Unlike encryption, tokenization removes the need to store sensitive data, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches. Even if a hacker gains access to the tokenized data, it is almost impossible to&nbsp; reverse-engineer the original information.</p>
 Improved Data Processing Efficiency 
<p>Tokenization accelerates data processing and retrieval by replacing long and complex data strings with shorter tokens. These tokens are easier and faster to search, index, and analyze. And this leads to improved performance and efficiency in data-intensive applications such as databases, data warehousing, and big data analytics.</p>
 Simplified Data Management and Migration 
<p>Lastly, tokenization facilitates data management and migration processes, particularly when transitioning between different systems or databases. When migrating data, tokens can be used to maintain data integrity and relationships while ensuring sensitive information remains secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, tokenization simplifies data integration, as systems can exchange tokens instead of transferring actual data. This may reduce the complexity and overhead of data sharing.</p>
<p>All in all, tokenization may offer notable security advantages. However, it is crucial to prioritize the management and protection of the tokenization system itself. This will ensure comprehensive security throughout the process.</p>
 Tokenization: Challenges and Risks 
<p>While tokenization offers numerous benefits, there are also potential risks associated with its implementation, for instance:</p>
 
 Dependency on Tokenization System 
 Token Reversal Attacks 
 Token Mapping Vulnerabilities 
 Single Point of Failure 
 
 Dependency on Tokenization System 
<p>Organizations adopting tokenization may become reliant on the tokenization system and infrastructure. If the system experiences a breach, suffers from downtime, or becomes unavailable, it can disrupt operations and impact business continuity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial to implement robust security measures and backup systems to mitigate such risks.</p>
 Token Reversal Attacks 
<p>Although tokenized data is not directly reversible, attackers may attempt token reversal attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the tokenization system or its implementation. If successful, these attacks could potentially derive sensitive information from the tokens. And, in turn, it may&nbsp; undermine the security benefits of tokenization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vigilance in system design and implementation, as well as regular security audits, can help mitigate this risk.</p>
 Token Mapping Vulnerabilities 
<p>Tokenization relies on a mapping or lookup table that connects tokens to their original data. If malicious individuals compromise this mapping table, they may gain access to the original sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robust security measures are therefore essential to protect against this risk, such as:</p>
 
 strong access controls. 
 encryption of the mapping table 
 secure key management. 
 
 Single Point of Failure 
<p>Centralizing tokenization processes introduces a single point of failure. If the tokenization system or central repository is compromised, it can have widespread implications across the organization, potentially exposing sensitive data or disrupting operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing redundancy, disaster recovery mechanisms, and distributed tokenization systems can help mitigate this risk.</p>
<p>All in all, it's important to note that while these risks exist, there are methods which may mitigate them and maximize the benefits of tokenization. These methods include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 implementing proper security measures. 
 conducting regular assessments. 
 adhering to best practices. 
 
 A Glimpse into SelfKey’s Protocol 
<p>When developing decentralized solutions, SelfKey places great emphasis on digital identity privacy and security. The vision is to create a more secure decentralized network, in which members may be able to exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may be such a platform by treating its members with transparency, equality, and fairness. Within the SelfKey Protocol, there are currently two tokens which serve as pivotal elements: KEY and SELF.</p>
 KEY: A Brief Introduction 
<p>Utility tokens derive their value from their utility or functionality within the ecosystem they are associated with. One may use them within the platform to exchange for goods or services, participate in voting or governance processes, access premium features, or facilitate interactions.</p>
<p>The KEY token may find utility in various ways, including:</p>
 
 Serving as a method of exchange for services within the SelfKey Protocol. 
 Enabling users to lock their credentials more securely. 
 Empowering members to govern the SelfKey DAO. 
 Equipping users with essential tools which may allow them to take charge of their digital identity and increase privacy protection. 
 
 The Purpose of SELF 
<p>While KEY remains the vital utility token to lock credentials, SelfKey introduces the SELF tokens to facilitate tracking of an individual's locked credentials and their duration.</p>
<p>Having access to the SelfKey DAO may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. Individuals may use these tokens for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some notable attributes of SELF tokens:</p>
 
 Individuals who successfully lock a real identity may mint SELF tokens. 
 SELF tokens may serve as a metric for reputation measurement. 
 As a reputation signal, they may strengthen legitimate credentials and help identify illegitimate ones. 
 Users themselves may mint SELF tokens, and they hold no inherent value. 
 SELF tokens may also serve as a governance mechanism, granting influence to those who use the platform, accumulate reputation, or engage in "identity mining" to enhance platform security. 
 As users lock valid credentials, they accumulate reputation in the form of SELF tokens. 
 
<p>By introducing SELF tokens, SelfKey may enhance the ecosystem by providing individuals with a way to monitor their locked credentials and reputation. At the same time, it may promote the integrity and security of the platform.</p>
 Locking for Digital Safety 
<p>By locking KEY tokens on their credentials, users may mint SELF tokens. Locking credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of locking, therefore, is to enhance digital security. This may prevent data breaches, identity theft, and unlawful attempts by malicious bots to infiltrate your private online accounts and systems.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rapid progress of modern technology constantly astonishes us, bringing forth opportunities for knowledge, efficiency, communication, and speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization, a relatively new concept, has the potential to simplify private data management and enhance online security through encryption methods, offering benefits in terms of privacy, security, speed, and efficiency.</p>
<p>Understanding this evolving concept becomes crucial in order to stay informed about its advancements and leverage its advantages without compromising our digital identities and online security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these purposes, SelfKey aims to educate people about digital safety and introduce them to innovative concepts and technologies that can enhance online privacy and security. Knowledge is vital in order to prevent online attacks aimed at our digital identities, therefore staying up to date with relevant news on this topic and spreading awareness is important.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Sybil attacks present a distinct challenge in safeguarding the security and equilibrium of a system, among other types of cybersecurity threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advancement of modern technology has enabled malicious individuals to generate highly convincing fake, digital identities. Therefore, the difficulty in distinguishing between a malevolent bot and a genuine human being becomes especially challenging.</p>
<p>Even when targeting smaller online groups or individuals, counterfeit digital duplicates can inflict significant harm. On a larger scale, within a private system, the infiltration of these malicious replicas can lead to catastrophic consequences. Not only do they endanger individual security, but their calculated intentions have the potential to disrupt the overall security and equilibrium of the entire system.</p>
<p>To combat this issue, SelfKey is aiming to develop decentralized solutions that may prevent the unauthorized access of these malicious bots to private online accounts and systems. By harnessing the very technology used to create fraudulent identities, SelfKey's online security methods aim to counterattack Sybil attacks and establish a secure digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>This article provides an in-depth exploration of Sybil attacks and their detrimental impact on the security of digital spaces. Additionally, we’ll elaborate on how SelfKey strives to reinstate security and balance to private accounts and systems.</p>

 Sybil Attacks: The horrifying truth 
 In a nutshell 
<p>According to literature, Sybil attacks are a method of network-based attacks in which a perpetrator creates multiple fake identities or accounts to gain control or influence over a system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the term "Sybil" comes from the book "Sybil" by Flora Rheta Schreiber, which portrays a case of multiple personality disorder. In the context of digital security, this refers to a multitude of counterfeit identities which may be controlled by one, single, malicious individual.</p>
 What happens in a Sybil attack? 
<p>During this kind of cyber attack, bad players create numerous fake identities, also known as Sybil nodes or Sybil identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The perpetrators then use them to deceive a network or system into believing that each identity represents a unique and independent user. By controlling multiple identities, the attackers can manipulate the network's behavior, disrupt its operation, or undermine its security.</p>
 Who do they target? 
<p>Sybil attacks are commonly associated with decentralized systems, such as peer-to-peer networks or blockchain networks. Here, participants rely on the assumption that each identity is unique and represents a distinct user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By creating a large number of Sybil identities, an attacker can:</p>
 
 gain disproportionate influence. 
 compromise consensus mechanisms. 
 launch various malicious activities, such as spreading misinformation, performing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">Distributed Denial of Service</a> attacks, or controlling a majority of voting power. 
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks can be challenging since traditional identification methods may not be effective in decentralized systems that rely on pseudonymous identities. Mitigation strategies often involve:</p>
 
 implementing reputation systems. 
 proof-of-work mechanisms. 
 identity verification protocols to establish trust and distinguish between legitimate users and Sybil nodes. 
 
<p>Overall, Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems. Therefore, robust security measures and consensus algorithms are necessary to prevent or minimize their impact.</p>
 The dreadful consequences of Sybil Attacks 
<p>Sybil attacks can be highly dangerous to digital systems, especially in decentralized networks or systems that rely on trust and consensus. Some reasons why Sybil attacks are considered a significant threat include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
 Undermining Consensus&nbsp; 
<p>In decentralized networks, like blockchains, where consensus is essential for maintaining integrity and security, a Sybil attack can disrupt the process. By controlling multiple identities, malicious individuals may manipulate voting or decision-making processes. And this may potentially lead to false consensus or control over the network.</p>
 Disrupting Network Operations 
<p>Sybil attacks can disrupt the normal operation of a network or system. For instance, an attacker may flood the network with fake identities, overwhelming the resources and causing performance degradation or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
 Spreading Misinformation 
<p>Bad players can leverage Sybil identities to spread false information or manipulate the perception of consensus. By taking control of a significant number of identities, they can amplify their influence and create the illusion of broad support for malicious content.</p>
 Exploiting Trust and Reputation Systems 
<p>Many digital systems rely on trust and reputation systems to establish credibility and make informed decisions. During a Sybil attack, a perpetrator can create a large number of fake identities with positive reputations. This way, they may mislead others into trusting them and granting them privileges they shouldn't have.</p>
 Security Risks 
<p>Lastly, Sybil attacks can compromise user security. For instance, if a Sybil attacker gains control over multiple identities, they may have access to sensitive user information, financial data, or private communications. Horrifyingly, this may lead to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a>, fraud, or unauthorized access to personal accounts.</p>
<p>Because the consequences of Sybil attacks can be devastating to a decentralized system, it’s crucial for certain security measures to be implemented, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identity verification protocols. 
 Reputation Systems. 
 Proof-of-Work mechanisms. 
 Consensus algorithms that incentivize honest behavior. 
 
<p>By doing so, individuals may help minimize the risks and consequences of Sybil attacks, before they corrupt whole systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In spite of all these security methods, though, developing strong defenses against Sybil attacks remains a continuous challenge. Therefore, constant vigilance and research are necessary to ensure the security and integrity of digital systems.</p>
 Ways in which Sybil attacks may occur 
<p>Unlike other methods of cyberattacks, which target one type of individual in particular or have a single scope, Sybil attacks can occur in many ways, with many specific purposes. Let us examine a few of them.</p>
 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks 
<p>In this type of attack, malicious individuals can create multiple Sybil nodes and use them to flood a target system or network with requests. This process can overwhelm the system’s resources and cause it to become unresponsive. And, by controlling a large number of identities, the attackers can amplify the impact of the attack.</p>
 Influence Manipulation in Social Networks 
<p>In social networks, attackers can create multiple fake profiles and use them to manipulate discussions, spread propaganda, or artificially inflate the popularity of certain content. Because they can appear as different individuals, the attackers can exert undue influence and manipulate the perception of consensus.</p>
 Blockchain Network Attacks 
<p>In blockchain networks, malicious individuals may create numerous Sybil identities to gain control over the consensus process. By controlling a majority of identities or computing power (known as a Sybil attack on proof-of-work), the attackers may:</p>
 
 manipulate transaction verification. 
 double-spend coins. 
 launch other malicious activities that undermine the security and integrity of the blockchain. 
 
 Spamming and Reputation Manipulation 
<p>In online platforms that rely on reputation systems, such as e-commerce or review websites, an attacker can create multiple Sybil accounts to spam or manipulate ratings and reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the aid of numerous, fake identities, the attacker can artificially inflate or deflate the reputation of products, services, or individuals. And, this way, they can mislead other users and affect their decision-making.</p>
 Influence in Online Voting Systems 
<p>In online voting systems or opinion polls, attackers may create multiple Sybil identities to sway the results by casting multiple votes or skewing the perception of public opinion. In doing so, the perpetrators can distort the outcome and compromise the integrity of the voting process.</p>
<p>These examples shed a light on how Sybil attacks can be used to manipulate, disrupt, or deceive various digital systems. Preventing and minimizing these attacks often requires implementing strong security measures, such as:</p>
 
 identity verification protocols. 
 reputation systems. 
 consensus mechanisms that can differentiate between genuine users and Sybil nodes. 
 
 Sybil Attacks against Decentralized Systems 
 A brief introduction to Decentralized Systems 
<p>Decentralized systems are computing or network architectures in which authority, control, and decision-making are distributed among multiple nodes or participants. This comes in stark contrast to centralized systems, in which a single entity or central server has authority.</p>
<p>In decentralized systems, no single entity has complete control or ownership over the entire system, and participants collaborate to achieve shared goals.</p>
 Why do Sybil attacks target decentralized systems? 
<p>Sybil attacks specifically target decentralized systems because these systems rely on the assumption that each node or participant represents a unique and independent entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By creating multiple fake identities, or Sybil nodes, malicious players can exploit the inherent trust and consensus mechanisms of decentralized systems. And this, in turn, could lead to various malicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us discuss a few reasons why Sybil attacks are particularly effective against decentralized systems.</p>
 1. Exploiting Consensus Mechanisms 
<p>Decentralized systems often employ consensus mechanisms to achieve agreement among participants. Sybil attacks can undermine these mechanisms by creating a large number of fake identities that skew the consensus process. This way, attackers can manipulate voting, decision-making, or transaction verification, compromising the integrity and security of the system.</p>
 2. Gaining Disproportionate Influence 
<p>What’s commonly known about decentralized systems is that they strive to give equal power and influence to each participant. However, in a Sybil attack, a perpetrator can create numerous Sybil nodes, effectively giving them disproportionate influence over the system. This can enable the attacker to exert control, manipulate perceptions, or disrupt the normal operation of the network.</p>
 3. Exploiting Trust and Pseudonymity 
<p>Many decentralized systems rely on pseudonymous identities to protect user privacy. Unfortunately, this anonymity also creates opportunities for Sybil attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malicious individuals can create multiple fake identities that are almost indistinguishable from legitimate ones. And using these, they can deceive others into trusting them and granting them privileges or access they shouldn't have.</p>
 4. Undermining Network Resilience 
<p>Decentralized systems often emphasize resilience and fault tolerance. But, a Sybil attack can compromise these attributes by flooding the network with fake identities.</p>
<p>An attacker can overwhelm resources, disrupt communication, or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, undermining the stability and availability of the system.</p>
<p>Due to these factors, Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems. In turn, this highlights the importance of implementing strong security measures, to prevent and reduce the risks associated with Sybil attacks.</p>
 SelfKey’s Defense against Sybil Attacks and Malicious AI 
<p>The significance of digital security is amplified in decentralized systems, given the distinct challenges and vulnerabilities they entail. Some crucial aspects that require strong security measures in decentralized environments include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 preserving data integrity. 
 upholding consensus integrity. 
 mitigating network threats. 
 safeguarding digital assets. 
 fostering trust among participants. 
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks in decentralized systems can be challenging, but there are several measures that can help mitigate the risk. Let us discuss some strategies which may prevent Sybil attacks.</p>
 Identity Verification 
<p>The first step is implementing strong identity verification mechanisms to ensure that participants in the decentralized system are unique and authentic individuals. This can include verification through trusted third parties, KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, or reputation systems that assess the trustworthiness of participants based on their past behavior.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a possible solution to combat identity theft and digital duplicates. SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) to detect fake, AI-generated digital identities and identity thieves, which could considerably lower the risks associated with Sybil attacks.</p>
 Sybil Resistance Mechanisms 
<p>Another important step is to design the decentralized system with built-in Sybil resistance mechanisms. These mechanisms aim to make it difficult or costly for attackers to create and control a large number of fake identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of Sybil resistance mechanisms include proof-of-work or proof-of-stake protocols, where participants must provide computational resources or stake tokens to participate in the system.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a>, members may mint SELF tokens as a part of the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-id-poi-locking/">proof-of-individuality locking</a> protocol. Again, this is developed utilizing the power of AI to gain more accurate and quick results, as AI can read and analyze patterns which may be impossible for the naked human eye to detect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this process, SelfKey aims to prevent duplicate accounts, malicious bots, or identity thieves from accessing private accounts or systems. Locking, in this context, is done solely with the purpose of increasing digital security.</p>
 Reputation Systems 
<p>Implementing reputation systems that track and evaluate the behavior of participants in the decentralized system is another crucial step. Reputation systems can help identify suspicious or malicious activities, making it harder for attackers to blend in and gain influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants with positive reputations may be given more privileges, while those with negative reputations may be subject to additional scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this purpose, SelfKey has developed an <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">engagement system</a> which offers active members the opportunity to mint SELF tokens for their contribution to the DAO.</p>
 Consensus Algorithms 
<p>Consensus mechanisms like <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">Proof of Stake</a> (PoS) or <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practical-byzantine-fault-tolerancepbft/">Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance</a> (PBFT) can require participants to prove ownership of a significant stake. Additionally, they may require them to demonstrate a high level of computational resources. This may make it more challenging for attackers to create a large number of identities and control the network.</p>
 Randomized Node Selection 
<p>Another method which may be efficient in preventing Sybil attacks is to incorporate randomized node selection in the network's protocols and algorithms. By randomly selecting nodes for tasks, such as voting or validation, the likelihood of multiple fake identities controlled by the same attacker being chosen is reduced, making Sybil attacks less effective.</p>
 Network Monitoring and Analysis 
<p>Analyzing network traffic, node behavior, and communication patterns can help identify patterns that are indicative of Sybil attacks. Therefore, employing network monitoring tools and techniques to detect unusual or suspicious activities is crucial.</p>
 Community Engagement and Auditing 
<p>Lastly, encouraging active participation from the community in detecting and reporting potential Sybil attacks is vital. It’s also important to conduct regular audits and security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and address them promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engaging the community can create a collaborative effort to identify and mitigate the risk of Sybil attacks.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that preventing Sybil attacks entirely is challenging, and a combination of preventive measures is often necessary. The specific prevention techniques employed will depend on the nature of the decentralized system, its objectives, and the potential threat landscape.</p>
<p>What’s vital is for the community to work together and for members of a DAO to be consistently active. Not only to keep the DAO alive, but also to protect their common goals and the security and balance of the system they are a part of.</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO aims to become a digital environment which may offer both security and convenience. By utilizing the amazing potential of AI, and with the contribution of its participants, SelfKey strives to prevent cyber attacks that threaten the security and balance of our digital future.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and POI (proof of individuality), or proof of humanity locking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and POI locking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches, or 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers POI locking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and POI Locking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>POI (Proof of Individuality), or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, POI locking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a POI credential that can be locked with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By locking KEY on their POI credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's POI locking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By locking their POI credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have locked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, locking POI credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens&nbsp;as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POI locking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By locking their POI credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD POI Locking  
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's POI locking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information to ensure the security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD POI locking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By locking their POI credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

<p></p><p>I wanted to learn more about how Web5 (and SSI in general) works and the benefits it could offer. To do this I created a simple project to create and store DIDs, and use them to read and write to a DWN using a protocol.</p><p>I used the <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-sdk-js">DWN SDK</a> to create a standalone DWN, which I called a HomeNode. To create DIDs I looked at the different methods available and chose ION as I could use the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a> repo to do all the hard work. With ION Tools and the DWN SDK I then made a separate repo for interacting with the DWN, which I called a HomeNode Manager.</p><p>To test things out I created two ION-anchored DIDs (anchoring takes some time to complete) and set one of them as the tenant of the DWN. This meant only messages created by and sent to the tenant DID would be accepted by the DWN, even if the other DID was also a tenant. </p><p>To grant the second DID permission to send a message to the tenant DID, I installed a straightforward protocol to allow this. The protocol allowed a plain text message to be sent to the tenant DID by stipulating the protocol path and schema needed. If the protocol was deleted or reconfigured to stop further messages being written then the existing messages could still be accessed by the tenant. Note, there are other ways to achieve this result such as granting permission directly or perhaps using another DWN to receive messages and syncing them to other personal DWNs. </p><p>My reflections are that Web5 isn't at all how I thought it would be. It does not involve having to learn a whole new framework and you have an awful lot of freedom to build exactly what you need with your preferred tools. You could even create your own DWN SDK if you really wanted to as it's based on a DIF specification. For me, the main concern is storage and usage of keys for signing and encrypting messages. There are so many aspects to consider and seemingly lots of ways to really mess it up. </p><p>The people in the <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">TBD Discord</a> patiently put up with a lot of questions I had making this project, they really know their stuff. There is a channel called <a href="https://discord.com/channels/937858703112155166/1098207585661878402">share-what-you-do-✨</a> where you can post your own projects. I definitely recommend having a go as it really helps pin down exactly what this technology can do for you.</p><p>My project is available on <a href="https://github.com/nearlyjuly/HomeNode-Manager">GitHub</a> if you would like to try it out for yourself (and no doubt code a much better version).</p>

  US crypto regulations are multi-layered and involve multiple agencies, requiring strict adherence to specific laws and registration.  Crypto regulations vary significantly across the US states, leading to different compliance requirements for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), such as exchanges.  Compared to the UK, EU, Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, the US lacks a comprehensive and unified regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.  <p>It is summer, it is hot, and the crypto regulatory sentiments in the USA are increasing with the temperature.</p><p>At this present moment, the USA crypto climate is rather multi-layered. Multiple agencies and acts pose plausible scenarios and their outcomes.</p><p>The agencies are the likes of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Among the laws and regulations are the Bank Secrecy Act (including the amendments offered by the US patriot act and AMLA), the Commodity Exchange Act, the Securities Exchange Act, as well as new laws such as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act.</p><p>To survive in such a crypto climate and stay compliant with the industry-specific laws of the land, digital asset companies are expected to adhere to the Bank Secrecy Act requirements and register with the FinCEN, SEC, or&nbsp;CFTC.</p><p>The US crypto regulations may appear overwhelming, but to grasp them, one needs to look into their intricacies and nuanced wording and definitions due to their intricate construct.</p> Historical Context and Evolution <p>Since the inception of cryptocurrencies, the regulatory climate in the United States has gone through several ups and downs. Some of the major moves&nbsp;are:</p><p>2013 — <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf">FinCEN classified crypto exchanges and administrators</a> as money service businesses.</p><p>2014 — the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) <a href="https://www.irs.gov/irb/2014-16_IRB#NOT-2014-21">categorized cryptocurrencies</a> as property for tax purposes.</p><p>2015 — the Commodity Futures Trading Commission took a different stance, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/bitcoin-is-officially-a-commodity-according-to-u-s-regulator#xj4y7vzkg">designating Bitcoin as a commodity</a>.</p><p>2017 — the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131">declared that Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)</a> should fall under the purview of securities regulations.</p><p>As the US crypto regulations kept evolving, the objective behind these regulations remained more or less the same: protecting investors, preventing fraud, and ensuring compliance with AML/KYC regulations.</p><p>This regulatory intent underpins the responsibilities and actions of the various regulatory bodies.</p> Who Regulates What? <p>The complex nature of digital assets often raises the question of which regulatory body should oversee which&nbsp;asset.</p><p>Depending on whether an asset acts as a money transmitter, security, or commodity/derivative, it could fall respectively under the jurisdiction of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p><p>FinCEN works tirelessly to prevent digital assets from being utilized in money laundering or terrorist financing. The SEC oversees the issuance and resale of digital assets that bear a resemblance to securities — meanwhile, the CFTC steps in when digital assets qualify as commodities or derivatives.</p><p>Yet, a clear-cut categorization has proved elusive so far, leading to potential overlaps in jurisdiction. As such, a financial institution dealing with digital asset futures might find itself under the scrutiny of both FinCEN and&nbsp;CFTC.</p> The Battle for Cryptocurrency Jurisdiction <p>The murky lines dividing these regulatory territories gave rise to an inter-agency struggle in 2021. This battle emerged between the CFTC and the SEC, both vying to expand their regulatory control over the crypto industry.</p><p>At one point, CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz stoked the fires with a decisive statement on&nbsp;Twitter.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/CFTCquintenz/status/1422912721637580803?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>His words had more than just rhetorical weight, as <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7820-18">a Massachusetts District Court had ruled</a> in October 2018 that digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, were commodities. This ruling effectively declared that the CFTC held jurisdiction over crypto-related fraud.</p><p>It became heated. Was this a stone against SEC for overstepping its jurisdiction frame? The answer could be found most probably in the Federal Legislation.</p> Federal Legislation and Cryptocurrency <p>The Bank Secrecy Act is the most powerful piece of US federal legislation concerning cryptocurrencies. Amendments also play a role — the US Patriot Act and Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA), the Commodity Exchange Act, and the Security Exchange&nbsp;Act.</p><p>The Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, and AMLA amendments cover the anti-money laundering aspect, while the Commodity Exchange Act and Security Exchange Act — the registration of digital assets as securities and commodities.</p> The Bank Secrecy&nbsp;Act <p>Those creating digital currencies, or using them to buy goods and services, are not considered money transmitters. Hence, they are <a href="https://davitianlaw.com/cryptocurrency-defense/bank-secrecy-act/">not governed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</a>. The law also exempts individuals or businesses that utilize digital currencies, like Bitcoin, for various purposes, including mining activities and investment trading for their own accounts.</p><p>The BSA’s scope extends to certain operations within the digital currency ecosystem. Those who serve as intermediaries in cryptocurrency transactions — accepting cryptocurrencies from one party and transferring them to another in return for additional cryptocurrencies, monetary funds, or physical currency — fall under the act’s regulations.</p><p>In addition, platforms that facilitate the matching of cryptocurrency purchase and sale offers, essentially operating as trading platforms, are required to comply with the BSA. The law also applies to payment systems that act as money transmitters, orchestrating the transfer of digital money from one party to&nbsp;another.</p><p>Thus, while certain participants in the digital currency landscape are exempt from the BSA, others must ensure compliance, affirming the law’s influence within the world of virtual currencies.</p> Commodity Exchange Act and Securities Exchange&nbsp;Act <p>The Commodity Exchange Act and Securities Exchange Act apply to cryptocurrencies depending on whether they are seen as commodities or securities.</p><p>If a cryptocurrency is considered a security, the issuers and exchanges must obtain necessary licenses from the securities regulators. However, the regulatory agency CFTC has long argued that BTC and ETH are commodities and, therefore, must come under the Commodity Exchange&nbsp;Act.</p><p>The recent outcome from one of the most heated US crypto legal battles, SEC vs. Ripple Labs, significantly contributed to the ongoing cryptocurrency discourse of whether they fit into the US legal framework.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/stephenchip/status/1679535816253624320?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The ruling of the case showcased the nuanced climate of digital asset regulation. The court ruled that Ripple’s native token XRP sales on public exchanges did not violate the law. Yet, the company’s dealings with institutional investors, such as sophisticated hedge funds, fell afoul of securities laws.</p><p>This verdict showcases the urgent need for clear and precise crypto regulation.</p> Zooming in: State-by-State Look <p>Predictably, regulations across the US states vary and, in a way, reflect the crypto climate in each of&nbsp;them.</p><p>In California, the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation remains uncertain about the regulation of digital currency transmission. It is yet to decide whether it falls under California’s Money Transmission Act.</p><p>In contrast, the Department of Financial Services adopts a different approach in New York, offering a unique BitLicense for virtual currency businesses. This requires a license for nearly any commercial transfer, sale, purchase, or issuance of virtual currency.</p><p>The state of Washington defines virtual currency as money transmission. Nevertheless, the storage of virtual currency without the unilateral power to transmit is not considered money transmission.</p><p>The District of Columbia treats dealing in digital currency as a form of money transmission, requiring a license under D.C.&nbsp;law.</p><p>For the crypto exchanges, these multiple legislative frameworks mean being compliant with all of them, obtaining licenses in each State, and jumping through all other documentation loopholes.</p> Is SEC Omnipotent? <p>The SEC is asserting itself as the ultimate authority when it comes to cryptocurrency in the USA. To stand by its claims, SEC lately undertook multiple legal actions against major crypto exchanges (e.g., Gemini, Coinbase, Binance) and high-profile figures such as ex-NBA star Paul&nbsp;Pierce.</p><p>The Ripple Labs win cast a serious blow on the SEC’s unilateral decision power and its claim that 99% of cryptocurrencies are securities.</p><p>Nevertheless, the storm is far from over. Crypto juggernauts, such as Coinbase and Binance, are engaged in ongoing legal tussles with the SEC, and the outcomes of these court battles could critically shape the future trajectory of the crypto industry.</p> Measuring the Regulatory Temperatures from the US through Europe to&nbsp;Asia <p>The major difference between the US and the UK &amp; EU crypto climate is the level of conclusiveness achieved by the UK and EU in regulating the industry.</p> Europe <p>In the United Kingdom, the Financial Services and Markets Act received <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-regulations-in-the-united-kingdom-a-comprehensive-analysis">royal assent from King Charles</a> on June 29th, 2023. The law turns crypto trading in the UK into a regulated financial activity. The legislation proceeds with the vision of encouraging a transparent, thriving, sustainable, and technologically advanced financial services industry of which cryptocurrencies would be a&nbsp;part.</p><p>The same applies to the EU, where the European Parliament’s approval of the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">Markets in Crypto Assets regulations</a> will introduce structural governance practices to crypto assets. Apart from looking at crypto assets from an AML/CFT perspective, the MICA also wants to become a proactive deterrent to stop people from selling crypto assets in&nbsp;panic.</p> Asia <p>In Asia, Hong Kong has stood out with its forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency regulation.</p><p>On June 1, the city’s financial regulator rolled out <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-the-regulated-road-ahead">new rules for digital currencies</a>. With this, exchanges hoping to operate in Hong Kong now have to follow strict Anti-Money Laundering guidelines and laws that protect investors. This includes letting retail investors trade virtual assets, something that was previously limited to professional investors and traders with big bank balances.</p><p>Not far from Hong Kong, Japan is also making its mark in the crypto regulatory space. The Financial Services Agency there works hand-in-hand with two industry associations to oversee cryptocurrency regulations. Together, they have fine-tuned rules around things like derivatives trading.</p><p>Japan’s Payment Services Act even recognizes cryptocurrencies as a valid form of payment, and there are no rules stopping Japanese people from owning or investing in&nbsp;them.</p><p>Moving further southeast, Singapore has carved out its niche in the crypto regulatory domain. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has managed to navigate the tricky balance between overseeing the risks associated with crypto transactions and encouraging tech innovation.</p><p>With the launch of the Payment Services Act (PSA) in January 2020, MAS established singular legislation that governs both traditional and crypto exchanges. This Act not only brings clarity to licensing requirements but also tightens the compliance rules for crypto businesses to prevent money laundering.</p><p>Singapore further sets itself apart by referring to digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether as “digital payment tokens” under the PSA, effectively granting approved cryptocurrencies legal status and treating them similarly to other asset&nbsp;classes.</p><p>Compared to the UK, EU, and leading crypto-friendly countries in Asia like Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, the US still lacks a comprehensive and unified regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This stark contrast underscores the significant strides the US needs to make in order to match the regulatory clarity and support for digital assets seen in these jurisdictions.</p> Becoming and Staying Complaint <p>Crypto businesses already operating or planning to do so in the United States need to become and stay compliant with multiple agencies and regulations. Depending on the types of service they provide, they would have to register with the FinCEN, SEC, or CFTC. If the businesses qualify as money transmission, adhering to the BSA is also a&nbsp;must.</p><p>The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires financial institutions active within the country to help the government detect and prevent money laundering. It has to be done within the AML program framework. The businesses have to carry out risk assessment activities to ascertain their exposure to money laundering activities.</p><p>The AML program requires crypto businesses in the United States to have policies, procedures, and internal controls commensurate with the BSA and its regulations.</p><p>There should be independent testing for compliance, where individuals shall be responsible for implementing and overseeing the efficiency of the control measures. The appointment of such supervisory individuals must be complemented with ongoing training, keeping them updated on changing regulations.</p> Future Outlook <p>As heated as this summer is, the United States keeps working towards making its crypto regulations well-augmented, effective, and more extensive and&nbsp;precise.</p><p>The recent Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act to the Senate was a decisive step in this direction. If approved, the legislation promises to provide a clear framework for digital asset regulation. This includes delineating the jurisdictions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Moreover, the bill paves the way for depository institutions to issue payment stablecoins. To ensure stability, the proposed legislation mandates that institutions hold 100% of the value of all outstanding stablecoins in reserve. It also guarantees stablecoin holders the ability to redeem their assets one-to-one.</p><p>The bill would also create an outline for the tax treatment of digital assets. It advocates for an exemption from income tax for purchases using digital assets that result in a gain or loss of US$200 or&nbsp;less.</p><p>Overall, the bill is also expected to enhance the consumer protection standards.</p> Concluding Summer&nbsp;Thoughts <p>The US crypto climate remains rather fluctuating when it comes to regulations. Yet, the need for such is undoubted. Moreover, the interest shown by major financial entities, such as BlackRock, in entering the crypto industry underscores the urgency of establishing these regulations.</p><p>The crypto market is considerably large-sized in the United States. Revenue in the cryptocurrency market is about to reach US$18 Bn in 2023. Experts predict it to nearly double and become close to US$32 Bn in&nbsp;2027.</p><p>Regulating such a high-growth market poses different challenges. One of the core challenges remains how to strike a balance between the rate of innovation and the security of the&nbsp;law.</p><p>Whatever the next steps are, technology keeps thriving, demanding a thriving jurisdiction.</p><p>Happy summer!</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				 <p>What is decentralized identity in ten words or fewer?</p>
<p>“Decentralized identity creates verifiable data.”</p>
<p>“Decentralized identity puts you in control of your digital identity.”</p>
<p>“Decentralized identity creates trusted digital relationships.”</p>
<p>All true. And if you understand what decentralized identity is, you’ll likely agree that these are some of the shortest possible explanations of the technology and its value. You might offer variations of your own—you might emphasize the ability to preserve privacy—and you may concur with our belief that the identity in decentralized identity is more than just another digital ID card, it’s about the data that can be associated with any person, entity, or thing.</p>
<p>But would any of these statements provide a reader, who may or may not have heard of the term decentralized identity (but only heard), with a mental picture of what it does and how it works?</p>
<p>Doubtful.</p>
<p>All new technologies face this explanatory challenge. They must be talked about and understood to be widely adopted and used in a way that doesn’t involve talking about or understanding how they work. How many of the planet’s five billion-plus users of the internet know what TCP/IP is and how it works? They don’t need to. But scroll back to the 1970s and early 80s, and you could not have discussed the internet without talking about TCP/IP.</p>
<p>We are at an inflection point with decentralized identity. It is increasingly being deployed because it is a powerful engine of digital transformation. But what is the minimal viable explanation that provides maximal understanding? What concepts and terms need to be kept in so as to leave no critical gaps in someone’s mental picture of how it works? And what should be left out because it the reader will likely not be able to fit into that picture without breaking understanding?</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">“A Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Data”</a> is our latest attempt to solve this challenge. It’s relatively short but comprehensive. It avoids technicalities but explains what makes the technology innovative and powerful. We hope those who are coming to this technology for the first (or second) time, find this helpful. We hope those in the know find new and useful ways to explain how it works. Enjoy.</p>

 We sit down with financial crime investigator, Jinisha Bhatt, to discuss the link between money laundering and human trafficking, the role of technology, and the importance of collaborative relationships. 



 When people talk about the ramifications of financial crime like money laundering, they often mention the impact to the financial system, or to a business, but you also talk about the ‘very human cost of financial crime’. Could you expound? 



<p>When I first began to investigate financial crime, what struck me most about incidents of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/3-stages-of-money-laundering/">money laundering</a>, corruption, and human trafficking was how they serve to undermine legitimate businesses and governments, and in turn, society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You see the starkest impact of a corrupt, fincrime-ridden society on the most marginalized of groups. Indeed, there’s a direct correlation between the rate of fincrime and violent crime.</p>



 What is the link between money laundering, and, for example, human trafficking or exploitation? What non-financial impact would the eradication of financial crime have on society and humanity? 



<p>As financial inclusion is the means to a more peaceful, equitable and just society, the eradication of fincrime would enable an equal distribution of public and private wealth – away from the underbellies of the launderers and corrupt officials to the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In turn, this would mean better social services, safer cities, better education, and a higher rate of social and economic mobilisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest driver of a prosperous nation is not only wealth, but equal and fair wealth distribution.</p>



 It is estimated that less than 1% of criminal proceeds from human trafficking and exploitation flowing through the banking system ever gets detected, and of that only 0.8% of traffickers are prosecuted – while a mere 0.2% of victims are rescued annually. What are the reasons for these weak numbers, especially the 1% detection rate? 



<p>Trafficking is a transient crime. If institutions fail to detect trafficking activity while it’s happening in a specific location, it is too late to pass on any intelligence to regulators and law enforcement. To improve detection measures, financial institutions could be more focused on creating non-transactional detection rules, such as frequent changes to device metadata and device language, frequent credit card cancellations, and frequent use of certain keywords in transaction memos. To strengthen intel-gathering measures, financial institutions could also:</p>



  Geomap frequently-used ATMIDs and/or branch locations<br>  Run adverse media searches on client usernames/aliases<br>  Conduct regular Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations on suspicious users and their associations.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>From first-hand experience, I am convinced that the biggest reason we fail at prosecuting criminals and rescuing victims is a lack of collaboration between, and within, the public and private sectors. One of the major explanations for a lack of collaboration are some very stringent and outdated privacy regulations. For example, many large institutions with substantial data sets work with legacy systems. There are many sophisticated AI and DLT-based tools that enable safe data-sharing in an encrypted manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another reason we struggle to rescue victims is a lack of victim-centered services. Many survivors struggle to find safe and prolonged housing, especially when they struggle with addiction. The lack of readily available and survivor-centered services contributes to a high revictimization rate. It is said that an average survivor is revictimized between 5-13 times before they are emancipated. And in this process, victims are financially excluded by institutions, especially when their credit rating and identity has been compromised by their perpetrators.</p>



 Could you talk a little more about your work in locating traffickers, in particular through the use of technology? 



<p>As a financial crime investigator, I came to realize that the industry’s approach to anti-trafficking investigations is fragmented. Data suggests that many countries have identified less than 1% of human trafficking victims in their jurisdiction. The rate of prosecution in many jurisdictions is also about 1%. My goal is to leverage technology and data to bridge the intelligence gap, and take in as many survivors as possible, while supporting law enforcement investigations. My team of volunteers and I implement various data, geomapping, and OSINT tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in partnership with data and machine learning engineers, we scrape escort ads on active escort forums in individual cities, then process the data, and deploy machine learning tools to predict where the most egregious of trafficking activity might be occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We then partner with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti Money Laundering</a> and OSINT investigators to create intel files on trafficking entities with a high-risk score.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We then use geomapping tools to cluster and map the most illicit trafficking networks so that our field intelligence volunteers can approach victims and extract them in a safe manner. We also send our intelligence files to law enforcement organizations, financial regulators and non-profit partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Our success is contingent upon true interdisciplinary action and many technological solutions.</p>Jinisha Bhatt, financial crime investigator.</blockquote>



 Would you say this unique approach to financial crime investigations helps or hinders your work at times? What more can be done to educate institutions on the link between financial crime and human trafficking and terrorist financing? 



<p>I would say that this approach is a timely reminder that we need to look beyond a series of transactions and financial patterns when investigating financial crime. Often, the most profitable crimes are also the most egregious and vile, and financial institutions simply cannot combat them single-handedly. It’s not just a matter of getting ‘more education’; it’s about nuanced and scenario-based education from lived-experience experts. It is high time that institutions worked in tandem with survivors, governments, victim services, forensic services, law enforcement, and of course, each other.</p>



 You have recently shifted into the crypto sphere, is there a difference in the types of financial crime, or ease of financial crime execution, between crypto and tradfi? 



<p>My primary motivation to transition into crypto investigations was traceability and speed of transactions. Before I made the transition, I invested in a blockchain forensics designation and found myself beguiled by the infrastructure and the crypto compliance community at large. While many financial crime typologies are the same in defi and tradfi, as an investigator, I may have more transactional data at my disposal in the crypto space by virtue of distributed ledgers and block explorers. I also find myself conducting faster and proactive investigations while collaborating with other compliant crypto platforms.</p>



 What part does technology play in the detection of financial crime? As criminals continue to use increasingly advanced techniques, how can organizations stay one step ahead of the international networks to combat financial crime? 



<p>I believe our biggest challenge is the lack of effective and responsible info-sharing among organizations.</p>



<blockquote><p>While individual organizations may have the best tools and talent at their disposal, their vantage allows them a narrow view of the juggernauts of financial crime operations.</p>Jinisha Bhatt, financial crime investigator.</blockquote>



<p>If we aim to be proactive, we must work together and deploy the best technology that is interoperable and collaborative. Some of the best use cases of predictive AI I have seen have been deployed in the anti-financial crime sector. They were largely successful when multiple financial institutions forged collaborative partnerships to combat crimes like human trafficking.</p>

 Verus Protocol lead developer Mike Toutonghi explains the differences between Verus smart transactions and smart contracts. <p>The following was written by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer on the Verus Protocol, on <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discord</a>👇</p> Application Programming Model <p>The way to understand smart transactions vs. smart contracts is to think about the application programming model, and how each of them work in&nbsp;context.</p><p>There is no 1:1 correlation, but smart transactions are much easier to use in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, in a decentralized fashion.</p> Smart Contracts <p>Basically, the current model on Ethereum&nbsp;is:</p>  You run on a blockchain where the only currency where accounting is enforced by the blockchain protocol is ETH. To launch, or materialize a token, an account abstraction, or any other form of currency or identity-like structure (NFTs, liquidity pools, etc), you write an executable program/contract, according to accepted conventions, but with no actual checks that you follow any form of math accuracy, interface adherence, or accounting rules whatsoever.  The differentiation of these contracts, which are akin to stored procedures in a database, but carry with them the DB schema as well as the interface, is in the way they enable differences of implementation of those accepted conventions.  Consensus across all of Ethereum is applied to ensuring that the shared, serialized, worldwide computer that is the EVM executes its low level instructions accurately, with no accounting of currencies, exchanges, enablement of efficient, actual IDs, zk-privacy, etc. The currencies that run above the single native security currency, run by arbitrary rules, often opaque or containing unexpected behaviors, and everyone must create their version of these contracts to build a&nbsp;dApp.   Verus Smart Transactions <p>In Verus, it’s a new model as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Your dApp can run on a client or on a broad range of resource types, and it communicates via the same RPC API as the CLI commands (optionally without wallet or control functions) with a fully functional, decentralized backend, which is the Internet of Value, including all its unlimited scale, connected systems and&nbsp;chains.  Unlike a single currency blockchain, Verus smart transactions natively support an unlimited number of friendly name currencies directly via protocol and an unlimited number of blockchains for currency launches, simple sends, currency conversions, or cross-chain operations. All inputs, outputs, cross-chain imports, and even conversions are validated and in/out values of all currencies accounted for by consensus, just as native currency ins and outs are on single-currency blockchains.  Identities are a first class concept in the primitives available for dApps. They all support fully available, open, decentralized, user controlled authentication and authorization protocols, enabled by QR code or deep links and supportive of permission granting, ID provisioning/sale by the dApp, private/attested KYC and other services. These protocols can easily be bridged to OAuth or OpenID Connect via servers like Hydra, but used natively, they require no service provider between the service actually authenticating the user and the user themselves.  Every identity is multisig and has revocation and recovery capabilities. They are also transferable and can have rights bound into them in a provable manner via the contentmultimap. All of this is supported as primitives in the core RPC/CLI api/command line and in the core protocol.  IDs enable their holders to launch like-named currencies, blockchains, and single NFT-like tokens that have a super power over the ID, which is very useful for an ID that may live across multiple&nbsp;chains.  IDs and currencies may be created and launched on one chain, leveraging all of that chains capabilities (Verus includes many variations in currency, including conditional crowdfunding, liquidity pools, blockchains, etc.), and exported to other chains to be used everywhere across the network. For example, if you launch a currency on Verus or any PBaaS chain, including the native PBaaS chain’s currency. All of those currency definitions can be exported to Ethereum, and they will emerge on Ethereum as an automatically created and functional ERC20 contract, enabling the currency to be sent back and forth via protocol from then&nbsp;on.  All identities and currencies are resolvable worldwide, meaning that you can determine a network path to the nodes of the blockchain where they were defined via their friendly name, or usually via their i-address, if they have been exported cross-chain. This enables apps to scale over any number of decentralized blockchains worldwide and leave the management of user databases and user data, as well as settings, signals, endpoints, etc. to the users themselves and the client apps they use to help them&nbsp;manage.  Because the currency and liquidity pool support is in the L1 protocol, we have been able to actually solve for and provide MEV-resistant (both intra and inter-block) AMMs as a primitive, available to all applications and&nbsp;users.  <p>People don’t have to write basic liquidity and conversion protocols, which are just primitives, not apps. Real apps can use all of these primitives to deliver the next level of function. Payments, currency conversions, earning systems, polls, voting, multi-chain world scale social networks using provable streams in provable IDs, crowdfunding, independent economies. All primitives, such as IDs, currencies, blockchains, and liquidity baskets have very rich capabilities from launch to continued operation.</p> Extending Verus Smart Transactions <p>If someone wants to extend smart transactions, that is an option, but they either don’t have to, or if they really have a reason to do so, they can do it on their PBaaS chain, share or not share back (lots of reasons to do so), and now that we have the core primitive framework as a foundation, we can certainly collaborate on a kind of protocol extension that is likely to include forms of VM and/or ZKVM extension points in the current protocol, to work within the framework of the core primitives that are fundamental to Verus and that we believe are crucial for safe financial infrastructure, yet generally missing in other&nbsp;systems.</p> Try Yourself! ✅ <p>Look up <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a> to use many API commands (e.g. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">launching currencies, tokens &amp; liquidity pools</a>).</p><p>Or look up the <a href="https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md">complete command list&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Join the community.

<p>“Identity fabric” isn’t a solution in and of itself, but rather represents a comprehensive and holistic approach to managing digital identities and security. This approach prioritizes flexible, scalable, and adaptable <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/digital-identity-101/identity-management/identity-management/">identity management</a> schemes that allow administrators to manage various requirements across an entire digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>By adopting an identity fabric approach, organizations can create an <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/digital-identity-101/identity-management/what-is-iam/">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> framework that is flexible enough to adapt to emerging technologies, scalable to handle increasing volumes of identities, and robust enough to provide the security necessary for modern digital environments.</p>
<p>This is particularly crucial in the era of digital transformation, where cloud services, mobile devices, IoT devices, and new regulations are constantly changing the IAM landscape.</p>
<p>The concept of an identity fabric is designed to cover all aspects of Identity and Access Management, including:</p>
 
 Identity Lifecycle Management: Lifecycle management includes the creation, management, and removal of identities for individuals, systems, and services in an organization–a critical component of authentication- and access-based security. 
 Authentication: The backbone of perimeter security, authentication focuses on using the identities of users, devices, systems, and services to control system access. This could range from simple username-password authentication to more complex multi-factor authentication. 
 Authorization: The counterpart to authentication standards, authorization determines who can access system resources based on privileges, roles, and responsibilities. 
 Governance: Governance covers identity management’s policies, processes, and oversight to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements. 
 Federation: Federated identity management handles system identities across different infrastructures, platforms, or organizations. This includes Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities. 
 Privacy and Consent Management: Managing personal data in compliance with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and others, including gathering and managing user consent for data processing. 
 
<p>The ‘fabric’ analogy implies a level of abstraction that can unify disparate IAM tools and systems under one architecture.</p>
 What Are the Technologies Included in an Identity Fabric System? 
<p>An identity fabric solution represents a holistic approach to managing digital identities. Hence it typically employs a range of technologies and protocols, many associated with IAM and cybersecurity. Here are some of the key technologies commonly used in an identity fabric solution:</p>
 
 Identity Protocols: Protocols like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and WS-Federation are often used to standardize the communication of identity and authorization data between different systems and services. 
 Multi-Factor Authentication: Technologies that support MFA, including hardware tokens, SMS-based verification, biometric authentication, etc., are a crucial part of most identity fabric solutions to enhance security. 
 Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO technologies enable users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems and services without needing to authenticate separately for each one. 
 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): APIs are crucial for enabling interoperability between different systems and services, allowing them to exchange identity data and other information. 
 Directory Services: Technologies like LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and Active Directory provide repositories for storing user and group information, which can be used as part of an identity fabric solution. 
 Risk-based Authentication: Technologies that analyze various risk factors (e.g., user behavior, device information, location, etc.) to dynamically adjust authentication requirements. 
 Identity Governance and Administration (IGA): IGA technologies provide the ability to manage digital identities, access permissions, and security entitlements comprehensively. 
 Privileged Access Management (PAM): PAM technologies help manage and secure access to critical systems and data by privileged users (such as administrators). 
 Consent and Privacy Management: Technologies for managing user consent and personal data in compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. 
 Federation Technologies: Technologies that enable the sharing of identity information across different trust domains. 
 
<p>Remember, the specific mix of technologies used in an identity fabric solution can depend on various factors, including the organization’s particular requirements, existing IT infrastructure, compliance requirements, and more.</p>
 What Problems Does Identity Fabric Solve? 
<p>The concept of identity fabric is designed to solve several challenges modern organizations face with Identity and Access Management. These problems stem from increasingly complex IT environments characterized by the growing number of users (both inside and outside the organization), the proliferation of devices, the use of cloud and hybrid environments, and ever-evolving compliance and security requirements.</p>
<p>Some problems that identity fabric addresses include:</p>
 
 Complexity: Modern organizations often have to manage many different IAM tools and systems, each with their features, interfaces, and capabilities. An identity fabric can provide a unified, abstracted layer that simplifies the management of these diverse systems. 
 Scalability: As organizations grow and change, they need IAM systems that can scale to accommodate more users, more devices, more applications, and more data. An identity fabric is designed to be scalable, capable of growing and adapting with the organization. 
 Fragmented User Experiences: In the absence of a unified IAM strategy, users (employees, customers, partners) may have disjointed experiences when it comes to authentication, with varying requirements across different services. Identity fabric provides a seamless and consistent user experience across multiple applications and services. 
 Security: Security is a crucial concern for IAM, with a need to protect against threats like identity theft, unauthorized access, and data breaches. An identity fabric can enhance security by enabling multi-factor authentication, risk-based authentication, anomaly detection, and more across the entire digital ecosystem. 
 Compliance: Compliance with various data protection and privacy regulations is another significant challenge. An identity fabric can help manage compliance by providing features like consent management, access reviews, and auditing capabilities. 
 Interoperability: With diverse systems (on-premises applications, cloud services, mobile apps, IoT devices, etc.), ensuring they can communicate and interact effectively is a significant challenge. By its very design, identity fabric supports interoperability between these various systems. 
 Future-Proofing: The IT landscape is continually changing, with new technologies, standards, and threats always emerging. An identity fabric can help “future-proof” an organization’s IAM strategy by providing a flexible, adaptable framework that can evolve. 
 
<p>By addressing these challenges, an identity fabric can help organizations manage their identities more effectively, enhancing security, improving user experience, and driving operational efficiency.</p>
 What Is the Relationship Between Identity Fabric and Identity Orchestration? 
<p>The idea of an identity fabric refers to a comprehensive, flexible, and adaptable framework for managing digital identities across an organization’s entire IT environment, encompassing all aspects of IAM like authentication, authorization, identity lifecycle management, governance, privacy and consent management, and federation.</p>
<p>Identity fabric, being the combination of processes and technologies used to control identity management across platforms, will almost inevitably feed into the process of orchestrating identity management. In some ways, orchestration is the control of identity management–the existence of a control system that manages policies, procedures, and large-scale schemas that an organization must implement for their particular identity management needs.</p>
<p>Fabric, like the metaphor suggests, would be the “material” on which that orchestration effort is built from. The tools and technologies in that fabric (federated identity or SSO, authentication and authorization systems, decentralized identity management systems, compliant identity verification or liveness proofing, etc.) are how orchestration is managed.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the fabric will help define how orchestration efforts automate these processes. Automation is a critical aspect of identity orchestration, and as such the underlying technologies in the identity fabric (which may even include advanced systems like machine learning and AI) will help the effectiveness of broader orchestration systems.</p>
 How Does Identity Fabric Relate to Zero-Trust Architecture? 
<p>Identity fabric solutions and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/zero-trust-identity/">zero trust</a> are concepts that play a significant role in modern cybersecurity strategies. They are different but complementary, and their relationship is often essential in ensuring comprehensive security for organizations.</p>
<p>Zero trust architecture is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside their perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to their systems before granting access. This means that every user, device, and network flow is authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before being granted the minimum necessary access.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an identity fabric solution is a holistic and integrated approach to IAM that covers all aspects, including but not limited to authentication, authorization, identity lifecycle management, governance, and privacy. Identity fabric is the infrastructure that handles the diverse identity and access needs across an entire digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>The principles of zero trust heavily rely on robust identity verification and management – the user’s or device’s identity must be authenticated, and their access must be appropriately authorized based on least privilege access principles. This is where an identity fabric solution comes in. An identity fabric solution essentially forms the backbone of a zero trust architecture by providing a comprehensive framework for managing digital identities.</p>
<p>In a zero trust architecture, an identity fabric solution could provide essential functionality, such as:</p>
 
 Continuous Authentication: Authenticating users and devices whenever they attempt to access resources, regardless of their location or network. 
 Least Privilege Access: Assigning users and devices the minimum levels of access they need to perform their functions. 
 Micro-Segmentation: Segmenting the network to limit lateral movement. 
 Real-time Adaptive Policies: Dynamically adjusting access policies based on real-time risk assessment. 
 
<p>Thus, identity fabric and zero trust architecture are intimately connected. While the identity fabric provides the mechanisms for managing identities and access, zero trust utilizes these mechanisms to ensure that each access request is properly authenticated and authorized, thus enhancing an organization’s overall security posture.</p>

<p>With many countries all over the world launching strategic funding programs and the largest technology companies leading development efforts, the threat of quantum computers to cryptography is not a matter of “if”, but “when.”</p>
<p>With anticipated benefits for life sciences, climate research, forecasting and more, funding for the research and development of quantum computers is currently in the <a href="https://techmonitor.ai/hardware/quantum/quantum-investment-2022">billions</a>. While state of the art quantum computers aren’t yet of sufficient size to threaten cryptographic systems, we continue to see steady progress and advancement.</p>
<p>So what’s at risk? Basically, every instance of encryption using public key cryptography that’s in use today – which is, basically, everywhere in our digital world, serving as the foundation of trust in connected systems. The good news is that significant progress has been made to identify new quantum-resistant algorithms that will be safe from an attack by a quantum computer.</p>
<p>For PQC, all eyes are on NIST</p>
<p>When it comes to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and standards, all eyes are on NIST. Several years ago, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) kicked-off a post-quantum cryptography competition. In the summer of 2022, they <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">announced</a> the first set of winners, selecting one public key encryption algorithm (CRYSTALS-Kyber) and three digital signature algorithms (CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM, FALCON, and SPHINCS+).</p>
<p>Their next step will be to release the hotly anticipated draft standards, which we could see any day now. NIST is also running a fourth and final round of their competition to choose additional algorithms, after which they will produce their final recommendations and formal standards for post-quantum cryptography, expected by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>What to expect following the release of NIST’s draft standards</p>
<p>When NIST announced the first set of winning algorithms, we saw increased attention and calls to action around the post-quantum threat and migration to PQC, including <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/how-government-action-is-providing-a-blueprint-for-post-quantum-preparedness/">very clear direction</a> coming out of the NSA and White House in the United States. I think it’s safe to say the release of the draft standards will be an even greater catalyst to action. .</p>
<p>We know what we have to do to mitigate this threat: move today’s public key cryptographic systems from where they are today – <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">currently using RSA and ECC</a> &nbsp;algorithms – to new quantum safe algorithms. While that might seem simple on the surface, it’s a big job. We’ve done cryptographic transitions before, like the move from RSA to ECC, or SHA 1 to SHA 2. Governments and enterprises alike struggled with these past cryptographic transitions. This transition to PQC will be more significant and complex than anything we’ve done in the past.</p>
<p>As each month unfolds, the quantum computing timeline becomes more defined. Predictions from the U.S. government suggest the threat could become reality by the early 2030s, and they are actively calling for organizations to take immediate action to begin the journey to quantum-safe encryption.</p>
<p>We know this will be a big job – entailing complete cryptographic inventories of assets and technology, mapping this to sensitive data, and developing and executing a post-quantum cryptography migration strategy. This will be a full-scale project that will touch every piece of IT infrastructure and span several years.</p>
<p>So there is no reason to sit and wait for the draft standards. The time to<a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/post-quantum-cryptography"> start those preparations</a> is now.</p>

 Towards compound growth in Ocean ecosystem <p>[Originally published by @trentmc0 on Oct 11, 2021. We’ve re-published to @TeamOcean to better organize archival posts. Please treat the article as if it was published on its original&nbsp;date.]</p> Punchline <p>OceanDAO is a grants DAO where anyone can propose a project, and each OCEAN holder can vote “yes” or “no” for a&nbsp;project.</p><p>It’s great for the Ocean ecosystem if OCEAN holders thoughtfully vote “yes” and “no” on OceanDAO proposals, to curate towards projects with the best chance of growing the Ocean ecosystem (“thoughtful” voting).</p><p>Voting “no” across all projects with the hope that the burn will drive OCEAN price is simply irrational. It’s too small of a burn to make a dent for the near term, and it hurts the ability to grow value in the longer&nbsp;term.</p><p>If you care about the value of your OCEAN, then please vote, thoughtfully.</p> 1. Introduction <p>This article provides background to better understand the “punchline” presented above. Ocean is designed to mirror Amazon’s successful dynamics. The keys are decentralized funding, curation, and a focus on compound growth (vs dividends).</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Sections 2–4 describe Amazon. Sections 2 &amp; 3 describes the Amazon flywheel. Section 4 describes how Amazon focuses revenue on growth rather than shareholder dividends. From this, it’s been able to grow like crazy and create longstanding shareholder value.  Sections 5–8 draw a parallel to Ocean. Sections 5 &amp; 6 describes how Ocean’s token design is modeled after the Amazon flywheel. Section 7 describes how Ocean design focuses on growth to create longstanding value. Section 8 describes how OceanDAO voting plays a big&nbsp;role.   2. The Amazon&nbsp;Flywheel <p>Over 25 years, Amazon has grown from a struggling online bookstore to a globally pervasive company with a trillion dollar market&nbsp;cap.</p><p>Its flywheel was key to success: if Amazon selection grows, then customer experience can’t help but improve; then sales can’t help but grow; then the number of sellers can’t help but grow; then selection can’t help but grow. And the loop continues.</p>The Amazon loop. Source: Amazon.com 3. Amazon Flywheel Components <p>Two key components in this flywheel are (1) its decentralized workers and (2) its resource allocation algorithm.</p>  Amazon has (1) a sea of two-pizza teams, each running fairly independently, each with its own profit &amp; loss. It’s the “workers” block in the image&nbsp;below.  Each team is (2) funded by Amazon HQ according to a resource-allocation algorithm — the “curation” block in the image below. The more ROI a team delivers, the more funding they get. When getting going, they get a bit of time to start — typically months — to start delivering ROI. If they can’t deliver, the project gets shut down and team disbanded.  Amazon’s flywheel, including curation of $ (top left), role of workers (middle), and role of dividends (bottom&nbsp;right) 4. Amazon Growth vs Dividends <p>The revenue for these teams comes as a cut of&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Amazon takes a cut from the sales and aggressively plows it into growth. (“curate” box in the image). It explicitly does not put much into shareholder dividends (“lower-bound-shareholder rewards” in image). This is because money into growth gives benefits that compound over time, whereas dividends are a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p><p>For example, if Amazon spends R&amp;D money to reduce its logistics costs by 2%, then it can keep reaping those savings for years to come. In contrast, Amazon did a dividend or a stock buyback, it would be a one-time benefit to shareholders and then the money is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>The best way to grow shareholder value is to grow revenue. It would only be rational for Amazon to give dividends if it couldn’t efficiently allocate its capital to growth (ROI &gt; 1). When you see Amazon start to dole out lots of dividends, it means growth has&nbsp;slowed.</p><p>Interestingly, many companies religiously aim to give dividends every year. IBM is famous for it. Unsurprisingly, their growth is tepid, and has been for&nbsp;decades.</p> 5. The Ocean Sustainability Loop <p>Amazon shows how well flywheels can work, including with decentralized workers and an algorithm to allocate resources. This gives Amazon an interesting <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/tokenize-the-enterprise-23d51bafb536">path to decentralization</a>. More usefully to for us: we can use this flywheel as a model for decentralized business models. We call it the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>. We use it as the beating heart of Ocean’s token&nbsp;design.</p><p>If Ocean data selection grows, then data buyer experience can’t help but improve; then data sales can’t help but grow; then the number of data sellers can’t help but grow; then data selection can’t help but grow. And the loop continues.</p> 6. Ocean Sustainability Loop Components <p>Two key components in Ocean’s loop are (1) its decentralized workers and (2) its resource allocation algorithm.</p>  Ocean has (1) a sea of OceanDAO-funded teams, each running fairly independently, each with its own profit &amp; loss. It’s the “workers” block in the image&nbsp;below.  Each team is (2) funded by OceanDAO according to its resource-allocation algorithm: voting. This is the “curation” block in the image below. The more ROI a team delivers, the more funding they can expect over time. When getting going, they get a bit of time to start — to start delivering ROI. If they can’t deliver, the team should not expect to receive further&nbsp;grants.  Ocean Sustainability Loop is an instance of Web3 Sustainability Loop&nbsp;pattern<p>Ocean is an ecosystem. There are way more teams than just OPF core team working to build and grow the Ocean ecosystem. Here are examples of work funded by OceanDAO.</p>  Ocean documentation. These have matured greatly in the last half year, thanks to Akshay. Work includes: search, ocean.py API, Provider API, Aquarius API, and (currently) documentation for&nbsp;V4.  Deep Gaia-X engagement. OPF core team has been engaged with Gaia-X a long time. However this engagement has become broader and stronger thanks to work by grant recipients (deltaDAO).  Vote with datatoken pools. This was accomplished by a grant (Tim Daubenshuetz).  Moderation of TG, Discord, and other channels. This is done by the Ocean Ambassadors grants recipients.  Learn about Ocean. The Ocean Academy team created tons of awesome material to onboard people about Ocean. It’s become so good, that doing Ocean Academy is a pre-requisite for people to become Ocean Ambassadors.  Learn about OceanDAO grants. The Ocean Pearl team has created a gorgeous frontend (oceanpearl.io) to browse, search and filter OceanDAO grants recipients. The scope is increasing to support other OceanDAO flows such as&nbsp;voting.   7. Ocean Growth vs&nbsp;Burning <p>The revenue for OceanDAO teams comes from OPF treasury, 51% rewards, and (with traction) Network&nbsp;Revenue.</p><p>Ocean is designed to aggressively plow Network Revenue into growth. (“curate” box in the image). It explicitly puts just 5% — a low amount — into burning (bottom left image). This is because money into growth gives benefits that compound over time, whereas burning is a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p><p>For example, if OceanDAO grants R&amp;D money to a new app that adds 100,000 participants to Ocean ecosystem, those people will stick around for years to come, assuming they’re getting value from the app. Network Revenue would flow to the Ocean community accordingly.</p><p>In contrast, in a burn situation, it a one-time benefit to OCEAN holders and then the money is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>Burning actually happens in two places: (a) 5% of Network Rewards, as described, and (b) any OceanDAO funds not allocated in a given funding cycle, i.e. not enough projects with a sufficient “yes” vote to use up the funds available.</p><p>The best way to grow OCEAN value is to grow Network Revenue. It would only be rational for OceanDAO to burn its funds it couldn’t efficiently allocate its capital to growth (ROI &gt;&nbsp;1).</p><p>We’ve actually built TokenSPICE simulations that validate this (at least with the model assumptions). In scenario A, we ran at 95% of Network Revenue to OceanDAO, and 5% to burning. In scenario B, the opposite. The results: in 10 years, predicted market cap was about 10x higher for scenario A. Focus on growth creates the most value for OCEAN holders, because it compounds. Burning is a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p> 8. OceanDAO Voting &amp; Ocean&nbsp;Growth <p>Let’s drill in on voting in OceanDAO.</p><p>What’s rational: voting “yes” for projects that you think have a good chance to help grow Ocean (expect ROI &gt; 1 over&nbsp;time).</p><p>What’s rational: voting “no” for projects that you think don’t have a good chance (ROI &lt;1 and will never get&nbsp;better)</p><p>What’s less rational: voting “no” on all projects because you think burning will help drive the price of Ocean. This less rational because the amount burned is so low that it won’t dent the price of OCEAN. Even more importantly, it means the ecosystem isn’t getting funded — precisely where the growth needs to&nbsp;be!</p><p>Put another way, ask yourself: can I expect more returns to OCEAN from this project in the next 6–18 months, versus burning? If yes, then vote yes. If no, then no. Burning is the lower-bound measuring stick for assessing value&nbsp;add.</p> 9. Conclusion <p>This article reviewed the Amazon flywheel and how Ocean’s token dynamics mirror them. It highlighted that value creation comes from funding for growth, which gives compound rewards over time. Contrast this to burning which is only a one-time payoff (and is money taken from&nbsp;growth).</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-f26700c187a2">On Voting In OceanDAO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (LPs / stakers) for higher data consume volume (DCV) and&nbsp;stake.</p><p>DF Round 1 (DF1) is part of DF Alpha phase. DF1 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 16, 2022, and ended 11:59pm Wed Jun 22, 2022 (one week later). 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were computed and sent to the claims contracts. LPs can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>DF Round 2 (DF2) is also part of DF Alpha phase.

How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As an LP (staker), here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  For each network with rewards (where you staked): select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)  <p>In DF1, only Polygon and EWC had nonzero DCV, therefore rewards only went to those networks.</p><p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF1 Input Parameters <p>DF1 is the first week of DF overall 🥳. This also makes it the first week of the the DF Alpha phase. DF Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included DF1’s parameters. Then, “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-examples-c2d67a17b5f5">Ocean Data Farming Examples: DF1</a>” provided examples to better understand earnings, against the DF1 rewards formula and related settings.</p> 4. DF2 Input Parameters <p>The rewards formula and related settings for DF2 are the same as for&nbsp;DF1.</p><p>This may not always be the case: we can expect round-to-round evolution of the Reward Function and related settings, based on learnings.</p> 5. DF1 Output&nbsp;Stats <p>OceanONDA V4 <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid 1), Polygon (137), Binance Smart Chain (BSC: 56), Energy Web Chain (EWC: 246), and Moonriver (1285).</p><p>Only Polygon and EWC had nonzero DCV in DF1, so we focus on&nbsp;those.</p><p>Exchange rate was 0.180514 OCEAN/USD, taken from Binance&nbsp;API.</p>  Total Stake (averaged across 7 days). Polygon 656633.20 OCEAN, EWC 3926.94 OCEAN, total 660560.14 OCEAN (119240.35 USD). Stake grew through the week, from about 100K OCEAN to &gt;1M&nbsp;OCEAN.  Total DCV (total across 7 days). Polygon 750.51 OCEAN, EWC 2.30 OCEAN, total 752.81 OCEAN (135.89&nbsp;USD).  OCEAN rewarded to LPs. Polygon 9998.11, EWC 1.89, total 10000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Rewards Stats.

Max APY means active&nbsp;work <p>Data Farming is not a wholly passive activity. The name of the game is to drive data consume volume (DCV). High APYs happen only when there is sufficiently high DCV. High DCV means publishing and consuming truly useful datasets (or algorithms).</p><p>Thus, if you really want to max out your&nbsp;APY:</p>  create &amp; publish datasets — or work with people who&nbsp;can  consume them — or work with people who&nbsp;can  go stake on them, and finally claim the&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Driving DCV for publishing &amp; consuming is your challenge. It will take real work. And then the reward is APY. It’s incentives all the way&nbsp;down:)</p> 7. Conclusion <p>DF1 has completed! DF2 counting has begun.

How to improve your APY? Playing the&nbsp;game. <p>Among other things, Data Farming is a game. Understand it better to earn more. Let’s start with the following curious datapoint: a single LP earned 44% of this round’s DF rewards (4393.86/10000). What game were they playing? Then to flip it around: can you play it? Consider this an opportunity for&nbsp;you.</p><p>To understand DF better, you need to understand what governs your payout. This is the rewards formula. Roughly speaking, reward = DCV * stake. Therefore, increasing DCV increases your rewards, and increasing your stake increases rewards.</p><p>Then ask yourself: how do you increase DCV, or stake? For stake, it’s obvious: just stake more. What about DCV? Well, there’s real consume and fake consume (“wash consuming”). Real consume is when people buy datasets and use them for real. This is a core value proposition for Ocean Protocol: Ocean makes it easy to monetize data, without compromising privacy or control. And of course since Ocean is still relatively young, then there is tremendous upside potential for real DCV. Create real datasets and algorithms that people want to consume, and the rest will&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Some LPs have discovered that wash consuming is profitable right now. A few hundred OCEAN spent on “fake” consumes will increase DCV, and can lead to thousands in OCEAN&nbsp;reward.</p><p>When real DCV is still low-ish, then this strategy pays. Therefore in the near term, expect more wash consuming!</p><p>Over time, we can expect liquidity to migrate to pools with maximum real DCV. This is because every $ on real volume is a $ that the LP doesn’t have to spend to create fake volume. So, as real DCV rises and wash consuming grows, profitability of wash consume will shrink. Eventually, real DCV will get big enough that it won’t be profitable to wash&nbsp;consume.</p><p>The 3% fee rate on every consume establishes this&nbsp;limit:</p><blockquote>If Consume Fee &gt; weekly Rewards Cap, then problem solves&nbsp;itself</blockquote><blockquote>— Manan&nbsp;Patel</blockquote><p>Well put. The weekly rewards cap is currently 10,000 OCEAN. At a 3% rate, DCV needs to be &gt; 10000 / 3% = 333,333 OCEAN. Put another way, if there was a DCV of 333,333 OCEAN, it would mean that total fees gathered for consume are 333,333 OCEAN * 3% = 10,000 OCEAN. Wash-consumers have paid 10,000 OCEAN in fees, and get just 10,000 OCEAN reward. Any higher DCV and it’s unprofitable to wash-consume. However, real data consumers are happy to keep buying and using the data, because they get business benefit from it. In short: once weekly real DCV exceeds 333,333 OCEAN wash consuming won’t be profitable.</p><p>The DF core team considered several mechanisms to stop wash consuming. But each of these adds complexity. However, as discussed, evolution will shrink wash consume over time anyway! In the meantime, we see it as as an extra incentive for the Ocean community to learn about Ocean Market and Ocean DF more. Therefore, the core team has held back from intervening. Let’s let evolution happen:)</p> 7. Conclusion <p>DF2 has completed. To claim DF2 rewards, go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF3 counting has begun.

 Stakers can claim DF3 rewards. DF4 counting has begun. DF4 runs July 7–14&nbsp;2022 <p>[Originally published by @trentmc0 on Jul 7, 2022. We’ve re-published to @TeamOcean to better organize archival posts. Please treat the article as if it was published on its original&nbsp;date.]</p> 1. Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (LPs / stakers) for higher data consume volume (DCV) and&nbsp;stake.</p><p>DF Round 3 (DF3) is part of DF Alpha phase. DF3 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 30, 2022, and ended 11:59pm Wed Jul 6, 2022 (one week later). 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were available. LPs can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>DF Round 4 (DF4) is also part of DF Alpha phase. DF3 counting started 12:01am Thu Jul 7, 2022, and will end on 11:59pm Wed Jul 13, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards is available.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, then details on DF3 and&nbsp;DF4.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As an LP (staker), here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  For each network with rewards (where you staked): select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)  <p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF3 Input Parameters <p>DF3 is the third week of DF overall, and third week of DF Alpha. DF Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>DF3 parameters were the same as DF1. The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included these parameters. Then, “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-examples-c2d67a17b5f5">Ocean Data Farming Examples: DF1</a>” provided examples to better understand earnings, against the DF1 rewards formula and related settings.</p><p>We fixed a bug that affected results. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c#">In DF Launch</a> and since, we’ve specified “APY ≤ 125% for each LP at each pool”. That is, the maximum possible reward for an LP in a given pool is bounded by the amount staked in that pool (amount staked * WPY, where WPY = 1.5717%). Up until the fix, we’d only been bounding APY globally (stake of all LPs at once), rather than locally ( per-LP per-pool). We caught this bug, and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/commit/57f9662afce25412c3e186e0f48a2df68b1d396a">fixed&nbsp;it</a>.</p><p>Practically speaking, this meant that 5570.59 OCEAN was dispensed, rather than the 10000.0 OCEAN available. This is because in the pools that had consume volume, stakers didn’t stake enough to hit the max rewards. In fact, of the &gt;3M OCEAN staked in Ocean Market, &gt;1M was staked on pools which had no consumes at all. The rewards not dispensed remain in the OceanDAO treasury for future DF rewards or other community programs.</p> 4. DF4 Input Parameters <p>The rewards formula and related settings for DF4 are the same as for&nbsp;DF1-DF3.</p><p>This may not always be the case: we can expect round-to-round evolution of the Reward Function and related settings, based on learnings.</p> 5. DF3 Output&nbsp;Stats <p>OceanONDA V4 currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid 1), Polygon (137), Binance Smart Chain (BSC: 56), Energy Web Chain (EWC: 246), and Moonriver (1285).</p><p>Only Polygon and EWC had nonzero DCV in DF1, so we focus on&nbsp;those.</p><p>Exchange rate was 0.1718 OCEAN/USD, taken from Binance&nbsp;API.</p>  Total Stake (averaged across 7 days). Polygon 1,691,705 OCEAN, EWC 3849 OCEAN, total 1,695,554 OCEAN ($291,296 USD).  Total DCV (total across 7 days). Polygon 2253.3 OCEAN, EWC 2.30 OCEAN, total 2255.6 OCEAN ($387.51&nbsp;USD).  OCEAN rewarded to LPs. Polygon 5570.2 OCEAN, EWC 0.336 OCEAN, total 5570.59&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Rewards Stats. Rewards were dispensed to 110 LPs.

Changes to Ocean Market and DF&nbsp;Schedule <p>Over the past weekend, Ocean pools encountered a new attack vector, where a malicious actor found a way to drain OCEAN from pools.

It’s lower risk than Ocean datatoken pools to achieve similar functionality for staking and curation.</p><p>Pool functionality will be removed from Ocean Market. Data Farming is on pause, and will resume when veOCEAN launches, within 3 months. DF will pick up where it left off: in DF5, the first week of DF&nbsp;Beta.</p> 4. DF4 Output&nbsp;Stats <p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid 1), Polygon (137), Binance Smart Chain (BSC: 56), Energy Web Chain (EWC: 246), and Moonriver (1285).</p><p>Only Polygon had nonzero DCV in DF1, so we focus on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Due to the attacks over days, volume and stake were winding down. Polygon stake averaged 1,090,424 OCEAN across many pools. However just just two pools had consumes totaling 7776 OCEAN stake (total DCV of 0.216&nbsp;OCEAN).</p><p>With an upper bound APY of 125%, or weekly percent yield of 1.57%, then 122.21 OCEAN was dispensed as rewards.

        Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, built on decentralized protocols such as Public Blockchain, and it offers unique features that align with our goals and values. 
 Here are 6 reasons why UNISOT embraces Web3: 
  <a href="https://unisot.com/demo/">Book a demo</a>             Transparency 
<p>This technology enables transparent and immutable record-keeping. UNISOT leverages these properties to provide a trustworthy and auditable source of truth for supply chain and business data. Participants can verify and <a href="https://unisot.com/digital-product-passport/">trace the origin</a>, movement and authenticity of goods, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain.</p>
       Decentralization 
<p>This technology, based on public blockchain and decentralized protocols, offers a trustless and transparent infrastructure. UNISOT utilizes Web3 to provide customers with a decentralized ecosystem, where data and transactions are recorded on a distributed network, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of manipulation or fraud.</p>
       Cost Efficiency 
<p>Web3 enables more efficient and cost-effective operations for customers. By leveraging decentralized networks, UNISOT can reduce the overhead costs associated with intermediaries, streamline processes, and eliminate the need for trust-based relationships. This ultimately leads to cost savings for customers utilizing our Web3 solutions.</p>
       Security and Trust 
<p>It introduces robust security mechanisms that protect customer data and transactions. UNISOT leverages cryptographic encryption and consensus algorithms inherent in Web3 to ensure the integrity and immutability of the data. By using Web3, we can offer customers an enhanced level of security, mitigating the risks associated with centralized systems.</p>
       Interoperability 
<p>Web3 technologies aim to create a more interconnected and interoperable internet. UNISOT recognizes the importance of seamless data exchange and integration across different systems and platforms. By leveraging Web3 protocols and standards, such as decentralized identifiers (DIDs), smart contracts, and decentralized data protocols, UNISOT enables interoperability between various supply chain systems, enabling efficient data sharing and collaboration.</p>
       Tokenization and Incentives 
<p>It introduces the concept of tokenization, which represents digital assets or utility within a network. UNISOT utilizes tokens to incentivize supply chain participants, rewarding them for contributing valuable data, verifying transactions or performing specific actions that benefit the ecosystem. This incentivization model promotes collaboration, participation and the sharing of accurate data, ultimately improving the overall efficiency and integrity of the supply chain.</p>
      <p>UNISOT adopts Web3 technology to leverage the benefits of transparency, decentralization, security, interoperability, and incentivization. By embracing these principles, UNISOT aims to revolutionize supply chain management and create a trusted and efficient global network for businesses to interact and transact with each other.</p>

      <p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has <a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P170723-1.pdf">published</a> its regulatory framework for cryptoasset activities to promote the global harmonization of regulatory and supervisory approaches. It incorporates lessons from events over the past year that highlighted structural vulnerabilities of cryptoassets and related players as well as feedback received during the FSB’s public consultation.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>The framework consists of two groups of recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of cryptoasset activities and markets, and “global stablecoin” arrangements respectively. It draws on the implementation experiences of jurisdictions and builds on the principles of “same activity, same risk, same regulation”, and being high-level, flexible and technology neutral.</p> 
      <p>Specifically, in light of last year’s events, the FSB has strengthened both sets of recommendations in three areas, namely:</p>

         <p>cross-border cooperation.</p>   
        
      <p>The recommendations focus on addressing financial stability risks and do not cover all risks related to cryptoassets. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are also not subject to the recommendations.</p> 
       &nbsp;  
       Kuwait Bans the Use of Cryptoassets For Payment and Investment&nbsp;  
      <p>On July 18th, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) of Kuwait <a href="https://www.cma.gov.kw/en/web/cma/cma-board-releases/resolutions-and-regulations/-/cmaboardreleases/detail/1384960">issued</a> a circular prohibiting cryptoassets from being used for payments or investment. It also banned all cryptoasset mining and the recognition of cryptoassets as currency in the country, and warned the public that companies are forbidden from providing any services related to cryptoassets – the sole exclusion being securities “regulated by the Central Bank of Kuwait and other securities and financial instruments regulated by the Capital Markets Authority”.</p> 
      <p>According to the regulator, the prohibitions will help the country comply with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF’s) recommendations for cryptoassets – though the FATF has not asked jurisdictions to ban cryptoassets – and came after a study by the National Committee for Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism.</p> 
      <p>Aside from the prohibitions, the CMA also cautioned the public to be careful and aware of the risks associated with cryptoassets, including the fact that they are not “linked to any asset or issuer, and that the prices of these assets are always driven by speculation that exposes them to a sharp decline”.</p> 
       &nbsp;  
       United States Regulator Accepts Spot Bitcoin ETF Applications  
      <p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accepted BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which begins the official review process for BlackRock’s ETF proposal. While an initial step in a likely lengthy regulatory journey, it signals the SEC’s openness to explore a spot Bitcoin ETF and assess its potential market effects.</p> 
      <p>Based on July 19th records, the Federal Register <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/19/2023-15252/self-regulatory-organizations-the-nasdaq-stock-market-llc-notice-of-filing-of-a-proposed-rule-change">listed</a> the spot Bitcoin ETF applications of BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck and WisdomTree. The listings – which were expected after the firms filed their initial applications in June – give the SEC a window of up to 240 days to approve or reject proposed rule changes that would pave the way for a spot Bitcoin ETF to be listed.</p> 
       Britain Will not Regulate Crypto as Gambling&nbsp;  
      <p>The United Kingdom government has <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/40999/documents/199652/default/">rejected</a> a proposal made in a May report issued by the Parliament’s Treasury Select Committee that Bitcoin, Ether and other “unbacked” cryptoassets should be regulated as gambling given the significant risks they pose to consumers – who might think the crypto sector is safer than it is if it is treated as a financial service.</p> 
      <p>In its response on July 20th, the finance ministry “firmly disagrees” with the committee’s recommendation in the report and said that treating cryptoassets as a form of gambling would put the country at odds with global and European Union regulators. Furthermore, a system of gambling regulation would likely not mitigate risks from the sector such as those highlighted by the <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/crypto-regulatory-affairs-global-regulatory-response-to-ftx-collapse/">FTX collapse</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>The government added that it is already working on regulating the cryptoasset market, and proposed regulatory legislation was put before the Parliament and debated last month.&nbsp;</p> 
       &nbsp;  
       Strong Momentum Seen in the Growth of China’s Digital Yuan&nbsp;  
      <p>On July 19th, China’s central bank governor <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-digital-yuan-transactions-seeing-strong-momentum-says-cbank-gov-yi-2023-07-19/#:~:text=SINGAPORE%2C%20July%2019%20(Reuters),as%20of%20August%20last%20year.">revealed</a> at a lecture organized by the Monetary of Singapore (MAS) that China’s digital yuan (e-CNY) in circulation had reached 16.5 billion yuan as of end-June with transactions hitting 1.8 trillion yuan – a significant jump from over 100 billion as of last August. He added that the total e-CNY transactions had reached 950 million, with 120 million wallets being opened.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>Despite these numbers – which cement China’s leading role among countries developing their own CBDCs – adoption is still in the early stages and e-CNY in circulation accounted for only 0.16% of China’s cash in circulation.</p> 
      <p>The governor also said that the digital yuan has so far been used mainly for domestic retail payments. Nonetheless, he said that though the “balance is very small, but with this kind of balance [we] support a large number of transactions, which means that the velocity is high and more efficient”.&nbsp;</p>

The OOBI protocol acts as a service endpoint that associates a URI or URL with either an AID or a&nbsp;SAID.</p><p>The OOBI protocol allows KERI to leverage the existing IP and DNS infrastructure for discovery. Hence, KERI does not need its own dedicated discovery network.</p><blockquote>The OOBI protocol is “out-of-band” as it enables any internet and web search infrastructure to act as an “out-of-band” infrastructure to discover information that is verified using the “in-band” KERI protocol.</blockquote><p>Common usages of the OOBI protocol&nbsp;include:</p>  Discovery of a Key Event Log (KEL) of an&nbsp;AID,  Discovery of a Key Event Receipt Log (KERL) of an AID from one of its witnesses, and  Discovery of a Self-Addressing Data (SAD) of a&nbsp;SAID.   Basic OOBI <p>The basic form of an OOBI is a tuple that contains both a KERI AID (or a SAID) and a URL (or&nbsp;URI).</p> (url, aid) <p>The URL typically includes the word “oobi” in its path to indicate that that URL is to be used as an OOBI. For example, an OOBI may associate a URL http://93:184:216:34:8080/oobi or <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>with an AID EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM as&nbsp;follows:</p> ("http://93.184.216.34:8080/oobi", "EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM")  ("http://example.com/oobi", "EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM") <p>In this example, the OOBI’s URL may be used to discover the AID’s key event&nbsp;log.</p> OOBI as a&nbsp;URL <p>A URL and an AID can be combined into one namespaced URL where the AID’s prefix is in the path component of the URL. This makes the URL self-describing. For example, the above example may be represented as one URL, as&nbsp;follows:</p> # http://{ipaddress}:{port}/oobi/{controller_aid}<br>http://8.8.5.6:8080/oobi/EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM <p>A role of the AID may also be added at the end of the URL such as controller, witness, andwatcher.</p> http://8.8.5.6:8080/oobi/EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM/controller <p>Another example of a URL OOBI is to include both a controller’s AID and its witness’s AID, as&nbsp;follows:</p> # http://{ipaddress}:{port}/oobi/{controller_aid}/witness/{witness_aid}<br>http://8.8.5.6:8080/oobi/EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM/witness/BrHLayDN-mXKv62DAjFLX1_Y5yEUe0vA9YPe_ihiKYHE <p>where EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM is the AID of the controller whereas BrHLayDN-mXKv62DAjFLX1_Y5yEUe0vA9YPe_ihiKYHE is the AID of the controller’s witness.</p><blockquote>Note: In the KERI community, the word “OOBI” is often used as a countable noun. “An OOBI” often refers to a URL that points to a resource related to an AID or a SAID whereas “OOBIs” refer to a collection of such&nbsp;URLs.</blockquote> Security Implication <blockquote>“An OOBI by itself is considered insecure with respect to&nbsp;KERI.”</blockquote><p>IP infrastructure is not trusted by KERI, and a KERI OOBI by itself is considered insecure with respect to KERI. Hence, any information discovered by the OOBI must be verified by other means. For&nbsp;example,</p>  A KEL or a KERL discovered from an OOBI of an AID must be verified with the KERI protocol. That is to verify that all key events are consistent, all signatures from the controller are valid, and no duplicity is detected.  A SAD discovered from an OOBI of a SAID must be verified with the SAID protocol. That is to verify that the SAID is really defined from the obtained&nbsp;SAD.  <p>The policy for verifying and accepting the information discovered by the OOBI protocol is called BADA (Best-Available-Data-Acceptance), which is discussed in the following section.</p><blockquote>Note 1: Everything in KERI or that depends on KERI is end-verifiable, therefore it has no security dependency nor does it rely on security provided by web or internet infrastructure.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: KERI AIDs are derived in a completely decentralized manner, and the root-of-trust of a KERI AID is completely independent of internet and DNS addressing infrastructure. Thus an IP address or URL could be considered a type of Out-Of-Band Infrastructure (OOBI) for KERI. We call this a KERI OOBI (Out-Of-Band-Introduction) and is a special case of Out-Of-Band-Infrastructure (OOBI) with a shared&nbsp;acronym.</blockquote> IPEX (Issuance and Presentation Exchange Protocol) <p>The Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) Protocol is a secure mechanism for the issuance and presentation of Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs).</p><p>Unlike <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, where two different protocols are required for issuance and presentation, IPEX works for both. While W3C VCs are exchanged between three parties—namely an issuer, a holder, and a verifier—IPEX simplifies the exchange protocol by modeling it as disclosure of information by a Discloser to a Disclosee. This approach has two advantages:</p>  Enhanced security: A simpler protocol can be designed and analyzed to minimize and mitigate&nbsp;attacks.  Convenience: A simpler protocol is easier to implement, support, update, understand, and&nbsp;adopt.  <p>The IPEX protocol leverages properties of KERI and ACDCs, including ancillary protocols such as CESR, SAIDs, and CESR-Proofs. Through its support for Ricardian contracts and graduated disclosure, IPEX allows the disclosure of an ACDC to achieve contractually protected disclosure—including chain-link confidentiality.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e#17e4">Graduated disclosure</a> reveals the content of an ACDC compactly, partially, or selectively. More content of the ACDC may be gradually revealed in a series of interactions, i.e., in a graduated manner.</blockquote><blockquote>Contractually protected disclosure leverages graduated disclosure to contractually protect the discloser. The disclosure minimally reveals the content of the ACDC to the disclosee using, e.g., partial disclosure. The discloser may reveal more content only after the disclosee agrees to the contractual terms provided in the prior disclosure.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e#d327">Chain-link confidentiality</a> contractually links the terms and obligations agreed by the initial recipient of the ACDC to subsequent recipients. That is, subsequent recipients of the ACDC must, at the very least, agree to the same contractual terms.</blockquote><p>Given a discloser and a disclosee who wish to exchange an ACDC, IPEX has the following 5-step exchange protocol:</p>IPEX (Issuance and Presentation Exchange Protocol) Protocol (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-ipex">IPEX IETF&nbsp;Draft</a>) Step 1: Apply [Disclosee] <p>The disclosee sends an ‘Apply’ message to the discloser to request for a disclosure of an ACDC. The message’s content includes:</p>  a schema (or its SAID) of the requested ACDC,  an optional list of requested attribute fields for selective disclosure,  a signature on the ‘Apply’ message (or its&nbsp;SAID).  <blockquote>Note: If a graduated disclosure is not required in the exchange, the IPEX protocol may skip to Step 4 to fully disclose the&nbsp;ACDC.</blockquote> Step 2A: Spurn [Discloser] <p>If the discloser does not wish to disclose the requested ACDC, the discloser may reject the Apply message and terminate the exchange interaction.</p> Step 2B: Offer [Discloser] <p>If the discloser wishes to disclose the ACDC but does not yet wish to disclose the whole content of the ACDC, the discloser may send an ‘Offer’ message that includes:</p>  a schema (or its SAID) of the offered&nbsp;ACDC,  a metadata ACDC (or its SAID) that includes partial or selective disclosure of the content of the actual&nbsp;ACDC,  a signature on the ‘Offer’ message (or its&nbsp;SAID).  <p>The metadata ACDC is used to initiate a contractually-protected exchange without leaking correlation to the actual ACDC. The metadata ACDC may also contain contractual terms (as Ricardian contracts) in the "r" section, of which the disclosee must agree to further the graduated interaction.</p><blockquote>Note 1: A metadata ACDC is an ACDC with an empty top-level UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) field, "u": "". The purpose of a metadata ACDC is to provide a mechanism for a discloser to make cryptographic commitments to the metadata of a yet-to-be-disclosed ACDC without providing any correlation to that yet-to-be-disclosed ACDC.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2 Since all the variants of an ACDC are various degrees of expansion of the compact variant, a signature on any variant of the ACDC (compact, full, partial, etc.) makes a cryptographic commitment to all variants of that ACDC. Therefore, a signature on any variant may be used to verify the Issuer’s commitment to any other variant either directly or indirectly. In other words, any variant may be used in a graduated disclosure even if it is not the variant that the issuer signs. This property even applies to the metadata&nbsp;variant.</blockquote> Step 3A: Spurn [Disclosee] <p>If the disclosee is not satisfied by the revealed information or does not agree to the contractual terms provided in the metadata ACDC, the disclosee may reject the ‘Offer’ message. Consequently, the exchange interaction may be terminated, or the discloser and the disclosee may negotiate for a new ‘Offer’ message, i.e., going back to Step&nbsp;2.</p> Step 3B: Agree [Disclosee] <p>If the disclosee is satisfied by the revealed information and agrees to the contractual terms provided in the metadata ACDC, the disclosee may sign the Offer message (or its SAID). The disclosee then returns an ‘Agree’ message that contains the signed ‘Offer’ message to the discloser.</p><p>The discloser can retain the ‘Agree’ message as digital proof that the disclosee has non-repudiably signed and agreed to the contractual terms. In the event of a breach of the contractual terms, the discloser can use this digital proof to hold the disclosee legally accountable.</p> Step 4A: Spurn [Discloser] <p>The discloser may reject the ‘Agree’ message and refuse to disclose more content of the&nbsp;ACDC.</p> Step 4B: Grant [Discloser] <p>If the discloser decides to further the graduated interaction with the disclosee, the discloser may send a ‘Grant’ message to the disclosee that discloses more or the full content of the ACDC. The ‘Grant’ message includes:</p>  full disclosure of the ACDC or partial/selective disclosure that discloses more of its&nbsp;content,  a signature on the ‘Grant’ message (or its&nbsp;SAID).   Step 5: Admit [Disclosee] <p>The disclosee signs the ‘Grant’ message (or its SAID) and return it as an ‘Admit’ message to the discloser.</p><p>Again, the discloser can retain the ‘Admit’ message as non-repudiable digital proof that the disclosee has admitted the disclosure of the&nbsp;ACDC.</p><blockquote>Note: The exchange interaction may be repeated so that the discloser may progressively reveal more content of the ACDC as the disclosee agrees to more contractual terms.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-3-oobi-and-ipex-2e6b222f4b87">KERI jargon in a nutshell.

<p>Have you ever tried to sell something online? While building community through online marketplace connections is a wonderful goal, it can often get derailed by scammers. Typically, the goal of these scammers is to defraud you for either money or merchandise, but in some situations, the outcome can be much worse.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In May 2022, police in the Bronx, New York, <a href="https://longisland.news12.com/police-issue-warning-safety-tips-after-dangerous-facebook-marketplace-transactions">issued a warning</a> to local residents after a 21-year-old man was robbed at gunpoint by two people pretending to be interested in purchasing a car he had put up for sale on Facebook Marketplace. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While most of us know to be wary of strangers, the vast network of social media makes many of us feel more comfortable, which can lead to a dangerous reduction of inhibitions. It doesn’t take much for us to find ourselves in uncomfortable or even dangerous situations, either physically, financially, or emotionally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Most Common Online Marketplace Scams</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Fortunately, the more you know about the types of scams you’re likely to see in online marketplaces, the easier it will be to avoid them. While many situations involving online marketplaces have led to real-life violence, others seek to defraud you in more insidious ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Let us walk you through the types of scams you may see online and how you can protect your identity, physical safety, and wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Counterfeit goods 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s incredibly easy to post something for sale on an online marketplace. All you need to do is type the listing and put it online. Buyers should be very wary of listings that only use stock photos or are priced much lower than retail. In most cases, a deal that’s too good to be true is a scam. The buyer is counting on the seller to send either full payment or a deposit, at which point they’ll disappear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Fake rental property 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>One scam that’s been frustrating house hunters for decades now is the <a href="https://sellbuymdhomes.com/real-estate-blog/craigslist-rental-scams/">fake rental property scam</a>. Typically, a ‘landlord’ will post pictures of a house or apartment for rent, accompanied by a price that’s just a little bit lower than the average. From there, they’ll either ask for your personal details or require a deposit to secure a visit. Once they have your details or your money, the listing – along with the scammer – will vanish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Overpayment 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another common scam perpetrated on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and many other online marketplaces is <a href="https://www.doj.nh.gov/consumer/dont-cash-that-check/check-overpayment.htm">overpayment</a>. If you’re selling an item, you may be surprised when the buyer sends you more than the agreed-upon price. They’ll often say it was an accident and ask you to transfer the balance back to them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>However, this scam reveals itself when you discover that the payment was either fraudulent or canceled by the buyer. This means that you’ll lose the original balance paid to you, as well as the amount you sent to the scammer.</p>

<p>The Best Ways to Avoid Getting Scammed on Online Marketplaces</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While there will always be scammers online, there are many steps you can take to protect your physical and financial safety online. Here are some safety measures we recommend when operating in online marketplaces.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Use caution when meeting up with someone in person. It goes without saying to never, ever invite someone you met online to your home. It’s best to meet them in a neutral, public place like a coffee shop or shopping mall and bring a friend. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 If someone overpays for an item you’re selling, invite them to file a dispute with their bank. Never send them money back, even if they really put pressure on you. If it was a legitimate mistake, tell them you’ll cooperate once they file a formal refund request. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Don’t give in to high-pressure situations. If someone makes you feel pressured to buy or sell something, take a step back. This common tactic is used to create a sense of urgency that can easily cloud your judgment. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Ask for a demonstration of the product you’re purchasing. It’s easy to pretend that something works when you’re meeting the seller quickly in a parking lot. Take the time to plug it in and check it thoroughly to ensure it’s a legitimate product. &nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Verify that you’re meeting up with someone real using Dentity. Using an ID verification service like Dentity allows you to send a request and immediately get back information that can verify whether the person you’re dealing with has provided their real identity. This gives peace of mind that can help ensure you’re not getting scammed.

 Dentity Provides Additional Security in Online Marketplaces 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While Dentity can help offer peace of mind when you’re using an online marketplace, it cannot prevent you from getting into a potentially unsafe situation, even if you know who you’re meeting.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s essential to exercise caution when buying and selling online by employing tools like Dentity as well as common-sense measures like meeting in public and bringing a friend along. &nbsp;</p>

   What Is Federated Identity? Federated identity refers to linking a person’s electronic identity and attributes stored across multiple identity management systems. These systems use common protocols and communication standards to securely link identity to a user across several platforms and accounts without increasing threats to security.

 What Is Federated Identity? 
<p>Federated identity refers to linking a person’s electronic identity and attributes stored across multiple identity management systems. These systems use common protocols and communication standards to securely link identity to a user across several platforms and accounts without increasing threats to security.  The user’s identity is trusted across these networks–that is, “federated.”</p>
 How Does Federated Identity Work? 
<p>Federated identity works by creating agreements between different systems or domains (or federations), where each trusts the others to authenticate users and vouch for their identities. These “agreements” come in the form of token-based and secure communications between computers.</p>
<p><a>A basic SSO or federated identity authentication</a> process may look like the following:</p>
 
 Authentication Request: The service provider determines that the user is not authenticated and redirects the user to an identity provider. 
 User Authentication: The identity provider prompts the user for credentials–whether a username/password, biometric scan, or token. 
 Identity Assertion: The identity provider creates an authentication assertion, a package of information that includes the user’s identity and other relevant information, such as role or group membership. The assertion is encoded into a security token, such as a SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) token or a JWT (JSON Web Token) for OpenID Connect. 
 Response to Service Provider: The identity provider returns the security token to the service provider. This may be done by redirecting the user’s browser to the service provider, with the token included in the redirection information. 
 Service Provider Trusts the Assertion: The service provider, having a trust relationship established with the identity provider, accepts the token, validates it, and extracts the user’s information. 
 
<p>Once the provider authenticates the user, it notifies the application or platform that the user is authentic.</p>
 Federated Identity and Federal Government Work 
<p>Because of the streamlined authentication, security features, and added security when managing cloud and SaaS systems, <a>federated identity management</a> is a major part of digital technology in federal contexts. However, the security and compliance standards are different, with diverse program requirements.</p>
<p>For example, one of the primary goals of the Privacy-Enhanced Identity Federation (PEIF) Project is to develop and promote security in federated systems, especially those related to PII.  By implementing privacy-enhanced measures, the project aims to minimize the risks associated with data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access to personal information.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Federated Identity? 
<p>Federated identity systems offer several advantages for both users and organizations. These include:</p>
 
 Increased Security: With federated identity, user credentials are not stored or transmitted across multiple systems, which reduces the potential for hacking or intercepting passwords. Fewer databases and connections means a smaller attack surface. 
 Improved Privacy: Federated systems minimize the amount of data needed to authenticate, meaning that providers can better prevent loss of privacy in routine authentication or identity verification scenarios. 
 Enhanced Interoperability: Federated identity enables seamless integration and collaboration between different systems, applications, and organizations, making it easier to provide unified services to users. 
 Better User Experience: The user experience isn’t just about a pleasant interface. A better experience means that users won’t fall into the trap of using bad passwords, or reusing them across platforms. 
 
<p>Remember, while there are many benefits to federated identity, it’s also critical to managing these systems carefully, as issues in the identity provider or federation relationships can impact many systems and users.</p>
 What Are the Drawbacks of Federated Identity Systems? 
<p>While federated identity systems or <a>SSO solutions</a> offer numerous advantages, they also come with certain challenges or drawbacks, including:</p>
 
 Single Point of Failure: If the identity provider goes down, users may lose access to all connected services. This can result in significant disruption, particularly in a business context. This also applies to attacks–while these systems minimize attack surface, a single database breach can threaten an entire system. 
 Increased Complexity: Setting up and managing federated identity systems can be complex, especially when integrating systems that use different protocols. It requires participation from several providers using the same standard across all systems. 
 Dependence on Third-Party Providers: Federated identity management requires a provider, meaning that an organization would need to work with such a provider to maintain their security. This can become a drawback if that provider is untrustworthy or suffers significant failure. 
 Interoperability Issues: While federated identity is intended to increase interoperability, differences between various protocols and implementations can still cause issues in practice. For example, not all systems might support the same version of SAML or other protocols. 
 
<p>Despite these challenges, many organizations find that the benefits of federated identity outweigh the drawbacks. However, it’s essential to understand and address these issues to ensure a successful federated identity implementation.</p>
 What Technologies Make Up Federated Identity Systems? 
<p>A federated or <a>SSO</a> system isn’t a single solution, but a collection of technologies supporting authentication. Therefore, some (or most) of these technologies will communicate through specific protocols.</p>
<p>Some of these protocols and technologies include:</p>
 
 Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML): This XML-based standard facilitates exchanging authentication data between providers and other platforms.  
 OAuth 2.0: OAuth, as a protocol used to communicate authorization for different systems, is often used with other technologies to create federated identity solutions that include both authentication and authorization requirements.  
 OpenID Connect (OIDC): Used in conjunction with OAuth 2.0, this approach adds identity claims to augment the specific authorizations granted by an authorization server to authenticated users. This identity information allows organizations to verify user identity across different internal platforms and services. 
 JSON Web Token (JWT): This tech uses compact and URL-safe JSON-based tokens to convey the identity and authorization grabs of authenticated users between an identity provider and a service provider.

   Identity threat detection and response (IDTR) equips enterprises to protect digital identities along with the identity systems that manage them. 

<p>Digital identity data is a cybercriminal's favorite target. The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">2023 ForgeRock Identity Breach Report</a> revealed a 233% increase in U.S. data breaches exposing user credentials compared to the year before. The reason is simple: if stolen, user credentials enable criminals to break into entire networks. From there, they can find high-value data to steal, hold for ransom, expose, or sell.</p>
	
<p>This is why it's critical to secure your user identities and passwords and the IAM services that manage them. And it's why identity threat detection and response (ITDR) should be part of every enterprise's security strategy.</p>

<p>Last year, after a series of high-profile incidents in which IAM vendors and their infrastructure were targeted by attackers, Gartner proposed the need for an identity threat detection and response (IDTR) strategy. ITDR isn't a single solution you can buy from a vendor. It's a process for preventing, detecting, and responding to identity-based threats.</p>

<p>The firm recommends ITDR because it can detect when IAM systems are compromised, enable rapid investigations, and offer remediation suggestions to restore affected systems. ITDR can expose security misconfigurations in the IAM infrastructure and analyze identity activity in real time to detect cyberattacks.</p>

<p>Visibility is critical, and ITDR can illuminate how an attacker might compromise credentials, privileges, and entitlements to move between systems and into cloud infrastructure. By providing visibility into attack paths, it helps to mitigate these risks.</p>
	
	<blockquote><p>"Organizations' reliance on their identity infrastructure to enable collaboration, remote work and customer access to services has transformed identity systems into prime targets for threat actors."</p>

 Prevention, detection, and response: the IAM and ITDR trifecta 

<p>ITDR is a multi-faceted approach to protecting identity data and the IAM infrastructure around it. It comprises technologies and best practices to protect against unauthorized access, account takeover, credential misuse, privilege escalation, and other malicious activities that target user accounts and credentials. There are three essential elements of an ITDR strategy, starting with prevention.</p>
	
   Prevention  
 <p>Prevention starts with some basic security hygiene of your IAM infrastructure, like ensuring that your users always use <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) for any systems that need passwords, go passwordless for all modern applications that can support it, and leverage continuous authorization to ensure IAM infrastructure security. You can layer in strong configuration controls to ensure no one can simply change security configuration, and add AI/ML-based behavior analytics solutions to understand user behavior better and prevent any suspicious activity.</p>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA): MFA requires users to provide more than one form of identification to access a system or application. For example, after entering a username and password or SSO credentials, a user may be required to accept a push notification from an authenticator app or enter a PIN sent to a personal device. Depending on the organization, MFA may include<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication"> passwordless authentication</a> as a factor, in which the user provides a fingerprint or facial scan.</p>
	
<p>Passwordless: Passwords are typically the weakest link in any organization's security apparatus. Removing passwords will mitigate many password-based cyberattacks, such as phishing, brute-force, and credential stuffing. However, many organizations may not be able to deliver complete passwordless authentication due to the complexity of IT systems. In these situations, delivering a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/passwordless-demystified">passwordless experience</a> while hiding the passwords is possible – passwords still exist for the legacy systems that need them, but users never see or interact with them.</p>
	
<p>Authorization: Continuous authorization involves capturing users roles, identity attributes, and contextual information, and evaluating the user's overall risk posture during every transaction, not just once during authentication. This capability combines <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-rbac-vs-abac">role-based access control</a> (RBAC) with attribute-based access control (ABAC), which assigns levels of access to users based on their authority level, responsibility, job title, status (employee vs. contractor), or department, as well as task-specific needs, such as viewing vs. editing rights. ABAC, along with risk-based access control, offers nuanced controls, such as allowing an accountant to access data while on a secure network and managed device, but not while outside the office or using a personal device.</p>
	
<p>Enterprise-wide visibility with AI/ML: IAM systems should continuously monitor login requests in real time, blocking malicious attempts and adding authentication steps when anomalous behavior is detected. Using device identification, user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), biometrics, and location intelligence, IAM tools can detect anomalies at the point of login.</p>
	
<p>Configuration security: Misconfiguration is common, and, while malicious changes in configuration to reduce security may be less frequent, either can be a huge threat to your IAM infrastructure. Your IAM platform should have tight controls to prevent changes to policies around MFA, passwords, authorization, and others. The IAM platform should also detect and alert you when any change in configuration reduces your overall security posture so that you can detect and respond to these changes appropriately.</p>
	
   Detection  
 <p>Integrated with a modern IAM system, ITDR provides centralized visibility and control over all assigned identities and privileges, continuously monitoring user activity, detecting unusual behavior, and alerting security teams. Some of its detection techniques include:</p>
	
  Configuration monitoring: Ensuring IAM systems are properly configured by continuously monitoring the system for suspicious changes. These changes may include the creation of unusual accounts or registering new authentication devices. 
   Identity monitoring: ITDR monitors login events, system logs, network traffic, user behavior analytics, and other sources of information. It continuously tracks user activities, access attempts, and changes in identity-related data. 
   Anomaly detection: ITDR relies on advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to establish patterns of user behavior and to identify deviations from those patterns. Unusual activities, such as multiple login attempts from different geographic locations, indicate potential threats. 
   Risk scoring: Based on the detected anomalies, ITDR assigns risk scores or profiles to individuals or events. These scores help prioritize and allocate resources for further investigation and response. Higher risk scores indicate a greater likelihood of identity-related threats. 
   Real-time alerts: When suspicious activities or anomalies are detected, the system generates real-time alerts to notify security teams or administrators. These alerts provide relevant details about the detected threat, enabling quick response and mitigation measures. 
    Response  
 <p>During response, ITDR requires interoperability with the IAM system to identify and contain the threat. If the IAM infrastructure or its data have been compromised, Gartner recommends taking a variety of actions, including (but not limited to) those that follow.</p>
	
  Contain and eradicate: Isolate the threat and disable syncing between directories, on-prem targets, and cloud user repositories. 
   Investigate: Gather additional information and assess the severity of the threat. This may involve analyzing log files, interviewing users, or using forensic to gather evidence. 
   Mitigate: Reset compromised credentials, block suspicious accounts or IP addresses, and implement additional security controls. Mitigation may also include freezing automated provisioning, quarantining certain users at risk, and stopping all account changes in IGA, IAM, and PAM. 
   Recover: Restore data from backups and collect logs from access management and governance. 
   Report: Notify executives, legal staff, and response teams early to maintain a posture of transparency and accountability. 
   Remediate: Reset affected credentials, remove rogue accounts and excessive permissions, patch systems, and rotate security keys.

<p>After the inaugural <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands Conference</a> we considered ways to keep the conversation going between events. We wanted to continue engaging with our existing Discord community and decided on a monthly Discord Stage chat that we could turn into a podcast.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">Causal Islands Podcast</a> will feature thought-provoking interviews with leading experts in distributed systems, AI, computing, local-first software, and more. We'll explore the intricate connections between tech + society and how these emerging technologies will profoundly shape our future.</p><p>For our first episode, we invited several speakers from the 2023 conference to chat about their takeaways from the event.</p>     EP01: Causal Islands 2023 Recap  0:00 /56:51 1×   <p>You'll hear:</p>  How our speakers felt about the unconventional conference, and why it's important to have more holistic conversations about emerging technologies  The talks that inspired them the most and what they learned  How we're thinking about next year's conference, including ways to make the hybrid aspect more engaging, and where we should consider hosting it  The new projects that our speakers are working on today &nbsp;  <p>Here's a glance at the episode...</p>  [2:39] Chia introduced herself as an Internet Artist and Product Designer at Figma. Chia's talk explored authorship, identity, power, and our role as mythmakers and technologists.  [3:38] Envisioning the future of computing involves looking at the political, cultural, and social implications of it. This isn't discussed at many tech conferences, but at Causal Islands, it was at the forefront.  [6:24] &nbsp;Michael R. Bernstein is a marketing, sales, and business strategy consultant for high-tech startups. He's an engineer turned marketer, and his experience serves him well as co-founder of Reify, a tech marketing agency.  [9:04] Michael used his art background to approach the problem of communicating technical ideas clearly to less technical audiences.  [11:20] One of the goals of Causal Islands is movement-building. It's a long game, and you must educate first and then sell.  [12:09] Michael tackles the adoption of new technologies by not pretending to be something you're not, adapting quickly based on feedback, and focusing on how the product solves the problem.   [13:54] Quinn is an Applied Researcher at Fission. She's building Rhizome, a decentralized database. Her Causal Islands talk was about the philosophy underpinning Rhizome. In it, she explored local-first and individual computing in contrast to a model that takes globally collapsed context and understanding into one least common denominator.   [15:07] Before we can give folks these new tools, we need to explain why thinking about computing in this way is valuable and why the tradeoffs that come with building systems in that way make more sense than they may appear at first glance.   [17:20] The talks at the conference pushed back against colonial narratives of computing and explored how technology and ideology go hand-in-hand. This made Quinn feel more comfortable going deeper into these ideas in her talk.  [23:52] Quinn felt that there was a current of optimism and our ability to build a better world using technology as long as we're thoughtful and careful about how we're building it and its implications.  [27:00] Chia walked away from the conference with a reinforced belief that to realize the future, we need to look at the layer of people, relationships, governance, ownership, and decision-making. We can't just look at infrastructure, data, or protocols. This is often missed when building autonomous and pluriversal decentralized worlds.  [27:48] Jon Corbett's talk on Indigenous Computing Theory offers so many excellent ideas and a framework that we can use to help achieve this.  [32:20] There is a consensus that we would like to host the next conference in a place that is accessible and maybe a bit off the traditional path (vs going to SoCal for a tech conference). We should consider the conference in the context of the place that we're in, and we should endeavor to bring in an audience that isn't already entrenched in the technical space - for example, community organizers and nonprofit organizations.  [39:10] We might do remote watch parties in the future. We're exploring ways to provide a better hybrid conference experience.  [43:19] Causal Islands can be like a CRDT, where we can split off and work on our projects and then meet up at a larger event. This is the blueprint that Papers We Love used.  [46:47] What's next for our speakers? Chia's involved in a remote residency - Welcome to My Homepage - at the Museum of Human Achievement. She is exploring the question, "If a website is a world, how will we attend to it as we do land?" She's also working at the Phillippine Internet Archive, documenting Filipino internet culture.  [49:40] Michael is working with clients and, in particular, exploring working with AI and safe AI attribution.  [50:22} Quinn continues to work on Rhizome. She'll also be giving a talk at CodeBEAM Europe called The Tamagotchi in my Hands: Anarcho-transhumanist Biohacking with Nerves, where she'll explore expanding her own agency by building tech that is designed only for her purposes.  [53:03] The last Strange Loop conference is coming up, and Zeeshan's Papers We Love will curate a track with eight speakers.  [54:32] Boris helped organize TrainJam, a trip from Seattle to St. Louis on the Empire Amtrak train. for folks traveling to Strange Loop. The day after StrangeLoop is a Local-First Software Unconference, that Fission is co-hosting with Ink + Switch. Tickets for the Unconference are still available.  <p>Listen to the podcast embedded above, or head to our <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">podcast landing page</a> to subscribe to the podcast on your preferred platform.</p> Episode Links and Shoutouts: <p><br>Co-Host: Boris Mann - CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Organizer of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a></p><p>Co-Host: Zeeshan Lakhani - Staff Research Engineer at <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Member of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> Programming Committee</p><p>Causal Islands Theme Song by <a href="http://depatchedmode.xyz/">depatchedmode</a></p><p>Editing by Becky Vazquez</p><p>Guest: Chia Amisola - Product Designer at <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a></p>  Chia’s Causal Islands 2023 Talk: <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/speakers/chia-amisola">The Creation Myths of Computing</a>  Chia’s Residency at the <a href="https://www.welcometomyhomepage.net/">Museum of Human Achievement</a>  <a href="https://philippineinternetarchive.com/">Philippine Internet Archive</a>  <p>Guest: Michael R.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>Deepfakes and Disinformation in Cyberspace</p>
<p>Cyberspace greatly enhances an actor's ability to engage in activities that can yield geopolitical and economic gains without resorting to the use of force. With the advent of cyberspace, various actors, including both state and non-state entities, have taken advantage of its vast interconnectedness to partake in a wide range of activities, including malicious behavior.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals and state-sponsored adversaries are always looking for new ways to exploit vulnerabilities and use new tools to target individuals and organizations. For example, in recent years, there has been an increase in the use of deepfake technology to boost the execution of advanced disinformation campaigns.</p>
<p>The manipulation of visual media is enabled by the availability of sophisticated image and video editing applications and automated manipulation algorithms that create content that can be difficult to distinguish from real footage. While deepfake technology can be used for fun or for artistic value, some actors could use it for malicious purposes, such as spreading propaganda or disinformation.</p>
<p>Advanced disinformation campaigns are one of the most sophisticated and persistent cybersecurity threats. Disinformation is defined as the dissemination of false, erroneous, or misleading information designed to deliberately cause public harm. The integration of deepfake technology in these campaigns allows adversaries to target the very fabric of society.</p>
<p>Future trends and challenges</p>
<p>(Geo)political objectives constitute the primary driving force behind disinformation campaigns that utilize deepfakes, frequently carried out by state actors and other politically motivated groups. While governments and intelligence agencies have historically used deception and media manipulation, the accessibility to create realistic images, videos, or audio has now extended to almost any actor.</p>
<p>Deepfakes require a wide dataset containing images, videos, or voice recordings of the targeted person. The data is fed into a program that learns the victim's key features and uses the learned information to modify an existing photo or video. Essentially, deepfake technology can create a synthetic video or image that realistically represents anyone in the world.</p>
<p>Deepfakes can be used to create false content of political figures, candidates, or public figures engaging in controversial or damaging behavior. As a result, this can lead to the spread of false information, conspiracy theories, or sensationalized stories that undermine trust, sow division, and evade accountability.</p>
<p>In addition, advanced disinformation campaigns can use deepfakes to rewrite history or manipulate cultural narratives. For example, tampering with historical footage or altering famous speeches can distort the public's understanding of significant events, leading to confusion, denial, or the promotion of alternative narratives.</p>
<p>Advanced disinformation campaigns can also use deepfakes to create sophisticated financial scams or fraud schemes. Fraudsters and cyber criminals could use voice manipulation techniques to impersonate someone in a phone call, tricking individuals or organizations into providing sensitive information or authorizing financial transactions.</p>
<p>How to move forward?</p>
<p>Detecting and countering deepfakes, along with promoting media literacy and critical thinking, are essential to mitigating the impact of advanced disinformation tactics. Countermeasures against deepfakes have been developed to help identify and alleviate their impact. Here are some common approaches:</p>
 
 Advanced detection technology: Implementing sophisticated detection algorithms and AI-driven tools can help identify altered content. 
 Source verification: Encouraging users to verify the sources of information they share and promoting credible news outlets can help reduce the spread of false information. 
 Digital watermarking: Embedding digital watermarks in original content can enhance traceability and accountability. 
 Public awareness and education: Promoting media literacy and critical thinking skills among the public can empower individuals to question the authenticity of information they encounter. 
 Collaboration with social media platforms: Establishing trust between tech companies and the public sector is essential to combat deepfakes and disinformation campaigns. 
 Government Regulations: Creating new regulations and legal frameworks can act as a deterrent and provide consequences for malicious actors. 
 
<p>As rogue nations continue to foster an environment for cybercriminals to thrive, individuals and organizations need to be prepared and build a strong cybersecurity foundation. It's important to note that the field of deepfakes is evolving rapidly, and countermeasures need to continually adapt to new techniques and advancements. Therefore, a multi-faceted approach that combines technical solutions, user education, and policy development is necessary to mitigate the risks associated with deepfakes.</p>
<p>Deepfakes and disinformation campaigns are in the focus of KuppingerCole’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a>&nbsp;event in Frankfurt from 14-16 November which will look at tackling future cybersecurity threats. Presentations will focus on a range of topics, including how AI enables cyber attackers and defenders, securing the autonomous world and the cloud, advancements in quantum computing, detecting deepfakes, securing IoT devices, securing business communication channels and supply chains, protecting digital identities, and the security challenges of Web3 and the metaverse.</p>

   Like anything, AI can be used maliciously. But when used for good, AI can be a game changer. 
	
<p>In May of this year, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) agreed to adopt a blanket ban on the use of remote biometric identification (facial recognition) in public spaces along with predictive policing tools as part of the EU's <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/">AI Act</a>. The ban is a departure from the original proposal and the position backed in Council by EU member countries.</p>

<p>I believe the ban is a mistake that's being fueled by fears about AI.</p>

<p>Government and industry must work together to educate the public about the benefits of AI and its ability to detect and fend off threats in cybersecurity and beyond. People's distrust in AI underscores the need for education, not halting the use of AI. At ForgeRock, we believe that AI is a powerful tool in fraud prevention and the protection of sensitive data. But we also believe that people deserve to know how AI works, and that starts with transparency – made possible through explainable AI.</p>

<p>Explainable AI provides citizens and consumers with the reasons why the AI made a particular choice and enables organizations to understand AI decisioning and make corrections as needed.</p>

 AI's role in cybersecurity 

<p>In an increasingly digital world, AI can help companies combat <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/enterprises-are-getting-better-breach-prevention-attackers-are-getting-better-too">cybercrime</a>. In our industry, identity and access management (IAM), AI is especially valuable, because it can help to prevent identity-based attacks, which are the leading cause of data breaches.</p>

<p>With AI's ability to analyze large quantities of data and recognize patterns, it can quickly and automatically block known threats and bot activity. AI can be used to monitor user behavior and make real-time decisions about whether to grant access or add step-up authentication if there is anything anomalous about the request (such as a login from an unusual timezone).</p>

<p>This application of AI is known as risk decisioning, and it's what fuels our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">ForgeRock Autonomous Access</a> threat protection product. Autonomous Access takes in a range of signals about who is trying to do what, and then determines what they can or cannot do next. If it detects a threat or anomalous behavior, its dashboard explains the decision in human-readable form. Admins get a detailed view of access events along with an explanation of the risky authentication attempt – this makes it easier to explain to legitimate users why they were asked for further proof of their identity. Perhaps they got a new device or were connecting from an unfamiliar network.</p>

<p>Organizations with AI-powered identity and access management can detect unexpected activity, stopping intruders in real time as they try to authenticate. They can also automate the process of eliminating over-provisioned access that enables attackers to use one compromised account to move laterally to higher-value targets.</p>
	
 The benefits of AI in cybersecurity 
	
<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) can boost the speed and effectiveness of cybersecurity.</p>

  Recognizing suspicious activity: AI excels in pattern recognition and can quickly analyze access attempts and user activity to identify suspicious behavior and potentially malicious activity. Plus, it continuously gets smarter at identifying the difference between normal behaviors and emerging threat patterns. 
   Speed and scalability: AI can process and analyze large sets of data far more quickly than humans. 
   Managing digital identity: The use of AI can help with managing digital identities and access permissions more efficiently, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">restricting access to systems and files</a> based on a user's role, behavior, or risk score, along with the sensitivity of the data being accessed. 
   Assisting analytics efforts: By analyzing historical data, AI can help to predict future cybersecurity threats. It can also analyze user behavior to identify unusual activity that humans could miss. 
   Improving authentication options: By analyzing contextual factors, such as location, device, and behavior, AI can calculate the risk level of an action or request and issue the appropriate authentication response. Trusted users can sail through authentication with choices like <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>, while suspicious or high-risk requests are prompted for further authentication or stopped and held for remediation. 
  Attackers are using AI. We should, too. 

<p>The fear of AI is understandable – its future is unknown and its potential for misuse is high. It also raises serious privacy concerns when facial recognition technology is involved, which undoubtedly led to the EU's recent ban.</p>

<p>But it's important to remember that AI is already playing an essential role in keeping us safe from sophisticated attacks, including those that are themselves fueled by AI. The advent of generative AI makes it far easier to impersonate others, and there's been an increase in attackers exploiting AI to develop new malware, create synthetic identities, and generate more targeted and authentic-looking phishing campaigns. Organizations that resist the use of AI in cybersecurity will be hamstrung in their efforts to defend against these attacks.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>In today’s online world, the importance of robust cybersecurity measures cannot be overstated. Cyber threats continue to evolve, and organizations, both public and private, face a constant battle to protect sensitive data from malicious actors. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/07/18/readout-of-white-house-multifactor-authentication-modernization-symposium/">a significant event</a>, the Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Modernization Symposium, was jointly hosted by the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of the National Cyber Director, the National Security Council, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. This symposium brought together industry and government leaders to discuss the urgent need for advancing <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant authentication</a>. As organizations contemplate how to best protect their organization, the symposium's insights serve as a powerful driving factor to adopt passwordless MFA now.</p> 
 The Time for Modern Authentication Is Now  
<p>Federal Chief Information Officer Clare Martorana captured the essence of the symposium's purpose — to deliver a positive, intuitive and trusted digital experience for users. Modernizing authentication methods is a key aspect of achieving this goal. The traditional reliance on passwords has proven inadequate in deterring cyber threats. Cybercriminals have become adept at <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/overview-different-types-of-password-attacks">exploiting password vulnerabilities</a> through phishing attacks, social engineering, and data breaches. As a result, adopting passwordless MFA is crucial in creating a resilient cybersecurity framework.</p> 
 Simplicity and Security Should Not Be Mutually Exclusive  
<p>Federal CISO and Deputy National Cyber Director Chris DeRusha highlighted that security doesn’t have to be complex to be effective. In fact, passwordless MFA, including passkeys, offers a simple yet strong methodology to protect organizations. By requiring multiple factors for user verification, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">passwordless MFA</a> significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p> 
<p>Implementing MFA not only strengthens security but also aligns with the President's Executive Order on cybersecurity. This alignment reinforces the notion that securing the authentication process, data and systems is a collective responsibility that extends to both public and private sectors.</p> 
 Collaborative Technology Strategies  
<p>The symposium showcased the importance of collaboration between public and private sectors to develop an interoperable and user-friendly MFA ecosystem. By combining efforts, organizations can learn from each other's best practices and collectively address shared security goals. Doing so enables in-depth discussions about contemporary MFA technologies and their potential impact.</p> 
 The Vision for a Safer Future  
<p>Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger called for identifying and addressing barriers to MFA adoption indicates the government's determination to support organizations in their quest for enhanced cybersecurity. As organizations embrace MFA, they not only protect their interests but also contribute to the nation's overall cyber defense strategy.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>In light of the recent Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Modernization Symposium and the resounding calls for embracing MFA, the time is now for organizations to adopt passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA. The prevailing cyber threats demand a shift away from reliance on passwords and towards stronger, multi-factor authentication methods. As the public and private sectors collaborate to develop interoperable and user-friendly MFA ecosystems, organizations can better safeguard their digital assets and provide users with a seamless and secure online experience.</p> 
<p>By aligning their technology strategies with <a href="https://www.hypr.com/">contemporary MFA technologies</a> and policies, organizations contribute not only to their own security but also to the overall cybersecurity landscape of the nation. Through collective efforts, we can build a more resilient and secure digital future.</p>

<p>It’s tough to recap my experience of DWeb Camp 2023. It was an intense, invigorating, and innovative event, as was the work leading up to it. Maybe the best thing I can do is try to tell the story of the Emergence app and provide my perspective on Holochain’s involvement and learning throughout this process. So, here goes:</p> Intent <p>In March 2023 Holochain began conversations with DWeb Camp about sponsorship and offered to create a simple application for note taking and community connection (via a tag cloud and shared space for documentation). This was intended to increase the collective intelligence of the camp and to help document the conference sessions. As a local-first, peer-to-peer application it would run directly on participants' laptops and connect over the mesh network LAN that the wonderful DWeb network team sets up each year, thus not needing to connect to central servers or the rest of the internet. </p><p>At the 2022 DWeb Camp many of us experienced challenges with the scheduling app Sched. Because everyone at camp was connecting to their servers over the same low bandwidth connection, camp participants had ongoing issues loading and accessing the schedule. These conditions are exactly where distributed applications shine, and we saw this as an opportunity to give people a strong experience of a local-first application.</p> Tomorrow <p>After some conversations with DWeb’s organizing team, this initial idea grew into a plan to have our app act as a decentralized Sched and to actually facilitate a day of “open-space” style sessions, coordinating the schedule as an emergent process amongst all of the camp participants. This day became known as “Tomorrow” — a day for stepping into and embodying the technologies and social patterns that the distributed web is building towards. On that day, access to the wider Internet would be shut off so as to give all of us distributed web tool builders a real opportunity to put our tools where our mouths are! Furthermore, to double down on decentralization, during this day all the participants would be using our app for proposing sessions and coordinating in which spaces they would go.</p><p>This felt like a really exciting opportunity that we couldn’t pass up, but it came with some significant challenges. The main one being that the app would have to work on cell phones because it just wasn’t going to be feasible to have 400 people toting their laptops around the forests of Camp Navaro just to add in their sessions and browse the schedule. But therein lay the rub: Holochain is not yet cell phone ready. So, to do this, we would actually need to either get it ready for phones, or come up with a work-around that was more like Holo-hosting, where cell phone users could just use a browser to access a Holochain instance through a proxy. But of course we couldn’t use actual Holo-hosting itself because this was all supposed to work on a day where access to the wider internet was off!</p>Introducing Tomorrow. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>. The Plan <p>We decided to go for both options: As Plan A, we would move forward on our “zero-arc” solution for running Holochain on cell phones directly. This solution disables gossip (and thus gets around the cell phone OS penchant of killing apps that use too much CPU/Memory/Networking), but still allows each person’s source-chain to live on the phone. As a backup, in case we couldn’t get plan A to work in time (we only had a few months), we would also develop a multiplexer, a kind of “Holo-hosting-light,” that would allow browser access to a pool of Holochain conductors that we would run on a cluster of small boxes on-site. The irony was not lost on us that to get things working in this setting we would have to do a kind of micro-re-centralization of a fully distributed tool, but this is still a useful configuration of the tech to explore!</p><p>So, I did some project planning, initial app prototyping, and smoke testing for our Plan B just to make sure that Holochain could handle the load of 500 people creating sessions and doing all kinds of activities on the 3 conductors in the multiplexer which we thought would be sufficient for our little cluster. The results looked great, no load problems. We also had a nice project plan with the various aspects of all the work and our participation in the conference, spreading out the labor and ensuring buy-in across all the stakeholders, and so we gave the green light to go ahead.</p><p>The fantastic <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/starpause/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Jordan Gray</a> took the initial design requirements and created the basic UX layout for the app. From Jordan’s designs, I built out the DNA for the app and Svelte-based single-page-app front-end. We then invested significant time in building this into a reasonably polished user experience with many, many rounds of UX/UI testing and improvements so that the app would really work well for the event and provide a powerful experience both of a distributed app, but also of the distributed coordination of a conference event. We really wanted to deliver on the ethos of the D in DWeb both at the technical and social levels.</p>Emergence app sessions page with example data. The Details <p>But it turns out that there are also a couple of other challenging Ds: those of the Devil in the Details.</p><p>For a number of complex reasons, we realized about six weeks before the event that Plan A for mobile wasn’t going to land in time for DWeb. There were too many development steps with too much risk to be able to be sure it would work. Though we had the conductor compiling and working on iOS and Android, some aspects of networking were being blocked, and we realized that there just wasn’t enough time to test, debug, and get the app through the Apple/Google App/Play-Store deployment process. So we switched completely to Plan B which appeared to be working very well. I was able to build the multiplexer in a weekend, which was what we expected because it's a fairly low complexity solution. It’s just a simple Node web app sitting behind a reverse-proxy which does 3 things: 1) installs app instances using people’s keys and passwords as a seed for generating their key-pair, 2) creates a UI credential that gets stored in people’s browser as a cookie, and 3) accepts zome calls from the UI signed using that credential and forwards it to the appropriate conductor.</p><p>But then things started to get hairy: as we ran our testing sessions with more and more people, we started to get zome-call timeouts and other symptoms that looked like conductor overload. This was quite surprising as it was happening at levels of interaction well below those we subjected the conductor to in our initial smoke-testing. We soon discovered that this was because users were often just reloading their web-browsers which was dropping in-progress websocket connections to the conductor. Holochain was designed under the assumption of a single user connecting over a few websockets to a local conductor, here we were creating hundreds of unexpected websocket connections. To fix this, we added web-socket connection multiplexing into our multiplexer setup! This improved things, but still, after a while, things stopped working again. Grrrr. </p><p>So then, as we continued to debug these issues, we really started seeing the rise of additional contextual complexity. Example: our plan for deploying to our cluster using our internal nix infrastructure (based on hydra), was implemented, but incomplete because we discovered that we wouldn’t be able to serve our multiplexer service over plain http because cell phone browsers get grumpy about that and basically require https for decent user experience. So we had to include adding and provisioning ssl certificates to reverse-proxy web-servers. And well, it just snowballed from there…</p> What Happened Tomorrow Browser based key registration for the Emergence app at DWeb Camp 2023<p>At this point I’m going to stop the blow-by-blow of all of the failure modes we encountered in processes, like converting and uploading data from Sched (which we wanted to do so people could take notes on the sessions all week long), or our development machines mysteriously taking forever to deploy data to the cluster because they were actually connected to a very slow Wifi when the Ubuntu UI showed that they were on the Ethernet, etc. Each one of these issues was fixable. Each one took minutes or hours to address. Time and again, we had successful test-runs followed by complete failures.</p><p>When we got to DWeb Camp it looked like the app was finally ready, but then this saga continued all throughout the build days, and even into the two days leading up to Saturday’s Tomorrow day of emergent sessions. We did, finally, get it working. Bugs at all levels, from the UI to the network configurations, to Holochain itself, were squashed. However, by this point, the DWeb conference team had already made the call to use the backup analog process for conference scheduling (which was a more than reasonable decision given the challenges up to that point), but we were still going to use the app for its initial purpose of note-taking and sensemaking. So, there we are with the whole cluster provisioned and hundreds of people starting to use the app when suddenly the power went out to the whole valley. This meant that though peoples’ phones were operating, there was no local LAN to connect to because the Wifi access points were down. It was a perfect example of an unending series of cascading failure modes, and an ideal embodiment of exactly what the Tomorrow day was supposed to be a test of: how fully decentralized can our tech stack be? Not just as we talk about it, but in actual practice, in the middle of a camp in the redwood forest.</p><p>On the flip-side, this led to a beautiful experience in further emergence. We had planned to do a get-your-hands-on-it session for people to experience running various Holochan apps. Well, that actually worked! Because even though the Wifi access points were down, we had the idea of turning on a cell-phone’s hot-spot functionality which, even without cell service, made it an ad-hoc Wifi router for Holochain nodes on laptops to connect in the middle of the woods with no power! This felt like a significant real-life demo of the power of local-first distributed computing architecture.</p> Lessons in Complexity and Teamwork Just a few of the Holochain team at DWeb Camp 2023. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>.<p>So in the end, what did we learn? Well, there were many lessons, small and large, which we are integrating back into our work, process, and code. Part of the difficulty of expanding contextual complexity comes precisely from the fact that it is invisible at the outset, even when you account for invisible additional complexity, which we did. We certainly detected and fixed a bunch of subtle performance bugs in Holochain. And we greatly increased our in-house capacity to build out apps with decent user-experience.</p><p>One of the most powerful lessons for me, however, was the lived experience of what an amazing team we have assembled. As each one of the problems we encountered arose, someone jumped forward to help figure it out, or work on it until we moved through to the next challenge. I find that our team’s collaboration isn’t just about solving the problem, but the grace and joy of working together in doing so. </p><p>I also want to personally (and on behalf of Holochain), thank the DWeb community and especially the on-site network team. Your tireless work was inspirational as well as being essential to everything we did. It was a pleasure to work with you. </p><p>The invitation of DWeb’s “Tomorrow” to take risks and bring technologies to use rather then just talking about them was answered by Holochain and others. It served as a forcing function to put our tooling and teamwork to the test in a setting where the contextual complexity was quite high. With Holochain in beta, this experience allowed us to squash some very difficult to find bugs. We will continue to prioritize partnerships and projects that put Holochain to the test. And if anybody is interested in using a very cool app for helping run open-space/unconference style gatherings, please get in touch with us!</p><p>Special thanks to Eric Bear (process design, testing, holding the relationship with DWeb), Jordan Gray (initial spec), Aaron Brodeur (UX/UI), David Braden (multiplexer &amp; app stress testing, tooling, and Holochain debugging), Jost Schulte (testing across all levels), Stefan Junker (network infrastructure and nix deployment), Gregory Jensen (Holochain testing and debugging), and the many others who put time and labor into this project. Similarly, thank you to everyone in the Holochain team and community who showed up to the repeated test sessions both before and at DWeb Camp.</p>

							<p>Navigating the world of digital assets is complex, particularly with the advent of evolving regulations such as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR), and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In response to these regulatory developments, businesses in the digital assets sector must stay well-informed and adjust their practices to remain compliant. Coinfirm and CoinsPaid, two leaders in the spheres of regulatory technology and crypto payment solutions respectively, have teamed up to elucidate these intricate regulations and their implications for businesses in the crypto space.</p><p>We are delighted to announce an exclusive webinar titled, “MiCA, TFR, and GDPR: Navigating Digital Assets Regulations.” The webinar features esteemed panelists Claudia Naiba, Regulatory &amp; Training Lead at Coinfirm, and Maria Akulenko, Head of Legal and Compliance at CoinsPaid.</p><p>In this webinar, you will delve into:</p><p>1. A comprehensive overview of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA),<br>2. Understanding the role of Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) in the context of MiCA,<br>3. Examining the impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the context of MiCA.</p><p>This event is not to be missed for professionals working in the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/digital-asset/"> digital asset </a>industry, regulatory bodies, or anyone keen to enhance their understanding of these critical regulations and their impact on digital asset transactions.</p>

			 Post Webinar Summary 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Introduction:</p><p>A webinar hosted by Coinfirm provided valuable insights into the European regulations in the cryptocurrency industry. The panelists focused on the Market in Crypto Assets Regulation (MICA), the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR), and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These regulations aim to bring transparency and accountability to the crypto market while protecting investors and personal data. In this article, we will provide a summary of the key points discussed in the webinar and shed light on how these regulations will impact the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>MICA – Protecting Investors and Ensuring Trustworthiness:</p><p>The webinar began by discussing the scope of the MICA regulation, which primarily aims to protect crypto asset investors and ensure the trustworthiness of the crypto assets market framework. MICA lays down specific rules for offers, persons seeking admissions to trading, as well as issuers of crypto assets. These rules apply to both natural and legal persons, including certain undertakings providing crypto asset services. However, fully decentralized services and certain exemptions are considered out of scope for MICA.</p><p>Key Provisions of MICA:</p><p>To achieve its goals, MICA requires issuers of reference tokens to have a registered office in the Union. It also mandates the creation and publication of white papers by issuers, containing mandatory disclosures about the issuer project details, rights, obligations, and underlying technology. Additionally, marketing communications related to these assets should align with the information provided in the white paper to ensure fairness and clarity.</p><p>TFR – Enhancing Transparency and Combating Money Laundering:</p><p>The panelists also delved into the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR), which aims to prevent money laundering in the crypto industry. The TFR extends obligations to virtual asset service providers, requiring them to provide information on the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers to facilitate traceability and comply with anti-money laundering measures. This regulation aligns with global recommendations and enhances transparency in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>GDPR – Safeguarding Personal Data:</p><p>Another significant aspect discussed in the webinar was the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR aims to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data. It covers the processing of personal data by data controllers and processors within the EU, as well as the processing of such data of EU residents by controllers and processors outside the EU. The GDPR sets out rules and obligations for organizations handling personal data to ensure lawful and responsible processing.</p><p>Interconnectivity of MICA, TFR, and GDPR:</p><p>It was highlighted by panelists that MICA and TFR are interconnected and rely on each other to address various issues within the crypto industry. The TFR aligns the European Union with global recommendations and imposes clear obligations on European crypto asset service providers, which will come into effect from January 2025. On the other hand, GDPR complements the regulations by safeguarding personal data and ensuring compliance with data protection standards.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The webinar provided valuable insights into the upcoming regulations in the cryptocurrency industry, specifically MICA, TFR, and GDPR. These regulations are aimed at bringing transparency, trustworthiness, and investor protection to the crypto market while also safeguarding personal data. Understanding and adhering to these regulations will be crucial for individuals and companies operating within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

 DIVE — Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy&nbsp;System <p>We are happy to announce that KILT will provide the infrastructure for decentralized digital identities for the project DIVE — Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy System by the German Energy Agency (dena). This follow up project to the <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-in-action-the-dena-blockchain-pilot-project-a384cb2629a7">“Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL)”</a> is commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. KILT is delighted to contribute to the transformation of the energy sector and to continue to work alongside dena the German Energy Agency, enterprises, and ecosystem projects using identities “Built on&nbsp;KILT”.</p><p>DIVE ​​- Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy System is set to evaluate the benefit of decentralized identities in the energy sector by using them in real-world use cases, i.e., proof of origin, the participation of micro-plants in flexibility markets, and rapid supplier switching at e-charging stations. All steps up to a broad implementation will be outlined in a transformation path, so that it enables building up an ecosystem and the subsequent rolling out of further applications.</p><blockquote>Following the successful Proof of Concept (BMIL Project) last year, we move towards the production phase together with dena and our other partners. We are happy and proud to see KILT as part of the essential infrastructure of this German Energy Transition project, which already sparked great interest beyond German and even European borders. With KILT’s integration to different use cases happening this year I am pleased to see that blockchain is starting to become commodity infrastructure for real world industrial applications. — Ingo Rübe, Founder KILT&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p><a href="https://future-energy-lab.de/projects/dive-en/">Text from dena&nbsp;website</a></p><p>The energy system is undergoing the greatest upheaval in decades: In order to achieve climate neutrality, renewable energies in Germany must be expanded massively. Instead of a few large power plants as in the past, electricity will increasingly be generated by wind turbines, solar parks and also small roof and balcony solar systems. Specifically, this means that there will be more and more decentralized systems with a relatively low capacity of power generation. On the consumer side, charging stations for electric vehicles, heat pumps or home storage must also be integrated into the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Owners of small power generation plants consume the electricity themselves or feed it into the grid. Therefore, the devices are available for various applications (e.g. self-consumption and grid feed-in). In terms of an efficient energy system, the change between these applications has to be automated: If a feed-in is to take place to maintain grid stability, it is automatically determined whether the decentral plant is available or not. A manual change is error-prone, expensive and does not offer the necessary flexibility and speed. Applied to the millions of small plants in our energy system, a digital solution is required.</p> The DIVE&nbsp;Project <p>For this automatic change, however, trust and certainty that a plant actually exists and can feed in a certain amount of electricity at a time are needed. This is where the project Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy System (DIVE) comes into play: The project investigates how systems or devices in the energy system can be equipped with secure digital identities. It will also clarify which structures are required for the associated identity management.</p> Digital Identities <p>A digital identity is comparable to an analog identity (e.g. ID card). It also consists of a unique number (e.g. identity card number, ID) and further properties (e.g. name, place of residence), with the difference that it exists and is managed digitally. As with an analog identity, a digital identity has recognized authorities that can issue and revoke the identity or certain associated attributes (e.g. driver’s license). The aim is that the verification of an identity and the associated properties (does the system actually exist? Are the specified properties such as the power and the location true? Is the system actually available?) can be automated in the energy system of the future. This ensures, for example, that the system is not scheduled for two applications at the same time and enables switching between different use cases almost in real time. For customers in particular, this can mean significant cost savings, for example if excess electricity in the grid is absorbed by their own home storage system or the PV roof system feeds in during bottlenecks.</p><p>The DIVE project builds on the previous <a href="https://future-energy-lab.de/projects/blockchain-machine-identity-ledger/">Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL) project</a>, in which the technical feasibility of connecting a decentral plant to a decentralized identity registry was&nbsp;shown.</p> Project goal <p>The aim of the DIVE project is to build on the knowledge gained and to test decentralized identity management using application-oriented scenarios. Specific use cases that are tested in the project are proof of origin, the participation of small systems in flexibility markets and the rapid change of suppliers at e-charging stations. In addition, all steps up to a broad implementation are presented in a transformation path, so that it is possible to build an ecosystem and roll out further applications.</p><p>The project will run from June 2023 to December&nbsp;2024.</p> Project Partner <p>Forschungsstelle für Energiewirtschaft e.V., Energy Web, Oli Systems, BOTLabs GmbH, fieldfisher, Fraunhofer FIT</p> Associated Partner <p>CHARGING RADAR, EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg AG, Equigy, Numbat, TenneT TSO, TH Ulm, TransnetBW GmbH, 50Hertz Transmission GmbH</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/dive-digital-identities-as-trust-anchors-in-the-energy-system-3c5011b5ed92">DIVE — Digital Identities as trust anchors in the energy system</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Companies can save an average of $2.66 million by testing their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">cybersecurity incident</a> response plan, but many choose not to. Whether this is out of necessity or negligence, it may cost businesses their reputation and revenue in the long run. Failing to keep up with cybersecurity can have compounding effects.</p>

<p>However, overcomplicating security can be just as damaging. Security fatigue is a major risk for businesses. Find out how to mitigate it in your organization to protect your digital assets.</p>
	
 What is security fatigue? 
	
<p>Security fatigue describes the feeling of exhaustion users experience when they are inundated with too many security measures. Particularly in the workplace, staff can become overwhelmed with security warnings, IT alerts, cybersecurity policy documents, password change requests, or even media consumption of stories about data breaches at other companies.</p>

<p>Overworked admins, who may be managing many thousands of identities and privileges, are often forced to give blanket permissions, which can lead to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/rise-self-driving-identity-governance">over-privileged or unauthorized access</a> – an enormous risk in any organization.</p>
	
 Symptoms of security fatigue 
	
<p>To combat security fatigue, you must understand how it presents itself – in yourself and your employees. These so-called symptoms of security fatigue are signs that you should rethink the way you handle cybersecurity for your company. Look out for:</p>

  Reduced attention during security training or processes 
   Frequent password reset requests from the user 
   Unsafe password practices, such as weak passwords or sharing them with coworkers, family, or friends 
   A sense of frustration with security measures 
   Ignoring software updates 
   Bypassing security by connecting to your server without a VPN or on public Wi-Fi 
   Demonstrating risky online behavior 
 <p>Risky online behavior in the context of security fatigue doesn't necessarily include gambling or anything nefarious or inappropriate for the workplace. However, it can be just as damaging in different ways. When users are faced with cybersecurity fatigue, they tend to forgo the recommended security measures and may not be as vigilant about avoiding online threats.</p>

<p>If you notice employees opening, responding to, or clicking through links in suspicious emails, it's a clear sign that they aren't as engaged in cybersecurity best practices as they should be. You can test this by sending out planned phishing emails and tracking users who click through, and use that information to adjust or expand your cybersecurity training.</p>
	
 MFA prompt bombing complacency 
	
<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a common cybersecurity measure taken by companies, but it can also reveal a security fatigue issue. Bad actors are well aware that organizations use MFA and are actively trying to fight their way through these security walls. One of these ways is <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a>.</p>

<p>If employees aren't careful, they can fall for this social engineering tactic. Typical MFA includes an authentication request sent to a user's device, such as a phone or tablet, after which the user taps the screen to "accept" that the authentication is legitimate. Attackers are, in turn, sending out fake MFA notifications, sometimes multiple times, to trick a frustrated or fatigued user into "accepting" the notification simply to make it go away. Once accepted, the attacker can gain unbridled access to user accounts.</p>
	
 The impact of security fatigue 
	
<p>Cybersecurity fatigue has clear negative impacts on businesses. Employees become tired of security measures and complacent, allowing these same measures to even work against the company's security. This cybersecurity-prompted syndrome has far-reaching risks that can't be ignored.</p>
	
 The financial risk 
	
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">According to IBM</a>, the average cost of a data breach in the U.S. is $9.44 million.</p>

<p>The financial risks of overwhelming employees — and consumers — with cybersecurity measures are palpable. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/customer-targeted-cybercrime-rises-traditional-digital-identity-fails">Customer-targeted cybercrime is on the rise</a> as security measures become more commonplace and attackers become more aware of how to bypass them. Data breaches due to security fatigue can result in:</p>

  Resources spent identifying and thwarting the attack 
   Legal fees and penalties for improper security 
   <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/11/26/how-consumers-feel-about-retail-data-breaches/">Loss of revenue due to damaged reputation and loss of trust</a> 
   Allocation of budget to increase identity theft protection 
 <p>Expending resources to identify and mitigate cyberattacks inevitably leads organizations to see decreases in productivity. IT and security teams are forced to spend less time on business operations that can improve the user experience and give the company a competitive edge.</p>
	
 The security risk 
	
<p>Many people get tired of logging into a VPN only to have a slow connection or one that drops frequently. So they connect directly to apps and data – sometimes using unsecured networks.</p>

<p>But these practices can leave your organization open to attack. Protecting your digital assets has become an ever-present need in modern businesses. Particularly during a business breakup, digital assets – like financial data, internal documents, and intellectual property – require tight security controls that prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.</p>
	
 The compliance risk 
	
<p>Security fatigue can lead to significant fines and penalties due to regulatory noncompliance and violations of industrial regulations. In addition, such violations can result in legal problems and damage to an organization's reputation. Harvard Business Review studied employees over a 10-day period and found that about 67% of <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/01/research-why-employees-violate-cybersecurity-policies">staff violated cybersecurity policies</a> at least once during the study period. In most cases, the employees were simply trying to get something done and security would have slowed them down. That is a clear case of security fatigue.</p>
	
 Managing security fatigue 
	
<p>Businesses can help reduce or eliminate security fatigue in several ways:</p>

  Implementing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication methods</a> to improve security and simplify the user experience 
   <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Streamlining identity governance</a> and access controls 
   Managing the business's <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identity on secure platforms</a> 
   Setting up alerts for suspicious activities 
   Using <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-driven tools to identify potentially fraudulent access</a>, requiring additional authorization when user behavior is unusual 
 <p>Above all, make it clear to employees and customers that cybersecurity must be a priority, for their protection and that of the business, but it can't be too onerous. That's because user experience is also a priority for acquiring and retaining customers and to avoid security fatigue amongst employees. Be transparent about your efforts to enhance security without causing fatigue, and ask for feedback directly from staff about how to improve processes. Keep an eye on employee data and track symptoms of security fatigue to ensure your mitigation efforts are working. You can't afford not to.</p>

<p>Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took the uncommon step of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-allows-imports-of-china-made-chemotherapy-to-ease-u-s-shortage-8ee88e7e?mod=mhp">allowing temporary imports</a> of a chemotherapy drug to ease a shortage in the United States of America. The drug – cisplatin – is made by a Chinese lab and will be imported without receiving formal USFDA approval. With <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/07/health/cancer-center-chemo-drugs/index.html">more than 90% of major cancer centers</a> across the country reporting experiencing the shortage, there is clearly an urgent problem to address.&nbsp;</p>
 Background on US FDA and China NMPA approaches to drug regulation 
<p>Food and drug regulation in the United States (US) and China differ in several key aspects, including regulatory frameworks, approval processes, and post-marketing surveillance. It is important to approach this topic in an apolitical way to focus on objective differences rather than any subjective biases.</p>
<p>In the US, the FDA oversees the regulation of food and drugs. The FDA has a robust regulatory framework that ensures the safety, efficacy, and quality of products. The agency conducts rigorous pre-market evaluations for drugs, assessing their safety and effectiveness through clinical trials before granting approval. This process aims to protect public health by minimizing the risks associated with the use of drugs.</p>
<p>Similarly, the FDA regulates food products in the US. It establishes and enforces standards for food safety, labeling, and ingredient requirements. The agency conducts inspections of food facilities, monitors food imports, and investigates outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. The FDA also requires pre-market approval for certain food products, such as additives and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), to ensure they meet safety standards.</p>
<p>In China, drugs and medical devices are regulated by the <a href="http://english.nmpa.gov.cn/aboutNMPA.html">National Medical Products Administration </a>(NMPA), formerly the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. China’s drug regulatory framework has evolved in recent years to align with international standards. The approval process for drugs in China involves three stages: preclinical research, clinical trials, and market approval. However, the timelines and requirements may differ from those in the US. China has also implemented a fast-track approval process for certain urgently needed drugs.</p>
 Post-market surveillance of drugs in the US and China 
<p>Both the US and China have post-market surveillance systems to monitor the safety and quality of products. In the US, the FDA employs methods like adverse event reporting, inspections, and product sampling to identify and address any potential issues. The FDA can also initiate product recalls if safety concerns arise.</p>
<p>In China, the NMPA has implemented similar measures for post-market surveillance. They monitor adverse events, conduct inspections, and enforce regulations to ensure product safety. China has also established a system for reporting adverse drug reactions and foodborne illnesses.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that regulatory systems can vary over time due to evolving scientific understanding, changes in public health priorities, and international harmonization efforts. Additionally, political, cultural, and economic factors may influence the implementation and enforcement of regulations in both countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While regulatory activities in the US and China follow similar paths procedurally there are reasons for concern regarding oversight of manufacturing processes. The possibility of substandard or even falsified drugs entering the US distribution system is therefore a real and pressing concern.</p>
 How ARTiFACTS Verify can help confirm the safety of drugs entering the US market 
<p><a href="https://artifacts.ai/verify/">ARTiFACTS Verify</a> is a platform that tracks chain-of-custody throughout the entire drug supply chain. Here’s a quick summary of how it works:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The system covers data processing from in-field collection and quality screening to confirmation assessment and reporting to stakeholders. 
 Data about samples’ lifecycle, task results, and participants performing drug tests are recorded in blockchain to create an immutable record and chain of custody vital to drug verification. 
 The platform is integrated with the <a href="https://padproject.nd.edu/partners/">Paper Analytical Device</a> (PAD) reader&nbsp; and allows users to add data from assays (HPLC and LC/MS), screening and other common tests (MINILAB test, near infrared test). Shortly, pharmacopoeial monograph tests and root cause analyses will be added to the system. 
 Each sample type is analyzed following procedures used by scientists and research specialists which are implemented into the operating system. 
 
<p>In conclusion, while the US and China share the common goal of protecting public health through drug regulation, there are notable differences in their regulatory frameworks, approval processes, and post-market surveillance. Understanding these differences can help stakeholders navigate the complexities of bringing products to market and ensuring their safety and quality. And in parallel, ARTiFACTS Verify provides a robust tool for studying pharmaceutical quality across the pharmaceutical supply chain.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>Zero-Trust practices offer many benefits to the organizations that adopt them; in this piece we will explore how they work, why they are gaining in popularity, and how DIDComm can help enable them for you.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>What is Zero Trust?</p>
<p>Zero Trust is an approach to cybersecurity that holds that you should never assume that someone or something has the proper credentials to access what they are trying to do, even if they are already inside your organization or system.</p>
<p>Picture this real-world example: When shopping at stores such as Costco, a membership card must be presented to gain entry. Therefore, it could be assumed that anyone who has made it into the store is a member, and is able to purchase goods. Costco does not make this assumption. It requires another check of the Costco club card at checkout, because the company knows that its system of checking at the door is not 100% secure. In other words, don’t trust the perimeter defense, always verify those who are inside it, which is a principle of Zero Trust.</p>
<p>Zero Trust evolved to deal with the painful and costly reality that in the digital age, perimeter defenses were easily defeated, not least by people faking or using stolen digital identities.</p>
<p>What is DIDComm?</p>
<p>Let’s shift gears now to Decentralized Identifier Communication (DIDComm) which is a method for creating a direct, encrypted line of communication between the owners of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p>
<p>DIDs are a recent W3C standard and can be thought of as global digital addresses for identity, though they are more than that. If someone, something, or some organization has a DID, they have an identity and can be contacted. The key point about DIDs is that they are decentralized — unlike the identifiers we presently use in the form of emails or user accounts with logins and passwords. These are centralized forms of identity, meaning your data is stored and managed by a third party from whom you “lease” an identity like a user account. You don’t actually own your email address. By contrast, you do own and fully control your DID; you can create any number of them; they are permanent for as long as you wish, and they can refer to organizations and things as well as people. And, as noted, you can use the communications protocol in a DID — DIDComm to directly connect to other DIDs.</p>
<p>How do DIDComm and Zero Trust work together?</p>
<p>There are two aspects of DIDComm that enable Zero-Trust principles by design.</p>
<p>The first is what we will refer to as “feature discovery:” either party in the connection can disclose what kind of protocols they are willing to accept. For example, you can share that you are open to sending / receiving messages and your name, while withholding your age, location, and other personal information. What is interesting and important is that you can withhold that you are able to share certain information. Say you are religious and you don’t wish to share that fact with the other party: they will not even know that that was an option for you to potentially share.</p>
<p>Feature discovery can happen at any time, though it often happens at the beginning of a connection with another DID; but as the owner of that DID wants to have more interaction and access more of your data, you can grant additional access — or decline in real time, which is similar to the double checking in Zero Trust.</p>
<p>The second aspect is being able to process a message from another party based on your willingness to trust that entity. By making the decision to engage in a protocol on a per relationship basis, you limit the access another party has to your interactions.</p>
<p>Policy vs architecture</p>
<p>DIDComm’s architecture enables Zero-Trust policies. That’s not the same thing as Zero Trust itself, but it is a good start for those interested in adopting Zero-Trust practices.</p>
<p>Another visualization might be helpful here. Picture you have two levers on a wall and you can only allow employees to pull a specific one. A policy solution might state that only the right lever may be pulled, and anyone who pulls the left lever will be subject to a fine of $500; an architectural solution would be to remove the unwanted lever.</p>
<p>Similarly, your company most likely has data protection policies in place, and everyone likely has had training to know to double check access rights; but as long as the “lever” is available there is a chance for something to go wrong. Having architectural solutions such as DIDComm provide an extra layer of security and confidence that no data will be shared that wasn’t meant to be.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about DIDComm, or have specific questions on how you might be able to get started, we encourage you to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">talk to our team of experts.</a></p>

  <p>As announced on June 7, 2023, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-is-generally-available/ba-p/2466932">Microsoft Entra ID Governance</a> is now generally available, and with it a set of new capabilities to empower businesses in their pursuit of streamlined access management. If you’re running your organization’s&nbsp; program, your primary job responsibility is linked to the business goal of ensuring that the right people have access to the right resources for the right amount of time. If you’re running your organization’s&nbsp; program, then identity governance – the ability to know who has access to what, when, and why – is foundational to Zero Trust. Regardless of the business objective driving your identity governance and administration (IGA) initiative, you shared with us the importance of implementing and monitoring IGA rollout in a way that demonstrates the effectiveness of IGA controls to your business stakeholders. We heard you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we created a new Microsoft Entra ID Governance dashboard that pulls information, giving you an at-a-glance view of your current state of Identity Governance, a launch-pad for IGA features, and quick access to compliance reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that implementing Identity Governance is a journey, and you may be in different stages of this journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 If you are just getting started, use the dashboard to assess the complexity of your IT landscape. Identify the number of users and guests in your tenant. Discover business apps and privileged roles in your tenant and review capabilities provided by Entra ID Governance to create an implementation plan that addresses your security and compliance needs. 
 If you’ve already deployed certain governance capabilities, use the dashboard to understand the coverage of your governance automations and find and close implementation gaps. For example, maybe you have automated birthright access using <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2210375">entitlement management</a>, but you have not set up periodic <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2211313">access reviews</a>. Use the call-to-action links in the dashboard to further improve your identity governance posture.<br> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we plan to evolve the ID Governance dashboard to further align the experience with your security and compliance needs while making it even easier for you to get started by reducing setup and configuration requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to use the Microsoft Entra ID Governance dashboard&nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access it, sign into the Microsoft Entra admin center and select the “Dashboard” blade under “Identity Governance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dashboard experience is made up of the following main components:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Glanceable cards: These cards provide high-level insights into what’s happening in your tenant from the perspective of employee, guest, privileged identities, and application access governance. The navigation links in the glanceable cards point to ID Governance quick start guides and tutorials. 
 ID Governance status: This visual shows your identity landscape in terms of number of employees, guests, business apps, groups, and privileged roles. It then highlights the various Microsoft Entra ID Governance feature sets configured to better govern these entities. If a feature is not configured, you can use the “Configure Now” option to open the configuration landing blade for that feature. 
 Tutorials: This section contains tutorials of popular ID Governance use cases for quick access. 
 Highlights: Use the content in this section to stay informed about the latest ID Governance features and learn how customers are using ID Governance to improve their security and compliance posture.<br>

<p><a href="http://Suomi.fi">Suomi.fi</a> e-Identification is a Finnish public service identity system. Using Suomi.fi, users can authenticate to any public administration service, and move seamlessly between the services that use it for authentication. It was introduced in 2015, and it now supports more than 200 million identifications each year. There are currently around 245 public and private sector <a href="https://www.suomi.fi/instructions-and-support/e-authorizations/what-is-suomifi-e-authorizations/services-using-suomifi-e-authorizations">services</a> relying on Suomi.fi for identification.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.suomi.fi/instructions-and-support/e-authorizations/what-is-suomifi-e-authorizations/services-using-suomifi-e-authorizations">Suomi.fi e-Authorizations</a> was introduced in 2016. It can be used to digitally authorise other individuals and organisations to take care of tasks on your behalf, whilst being legally binding. The system enables a wide range of scenarios, including allowing the registration of mandates in complex legal entity forms, including for public administration bodies, clubs and associations, churches, investment funds, deceased estates, bankrupt or liquidated entities and organisations with foreign officials. Mandates can either be granted to the assignee or you can conveniently proactively request a mandate through the service. This reduces the actions required to get a mandate, when the assignor is less familiar with the service and may be reluctant to initiate the process.</p>
<p>Offering a centralised platform for identification and authorisation streamlines the implementation and adoption of new online services. The efficiencies that this has enabled are quite incredible. The number of services connected, and the number of transactions, have shown strong growth since Suomi.fi’s inception.</p>
 Why was Suomi.fi created? 
<p>The Suomi.fi platform was born out of the National Architecture for Digital Services Programme, which ran from 2014 to 2017. Work and scope of the programme have continued since then and the platform is a core part of Finland’s digital e-government strategy.</p>
<p>Prior to Suomi.fi e-Identification, there were two widely used strong authentication services in the public sector: Tunnistus.fi and VETUMA. VETUMA included the ability to integrate payments-as- a-service. Consolidation and harmonisation of the services into Suomi.fi proved to increase adoption both by online services and by the general public.</p>
<p>Prior to Suomi.fi e-Authorizations, the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="KATSO platform">KATSO platform</a> served Finland for 15 years from 2006 to 2021. To ease the transition to Suomi.fi, mappings were made between KATSO roles and the new Suomi.fi e-Authorization Mandate Themes. In 2020, KATSO had 32 relying organisations and around 170 roles. Comparatively, today Suomi.fi e-Authorizations has over 200 relying organisations and over 400 mandate themes.</p>
<p>Detailed history of the Suomi.fi services, including e-Identification and e-Authorizations can be found at <a href="https://dvv.fi/en/suomifi-history">https://dvv.fi/en/suomifi-history</a>.</p>
<p>In 2022, 196.6 million logins were made via the Suomi.fi service to government services or private sector service providers fulfilling a government mandate. This was slightly less than the peak annual 200.5 million login events achieved in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
 How does Suomi.fi e-Identification work? 
<p>Suomi.fi e-Identification is closely tied to the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/finnish-trust-network-ftn/" title="Finnish Trust Network">Finnish Trust Network</a> (FTN) – a framework which allows application providers to enter into a single contract, with a single integration, to make use of multiple identity providers. Suomi.fi uses Finnish Trust Network actors to provide the strong authentication brokering and authentication for citizen login.</p>
<p>This means that a user accessing a service via Suomi.fi can be authenticated via a number of identity providers (IdP) – including all of the FTN IdPs that are brokered to the service, all using one integration and contract as enabled by the FTN. These are predominantly bank IdPs (see screenshot below for options), giving users choice over which strongly authenticated pre-existing identity they use to access public services with Suomi.fi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The identity brokering part of the Suomi.fi service is contracted by the Digital and Population Data Services Agency from third-parties, and subject to the public procurement process. This was first done in 2017, again in 2018, and most recently in December 2020. This streamlines the system management significantly and enables cost savings. Like most major government service procurement contracts, the contract is put to tender at regular intervals. Thanks largely to the tightly specified Finnish Trust Network requirements, this part of the service can be defined so precisely that the only criterion for selection is the lowest price. The next procurement round has been announced for Autumn 2023.</p>
 How do Suomi.fi e-Authorizations work? 
<p>Using the authentication services provided by Suomi.fi e-Identification, Suomi.fi e-Authorizations provides the powerful ability to allow one party to act on another party’s behalf. This removes the need for paper-based power of attorneys or letters of consent!</p>
<p>Suomi.fi e-Authorizations provides very high-level authorisation using the concept of <a href="https://www.suomi.fi/e-authorizations/mandate-themes">mandate themes</a>. For example, the theme “Representation at the General Meeting” gives another person your rights at shareholder meetings.</p>
  
<p>The scope of the authorisation can be further tightened using the ID of the company in question. In this example, Jane Doe can represent someone at the General Meetings for company ID 123456-7 only:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even non-Finnish individuals and organisations can use the electronic authorisation service, thanks to a Finnish Authenticator app launched in 2020.</p>
<p>The system gives clear information on what mandates have been given or received and how long they are valid for. It’s also easy to change or revoke a mandate.</p>
 Limitations of the e-Authorizations service 
<p>One limitation is that for mandates requested from or given to individuals, you need to know the social security number of the assignor. Some people may be reluctant to provide this for fear of misuse.</p>
<p>Further, the mandate themes approach gives an all-or-nothing approach to access within the defined theme. For example, the use of Suomi.fi by all Finnish pharmacies. For the theme “Use of pharmacy services”, the assignee of the mandate can carry out a wide range of activities:</p>
 
 pick up medication from the pharmacy on behalf of the assignor 
 request that the assignor’s prescription is renewed by the pharmacy 
 request the pharmacy to check the benefit data related to the assignor’s prescriptions and medicines and to give information on them to the assignee 
 give their consent for the invalidation of the assignor’s prescription at the pharmacy 
 ask for a summary of the assignor’s prescriptions 
 
<p>Rather than only being able to grant authorisation to complete one of these tasks, the mandate themes approach grants authorisation for all tasks in one go. Therefore, in this example, you can’t allow someone to only pick up a specific prescription medicine on your behalf. If you give them this mandate theme, they can pick up any medicine and even get access to a summary of all of your prescriptions.</p>
<p>The scope of some types of mandates can be limited by using a specifier – for example, entry of a property ID may be used to limit the mandate to a certain property, or entering a company ID to limit a mandate to matters related to a certain company (as seen earlier).</p>
<p>For use cases where permission to do something on another’s behalf needs to be limited beyond the standard capabilities of the system, for example access to specific documents or projects, additional access right management systems are required. Ubisecure provides software solutions that allow Suomi.fi to provide federated user authentication and can be integrated with Suomi.fi e-Authorizations for coarse-grain access control. On top of this, fine-grained access control can then be managed within the Ubisecure Identity and Access Management platform. This is available as an on-premises deployment, as a managed software-as-a-service solution or a hybrid cloud/on-premises approach. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/demo/" title="Get in touch for a demo">Get in touch for a demo</a>.</p>
 What’s next for Suomi.fi? 
<p>Suomi.fi e-Identification and e-Authorizations are the backbone of eGovernment services in Finland. They have built on the success of prior services in a comprehensive, easy-to-use, and well documented shared service. Its success is no doubt also due to the funding model – individual government services and departments can use the platform without charge, and the Ministry of Finance funds the service for the public good.</p>
<p>Suomi.fi e-Authorizations is under constant, active development – including additional reporting, improved usability and finer-grain administrative user rights controls. The <a href="https://dvv.fi/documents/16079645/20878327/Suomi.fi+julkiset+tiekartat+06-2023.pdf/d8e513ec-1c97-a7c9-9959-1ae2ca486f71/Suomi.fi+julkiset+tiekartat+06-2023.pdf?t=1687435081595">public roadmap</a> shows themes such as continued development for stability, reliability, availability and usability, making it easier for foreigners to do business in Finland, and exploring opportunities and coordination with the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/european-digital-identity-framework/" title="European identity wallet">European identity wallet</a>, looking at the integration of foreign trade registers. Another big focus is on investigating the handling of complex cases around authorisation involved in legal guardianship and lasting power of attorneys.</p>
<p>You can follow the growth and development of Suomi.fi via monthly updates provided by the team at the Digital and Population Services Agency (DVV), which is available (in Finnish) at <a href="https://dvv.fi/suomi.fi-infot">https://dvv.fi/suomi.fi-infot</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also positive to see third-party, commercial, non-governmental organisations starting to streamline their processes by adopting the central Suomi.fi service. For example, business management software for entrepreneurs that perform tax reporting and declarations on behalf of small-business owners; or shareholder registry and management platforms that allow representatives of shareholders to participate in shareholder meetings.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Suomi.fi e-Identification and e-Authorization are integral cornerstones of the Finnish digital society. Without these critical services, online interaction with all levels of government would come to a standstill. The design, both logical and technical, has proven the test of time – it is a reliable and easy to use service with enormous proven benefits for citizens, businesses, and public officials alike.</p>

			 The partnership provides financial institutions with a cutting-edge tokenization platform handling ERC3643-based tokenized securities atop an integrated non-custodial wallet infrastructure to abstract away blockchain complexity while ensuring compliance and security.&nbsp; 
<p>Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, a leading real-world asset tokenization platform, has joined forces with <a href="http://dfns.co">Dfns</a>, the leading multi-party computation (MPC) wallet infrastructure and security firm, to provide a comprehensive tokenization solution for financial institutions. This new collaboration offers Tokeny’s enterprise-grade tokenization platform along with Dfns’ embedded non-custodial wallet infrastructure, enabling institutions to seamlessly issue, manage, and distribute ERC3643-based tokenized assets through a fully compliant suite of tools built for user experience and security.</p>
<p>Tokenization is poised to revolutionize finance, with blockchain networks playing a pivotal role as the shared financial infrastructure to eliminate data reconciliation and enable programmable securities to improve efficiency and asset liquidity. With the projected valuation of tokenized illiquid assets reaching $16 trillion by 2030 by BCG, it is crucial for institutions to embrace innovative solutions that cater to evolving market demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the industry has evolved in recent years, use cases developed have leveraged market proven and audited permissioned token standard ERC3643, ensuring that only eligible investors can transfer digital securities and issuers are always in control. This open-source protocol brings compliance and control on the blockchain. However, the end users, such as issuers, agents, and investors, must adopt wallets to sign their blockchain operations. In some jurisdictions, issuers face some regulatory restrictions when offering wallet solutions to investors to facilitate their user journey.</p>
<p>The bundled Tokeny/Dfns solution brings financial institutions a turnkey platform where the blockchain complexity disappears. Users get automatically generated wallets and perform transactions directly on the GUI or via API integrations. The signatures of these transactions are on the blockchain, the user is in full control of the wallet and the process is similar to any web banking experience. By incorporating this solution into their operations, institutions can enhance operating efficiency and deliver innovative features to their customers without needing to face any blockchain complexity.</p>
<p>Key features of the Tokeny/Dfns solution include:</p>
 
 An intuitive dashboard and powerful APIs allows users to navigate and manage tokenization projects effortlessly using ERC3643 standard. The solution streamlines the entire process, from issuance to lifecycle management, and provides all the required white-labeled tools for tokenization projects, including investor onboarding tools, permissions management tools, an investor portal, a marketplace, and secondary market solutions. 
 The platform is multi-chain, multi-assets, and multi-jurisdiction.&nbsp; 
 The ERC3643-based permissioned tokens incorporate compliance rules relying on on-chain identities to guarantee the ownership, which enables recovery functions, support for multiple wallets per investor, and more. 
 A comprehensive dashboard provides the ability to track on-chain ownership and establish comprehensive cap tables that include investor data, aggregating on-chain identity addresses and off-chain relevant data relating to the identity.&nbsp; 
 Unique programmability and granularity of actions due to the exposure of permissions, controls and policies at the API-level which enables automations and complex multi-step flows involving several approvers/stakeholders and other decision-making variables. 
 The dashboard and API have embedded MPC wallets, enhancing the decentralization of the keys, reducing the surface of trust, and enabling cryptographic controls over asset movements by the custodian and/or final owners. 
 Hardened TEE-based security measures and ensured compliance with all regulations can be guaranteed due to Dfns’s mastery of secure enclaves and composable key deployment schemes across multiple clouds, HSMs and availability regions. 
 Non-custodial MPC wallet infrastructures provide financial institutions, who are bound by local regulations, with the opportunity to promote their services internationally, expanding their reach to include investors from other countries. 
 Streamlined pricing model offers scalability and cost efficiency, providing financial institutions with a competitive advantage. 
 

		 
	 
    This collaboration is a game changer because tokenized securities are now manageable with a great user experience, combined with the security and automation needed by large financial players. It makes it simple for institutions to harness cutting-edge technology to improve their operations and offer tokenized capabilities to their clients. As barriers to entry are lowered and compliance features meet institutional standards, we'll experience the full benefits of this transformative technology. Tokenization is not the future of finance anymore, it’s happening today.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny       Dfns’ unique MPC implementation powers Tokeny’s platform with issuer wallets and enables issuers to generate wallets for their investors as well. This partnership enhances the UX for investors who do not need to interact with any private key and related blockchain complexity. One should think of it as an Apple-Pay-like experience for investors who want to access their tokenized securities instantly. It also enables end-to-end automations where the issuer can determine the compliance workflows they need. We are very excited about this new offer and wish to push out new features together in the coming months.  Clarisse HagègeCEO of DFNS

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, everyone. You will remember Elizabeth Garber, who was one of the lead editors of the GAIN paper. We interviewed her in episode 52, late in 2021. Elizabeth has a long background in customer strategy and product management. She has also led the Open Digital Trust Initiative at the Institute of International Finance, and she co-chairs the OpenID Foundation’s GAIN technical proof-of-concept.</p>
<p>Since we last interviewed her, she co-founded IDPartner, a venture backed Start-Up that puts people in control of their digital identities. This will be a key player in any global assure identity network, as interoperable networks are beginning to flourish.</p>
<p>We have a second guest. Our second guest today is Mark Haine. He is an engineer and entrepreneur who has focussed his career on building solutions that enable business and mitigate the risk in financial services through Considrd.Consulting Ltd. Mark and his team are providing strategic security consultancy to a range of clients. He has also taken on a leadership role on the OpenID Foundation as co-chair of the eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group and is co-author of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance Specification. Mark also is a board member of the Open Identity Exchange.</p>
<p>Elizabeth and Mark recently published a draft paper for the OpenID Foundation called Human-Centric Identity: a primer for government officials, which is all about how to design identity systems to sustain and promote human rights. As we speak, it’s open for public comment. You can find it on the OpenID Foundation website – <a href="https://openid.net/">openid.net</a>. So, let’s get started.</p>
<p>Hello, Elizabeth. Hello, Mark.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Garber: Hi.</p>
<p>Mark Haine: Hi.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s very nice having you. Welcome back, Elizabeth, and welcome for the first time Mark. So, we’ll hear more about GAIN, this initiative that was launched a bit less than two years ago. And we really want to hear the news about that. But to get started, we always want to hear about our guests.</p>
<p>So, for all of you, please tell us about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Okay, I’ll go first. For me, the journey really started in identity when I was working at a bank. We had introduced a new vendor into our identity and access management program. I won’t say who because it didn’t really go very well at first. But I was brought in as kind of fresh eyes to lead a root cause analysis exercise and make some quick changes and fixes. And that led to two things.</p>
<p>First, I ended up taking a digital products role on that team and having more and more to do with identity. And second, I was absolutely hooked on the industry. So, there were just so many interconnected challenges and opportunities. The stakes were really, really high. So, I started to form partnerships outside the bank, and most notably with the person who would become my good friend and my Start-Up co-founder Rod Boothby. So, he brought me into the Open Digital Trust Initiative with all the world’s leading banks, the IRS, and also the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>And that, of course, led to the GAIN paper where I quickly raised my hand to help out and Mark my colleague here and the other co-editors. I then still co-chair the proof-of-concept along with Mark and authored the follow up paper, which will be out by the time this podcast airs, I think.</p>
<p>Mark and I then wrote the paper you just referenced, which is addressing how government identity systems can sustain and promote human rights. All of those papers can be found on the OpenID website, by the way, openid.net.</p>
<p>Since we last talked, I co-founded my company IDPartner, which is really in the spirit of GAIN and is seeking to help banks and other parties connect into such a global network. So yeah, I’m still relatively new to this industry of being a few years in now, but it’s pretty much consumed the majority of my waking moments for the last three to four years.</p>
<p>Mark: So, we’re in some ways similar to Elizabeth, but in other ways slightly different. My background is also from financial services. I have had a number of operational roles and then design and architecture roles in primarily UK banks. I’ve had a rich array of roles. I’m taking on some really interesting challenges along the way. It started out with operational I.T., moved into networks and security design and after some time and lots of rich experiences.</p>
<p>I ended up in the Identity and Access Management team at a large UK bank having done a bunch of work on future architectures for that organisation and innovation team. And around that time the UK was starting to move towards open banking. I managed to switch over to become a core member of the Open Banking UK implementation Entity Security Team, where I was involved in designing various aspects of the open banking architecture and the protocols involved. And that led me to interact with a bunch of people from the OpenID Foundation, who recruited me to come and help on the open standards side of things more actively, after I moved on from open banking to do other things.</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve been working on new draft specifications, and writing a number of white papers, including the GAIN white paper and the one that Elizabeth and I have been working on together about human rights in the context of government digital identity. And here we are today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Thanks both of you for sharing your story. Before starting to hear the newer things that happened for GAIN, I hope you can give us an overview. So, what is the Global Assure Identity Network?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Well, so back in 2021 when we last spoke, GAIN was just a paper. It was – we used to say it was no logos and pro-bono. It was 156 individuals, identity and industry experts who signed as individuals because it contained so much that they could all agree on. And primarily that was that we wanted to build a globally interoperable network for high assurance identity.</p>
<p>We wanted to connect the islands of trust that exist out there today, the different ecosystems where you can be trusted. And we want to create new ones and connect those too. We want to make it possible for somebody in the US, like me to transact with somebody in Finland confident that you could trust who it was on the other end of that digital session.</p>
<p>And we wanted to do that in a really – privacy preserving way. So, no new databases being introduced of PII, full customer consent for sharing and really the minimal amount of information required. All of that was the stuff that the original authors could agree on. At the time we wrote it addressing financial institutions. We didn’t think any such network were going to be inclusively or exclusively led by banks.</p>
<p>But we did argue the banks were really well-placed to catalyse such a movement as they had done in Sweden, Norway and other places. And also, open banking was a growing enabler and there were lots of benefits to them, their customers and others. If they took a lead and did so with a sense of urgency. What we have seen in the intervening years though, is that while that’s still true and still would be a great catalyst, but other corners of the market are moving very, very quickly. We’re having broader conversations now in relation to GAIN, including with the European Union and those designing mobile driver’s licenses.</p>
<p>It’s all interconnected with standards development and has a really big impact on how identity systems will work, interoperable, in years to come. Sorry, that was a summary and a movement into the present day.</p>
<p>Mark: There was a couple of things I would raise from the original paper, that holds true today as well, I think. And those are that we felt back in 2021 that there wasn’t a need for any particularly new or ground-breaking technology to enable this. And probably the most critical thing to allow such a scheme or system to emerge was a way for the three key classes of entity involved, all to find benefits from the services provided.</p>
<p>So, the identity provider, the relying party and the end user, who is subject to all of us, all needed to have their own benefits arising from this for such a thing to become viable. And I think that was something that really hadn’t been voiced quite so directly before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, well, no surprise of course. From a paper to the implementation for a proof-of-concept that nowadays you, and some of your allies, are working on. So, I think it’s time to hear more deeply, what are the main updates in advancement that GAIN has had since then?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Okay, so after we launched the paper, we had five organisations initially, who had signed a MOU, a memorandum of understanding. It was legally not binding, but it meant that they would loosely collaborate and align efforts to further the GAIN vision of interoperability. So, I share those organisations now and you can go learn more about what they’re doing in the space. So that’s the OpenID Foundation, the Open Identity Exchange, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), the Cloud Signature Consortium, the Institute for International Finance. And since then, we’ve had one more organisation formally sign up, and that’s the Secure Identity Alliance.</p>
<p>Each of those organisations does work that’s relevant to GAIN and feeds, whether it’s standards or requirements maybe from the financial sector. They feed into the work that is done at the moment through two major communities that we should drill into what both of these communities have been doing. So, we have the technical proof-of-concept of the OpenID Foundation, which is where Mark and I co-chair a community group, and we really have built a prototype that interconnects multiple trust networks.</p>
<p>And then there’s the policy work at the Open Identity Exchange, OIX. It’s called the Global Interoperability Working Group, and they’re really looking at more of a semantic interoperability; how two different policies interact, how do the policies in one trust framework translate into another and what enables that. Mark, do you want to give an update on the technical proof-of-concept that we’ve been running?</p>
<p>Mark: Yeah. So, to GAIN proof-of-concept within the community group in the OpenID Foundation, has been taking a number of steps to dispel any suggestion that this stuff can’t be done with the technology we have today. One could argue not terribly ground-breaking work because it’s showing that stuff can be done using existing protocols. But at the same time, we’ve been doing it in a way which demonstrates quite significant Cross Domain Examples.</p>
<p>So, our first little proof-of-concept was simply allowing existing identity providers from multiple different countries to provide digital identity data to a relying party. And it was existing trust networks of various different types. It wasn’t terribly complex. In some ways. That’s kind of the beauty of it. A relatively simple OpenID Connect implementation with a relatively simple layering of eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group specs as well on top, to allow us to be explicit about the assurance level for the individual.</p>
<p>We’ve then moved on from that Federation example to addressing the question of trust between the entities involved. So, allowing the identity provider and the relying party to be more confident in each other, that they are dealing with an entity that is another member of the network. And the big realisation we had when we were doing that was that we shouldn’t try and have every party register to a GAIN instance. There’s plenty of identity networks out there already and we shouldn’t expect their members to have to reregister for something else. That’s not a terribly scalable way at a global level. So, our decision at that point was to build an instance of a network of networks so that we could keep the implementation impact as low as possible for each member and at the same time enable that global reach.</p>
<p>So, we did some work using a protocol called OpenID Federation to allow communication of trust to some of the technical details like; how to verify cryptographic keys across networks. And we ended up building a really nice little demo whereby the end user arrives in a Japanese airport and is able to present their identity from a German network to the local telephony company, so that they could then pick up a new eSIM as they entered the country. It sounds simple. There were a few challenges along the way, but we managed to overcome them and have a little demo which we could share at some point with any interested party.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: So, the two main concepts that we’ve been testing there have been – we often break it down as the data plan in the control plan. So, the first piece that Mark was talking about where we tested the OpenID Connect for identity assurance standard, that’s how does the data move between one party to another. And then the second, which we spent a lot more time on, was the control plane, how do we enable one party in one network to trust another party in another? So how does a relying party in Japan trust an identity provider in Germany? And that’s where OpenID Federation came in, as a really scalable way of delivering that kind of trust.</p>
<p>Mark: Yes, it avoids having to build direct 1 to 1 relationship between every entity, which clearly on an international level, it’s not going to be possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: How many countries have you – mentioned two countries in this example – but how many countries so far have you managed to connect?</p>
<p>Mark: We’ve got members from quite a range of countries, actually. Our initial proof-of-concept involved contributors from UK, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, USA and Japan. I think there may have been more. My memory isn’t the best on these things. And then the second one, again, we had Italy, Japan, UK, Germany, the US. Any others Elizabeth?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Not off the top of my head. But what I think is really cool about the prototype that we have operating right now is that you’ve got three different trust networks, in three different countries, in I guess four different verticals operating. So, we have the German bank based, yes.com Federation. Then you have that connected, both at a data level and a control level, to an open banking system in Japan and the relying party is in telecommunications. And then you have all of that connected, both at a data level and a controlled trust level, all that connected to what is essentially an Italian government implementation. So, we’ve got lots of different types of systems, different types of architecture.</p>
<p>And in that early prototype that we did it with just the data passage, was that we interconnected with wallet-based ecosystems as well there, and we’re looking to bring that back into this larger multilayer proof-of-concept that we have going on right now. So that’s our next stage. But that’s a preview.</p>
<p>I want to make sure we don’t move on before we talk about the work that OIX is doing. Their emphasis has been on mapping different policy frameworks. They looked at how well policies relate to one another and how bilateral agreements can enable one trust framework to trust another, and then ultimately landing on the idea that bilateral agreements are not actually scalable the world over. And so, what they’re looking at now is something that Nick is calling, this as Nick Mothershaw, a ‘smart wallet’. So how can an agent or something –</p>
<p>Mark: Global Interoperability Working Group has been focusing in a couple of areas. One has been to discuss how we might communicate assurance levels between different jurisdictions. One of the challenges we have is that there are different standards for identity assurance in different countries. And as part of that, there’s been a bunch of analysis work going on in partnership with the Fraunhofer Institute to do a comparative review of the different assurance standards and see whether they’re readily mapped or not.</p>
<p>And there will be a report coming out from the Open Identity Exchange in the space sometime in the next few months. Then net-net is that it’s unfortunately not terribly easy to do a mapping and there may be a need to take it to a lower level and map the underlying data points to each other rather than to map to the abstract assurance level.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: So, they’re looking at, how can an agent work on behalf of a user to help translate those policies from one framework to another. To how can an agent or a wallet understand what credentials are inside it that meet the needs presented by a verifier? And does a new credential need to actually be issued? They’re looking at how can we know what wallets can be trusted in an ecosystem? How can it dynamically understand what policy requirements need to be met, what credentials qualify? Is there a common format that can be agreed upon for these policy decisions? And all this is underway at OIX.</p>
<p>Mark: In terms of analysis there as well. They’re looking at the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework, the European digital identity eIDAS assurance levels, the US NIST standards in the space and at the trust framework that exists in Canada and Sweden are on the list as well. Although I don’t think all of the analysis is in. So, a fairly broad reaching comparative review of assurance levels and the new policy framework around them.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds definitely, definitely really good. I haven’t heard of this. I want to hear more information about this.</p>
<p>Mark: The best way to find out more about this analysis would be to join an OpenID Exchange and come and attend something that, some of the working group calls that happen. The report I don’t know whether it’s going to be publicly available or a ‘members of’ report at this stage. There might be a summary report available for non-members. So that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. If you see as a retrospective have there been any main challenges or barriers that you had to overcome in this nearly two years?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I would say one of the biggest challenges is really an exciting one, is how quickly the market moves. When you’re talking about global interoperability, you’re talking any kind of shift around the world has an impact on the interoperability aspect. So, I think we do a really good job as a group, both at the technical proof-of-concept level of the Open Identity Exchange and as the GAIN six non-profit, we do a really good job keeping connected to a lot of those moving pieces around the world.</p>
<p>Proud to say that we have close relationships both inside Europe and the European Union, those leading mobile driver’s license efforts, or I should say, North American mobile driver’s license efforts. You know, sometimes this stuff means that actually new concepts, new standards are embraced. And we need to make sure that our prototypes move and shift to ensure that we’re still keeping up to date with the standards that are being embraced and matured by regulations and others around the world.</p>
<p>This is a really exciting problem to have to see things develop and mature. I guess the connected challenge to that is just making sure that we’re aware of all of that’s going on. We recently got in touch with a group working out of the UN on a similar challenge of; how do you enable one entity to build trust with an entity in a different trust network. And they’re really, you know, we’re all working on similar things and exploring. Once we know; what have been your lessons learned, what have been ours and cross-pollinated ideas about how we can achieve these things together and maybe work together. So yeah, a big challenge is knowing what is going on everywhere.</p>
<p>Mark: Yeah, I completely agree Elizabeth Yeah, I completely agree Elizabeth. A couple of other names to drop as well, I know that the OpenID Foundation has been working quite hard to establish and develop relationships in various parts of the world. And I would say the engagement with the European digital identity project has been really good. We had some nice sessions in Berlin around the European identity conference earlier this year. The engagement with the NIST guys in the US around what they’re doing, and their update to their digital identity guidelines has been really positive.</p>
<p>Gail Hodges, Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation has also been reaching out quite successfully into a project called ID for Africa, and trying to bridge that global north, the global south part of the problem space. And I would also say that interoperability, I think, is probably one of the biggest challenges that spans across technology, data and policy. And it’s really good to see the OECD call that out explicitly in their drafts digital identity guidelines that are open for review at the moment and coming out, I think later this year, now.</p>
<p>There’s an awful lot happening in this space. It’s really dynamic. And echoing Elizabeth’s point, the biggest challenge is keeping up with all of the activity that’s going on.</p>
<p>One thing I would say that we’ve been doing in our GAIN groups, has been to try and make sure that we’re relevant to all sorts of different technical architectures. So, this is something that can interoperate across technology difference, at least. Ultimately, the technology should be there to serve the people of various sorts, you know, people who represent organisations and the people who are trying to access services. So, a particular protocol should not necessarily the boundary for interoperability.</p>
<p>To that end, although our first couple of proof of concepts have been OpenID Connect focused. The one we’re working on now is to extend that proof-of-concepts to delve more into the W3C quality-based architecture. We’re doing that in part with people involved in the European digital identity wallet, as well. So, there’s a lot going on. And I think, a lot of real dynamism and action in the marketplace at the moment as well.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: And the more we do in this proof-of-concept is – the more that we do to really test the specifications of these standards, the more we learn, and the more those standards mature. So really benefits from having a lot of participation. Because the both the Federation spec and the IDA spec, I think have been improved as a result of people trying to build it coming together trying to align it, make sure that both parties understand the same things that are using the same configurations. It just, it makes all the specifications better and more mature.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, excellent. You mentioned already a few examples, but if you have any other success stories in particular that you would like to tell us more.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I think our big success story is the one that we raised connecting the German banking network, a Japanese banking network with coms roaming and Federation’s run by the Italian government, both at the data level and the trust level. Can I trust the relying party and an IDP in two different networks? The big proof of GAIN, there’s always going to come when private companies or other entities actually bring it out there into the public domain, and people are actively using it to create their eSIM in another country. And I think that’s the next big hurdle is to see something out there in the wild. And I’m hopeful that you’re going to hear some more about that in the coming year.</p>
<p>Mark: Yeah, likewise. I mean, ultimately what we’re driving towards is something that gets implemented. But I do think that the debates that the white paper originally provoked and the groups that have been acting, following on from that have surfaced a few difficulties along the way. And these were difficulties that needed to be surfaced in order that a solution could be built.</p>
<p>I’m not yet certain that all of the challenges have been addressed fully. In fact, I’m fairly certain they haven’t all been addressed fully yet. But we’re working through them as they emerge and prioritising our efforts as best the way we can. I would say a lot of this work is being done either by companies who are contributing their staff’s time to working groups or even individuals contributing their time to these working groups.</p>
<p>So, you know, if anybody out there thinks that they may have the ability to devote some time or even some implementation efforts, that would be, I think, a valuable thing to do, either whether that’s in the policy domain or the data domain with the Open Identity Exchange or in the technical protocol domain with the OpenID Foundation. The only way these things are moved forward is by people contributing the time.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, they need more contributors, absolutely.</p>
<p>Mark: Just to drive one particular point home. In particular, at the moment, the OpenID Foundation, GAIN POC community group is looking for digital wallet implementers, particularly at the moment, and secondarily, issuers of digital identity credentials as well verifiable credentials. So, if anybody listening to the podcast is willing, able and has some expertise in that area, they would be very, very welcome. Indeed.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Yeah, based on your observations when I asked you the hurdles, or what you find on your way – you find a lot of things moving on projects that have similar goals, let’s say. But now looking at the future, what is coming in the near future, if you focus on the near future. So, what would be the main potential future developments that you think is going to happen in the next, let’s say, one or two years?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I would say three things.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials, as Mark was just saying, we need to be interoperating, with wallet-based ecosystems. And our technical proof-of-concept in the short term, in the next few months, needs to be extended to incorporate those issuers and those wallet providers.</p>
<p>I think the OIX work on smart interoperability that takes us beyond the next few months, but into you know, the next year or so I think that that work will take shape a bit more. And we will hear more about how interoperability can be enabled, semantically through such systems. I think that work is really, really exciting.</p>
<p>And then the next thing I think you’re going to start to see is more commercial implementations of this use case, of cross border, high trust identity.</p>
<p>Mark: Clearly, the European digital identity project is going to march forward dramatically over the next couple of years as well. And I think that will produce a number of successes and identify a number of challenges along the journey as well. At the moment, the topic of international interoperability is a really interesting one to me. And I think the European Union has certainly within its power, the ability to solve that between the member states. But I think there will be challenges to do with interoperability to other nations.</p>
<p>I also think that there will be quite an interesting series of events around who wins in terms of wallet provider. Clearly, the big tech have wallets already embedded into a lot of consumer devices. But it’s going to be interesting to see how that plays out. Particularly in the context of the European Union project, as they have quite a different perspective on how a wallet should be governed more than anything else. So that’s going to be a really interesting thing to watch over the next couple of years, and I’m sure will produce some great and informative outcomes. It’s an extremely interesting experiment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s sounds great.</p>
<p>Mark: And I think some of the members of our groups are active in that space as well. And indeed, the OpenID Foundation has been contributing quite strongly to that project with a couple of the key protocols in and out of the wallet being selected for the first round of proof-of-concept work in the European digital identity programme. And there’s definitely conversations going on around trust of issuers and wallets. In the context of the OpenID Federation spec as well. I know that some of the Italian contingent are quite keen to promote the use of that protocol in the European digital identity wallet space for organisation-to-organisation trust effectively.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So final question for both of you. So, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Mark: I’m going to say that they should be considering how they integrate reusable digital identity into their business processes at some point in the future. A lot of what has been done before has been very organisationally with focussed and very transactional. So, us poor end users have to go through identity verification processes quite frequently. And I think going forward it would be better for end users and better for organisations to be able to reuse those assured identities.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: I totally agree. So, I’ll take a different angle on the question. I would address, rather than business leaders, namely standards bodies, regulators and yes, potential ID providers, including government providers, even banks. There’s a lot going on in this industry as we’ve talked about so many exciting movements forward. So many standards reaching points of maturity. And we’re really, really excited by the developments that we’ve seen over the last few years. As we put in our paper that we’ve written for government officials, no single solution or standard or architecture is going to be a panacea.</p>
<p>No one thing is going to solve all the world’s problems. So, we would all really benefit from, if not slowing down, then at least taking the time to speak to each other. Make sure that we understand how we’re going to establish multi-party trust, checks and balances in the systems, mitigate the risks of fraud while protecting privacy. I would love to see more, even more open, transparent communications, public private partnerships forming in this space. So that’s what I’d put on your agenda.</p>
<p>Oscar: Both sounds very good. Well, I’m very happy to have had this conversation with you and hear this very good news, the progress that GAIN and all the partners have had. So, congratulations and well done for you, Elizabeth, Mark and everybody has been involved and is involved.</p>
<p>So, a final piece, just let us know how people can find more information about this project or get in touch with any of you.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah. So, I think the fastest way is probably – there is the OIX Global Interoperability Working Group. The fastest way might be the <a href="https://openid.net/">openid.net</a>, there’s a GAIN, community group there. Either way that will get you to where you need to be. You can also obviously reach out to Mark and myself. We are available on LinkedIn. So yeah, please get in touch.</p>
<p>Mark: Let me just reiterate then <a href="https://openid.net/">openid.net</a> and there’s a search box there. Please put in GAIN. You’ll find a number of items there that may be informative.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Again, it was a pleasure talking with both of you, Elizabeth and Mark and all the best.</p>
<p>Mark: Thanks Oscar.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Thank you.</p>

			 Can’t Beat Tokeny’s Team Retreat 
<p>Happy July from the entire Tokeny team! We hope you are enjoying your summer or winter wherever you are in the world.</p>
<p>Can you believe we are already past the halfway point of the year?! Time flies when you are having fun and we at Tokeny know a thing or two about having fun… well if you call the growth and success of our team fun then yes, a ton of fun over here.</p>
<p>We know how much you love discussing tokenization topics each month, but we figured it’s equally as important for our readers to get to know us a bit more on a personal level.</p>
<p>Just as blockchain thrives on a decentralized network, we believe that our team’s dispersed nature isn’t a hindrance but a strength that enables us to tap into global talent and diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>In fact, the Tokeny team covers 20 nationalities, which allows us to ideate and analyze from a myriad of perspectives on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Indeed, while a decentralized workforce offers various benefits, it can sometimes inhibit the natural human connection that typically thrives in in-person settings. Recognizing this, we decided to arrange a gathering for all our team members over the past two years.</p>
<p>Specifically, we gathered in Sitges, a charming beach town near Barcelona, known for its beautiful beaches, stunning sights, and lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>You could feel the positive, anticipatory energy in the air on the first day as everyone arrived, for the veterans to reconnect and for the newcomers who haven’t met everyone in person yet, the stage was set for an incredible trip.</p>
<p>For the next 3 days, we came together for an incredible journey that was all about rejoicing, rejuvenation, and reigniting our team spirit.</p>
<p>We all joined together for team dinners, water competitions, and of course, we made some time to be productive and get work done face-to-face, which was nice for a change.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Final Thoughts 
<p>The excitement we had in seeing each other was truly remarkable. As our company grows in stature, so do we grow in numbers. We could all feel the communal sense that we know our company and products are very unique, and as we continue to push forward, we will achieve our goals and overcome any obstacles in our way.</p>
<p>Spending a short, yet packed three days with the Tokeny family was a real pleasure. The bonds and camaraderie among us have grown significantly, and this will surely reflect in the work we produce.</p>
<p>Also, a special thank you to Ivie Satijn, Denisa Kutschera and Radka Tocikova for their incredible work in preparing this event, it’s never easy to plan an event for dozens of people from all over the world. Finally, thank you to our customers and partners for the trust you put in our team.</p>
<p>See you next month where we will be back to our regularly scheduled programming!</p>

<p>It's no secret that more organizations around the world are undergoing some form of digital transformation. In turn, finding an identity and access management (IAM) solution that measures up to today’s open identity standards is a key part of this process. This means locating a resilient IAM solution that fits your current infrastructure while also being flexible enough to pivot with your digital transformation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the need for the right IAM solution is clear, that doesn’t necessarily change your company’s current situation. What about where you are right now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter the size and scope of your organization, a digital transformation doesn’t happen overnight. It could be the case you are apprehensive about deploying a brand-new IAM solution while in the midst of a digital transformation or cloud migration. Or, perhaps you still rely on on-premise systems and need to find a flexible IAM deployment option to account for your legacy network.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
With the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/solutions.html">PingOne Cloud platform</a>, you can take advantage of flexible IAM deployment options that work in any environment, including on-prem, cloud-native, cloud-based, and hybrid.</p>

<p>There's a new way to organize and store files online and in distributed systems. Here, we dive into what content addressing is, how it works, and some of its benefits and challenges.</p> What is Content Addressing? <p>Location-based addressing, what we're all used to, uses soft links (URLs) to point to where the file is located. </p><p>Content addressing, on the other hand, uses cryptographic hashing to generate a unique identifier (CID) from the data that describe itself. The CID acts as a hard link that points to a specific version of a file. </p><p>Say your friend recommends a book to you. They tell you the book is in the local library in the third row on the right, fifth bookcase, second shelf, third book from the left. So you follow their directions, hoping to find the book. The book might be there, or another book might have replaced it. On the other hand, if your friend gave you the ISBN, you could use that to find the correct book. The first example is how location addressing works today, and the second is how content addressing works. </p> How Content Addressing Works <p>Let's dive a bit deeper. </p><p>The first step is to generate a content identifier. As previously mentioned, CIDs are hashes. To generate a hash for a piece of data, we use a hash function. </p><p>Hash functions take an input (for example, a file in binary format) and produce a fixed-size string of characters, typically a sequence of numbers and letters. The output is called the "hash value" or "hash code.</p><p>Next, we want to associate the content identifier with the content. This involves choosing a storage medium and linking the content identifier to the stored content. If we choose to store a file on IPFS, for example, there are four steps: </p>  Chunking: IPFS breaks down the file into smaller fixed-size chunks.  Content Addressing: IPFS calculates the cryptographic hash of each chunk using a secure hash function. This hash value uniquely represents the content of that specific chunk.  MerkleDag: IPFS constructs a MerkleDag that organizes the chunks and their relationships. Each chunk is represented as a node in the graph, and the edges between nodes represent the relationships between chunks.  Root CID: The root of the MerkleDag is computed by hashing the hash values of its children and generating a unique hash value. This hash value is the final Content Identifier (CID) for the file.  <p>The final step is retrieving content using the content identifier. This is a 2-step process: 1. Locating the content based on the content identifier 2. Verifying content integrity using the identifier.</p><p>To continue with the IPFS example, you can either connect to IPFS using the CLI or use the Brave browser's IPFS gateway and enter the CID. This will fetch your file. If you want to verify that this particular version of the file is the one you're looking for, you can compare its hash or recalculate it. If they match, it's the same data. IPFS's MerkleDag structure means you can also traverse that to trace back your file. </p><p>CIDs are immutable hard links, so if even one byte of data is altered, a new CID will be generated during the hashing process. This helps ensure content authenticity in a decentralized and trustless environment.</p> Benefits of Content Addressing <p>There are several benefits to using content addressing. As previously mentioned, data cannot be tampered with without it being immediately obvious since any change to a file will generate a new hash for that file. </p><p>This also opens the door to immutable data storage because when we use content-addressed links, we create persistent data structures. This is especially necessary for archives, blockchains, and version control systems. &nbsp;</p><p>Data deduplication is another advantage. With the location-addressed Internet we have today, the same file can be stored an unlimited amount of times because there is nothing to tell the storage system it's redundant. It just creates a new variation of the file name and moves on (EX: File.jpg, File(1).jpg, File(2).jpg, etc.). But with content addressing, if Jack stores a picture of a volcano on IPFS and Jill stores the same file, they will each have the same hash. That file is only stored once. This reduces storage costs by eliminating duplicate content and also improves data retrieval speed in distributed systems.</p><p>There are numerous other benefits, including secure sharing with encrypted hashes, efficient distribution, and more. </p> Challenges of Content Addressing <p>While content addressing makes the links to files immutable, it does not persist the data on the distributed network. If the file is no longer available (deleted or garbage collected), it won't be retrievable using the CID. Therefore, to ensure a file remains accessible, it's important to save it to your own node or pin it using a storage service.</p><p>Discoverability is another challenge. Since CIDs are hashes, they're difficult to remember. Users can link their CIDs to a human-readable name using DNS Link, but it's an extra step.</p> Conclusion <p>In summary, content addressing is helping to fix some of the problems that have formed due to traditional location-based addressing, such as duplicate or unreliable files. It also forms the basis of persistent data structures, enabling immutable storage solutions and version control within file systems (like <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">Fission's WNFS</a>!). </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about content addressing, Protocol Labs' <a href="https://proto.school/content-addressing">ProtoSchool tutorial</a> is clear and easy to understand and acts as a jumping-off point for more detailed technical topics.</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer networks are the foundation of the decentralized web. Today we dive into what P2P networks are, how they differ from the popular client-server model, and the advantages of decentralized file sharing in P2P networks.</p> The Client-Server Model <p>Today the predominant type of distributed application architecture is the client-server model. In this model, the client is the service requestor, and the server is the provider of the resource or service. The client usually doesn't provide any resources to the network. Some well-known examples of the client-server model are network printing, email, and the World Wide Web.</p> What is a Peer-to-Peer Network? <p>A peer-to-peer network, on the other hand, is a distributed application architecture where each participant (peer) acts as a node. All nodes are equal, and all contribute some processing power, bandwidth, or disk space to the network. A node can make requests as well as provide a resource or service. A well-known example of a peer-to-peer network is Napster, a digital audio file-sharing system. </p> Decentralized File Sharing <p>If there is no central intermediary receiving requests and returning resources, how does peer-to-peer file sharing work? In a client-server model, servers host files, and clients download the files from those central servers. In a P2P system, peers request and share files directly. This is commonly done through a DHT or Distributed Hash Table. Information like file names, hashes, and locations are all stored in the DHT. The hashes represent keys and act as unique identifiers that help identify a specific piece of data within the DHT. </p><p>When users want to share a file, they break it down into smaller blocks and distribute those blocks across nodes in the network. Then, when users want to download the file, they query the network with the help of the DHT to find the nodes that have stored these blocks. When they find the nodes, they connect to them directly and download the file. </p> Advantages of Peer-to-Peer Networks <p>The decentralized DHT structure makes P2P networks more scalable, secure, and fault-tolerant. </p><p>Scalable: As the number of network participants and requests increases, so does the ability to handle those requests. </p><p>Secure: The network is less susceptible to malicious attacks because there is no central server hosting the data. </p><p>Fault-Tolerant: Multiple copies of data spread across many nodes in the network means that even if a few nodes go down, there will be others to take on the responsibilities of those fallen nodes and maintain data availability.</p> Peer-to-Peer Networks Today <p>Today, P2P networks are gaining in popularity.</p><p>IPFS, or the InterPlanetary File System, is a peer-to-peer network and hypermedia protocol. When a file is stored on the network, it's split into smaller chunks, hashed, and given a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/content-addressing-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/">CID or content identifier</a>. When users request that file, they use the CID to locate it. Users can store graphics, audio, video, plain text, and hyperlinks on IPFS.</p><p>Blockchains, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, are also P2P networks. They use a distributed ledger to track transactions in a network without a central authority. The blockchain is tamper-proof and immutable, with many use cases - from storing ownership records to distributing cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>In conclusion, peer-to-peer networks are a resilient and decentralized way to share and distribute files, collaborate with other users, and distribute compute power and resources. </p><p>Interested in learning more about the decentralized web?

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 5th July to 17th&nbsp;July <p>Welcome to Veriscope, our biweekly global crypto regulatory update, providing you with the latest news from the world of cryptocurrency regulation. In this edition, we are zeroing in on key regulatory updates that are shaping the global crypto landscape.</p><p>From the US, where a renewed push for the Responsible Financial Innovation Act is on the cards, to South Korea, where virtual asset legislation is evolving. South Africa is also making headlines by requiring crypto exchanges to be licensed, while Singapore’s Monetary Authority aims to enforce stricter rules for Digital Payment Tokens (DPT) providers.</p><p>So, let’s not wait any further and dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Reforms Gain Momentum Amid Market Volatility <p>World Overview&nbsp;🌍</p><p>USA: Crypto regulation takes center stage as US lawmakers Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand gear up to reintroduce the Responsible Financial Innovation Act. Originally brought forward during a crypto market crash in 2022, the act aims to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>South Korea: Meanwhile, South Korea strengthens its grip on virtual asset legislation with the initiation of its second phase. The Financial Services Commission plans to delve into issues related to crypto asset issuance and distribution, building on the foundation of user protection laid by the recently passed “Virtual Asset Protection Act.”</p><p>South Africa: Down south, the South African Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) requires all crypto exchanges to obtain licenses by the end of the year. This mandate marks a significant move in tightening the regulatory reigns within the crypto industry in Africa, with punitive measures planned for non-compliant entities.</p><p>Singapore: On a similar note, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is working on firming up rules for providers handling Digital Payment Tokens (DPT). By the end of the year, MAS plans to ensure customer assets are securely held under statutory trust and intends to curb digital currency lending and staking activities.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into two of these significant developments and analyze their impact on the broader ecosystem.</p> Reviving a Regulatory Initiative: A Significant Shift or Innovation Stifle for the US&nbsp;Market? <p>A renewed push for the Responsible Financial Innovation Act has been initiated by Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand. The aim? To offer a clear regulatory roadmap for digital assets, casting a bipartisan light on a topic that has often been cloaked in uncertainty.</p><p>First introduced in 2022 amid a crypto market downturn, the Act’s resurrection is set against a backdrop of renewed demand for clarity and&nbsp;control.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1680321593178832898?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>One of the main features is the proposed alterations to the US tax code, which would empower the industry to fund its own oversight. In practical terms, this means that the costs associated with regulation, audit, and security would be borne by the digital asset&nbsp;firms.</p><p>As part of its comprehensive approach, the proposed regulation also includes measures to preclude events like the FTX crisis, putting consumer protection at the forefront to address existing apprehensions regarding digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The draft calls for the regulation of stablecoins, a direct response to the TerraUSD (UST) crash that sent ripples through the crypto industry. It also proposes that only depository institutions issue stablecoins, which, while providing an extra layer of security, could potentially stifle innovation.</p><p>It also demands that crypto exchanges must register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p> Potential Implications <p>On the bright side, the clarity provided by the Act could potentially attract mainstream and institutional investors, fostering trust in regulated exchanges. Also, the proposed customer protection measures that the Act proposes could minimize fraud and market manipulation, thereby creating a safer investment climate.</p><p>Despite several upsides, there are more than a few downsides as well. For instance, over-regulation could suppress innovation, given that the decentralized nature of crypto is its lifeline. Moreover, permitting only depository institutions to issue stablecoins could result in power concentration, straying from crypto’s core principle of decentralization.</p><p>In essence, the reintroduction of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act is a signal of crypto’s growing legitimacy. As the Act undergoes legislative scrutiny, the crypto industry watches in anticipation.</p><p>The balance between innovation and regulation is a delicate one. The outcome will have significant implications for the future trajectory of the crypto industry.</p> South Africa Rush for Licenses: Crypto Exchanges Dodging the FSCA Crack&nbsp;Down <p>South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has drawn the line: crypto exchanges must obtain a license by the end of the year or face penalties.</p><p>This clear mandate by Commissioner Unathi Kamlana is backed by approximately 20 applications already on the table and the anticipation of more as the November 30 deadline approaches.</p><p>As observed in many other countries, the reasoning behind this decisive step is to shield consumers from potential financial risks inherent in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>And no matter the size of operations, all exchanges serving South Africans will have to comply. While the directive is stern, Commissioner Kamlana assures a period of time will be dedicated to examining the outcome of these measures.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-regulations-in-the-united-kingdom-a-comprehensive-analysis">Crypto Regulations in the United Kingdom: A Comprehensive Analysis</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1679929054286454784">How Shyft Veriscope Solves Travel Compliance Woes?</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>With Microsoft Entra ID Governance, you can effectively manage your organization’s security and identity governance needs and boost employee productivity by implementing appropriate processes and enhancing visibility. The Microsoft Entra platform empowers you with the ability to guarantee that the right people have the right access to the right resources.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce the general availability of a set of capabilities in Entitlement Management available through Microsoft Entra ID Governance to help you strengthen your identity governance posture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Extending the access lifecycle with your organization-specific processes and business logic&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/run-custom-workflows-in-azure-ad-entitlement-management/ba-p/2466938">announced the public preview of entitlement management custom extensions</a>, allowing you to extend the access lifecycle with your organization-specific processes and business logic when access is requested or about to expire. With it you can create tickets for manual access provisioning in disconnected systems, send custom notifications to additional stakeholders, or automate additional access-related configuration in your business applications such as assigning the correct sales region in Salesforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/whats-new">refreshed the public preview</a> to enable introducing external governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) checks into the entitlement management processes. This preview refreshed enabled you to configure that an extension could pause or stop the access request and surface additional information to approvers users in My Access. Today, I’m happy to announce this capability is now generally available.<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Automate additional compliance checks as part of the access request with custom extensions&nbsp;</p>
<p>You allow your resellers to purchase goods through your reseller purchasing portal. Before someone gets access to the portal, your internal sales organization must approve and ensure that a reseller contract is in place. Until now, an approver in the sales department had to validate the contract in the contract database, what has been a manual and time-consuming process can now be automated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Custom extension creation&nbsp;</p>
<p>You, as an admin, can now make a custom extension available to the sales department which will validate if a reseller contract is in place. During the creation, you can specify that the extension is intended to be used during the access request workflow and that the access request should be paused until a response is received from the corresponding Logic App which will perform the contract validation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br><br>Linking the contract validation to the access package of the reseller portal&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sales department can now extend the policy of the reseller portal access package to perform the contract validation at several stages of the access request process. In this case, the sales department opts for the validation to happen right after the access request is submitted so it’s enriched with the contract status once the request makes it to the sales representative for approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br>Approver empowered with contract status information&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going forward, when the sales representative receives an access request for the purchasing portal, the request details will be enriched with the contract information so they can quickly make a decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: The external process could have stopped the request completely if needed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about embedding your custom processes into entitlement management, see: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-logic-apps-integration">Trigger Logic Apps with custom extensions in entitlement management.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Assigning access automatically to access packages instead of requiring users to request access&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/dynamic-automated-access-with-azure-ad-entitlement-management/ba-p/2466937">announced the public preview of dynamic automated access with entitlement management </a>to automate your processes for access lifecycle management by assigning access to users based on their attributes without the need of access requests or administrative interaction. Today, I’m happy to announce that this capability is now generally available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Automatically assign people to Sales Team access package based on user’s department</p>
<p>You want employees in the Sales department to be automatically assigned to the Sales Team access package which contains sales-related projects’ resources. For that, you add a new auto-assignment policy to the Sales Team access package, that checks if the user is in the internal organization’s Sales department.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this policy, you specify a rule for how entitlement management will select the users who need assignments. The rule is based on the attributes of the user, such as department, that typically come from your organization’s HR system, where many people with the same value of the attribute need the same access. As you want employees only (not guests) you create a rule as follows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information see: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-access-package-auto-assignment-policy">Configure an automatic assignment policy for an access package in entitlement management</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Configuring Verified ID checks in entitlement management&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Spring 2023, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/entra-identity-governance-with-entra-verified-id-higher-fidelity/ba-p/2466934">announced the public preview of an integration with the Microsoft Entra Verified ID</a> service. This integration allows you to incorporate Verified ID checks into the access request management workflow, saving you valuable time and effort, and enhancing security by removing human errors and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to your feedback, we’ve expanded the integration to include Logic App support. With this you can ensure that the Verified ID presented by the user corresponds to the same user who is currently logged into their account and submitting the access request. This powerful combination guarantees an additional layer of confidence and accuracy in the verification process, reinforcing the integrity of your access controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I’m happy to announce that these capabilities are now generally available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Require independently verified credentials to automate approvals&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are working with an external design agency on a project for a new customer. You require consultants to complete a Verified Vendor certification before they can be onboarded to new projects. Previously, consultants had to email a notarized copy of their certificate for manual review and approval by someone in your organization to onboard. Now, you can configure access packages with Verified ID requirements, setting a new standard for streamlined onboarding processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a consultant goes to request access to the access package from the My Access portal, they will be able to select from one of two policies. Policy 1 requires approval whereas Policy 2 auto-approves the request if the user presents the required Verified ID. When the consultant selects Policy 2, all they need to do is scan the QR code on the screen. This will allow them to present the credentials from their digital wallet, and since the access package does not require approval, the consultant will receive automatic access after their credentials have been verified by the issuing agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information see: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-verified-id-settings">How to configure your access package with a verified ID requirement</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Entitlement Management support in Conditional Access&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Entitlement Management service is now targetable in the conditional access policy for inclusion or exclusion of applications. By enabling the inclusion or exclusion of Entitlement Management and/or My Access in conditional access policies, your organization is better set up for self-service onboarding and conditional access policy exception management scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about conditional access see: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/">Azure AD Conditional Access documentation</a>. To target the Entitlement Management service, select “Azure AD Identity Governance - Entitlement Management” in the cloud apps picker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. My Access search improvements&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As dedicated as we are to expanding Microsoft Entra’s end-to-end capabilities for admins, we’re equally committed to ensuring secure access remains a breeze for your valued end users. As part of our commitment to making the end-user experience as smooth and effortless as possible, we’ve made significant improvements to the My Access search functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable users to find access packages more effectively, we’ve added a Resources column that shows users the resources that are part of the access package. In addition, users can now search for access packages using additional criteria, such as the access package name, description, and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/06/governments-and-citizens-want-simple-smooth-and-secure-interactions/">A recent Entrust survey</a> revealed that governments around the world are embracing eGov service enablement and delivery to revolutionize their interactions with citizens, but in varying degrees. Here we will explore why governments need to modernize citizen service delivery, and the benefits they will gain by doing so. And we’ll look at how differences in demographics can illuminate ways that governments can enable simple, seamless, and secure interactions with their citizens.</p>
<p>When governments prioritize enhancing digital infrastructure, policies, and processes, they can streamline operations, save time, reduce errors, and lower costs associated with citizen interactions. The result is increased citizen engagement and improved transparency, which promotes trust. The key to keeping that trust is ensuring that personal information is protected – and there’s room for improvement here.</p>
<p>A recent study by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/americans-views-of-government-decades-of-distrust-enduring-support-for-its-role/">Pew Research Center</a> revealed that trust in government remains low among U.S. citizens, finding that one in five Americans say they trust the government in Washington to do what is right “most of the time” (19%), and just 2% trust the government to do what’s right “just about always.”</p>
<p>Across all countries surveyed by Entrust, most respondents put their trust in the government’s ability to secure their personal information somewhere in the middle of a 1-10 scale. There were significant differences, however, in who gave government high marks (9 or 10 on a 1-10 scale) for trust, ranging from a high of 38.4% in the United States to a low of just 26.5% in Australia.</p>
<p>Governments are lagging in their efforts to improve their mobile app delivery in government-to-citizen interactions. As they strive to embrace digital transformation, building and maintaining citizens’ trust is crucial.</p>
<p>Countries vary widely in how much citizens trust their government and how they interact.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Australia Commits to Digital Transformation</p>
<p>The Australian government recognizes the importance of government-to-citizen engagement in the digital age, and, according to <a href="https://www.govtechreview.com.au/content/gov-digital/article/ensuring-digital-transformation-success-in-government-472786136">Australia’s Digital Transformation Agency’s Digital Transformation Strategy 2018-2025</a>, aspires to be a leading digital government globally. Australia’s strategy sets a target to bring all federal services online by 2025.</p>
<p>Australia now has a double-digit lead in high marks for service delivery via mobile app use over the other countries in the Entrust study. Most other countries rely on web portals as their preferred digital option.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Australian government is expected to release its final Data and Digital Government Strategy, along with an implementation plan, by the end of 2023. These documents will outline the initiatives for the government’s vision of a digitally empowered nation.</p>
<p>Germany Recognizes the Need for Change</p>
<p>The European Commission’s Digital Economy and Society Index <a href="https://cepa.org/article/deutsche-katastrophe-germany-fights-digital-backwardness/">(DESI)</a> in 2022 ranked Germany 13th among European Union member states in terms of digital performance. This ranking highlights the disparity between Germany and its counterparts.</p>
 
 50% of Germans possess basic digital skills, compared to 80% of Finns 
 Fewer than 40% of German households have access to fixed broadband connections, versus 70% of Spaniards who enjoy that convenience. 
 
<p>With few digital options today, German citizens have the lowest usage of eGov service delivery options across all the countries surveyed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is about to change. <a href="https://cepa.org/article/deutsche-katastrophe-germany-fights-digital-backwardness/">The German government</a> recognizes the need for comprehensive digital transformation and acknowledges the importance of embracing digital advancements. While Germany does have a strong economy, the country faces challenges such as inconsistent internet connections, outdated technology in classrooms, low citizen trust, and government offices heavily reliant on traditional methods. This lack of digital adoption and integration could adversely affect Germany’s growth in industrial and public sectors.</p>
<p>Different Age Groups See Things Differently, and the Same</p>
<p></p>
<p>The table above shows how different age groups in the study, regardless of geography, prefer to interact with government. There are some interesting similarities and differences:</p>
 
 Government web portals are the preferred method of interaction across age groups. 
 Gen Z preferences are almost evenly split between the web and phone with the use of all other means of interaction (other than mail) preferred over mobile apps. 
 Gen Z prefers to use the phone more than baby boomers. 
 Baby Boomers prefer web portals 52% more than their Gen Z counterparts. 
 Everybody, regardless of age or geography, dislikes mail. The lowest scores in our survey were reserved for in-person interactions, and interactions by mail. While governments will continue to provide these services to meet the needs of all of their citizens, this speaks to the critical need to embrace digital services. 
 
<p>Advice to Governments Everywhere</p>
<p>Embracing digital technologies will help drive simpler, more seamless and secure citizen services, resulting in engaged citizens, streamlined processes, and strengthened trust in government.</p>
<p>Governments should collaborate with technology vendors to provide seamless, secure citizen journeys for eGov service enablement and delivery with the goal of creating a modern and inclusive framework that adapts to the needs of our rapidly evolving digital age.</p>
<p>Entrust enables trusted citizen identities for eGovernment service enablement and delivery. Our <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/secure-digital-citizen-interactions">solutions</a> let government departments and agencies seamlessly and securely enroll and onboard citizens, issue and verify citizen credentials, and accelerate the delivery of citizen services resulting in:</p>

 New Code Examples — Making Integrating KILT Technology Easier <p>With increasing adoption of KILT Protocol by both enterprises and other blockchain projects, the KILT development team is refining existing processes and making integration easier.</p><p>To date, integration was done using the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/kilt-sdk">KILT Software Development Kit</a> (SDK) and adapting the open-source code of the existing applications (e.g., <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran wallet</a>, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/services/socialkyc">SocialKYC credentials</a>).</p><p>Following feedback, to simplify the integration process, the KILT development team has now created two simple TypeScript code examples: one for Attesters, one for Verifiers.</p> Attesters and Verifiers on&nbsp;KILT <p>Using KILT Protocol, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/attesters-verifiers">any entity can monetize their trusted reputation</a> in the physical world by becoming an <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/credentials/attestation">Attester</a> and issuing reusable digital credentials.</p><p>A <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/credentials/verification">Verifier</a> can be any entity that chooses to accept pre-existing credentials that meet their&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Integrating KILT’s identity solutions doesn’t require any blockchain skills, and there are no license costs or contracts.</p><p>A hash of the credential is anchored to the KILT blockchain by the Attester. The Verifier reads the hash to ensure the credential is still valid. Both of these functions require a web application that can interact with the KILT blockchain. These applications can now be easily built using the TypeScript code examples.</p> Testing Environment <p>The code examples for Attesters and Verifiers use the <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/spec-ext-credential-api#verification-workflow">KILT Credential API</a> (Application Programming Interface). Developers can run the code on Peregrine, the KILT testnet, to build and try out the application in a test environment at no cost. Peregrine Coins (which have no monetary value) can be obtained for free from the faucet. Once the developer has tested their application they can then configure the application to work with the KILT blockchain.</p><p>Each code example intentionally includes only the necessities to make the application run, and is not opinionated about implementation, so it can be reused in whatever architecture the developer chooses. To run as a service, the developers can optimize and secure the application to meet their own requirements.</p> The KILT Attester&nbsp;Example <p>The <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/CertifiedProof">CertifiedProof decentralized application</a> (dapp) is an example web application for attesting and revoking KILT credentials.</p><p>The code example keeps the application as simple as possible. Out of the box it attests two basic claim types (CTypes). A CType is the format of information required for the credential.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/ctype-index">Existing CTypes </a>can be used in their original form or a new one can be created by adding different information fields, ways of paying for the credential, security measures, or any other requirements.</p><p>Larger entities may also want to build their own version of the Sporran wallet, which the Claimer can download on their own device to generate their decentralized identifier (DID) and store their credentials.</p> The KILT Verifier&nbsp;Example <p>The <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/ProofCheck">ProofCheck decentralized application</a> (dapp) is an example web application for verifying the KILT credentials.</p><p>Using the dapp, the Verifier can check that the credential is connected to the DID of the Claimer, that it was attested by the DID of the trusted Attester, and that it hasn’t been&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>In the real world the Verifier can choose which credentials they accept to meet their needs. For testing purposes, developers require KILT credentials. <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a> credentials can be obtained for free <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">here</a> and used for&nbsp;testing.</p> Summary <p>The CertifiedProof and ProofCheck code examples make it easier for Attesters and Verifiers to integrate KILT identity solutions.</p><p>A code example that can be used to implement a login with a KILT credential is also being developed to make integration even easier for Verifiers. This will be as easy to install and use as normal Web2 website services.</p><p>These developments contribute to the real-world adoption of blockchain technology and the return of control of private data to its&nbsp;owner.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers.

<p></p>



<p>Workplaces are transforming at a fast pace. Emerging technologies like AI (artificial intelligence), ML (machine learning), big data, and blockchain are turning physical workspaces into digital ones. The COVID pandemic has already given a further boost to this process. Currently, employers are hiring globally as work from anywhere gathers pace. However, as the workplace transformation progresses rapidly, it raises the risk of fraudulent activities. Given that credential of candidates plays a critical role in making the hiring process successful, enterprises globally are looking at ways of vetting the entire process. Similarly, genuine professionals are trying to cross check the veracity of claims made by employers before entering into a job contract.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ironically, digitalisation of both these processes remains at a low level.This problem further aggravates in a huge country like India with its 1.4 billion population. With more than 40% of India’s population below 25 years, the country has a working class population of 540 million. Every year, around 6.5 million students graduate from colleges. No wonder, such vastness creates its own set of problems with instances of job scams, fraud candidates, and imposters becoming frequent. During the pandemic years, such a trend has touched menacing proportions. Against this backdrop, digital resumes with the help of blockchain technology can mitigate such risks to a great extent. In a country like India, its relevance is beyond discussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



 Leveraging blockchain technology for secure &amp; efficient HR recruitment: 



<p>HR (human resources) technology has evolved a lot over the years with increasing automation playing a bigger role. The advent of ChatGPT kind of generative AI tools has added a new dimension to this space. Despite such transformation, most of the data about candidates and professionals is stored in an unorganised manner. These remain paper-based or digital-based records without any central access system. Moreover, there is no way to track the veracity of the credentials of candidates, nor any way to check the tampering. In this context, blockchain technology can be very useful for its unique features.&nbsp; A blockchain is a form of decentralised ledger technology that enables the secure storage and transmission of data. Here, each transaction is recorded across each node on the network. Therefore, no record can be changed without altering subsequent blocks in the chain. This makes the whole system tamper-proof. In the HR space, this feature will help in checking unintended changes to the resume. Secondly, blockchain creates a depository of digital resumes with the entire history of academic and professional history stored in one place. Such depository can be shared by several employers in the same field for checking the veracity of candidates for higher education or employment. Moreover, decentralisation of data recording provides security and stability to the information stored. As educational institutions and corporates have seen cybersecurity attacks mounted by nefarious elements on a regular frequency, blockchain-powered solutions can provide much-needed security and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



 Digital resume leveraging blockchain: 



<p>Globally, corporates are in pursuit of hiring the right talent for manning operations. Post globalisation, India has emerged as a talent hub for the world. The technology industry alone has employed more than 5.4 million people with most Fortune 500 companies having their presence in the country. The country has also emerged as the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world. As China Plus One plays out across the world, India is also seeing traction in the manufacturing sector. With the growth of the Indian economy, employment opportunities are also on the rise. It requires the right selection of talent for ensuring efficiency. In this context, blockchain technology can be a great enabler.</p>



<p><br></p>



 Making selection process better &amp; faster:&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>During 2020-22 period, most businesses have opted for an online recruitment process. This was accompanied by scams and frauds as many potential candidates used fake resumes and experience letters to get jobs. These instances were caught during the background check process. Many companies including Accenture, Infosys, Cognizant had laid off staffers owing to fraudulent activities. Such concerns can be easily addressed by building digital resumes of candidates, leveraging blockchain technology. With the use of this technology, individuals and organisations can generate a secure and unalterable digital record of their academic achievements, professional experience, and competencies. This will make the process easier for employers to verify the authenticity of a candidate’s qualifications. Such records will do away with the manual process of background checking as all the databases will be available in one place. Moreover, many processes can be automated, leading to a lot of cost savings for organisations and enterprises. For instance, organisations are currently employing a team of HR professionals for conducting recruitment and taking the help of external agencies for a background check.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain will not only enable organisations to hire effectively, it will also empower individuals in getting the right job. Given the huge working population, job scams in India are very frequent. Recently, a massive job fraud duping 50,000 candidates was unearthed by Odisha police. Such scams can be thwarted to a large extent if blockchain-powered solutions are used to create digital profiles of organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



 Boosting jobs: 



<p>Blockchain can not only be used in the white-collar job space. Even blue-collar jobs will get a leg up from this technology. India has seen an increasing formalisation of blue-collar jobs by multiple ecommerce and related startups. Even the government is trying to promote skill-based job recruitment to boost employment. Blockchain technology can be leveraged to create digital resumes of skilled workers for employment in various sectors. Such a common depository of resumes can be accessed by several employers and individuals for various services. Digital records of skilled individuals will increase job opportunities in the blue-collar job space.</p>



<p><br></p>



 Right technology partner: 



<p>Many global technology firms have started deploying blockchain technology in the human resources space. Last year, an online resume-validating network run by Velocity Network Foundation garnered support from than a dozen board members from companies including Aon, Oracle, SAP, UKG, and ZipRecruiter to reduce the time and cost of vetting job candidates. Many blockchain-focussed specialised firms in India such as Dhiway Networks have come up with solutions that can help enterprises to create digital resumes of candidates. India houses the largest number of young people in the world, which is likely to continue for the next three decades. Therefore, it becomes important for organisations to collaborate with the right technology partner for leveraging blockchain technology to the fullest. This can not only save cost but also improve return on investment by hiring the right talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The advent of technology has changed the face of the education sector globally. Rapid penetration of the internet has facilitated the push towards online education. This has gained further momentum during the COVID pandemic as online education became the norm. Leveraging emerging technologies such as AI, ML, and big data among others has increased both access and reach of educational institutions manifold. However, it has ushered in a growing wave of privacy concerns and challenges to the authenticity of the documents and credentials shared on the webspace. According to Forbes magazine, there is an old, but fast-growing degree mill industry doing business for an estimated $7 billion a year worldwide from fraudulent diplomas, degrees, and transcripts. In India, these concerns are no lesser with instances of fake certificates, job scams, and related aspects cropping up frequently. Against this backdrop, blockchain as a technology can be a game-changer in ensuring the genuineness of degrees by maintaining a digital record.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



 Indian case study:&nbsp; 



<p>The Enforcement Directorate of India has recently filed a charge sheet under the anti-money laundering law against Himachal Pradesh-based Manav Bharti University and its promoters in a case linked to the alleged sale of fake degrees. The university has allegedly issued 36,000 fake degrees over 11 years for prices ranging between Rs 100,000 to Rs 300,000 (US$1,362-4,085). In March this year, Odisha police unearthed a fake certificate scam and arrested 19 people relating to the case. More recently, 700 Indian students, hailing from Punjab, are under the scrutiny of the Canadian government after being duped by unscrupulous education consultants back home, who had handed over ‘fraudulent college admission letters’ to enter Canada. So, the problems are real that are affecting the lives of hundreds of students with cross-border ramifications. No wonder, the Trends in Education Frauds in India report for 2020 says that fake degree submissions constituted nearly 28 per cent of education discrepancies in India. Universities issuing counterfeit degrees and job aspirants submitting fake academic and experience credentials are not only confined to India. It is rather a global phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><br></p>



 Blockchain in education: 



<p>Apart from fake certificates, blockchain technology can also be leveraged for knowing the validity of different credentials. For instance, records, certificates, and credentials which we acquire have different longevities. Some, like ID cards, are valid for a specific period; others, like skilling certificates, require constant renewal. Also, there are records like certificates that have validity across the lifetime of the data subject. Regardless of the longevities, the documents need to be embedded with a high degree of assurance, enabling trustworthy interactions when exchanged. And this is possible due to the distinct features of blockchain. Firstly, it ensures a decentralized, transparent, and secure system. Each transaction (data) is recorded on multiple nodes, creating a distributed network that is difficult to hack or manipulate. Secondly, it creates a digital and decentralized platform for issuing and storing credentials. Such a feature allows the formation of a repository of digital records. Blockchain technology also enhances data privacy and ownership, by providing individuals control over their data through the use of self-sovereign identities. The stakeholders can choose who can access their data. Given the complexity of data privacy regulations, educational institutions can comply with norms by leveraging blockchain technology. Therefore, it has plenty of scope in the education sector for trust, security, and credentialing of educational records.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><br></p>



 Digital records &amp; credentialing: 



<p>Educational institutions across the world work in silos with very less centralization of data. Centralisation is only seen in a specific sector without any information sharing within sectors. No central authority in a vast country like India has access to all the students’ credentials for studying in different educational institutions. In this scenario, blockchain can be leveraged to create a repository of digital certificates. Such a repository can be used by various stakeholders including government agencies, enterprises, staffing firms, and educational institutions for authenticating the genuineness of certificates. It can streamline the credentialing process by providing a digital and decentralized platform for issuing and storing credentials. Such blockchain-based digital certificates can also help students access and share their credentials easily with employers, other institutions, and third-party verification services, eliminating cumbersome paperwork, which demands time and resources. Currently, the University Grants Commission (UGC) is planning to set up a National Academic Depository that will centralise all records of students under one platform.<br></p>



<p><br></p>



 Data privacy &amp; IP protection:&nbsp; 



<p>While institutions can utilize blockchain technology to create a decentralized and immutable ledger of credentials and make the verification process easy, these credentials can be anchored on the blockchains securely, preventing the chances of tampering. It will establish trust among all the stakeholders. For instance, the U.S. Congress enacted the Family Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in 1974 to protect the privacy of students attending government schools. This act allows parents access to their children’s educational records and give them rights to request record amendments and control the disclosure of personally identifiable information. Similarly, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) of Europe puts the onus of data privacy of students on educational institutions. The National Education Policy of India is also considering similar norms concerning data privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, educational institutions store vast amounts of sensitive data including records, financial information, and research information. Blockchain technology protects the data from unauthorized access, duplication, manipulation, and sharing..&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><br></p>



 Fillip to edtechs &amp; cost savings: 



<p>Edtechs has emerged as one of the important pillars of the education system globally. In India, this segment plays a critical role in upskilling human resources, increasing the reach of quality education in rural areas apart from enhancing the usage of technology. However, the rapid adoption of such technology platforms has also given rise to instances of fraud. Such frauds can be regulated with the help of blockchain technology. Moreover, blockchain can transform data recording, storage, and sharing process from paper to digital ones. Currently, many educational institutions face issues like verifying the authenticity of academic credentials such as degrees, diplomas, certificates, and examination mark sheets as it is time-consuming and vulnerable to errors owing to its paper-based approach. Leveraging blockchain, these processes can be automated, reducing dependence on manpower and paper-based processes.<br></p>



<p><br></p>



 Collaborate with technology partner:&nbsp; 



<p>Deploying blockchain by educational institutions, however, needs the necessary infrastructure, training of staff, and ensuring interoperability across systems. These challenges can be dealt with by hiring technology providers who maintain global standards. Players such as Dhiway Networks, a blockchain technology company based out of Bangalore, can make the process easy for educational institutions. The company offers digital solutions such as #MARKs against fake certification. In addition to verifiability, this tool gives the issuing authorities the capability to track and trace any educational certificate digitally, making remote validation a reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Be it schools or universities, educational institutions, irrespective of their scale and size, can deal with challenges like verification of credentials, preventing fraud, and ensuring data privacy by using blockchain technology. Collaboration with the right technology partner can ease this process to a great extent.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>Preparing for future cybersecurity threats can be daunting, but it really doesn’t have to be the case if cyber security leaders recognize the true nature of the challenge. An analysis of past cyber-attacks reveals that they tend to be cyclic and lack any real innovation.</p>
<p>Most "sophisticated" attacks are just different combinations of well-known attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) applied to new technologies. Therefore, the key to success lies in focusing on new technologies, protecting data within them, and automating processes to keep up with the pace of change.</p>
 Assess risk 
<p>A risk-based, data- and identity-centric approach to security is invaluable. Data is the lifeblood of any organization and the main target of cyber-attacks. Identity plays a crucial role in access control and is frequently exploited through various TTPs. Risk assessments should pay particular attention to data and identity, ensuring thorough analysis and mitigation before implementing new technologies.</p>
 Focus on technology 
<p>There are several developments in the business IT landscape that require attention, starting with artificial intelligence (AI), which can be used both by attackers and defenders, enabling attacks, such as phishing using deepfake impersonations. Quantum computing poses a threat to encryption, and organizations must plan for quantum-proof encryption. Internet-enabled devices (IoT) are vulnerable and can be exploited to access wider networks. Cloud-based services, while offering advantages, require diligent risk assessments and strong security measures.</p>
<p>The trend of remote work introduces new cybersecurity risks, especially with the rise of shadow IT. Virtual environments, such as the metaverse, offer new opportunities for engaging customers but require careful consideration of privacy and security. Web3.0, with its open-source and blockchain foundations, may improve data control but also provides new attack vectors. 5G networks offers enhanced capabilities but require understanding and planning for the associated cybersecurity risks. &nbsp;Lastly, organizations must address the security risks associated with the IT supply chain, as compromises can lead to further cyber-attacks.</p>
 Challenges and opportunities 
<p>Digitalization brings both benefits and challenges. Organizations must prioritize security while embracing change to ensure the success of their operations.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity in an AI powered digital world is the focus of KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> event in Frankfurt from 14-16 November that will look at tackling future cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Presentations will focus on a range of topics, including how AI enables cyber attackers and defenders, securing the autonomous world and the cloud, advancements in quantum computing, detecting deepfakes, securing IoT devices, securing business communication channels and supply chains, protecting digital identities, and the security challenges of Web3 and the metaverse.</p>

  <p>In a previous blog, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/it-s-time-to-hang-up-on-phone-transports-for-authentication/ba-p/1751752">It's Time to Hang Up on Phone Transports for Authentication</a>, I wrote about the vulnerabilities of multifactor authentication (MFA) mechanisms such as SMS and voice. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00945.pdf">A recent MFA research study</a> from Microsoft concludes that SMS is 40% less effective in stopping bad actors compared to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/authenticator">Microsoft Authenticator</a> app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've also continued to bolster our Authenticator offering by <a href="http://aka.ms/authapplevelup">upleveling security</a>. But, despite the clear advantages to moving away from phone-based authentication, we still see around 44% of MFA traffic through SMS and voice phone calls. Bad actors continue to exploit MFA based on phone methods. Together, we can use stronger authentication methods to protect our users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I am excited to share that we’re taking steps to help you do just that. First, we’re helping you get your users registered with better methods by improving the strong authentication registration campaign capabilities. Then, to make the use of flagship capabilities like FIDO2 more accessible in more environments, we’re releasing FIDO2 support on iOS and macOS browsers in general availability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Modern strong authentication registration campaign&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/new-microsoft-authenticator-security-features-are-now-available/ba-p/2464386">In November 2021, we released registration campaigns</a>, a feature that allows enterprises to drive adoption of modern authentication methods, starting with Microsoft Authenticator. Since its release, we’ve had thousands of enterprises depend on this feature to drive adoption of modern authentication methods, helping over 1.3 million users configure and start using Microsoft Authenticator as their primary authentication method. However, we’ve heard from customers that they need more control over a user’s registration for modern strong authentication – so we’re adding new features to help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registration campaign sign-in prompt&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, we’re introducing a maximum prompt skip limit. With our latest updates, users will be able to postpone their registration up to three times. This will give them enough time to plan and prepare for the change, while increasing the effectiveness of your campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for organizations set as Microsoft managed, we’re enabling the feature automatically for users that are fully dependent on SMS or voice for MFA. Beginning this month (July 2023), we’ll initiate a phased rollout of this change. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2070717">Message center in the Microsoft 365 admin center</a> where we’ll notify admins when this change will impact their organization specifically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 FIDO2 support on iOS and macOS browsers in general availability 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also excited to announce that you can now use FIDO2 security keys to sign into Microsoft Entra ID federated applications on iOS and macOS web browsers. FIDO2 security keys provide strong, phishing-resistant authentication protected by a biometric factor (fingerprint) or PIN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be especially useful for highly regulated organizations that have strict compliance requirements, such as US Government agencies who need to comply with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, that require phishing-resistant authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the instructions on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key">this page</a> to enable passwordless sign-in with FIDO2 security keys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together we believe that these changes will make a real difference and propel millions of users to a better way of MFA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay safe out there,&nbsp;</p>

<p>At VeramoLabs, we’ve been thinking recently about how technologies like Decentralized Identities (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials can be used with modern AI chat-bots (or other Machine Learning agents) to reduce some of the risks these powerful tools present and increase interoperability between them and other systems. The risk we are most concerned with is the introduction of powerful yet opaque systems that reinforce inequality because they are trained on biased data (for more on this, you might want to check out the book Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil). On the other hand, a lack of interoperability increases switching costs, reduces ease of access, and (to a degree) impedes the development of interesting composable solutions that chain together ML&nbsp;models.</p><p>Adding a type of provenance to data generated by AI can enable us to provide auditability that should both improve the AI models and protect the systems and people they affect. By defining a common standard for verifiably interacting with AI models, we can start to fill the “moats” that less-open AI projects are trying to dig around their&nbsp;models.</p><p>As a demonstration, we’ll a simple application that shows how a user might interact with an AI chatbot in a way that provides more security throughout the process. At a high level, we’ll show how to build a protocol within <a href="https://didcomm.org/">DIDComm</a> (an open standard for end-to-end-encrypted communication between <a href="https://veramo.io/docs/basics/identifiers#decentralized-identifier">DIDs</a>) that lets us communicate with an AI agent and receive generated data as a <a href="https://veramo.io/docs/basics/verifiable_data#w3c-verifiable-credential">Verifiable Credential</a>.</p><p>This certainly isn’t a perfect solution, but it’s a helpful exercise for exploring the intersection of AI, Identity and the Veramo framework. Since Veramo is a multiplatform and modular javascript framework for decentralized identity, verifiable data and communication, we can use it to prototype an SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) solution for verifiably communicating with AI models in just a few minutes. We’ll use Veramo to build both a cloud agent that wraps an AI model and the front-end user interface for sending secure messages to that&nbsp;agent.</p><p>For this demo use case, we’ll be using an LLM named “Starchat” found on <a href="https://huggingface.co/">huggingface.co</a>, a platform for open-source AI. Huggingface allows us to interact with ML models via their API and also provides metadata about the model, such as the dataset the model was trained on or any associated research&nbsp;paper.</p><p>We’ll start by defining a “sub-protocol” for DIDComm. The base DIDComm standard defines the minimal message format and the cryptographic processes required for encrypted communication. The specification also details how “sub-protocols” can be layered on top of DIDComm to support interoperability between common use cases. You can find existing “sub-protocols” on the <a href="https://didcomm.org/search/?page=1">DIDComm&nbsp;site</a>.</p><p>If you prefer watching videos to reading, you can watch a tutorial that covers the rest of this article on our&nbsp;youtube:</p><p>Our protocol will be very simple, so all we really need to do is define 2 message types: one for the question a user will be sending to the AI agent and one for the AI agent’s response. We’ll use dummy URLs for the types, although if this protocol were used in a production environment, it would be preferable to use URLs that point to the protocol definition. Most of our work will be contained in a plugin for Veramo, published as an NPM&nbsp;package.</p><p>For outbound queries from a user to an AI agent, we’ll create a message with type = <a href="https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/question`.">https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/question.</a> In the body object, we’ll include a prompt string (the question the user is asking the AI), and the message should include a thid (thread ID) so that successive queries could be linked together in a UI, although we won’t be implementing that aspect in this proof-of-concept. We’ll also include a return_route since we expect a response right away, as well as all the standard DIDComm message fields: from, to,&nbsp;id.</p><p>This means an outbound message will look like&nbsp;this:</p> {<br>  type:"https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/question",<br>  from: "did:fake:sender",<br>  to: "did:fake:ai-text-generation-model",<br>  id: "abc-123",<br>  thid: "def-456",<br>  body: {<br>    prompt: "What are the bones in your arm called?"<br>  },<br>  return_route: "all"<br>} <p>We can create a simple helper function in our Veramo plugin to help us easily create these messages:</p> export const ML_TEXT_GENERATION_QUESTION_MESSAGE_TYPE = 'https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/question'<br><br>export function createMLTextGenerationPromptMessage(prompt: string, senderDidUrl: string, recipientDidUrl: string, thid: string, returnRoute: boolean): IDIDCommMessage {<br>  return {<br>    type: ML_TEXT_GENERATION_PROMPT_MESSAGE_TYPE,<br>    from: senderDidUrl,<br>    to: recipientDidUrl,<br>    id: v4(),<br>    thid,<br>    body: {<br>      prompt<br>    },<br>    return_route: returnRoute ? 'all' : 'none'<br>  }<br>}<br> <p>When an agent receives this type of message, it performs the query by sending a request to the Startchat API. This requires a bit of hacky code due to a quirk of the Text Generation model API. There’s probably a better approach, but for this proof-of-concept the hacky solution is&nbsp;fine:</p> async function query(data: any, token: string): Promise&lt;any&gt; {<br>  const response = await fetch(<br>    "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/HuggingFaceH4/starchat-beta",<br>    {<br>      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, 'Content-Type': "application/json" },<br>      method: "POST",<br>      body: JSON.stringify(data),<br>    }<br>  );<br>  const result = await response.blob();<br>  return result;<br>}<br><br>export async function getAnswer(queryInput: string, token: string): Promise&lt;string&gt; {<br>  const modQuery = queryInput + "&lt;|end|&gt;\n&lt;|assistant|&gt;\n"<br>  const res = await query({"inputs": modQuery}, token)<br>  const text = await res.text()<br>  let generatedText: string = JSON.parse(text)[0].generated_text<br>  let iterations = 0<br>  let answer = generatedText.substring(modQuery.length)<br><br>  while (!answer.includes('&lt;|end|&gt;') &amp;&amp; iterations &lt; 20) {<br>    const r = await query({"inputs": modQuery + answer }, token)<br>    const generatedText2 = JSON.parse(await r.text())[0].generated_text<br>    answer = generatedText2.substring(modQuery.length)<br>    iterations++<br>  }<br>  const end = answer.indexOf('&lt;|end|&gt;')<br>  let finalAnswer = answer<br>  if (end &gt; 0) {<br>    finalAnswer = answer.substring(0, end)<br>  }<br>  return finalAnswer<br>} <p>Then we create a verifiable credential that contains the response to the query along with a few pieces of metadata that can aid in auditability and user education. Such a credential might look like&nbsp;this:</p> {<br>  issuer: { id: "did:fake:ai-text-generation-model"},<br>  '@context': ['https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1'],<br>  type: ['VerifiableCredential', 'TextGenerationAnswer'],<br>  issuanceDate: new Date().toISOString(),<br>  credentialSubject: {<br>    id: "did:fake:sender",<br>    prompt: "What are the bones in your arm called?"<br>    answer,<br>    model: "HuggingFaceH4/starchat-beta",<br>    license: "bigcode-openrail-m",<br>    linkedPapers: ["arxiv:1911.02150", "arxiv:2205.14135"]<br>  }<br>} <p>To create this credential using Veramo, we create another small function:</p> function createCredential(context: IAgentContext&lt;ICredentialPlugin&gt;, response: string, prompt: string, from: string, to: string): Promise&lt;VerifiableCredential&gt; {<br>  return context.agent.createVerifiableCredential({<br>    credential: {<br>      issuer: { id: to },<br>      '@context': ['https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1'],<br>      type: ['VerifiableCredential', 'TextGenerationResponse'],<br>      issuanceDate: new Date().toISOString(),<br>      credentialSubject: {<br>        id: from,<br>        prompt,<br>        response,<br>        model: "HuggingFaceH4/starchat-beta",<br>        license: "bigcode-openrail-m",<br>        linkedPapers: ["arxiv:1911.02150", "arxiv:2205.14135"]<br>      }<br>    },<br>    proofFormat: 'jwt'<br>  })<br>} <p>The AI agent then sends a DIDComm message with type = <a href="https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/response">https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/response</a> that contains this credential back to the original sender, utilizing the connection that delivered the first message if possible (as requested by the return_route parameter).</p><p>Another helper function in our plugin will let us easily create these response messages:</p> export const ML_TEXT_GENERATION_RESPONSE_MESSAGE_TYPE = ‘https://veramo.io/didcomm/ml-text-generation/1.0/response'export function createMLTextGenerationResponse(senderDidUrl: string, recipientDidUrl: string, questionId: string, questionThid: string, credential: VerifiableCredential): IDIDCommMessage {<br><br>export function createMLTextGenerationResponse(senderDidUrl: string, recipientDidUrl: string, questionId: string, questionThid: string, credential: VerifiableCredential): IDIDCommMessage {<br>  return {<br>    type: ML_TEXT_GENERATION_RESPONSE_MESSAGE_TYPE,<br>    from: senderDidUrl,<br>    to: recipientDidUrl,<br>    id: `${questionId}-response`,<br>    thid: questionThid,<br>    body: credential<br>  }<br>} <p>We can put this all together in a relatively small Message&nbsp;Handler:</p> <br>/**<br> * A plugin for the {@link @veramo/message-handler#MessageHandler} that handles Starchat messages.<br> * @beta This API may change without a BREAKING CHANGE notice.<br> */<br>export class MLTextGenerationPromptMessageHandler extends AbstractMessageHandler {<br>  private hfToken: string<br>  constructor(hfToken: string) {<br>    super()<br>    this.hfToken = hfToken<br>  }<br><br>  /**<br>   * Handles a Star Chat Message<br>   * https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#trust-ping-protocol-10<br>   */<br>  public async handle(message: Message, context: IContext): Promise&lt;Message&gt;

 ¿Que está pasando con Hollywood y la AI o Inteligencia Artificial? 
<p>Hollywood tiene un problema con la inteligencia artificial y la falta de humanidad e individualidad que genera en la industria. La última protesta de los actores ha subrayado la importancia de salvaguardar la autenticidad en la industria cinematográfica y televisiva. En este contexto, el uso de un sistema de Identidad Auto-Soberana descentralizada (SSI) puede ser importante. Este sistema ayuda a verificar datos e identidades y a evitar estafas y suplantaciones.</p>
<p>Es hora de proteger la autenticidad y la identidad en Hollywood, preservando la esencia de la actuación humana en la era digital. identidades y, en el caso de Hollywood, preservar la esencia de la actuación humana en la era digital.</p>
<p>Un sistema de Identidad Auto-Soberana asegura la verificación confiable de datos e identidades, marcando la diferencia en el control de datos personales. Con la Identidad Auto-Soberana, podríamos evitar la impersonalización y los usos negativos de la Inteligencia Artificial, como las estafas y los robos de identidad.</p>

  <p>As announced on June 7, 2023, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-is-generally-available/ba-p/2466932">Microsoft Entra ID Governance</a> is now generally available, and with it a set of new capabilities to empower businesses in their pursuit of streamlined access management. This includes machine learning (ML) powered access review recommendations and user inactivity access review scoping. These additions leverage advanced technologies to enhance access reviews, granting reviewers intelligent recommendations and simplifying security management by regularly reviewing and removing inactive accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's explore how these features assist organizations in making informed decisions and safeguarding critical resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Machine Learning-based recommendations for reviewers&nbsp; 
<p>Access reviews play a crucial role in ensuring the right users have the appropriate access privileges within an organization. However, the decision-making process can be challenging and time-consuming for reviewers. This is where machine learning-based recommendations for reviewers come into play. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and the organization's reporting structure, this feature provides insightful recommendations to reviewers, enabling them to make well-informed decisions swiftly. Nevertheless, it’s worth emphasizing that while this recommendation is significant, it’s merely the first step towards unlocking the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: You want reviewers to make the review process easier so that reviewers can make quicker and more accurate decisions&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want your reviewers to be efficient during your access certification campaigns. When creating the access review, you select ‘User-to-Group Affiliation’ as part of enabling reviewer decision helpers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The user-to-group affiliation recommendation analyzes users' relative affiliation with other users in the group, while also considering the organization's reporting structure. By utilizing a machine-learning-based scoring mechanism, the system identifies users who are at a significant distance from other users in the group, indicating "low affiliation."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviewer now will see the recommendation in My Access when going through the access review. These insights help flag potential candidates for closer scrutiny before a decision is made to accept or deny access, thereby helping reviewers increase review efficiency, reduce attestation fatigue, and ensure the sensitive resources are secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviewer can now take immediate action. They have the option to accept the recommendations by clicking on “Accept Recommendations,” enabling swift, efficient decision-making. Alternatively, reviewers can manually review the recommendations and exercise their judgment to accept or deny access accordingly. This feature empowers reviewers to make well-informed decisions while reducing the time and effort required to complete an access review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unleashing the power of inactive user scoping&nbsp; 
<p>Managing inactive user accounts is a significant challenge for organizations, as dormant accounts can pose potential security risks. ID Governance tackles this challenge head-on with the introduction of inactive user scoping. This feature allows administrators to review and address stale accounts that haven’t been active for a specified period. By encompassing both interactive and non-interactive sign-in activities, inactive user scoping provides a comprehensive view of user activity. Administrators can set a specific duration, such as 30, 60 or 90 days, to determine inactive accounts. As part of the review process, stale accounts can automatically be removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: You want to set up a recurring review of inactive users in a critical group&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want to set up a recurrent review of the audit team group, who have not signed into any application in Azure AD (both interactively and non-interactively) in the last 30 days. For that you create a new access review, you choose the group, all users in the group and choose the new option for inactive users, with a threshold of 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Removing inactive user accounts improves an organization's security posture by reducing the attack surface and minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. By regularly reviewing and removing stale accounts, organizations can ensure that access privileges align with business requirements and maintain a lean, secure user environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Give it a try&nbsp;

<p>Identity-related security is paramount in our modern threat landscape, touching on almost any form of vulnerability related to cybersecurity.</p>
<p>What Is Identity Lifecycle Management? Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM) is the collection of technologies, processes, and policies governing digital identity creation, management, and deletion.</p>
 What Is Identity Lifecycle Management? 
<p>The Identity Lifecycle is a continuous cycle of managing users’ identities within a system or network, typically in an organization. It involves several stages that ensure the secure and efficient handling of user identities and access controls. The steps of this lifecycle usually include the following:</p>
 
 Provisioning (Onboarding): In this stage, user accounts are created, often when a new employee joins the organization. Each user’s relevant access privileges are defined based on their roles and responsibilities. 
 Access Governance: This is a continuous process where policies are established and enforced to govern the identity and access management system. 
 Authentication: At this point, the ILM system includes controls to prevent unauthorized access by requiring login credentials, typically associated with multi-factor authentication. 
 Authorization: After authentication, authorization rules and controls function as the gatekeeper of access to system resources based on the user’s role, the type of resource in question, and other factors like user location, device, or behavior. 
 Management: This ongoing process involves managing users’ identities, maintaining their access rights and roles, and keeping track of any changes. This includes changes to the user’s role, changes in their privileges, or removing their access rights. 
 De-Provisioning (Offboarding): When a user account is no longer required, the ILM process must account for removing the user and their access rights to prevent backdoor access or insider threats. 
 Reporting: Regular reports and audits are conducted to ensure the identity and access management system functions correctly and securely. This includes checking for any signs of suspicious activity or potential security breaches. 
 
 How Does Identity Lifecycle Management Work? 
<p>It’s an essential component of an organization’s security strategy, ensuring that individual users only have access to the resources they must and that their interactions with resources are readily observable and documented.</p>
<p>There are various components of any Identity Lifecycle Management, including:</p>
 
 Onboarding and Offboarding: When a new user is added to or removed from the system, users get (or lose) unique credentials and identifiers denoting roles and responsibilities. 
 Identity and Access Management: This ongoing process involves managing users’ identities, including their access rights and roles. It may include controlling the user’s credentials, setting up multi-factor authentication, managing access to different resources, and other related tasks. 
 Auditing: Regular reviews and audits ensure access rights and roles are still appropriate for each user. This could involve reviewing logs and reports, conducting access certification campaigns, and other activities to verify that the system functions correctly and securely. 
 Compliance Reporting: Many organizations need to demonstrate compliance with various regulations or standards related to identity and access management. This can involve generating reports, documenting processes and procedures, and other activities to demonstrate compliance. 
 
<p>ILM provides a structured approach to managing and securing digital identities to improve security and accountability throughout the organization.</p>
 What’s the Difference Between ILM and Privileged Access Management? 
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/privileged-access-management/">Privileged Access Management</a> (PAM) overlap in their more generic definitions. However, both are critical to an organization’s <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/identity-management/what-is-iam">Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) efforts.</p>
<p>The differences between the two include:</p>
 
 Identity Lifecycle Management covers the management of identities for all users within an organization throughout their lifecycle. This includes everything from the initial onboarding of new users (creating accounts, assigning initial roles and permissions), through changes in roles or responsibilities (which may require changes to access rights), to eventual offboarding (disabling or deleting accounts when users leave the organization). 
 Privileged Access Management, on the other hand, focuses explicitly on managing accounts with elevated privileges. The risks associated with these accounts are significantly higher, so they require additional controls. These include strong <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a>, session monitoring and recording, detailed logging and auditing, and even advanced features like ‘just-in-time’ access, where the privileged rights are only granted when needed and automatically revoked afterward. 
 
<p>Effective security requires both ILM to manage the broad population of users, and PAM, to provide additional controls for the smaller number of high-risk privileged accounts.</p>
 Why Is Identity Lifecycle Management So Important? 
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM) ensures the security and integrity of an organization’s systems and data. Here are several reasons why ILM is so important:</p>
 
 Security: ILM provides a centralized and understandable way to address security based on user resource access. This, in turn, provides more control over these security issues. 
 Compliance: Many industries are subject to regulations that require them to manage and protect digital identities in specific ways. By providing a structured approach to managing these identities, ILM helps organizations to comply with these regulations and avoid potential penalties. 
 Cost Reduction: Automation and centralization (mainly through <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/idaas/">IDaaS</a> systems) can reduce costs related to the maintenance of identity systems in terms of money spent on software and work hours dedicated to related tasks. 
 Auditability: ILM provides a clear record of who has access to what resources and when making it easier to audit access and identify any potential issues. This is important for organizations that need to demonstrate compliance with specific regulations. 
 Risk Mitigation: ILM helps prevent internal threats by ensuring that access rights are granted based on the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/principle-least-privilege/">principle of least privilege</a>, giving users the minimum levels of access they need to perform their jobs. Also, when employees leave or change roles, ILM ensures their access rights are updated promptly to prevent potential security risks. 
 
<p>By managing the entire lifecycle of digital identities within an organization, from creation to termination, ILM provides a comprehensive approach to identity and access management. This helps ensure that the right people have access at the right time, improving security, efficiency, and compliance.</p>

<p>As part of Coinfirm’s investigative and analytic efforts, we continually improve our understanding of the complex workings of<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>transactions, especially those related to high-profile hacking events. Today, we present a deep dive into the Parity hack, one of the most notorious events in blockchain history.</p>



<p>6 Years ago, on the 18th of July 2017, the Parity multisig library was compromised, resulting in the theft of 153,037 ETH from three wallets. Thanks to the swift response of white-hat hackers, who secured funds from a total of 596 vulnerable wallets, the damage could be somewhat mitigated. Nonetheless, the breach represented a significant event in the blockchain world and highlighted the importance of robust security mechanisms.</p>

<p>After the initial breach, the hackers began moving their illicit gains. Our team at Coinfirm traced seven transactions totaling 70,000 ETH moving out of the hackers’ wallet, leaving behind an unspent amount of 83,037 ETH.</p>



<p>Further tracking led us to a series of transactions involving Tornado.Cash, a renowned Ethereum mixing service. Our analysis showed that a total of 10,290 ETH was deposited into Tornado.cash, complicating the tracking process as this service is designed to obscure the origins of its transactions.</p>



Deposits to Tornado.cash



<p>Despite this obstacle, we identified 13 addresses that received the withdrawals from the Tornado.Cash 100 ETH and 10 ETH pool, corresponding to the previously deposited 10,290 ETH (minus the network and mixer fees). The analysis of these transactions can be found in the table below:</p>

<p>Identified Tornado.cash withdrawals</p>



<p>Upon further analysis, we observed that the withdrawn ETH was then converted into RenBTC, a wrapped Bitcoin token on the Ethereum blockchain, across two different decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



Withdrawals from Tornado.cash, Swap and deposit to RenBridge



<p>Subsequently, these RenBTC tokens were transferred via the RenBridge, a decentralized application enabling the conversion and transfer of digital assets between blockchains.</p>

<p>RenBridge cross-chain transfers</p>



<p>At this point, the cryptocurrency had been swapped back into its original form – Bitcoin, and a total of 668 BTC were withdrawn. The remaining 31 BTC was moved to an unidentified wallet, making further tracking challenging. The summary of these transactions can be seen in the table below:</p>



Withdrawals from RenBridge



<p>In conclusion, our investigation into the Parity hack provides crucial insights into the techniques employed by hackers to launder stolen funds. Our findings underscore the importance of blockchain analytics in tracing illicit funds and reinforcing the security mechanisms of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>







<p>Coinfirm is committed to providing robust blockchain analytics and pioneering investigative efforts, enabling a safer and more transparent blockchain ecosystem.</p>

  <p>As announced on June 7, 2023, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-is-generally-available/ba-p/2466932">Microsoft Entra ID Governance</a> is now generally available, including one of our newest capabilities: Lifecycle Workflows (LCW). I'm thrilled to share more about the rich set of capabilities in LCW, including enhancements and improvements we’ve made since public preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User identity lifecycle is a critical part of an organization’s security posture, and when managed correctly, can have a positive impact on their users’ productivity for Joiners, Movers, and Leavers (JML). The ongoing digital transformation is accelerating the need for good identity lifecycle management. However, IT and security teams face enormous challenges managing the complex, time-consuming, and error-prone manual processes necessary to execute the required onboarding and offboarding tasks for hundreds of employees at once. This is an ever present and complex issue IT admins continue to face with digital transformation across security, governance, and compliance. Taking a closer look at the identity lifecycle challenges we can see that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 It’s common that every employee in the organization needs access and the number of apps and the volume of data being managed has increased significantly. This is in addition to the constant increase of regulatory requirements. To keep up pace IT admins have had to rely on scripts to complete the JML processes, and troubleshooting problems is complex and time-consuming. 
 Onboarding new users involves many moving parts so reducing manual repetitive tasks to gain the right access and ensure productivity of employees on day one can be crucial to decreasing costs and securing talent in a competitive job market. 
 With cyber-crime intensifying, organizations are exposed to more security threats if accounts and access are not removed in a timely manner when employees leave or move within the organization. IT spends too much time on manual processes to add and remove resource access resulting in delays and errors which can cause compliance issues.<br><br> 
 
<p>At Ignite 2022, we announced the public preview of <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fgovernance%2Fwhat-are-lifecycle-workflows&amp;data=05%7C01%7CAlexander.Filipin%40microsoft.com%7Caacd9111cae64910c22108db3bd58e3b%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638169560682825355%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=1AwFcGTh%2FvKu1NCGG2D10AwVTNOV67WONrfH7cNDIVc%3D&amp;reserved=0">Lifecycle Workflows</a>, which adds automated, enterprise-grade user lifecycle management capabilities for organizations to modernize their identity lifecycle management and help IT admins address these challenges. Since then, hundreds of organizations across the globe have tried the feature and provided feedback. We’ve updated LCW to help IT pros save even more time, reduce errors, and avoid costly delays using a simple, intuitive experience. Now they can automate and streamline repetitive joiner, mover, and leaver tasks to help new employees and those with role changes to be productive immediately. They can also ensure access is removed as soon as employees leave the organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s explore how LCW helps IT Pros automate repetitive tasks in the user lifecycle management process, saving time, reducing risks, and allowing employees to be productive faster. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Scenario 1: Automate the onboarding process of a new employee to be productive on their first day&nbsp; 
<p>Normally, onboarding new employees requires the manual generation of several tickets for IT to process and a set of disconnected steps that IT must complete. Often, the result is that the new employee is missing required access to apps, Microsoft Teams group memberships, initial sign-in credentials, and so on. Processing the service tickets, and potentially tracking down erroneous or missing steps, takes significant time and effort for IT admins, while also negatively impacting user productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the IT admin, you are responsible for managing this process. Using Lifecycle Workflows, you can create a custom workflow in just a few steps that, based on the employee start date, enables the user account, sends a welcome e-mail to the new employee, adds the employee to the marketing group, and creates a ServiceNow ticket using our built-in Logic Apps extensibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at how to make this happen!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Configure a custom workflow using an out-of-the-box workflow template that fits your scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Woodgrove admin, Lisa, goes to <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_LifecycleManagement/CommonMenuBlade/~/overview">Entra Identity Governance -&gt; Lifecycle Workflows</a> and clicks on Create workflow to choose a built-in workflow template that fits her scenario. In this case, she chooses the Onboard new hire employee workflow template for this Joiner scenario. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select a built-in workflow template with Microsoft Entra ID Governance Lifecycle Workflows to match the right scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Basics tab, Lisa customizes the workflow name and sees the trigger event details are already configured to trigger based on the employeeHireDate attribute. With the new Lifecycle Workflows enhancements, if desired, she could have chosen to trigger based on the user creation date instead. Trigger event details can now be customized for up to 180 days, but for this new hire onboarding scenario, the template value is configured to run on the new hire’s first day of work, so no additional changes are needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisa can optionally customize the workflow further by scoping the workflow to target a subset of users in the Configure Scope tab using the collection of supported Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user properties, including OnPremises extension attributes and directory extension attributes. This allows Lisa to configure different workflows for users located in the US and Europe, if needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Customize the tasks to run for the new employee on Day 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because each of the workflow templates have pre-defined tasks for the scenarios, no additional tasks are required. Admins can choose to further customize the workflow by adding additional tasks from the collection of built-in tasks for the appropriate scenario. Admins can also leverage the built-in custom task extension task that enables the extensibility to perform additional actions in Logic Apps, Microsoft’s powerful low code solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the new Lifecycle Workflows enhancements, you can now make access package assignments requests and create customized emails with your own branding including company logo and domain, custom subject, body and language as well as add additional recipients on CC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check off all the items on Woodgrove new employee checklist, Lisa adds a task to create a Service Now ticket to request a laptop delivery leveraging an existing Logic App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisa can now customize the welcome email to be sent with the Woodgrove company logo, add a link to the Woodgrove new employee portal, and CC employee onboarding team members for awareness so employees know the email came from Woodgrove.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customize the welcome email for newly onboarded employees with matching company logo and accompanying details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisa clicks on the Review + Create tab to review all the changes, then clicks the Enable Schedule checkbox and clicks Create to save the workflow. The workflow will automatically run based on the tenant schedule and only for the users that were auto-detected to meet the execution conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Monitor the workflow status&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every action taken by Lifecycle Workflows, including creation, updates, and processing events, are stored in the audit logs reports. Additionally, Lifecycle Workflows provides the Workflow History feature, a more granular reporting feature that allows you to quickly see what ran for who and whether it was successful. Lisa can navigate to the Workflow History of the selected workflow to check the processing status of a workflow across the user, runs, and task views for troubleshooting and compliance purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Workflow History to review status of a workflow across any user for troubleshooting and compliance standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Scenario 2: Automate the employee offboarding process to remove access in a timely manner&nbsp; 
<p>Another important identity lifecycle scenario is employee offboarding. There can be many different reasons why an employee needs to be offboarded e.g., retirement, separation, or leaving to join a competitor. Regardless of the offboarding reason, it’s important for IT admins to ensure these accounts are no longer active and all resource access is removed from the former employee in a timely manner to reduce security risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether the offboarding process is planned weeks in advanced, needs to happen in real-time, or is part of access clean up after the employee leaves, Lifecycle Workflows provides flexible options to automate the process with built-in leaver workflow templates for processing the separation in the timeframe that fits your needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vance, an IT admin for Tailspinonline, is responsible for managing the offboarding processes. Using built-in leaver templates in Lifecycle Workflows, he can save time by pre-configuring pre-offboarding, real-time separation, and post-offboarding workflows, based on his company's policies. In this case, Vance needs to quickly offboard an employee who is leaving for a competitor, so he will immediately block the employee’s access by disabling the user account and remove them from all Azure AD groups and Microsoft Teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at how to make this happen!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Configure a custom workflow using an out-of-the-box workflow template that fits your scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vance goes to <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_LifecycleManagement/CommonMenuBlade/~/overview">Entra Identity Governance -&gt; Lifecycle Workflows</a> and clicks on Create workflow to choose a built-in workflow template that fits the scenario. In this case, he chooses the Real-time employee termination workflow template for this Leaver scenario. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lifecycle Workflows includes multiple Leaver scenario templates such as Real-time employee termination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Basics tab, Vance customizes the workflow name and sees the trigger event details are already configured to trigger on demand, so no changes needed. This template offers the IT admins like Vance, the flexibility of choosing to run the workflow immediately, for the users they select or configure it now and run it later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For other offboarding scenarios, he can choose from other pre-defined workflow templates to trigger based on the employeeLeaveDateTime attribute, populated from HR systems and treated with sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Customize the tasks to run for the employee in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because each of the workflow templates have pre-defined tasks for the scenarios, no additional tasks are required. However, admins can choose to customize the list of tasks to fit their needs. In this case, Vance sees that template already has pre-defined tasks to remove the user from all groups and Teams and delete the user account. Per the company policy, the account will be deleted later as part of the post-offboarding process, so he can quickly remove the delete user account task. Then, he adds a task to disable the user account to ensure the employee is blocked from signing in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This template offers IT admins like Vance, the flexibility of choosing to select users now and run the workflow immediately or create it now and select users to run it later. From the Select users tab, Vance selects the user and clicks on the Review + Create tab to review all the changes, then clicks Create to save the workflow. The workflow will immediately start processing the users that Vance selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select multiple users, if needed, in Real-time employee termination workflows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Monitor the workflow status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vance can now navigate to the Workflow History of the selected workflow to monitor the progress and see that the separation is already being processed. He can optionally choose to drill in further on the status of the individual tasks to check for issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leveraging the Real-time employee offboarding templates ensures access is automatically removed upon an employee’s departure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using the real-time leaver template, Vance automated the offboarding process so that access is removed upon an employee’s departure, reviewed the history of the workflow so that he can ensure that each task in the offboarding process was completed successfully, and helped the organization safeguard its critical data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the new Lifecycle Workflows enhancements, we’ve made updates and improvements for more granular workflow execution auditing, and at any time, you can navigate to <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_LifecycleManagement/CommonMenuBlade/~/auditlogs">Lifecycle Workflows Audit Logs</a> or <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ERM/DashboardBlade/~/Audit%20logs">Entra Identity Governance Audit Logs</a> and check the workflow execution info and other workflow management activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What customers are saying&nbsp; 
<p>We got some great feedback from customers and partners like you during the previews:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;“With Lifecycle workflows, Microsoft’s Entra platform adds a so far missing core Identity Governance component, to solve client’s requirement around automated JML (Joiner, Mover and Leaver) use cases. This will be a significant step forward to use Entra as the central Identity system within a client’s estate.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Erik Siebler (IAM Lead, DXC)&nbsp; </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We were able to see the product vision of Lifecycle workflow and how this could help us to move our current Join, Move, Leave workflows from our current legacy IAM platform to Cloud native IAM solution. We already have moved a few of our workflows to Lifecycle Workflows for onboarding of our store and back office employees that include O365 licenses, SMS and Email notification to managers."&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Maqsood Ali Bhatti (IAM Lead, Elkjøp Nordic AS) </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"With Lifecycle Workflows we finally can support the business of ourselves and our customers with an automated joiner and leaver process. This powerful and amazing feature helps us and our customers stay in control of the lifecycle of accounts in Azure AD and makes sure accounts are provisioned and deprovisioned automatically."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Pim Jacobs (Principal Consultant, InSpark) </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Every customer is struggling with identity next management, we use logic apps, we use automation for hybrid workers and it's really cool that Lifecycle Workflows integrates perfectly with many different Azure services, and that's the very positive thing that you're already familiar with them even if you haven't used them before. And at every customer there is a massive mess with user accounts and with Lifecycle Workflows you can easily start building your identity workflows since there's definitely a lot less steps than ordering a third party identity and access management solution. This feature can be very important for us in the future."&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Nicola Alig (IAM Lead, BaseVision)&nbsp; </p>

				  Digital Wallet Interoperability: Overcoming Challenges &amp; Embracing Ecosystem-Level Collaboration  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Let’s start by acknowledging a fundamental truth – most digital identity wallets lack interoperability. While there is some degree of interoperability in specific circumstances, the full potential of digital wallet interoperability is yet to be realized. The road ahead may be long, but understanding ecosystem-level interoperability can guide us on this journey.

				  Understanding Ecosystem-Level Interoperability 
<p>Interoperability is the seamless ability of systems to work together. In the context of digital wallets, it means users can choose any wallet to perform desired transactions. While universal interoperability may seem ideal, we should focus on enabling effective communication between digital wallets within ecosystems. This involves adhering to specific technologies, protocols, and standards unique to each ecosystem.</p>
 Different Ecosystems, Different Need for Digital Wallet Interoperability 
<p>Before addressing the challenges of achieving interoperability, it’s crucial to recognize that different ecosystems have distinct requirements and priorities. Universal interoperability across all digital wallets is simply not feasible. Instead, we should embrace ecosystem-level interoperability, allowing wallet providers to cater to specific user needs and comply with local regulations by leveraging their own technologies, protocols, and standards.</p>
 Challenges to Interoperability 
<p>While interoperability holds great potential, several challenges impede its realization. Some key obstacles that require addressing:</p>
 
 Local Variation: A significant hurdle to interoperability arises from the local variation within different ecosystems. Even within the same document type, attribute names, data formats, and other specifications can differ significantly. These inconsistencies across ecosystems impede seamless communication and interoperability. 
 Security and Trust Considerations: Digital wallets handle sensitive user information, necessitating robust security measures and the maintenance of user trust. Interoperability introduces additional complexities and potential security vulnerabilities, requiring careful coordination and standardization of security protocols to ensure the integrity of transactions and protect user data. 
 Competitive Landscape: Providers may perceive interoperability as a potential risk to their competitive advantage. Wallet providers often maintain closed ecosystems to retain customer loyalty and capitalize on their unique features or services. Achieving the right balance between collaboration and competition is crucial for fostering innovation while embracing interoperability. 
 
 The Role of Trust Registries 
<p>Trust registries will play a crucial role in enabling interoperability between digital wallets. They serve as central authorities for validating identities and credentials, and facilitating secure transactions, promoting seamless communication and trust within the ecosystem. By establishing a trusted network, organizations can leverage trust registries to verify wallet providers’ trustworthiness and adherence to security and regulatory standards.</p>
 Embracing a Connected Future through Digital Wallet Interoperability 
<p>Achieving interoperability among digital wallets requires collaborative efforts, shared standards, and technological advancements. We must recognize that while we have made significant progress, there is still work to accomplish. We can pave the way towards enhanced interoperability by establishing trust relationships through deliberate partnerships, adhering to standardized protocols, and leveraging technological advancements like Trust Registries.</p>
<p>Interoperability remains a critical goal for the digital wallet industry. Although challenges exist, we must persevere in fostering ecosystem-level interoperability. By embracing collaboration, standardization, and innovation, we can unlock the full potential of digital wallets and create a connected future that benefits users and providers alike.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>In a prior episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/thinking-beyond-client-server-architectures-with-daniel-hardman/">#53</a>), Daniel Hardman and I discussed the implications of choosing different architectural models for digital identity implementations. We explored the trade-offs involved in these decisions, particularly focusing on client-server architectures. In this particular discussion with Sam Curren and Darrell O’Donnell, we planned to delve deeper into this topic, examining real-world examples and discussing specific technologies and implementations, such as DIDComm and <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/open-id-4-vc-openid-for-verifiable-credentials/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC)</a>.</p>
<p>Our conversation starts around a key concept: the distinction between session-based and non-session-based activities in common computing tasks. Session-based activities, such as logging into a website or participating in a video conference, involve a server establishing a session with your device. This session allows the server to remember you as you navigate from page to page or interact with other participants. On the other hand, non-session-based activities, like sending and receiving emails or downloading files, don’t involve a lasting session. Your device sends a request, the server responds, and then the connection ends.</p>
<p>We’ve been witnessing growing adoption of verifiable credentials for both session-based and non-session-based scenarios. While session-based activities typically involve you (a consumer) presenting credentials to a verifier, non-session-based activities could allow you to play different roles in the verifiable credential trust triangle. For instance, you could be a holder of credentials, but you may also wish to be a verifier, to check the integrity of an email or a file, for example. This framing is one input that can be handy when trying to determine what digital credential exchange protocol is best suited for a specific context.</p>
<p>We then delved into both identity and non-identity use cases surrounding verifiable credentials. This exploration helped us distinguish where certain specifications, such as OpenID4VC can truly shine and offer significant benefits. For example, OpenID for verifiable credentials is particularly well-suited for identity-centric use cases. It allows users to log into websites and applications using verifiable credentials, similar to how they would log in with a username and password – this makes it a natural fit for identity-centric use cases and helps eliminate passwords, something we can all agree is needed. But in non-identity-centric use cases, such as issuing a product passport from an enterprise resource planning system or manufacturing management system, something like OpenID4VC would make less sense, and we may look at DIDComm-based protocols as enablers.</p>
<p>We also noted that verifiable credentials are just one tool in our arsenal to achieve digital trust. There are other types of trust tasks that you might want to use alongside verifiable credential interactions to build trust (e.g., secure messaging, asking a trust registry). This is an important distinction. For those aiming to provide digital trust infrastructure as a public good to citizens or consumers, it’s crucial to consider tools that foster digital trust beyond a specific identity system architecture. This also means thinking about protocols that offer the flexibility to go beyond digital credential exchanges. These protocols should provide additional foundational elements of digital trust that empower citizens or consumers in interactions that extend beyond the traditional client-server model prevalent in today’s digital world.</p>
<p>An interesting point that emerged during our discussion was the comparison between DIDComm and OpenID4VC. While it might seem like comparing apples and oranges, just as you can enjoy both fruits in one snack, you can also leverage both OpenID4VC and DIDComm in the same products. OpenID4VC can be a great mechanism to obtain identity credentials, which could then help bootstrap other downstream interactions using a protocol like DIDComm.</p>
 
<blockquote><p>DIDComm and OpenID can work together. If a DID with a DIDComm endpoint is passed during an OpenID for VC interaction, it can bootstrap into something more later. Also, if there’s an existing DIDComm interaction, it can tie the context together with the interactions happening in the OpenID4VC protocols.</p></blockquote>
<p>We concluded our conversation on a note of agreement that the most important thing is meeting the customers where they’re at. This means using technologies and protocols that the customer is already familiar with and comfortable using. Since many customers are already familiar with the process of logging into websites and applications using OpenID, it may make sense to use OpenID for verifiable credentials as well. This approach can help to reduce friction and increase adoption of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick soundbite from the conversation:</p>

<p><br>Looking ahead, I’m certain that there will be more thinking, collaboration, and convergence between different credential exchange protocols like DIDComm and OpenID4VC, and I eagerly look forward to it. I hope you find this conversation as interesting and engaging as I did.</p>

<p>The decentralized web, or Web3, has several key characteristics that differentiate it from Web2. We are moving beyond centralized platforms and walled gardens that hold users and their data hostage and are instead transitioning to a web that grants users agency - making them active participants in everything from data storage to access to distribution.</p><p>Here are seven core principles that define the decentralized web and their associated benefits: </p> 1) Decentralization <p>The obvious principle to start with is decentralization! In the decentralized web, users don't utilize a central authority to publish content or share files. Instead, they harness the power of the distributed web. </p><p>The distributed web refers to the underlying infrastructure that powers Web3, such as P2P networks, protocols like IPFS and Activity Pub, cryptography, and blockchain technologies. Utilizing decentralized tools and computing empowers users to decide how, when, and where to participate online, increasing their autonomy. It encourages user-owned identities, data, and digital assets, enabling individuals to manage and control their online presence without relying on third-party intermediaries.</p> 2) Privacy and Security  <p>Privacy is a closely-held value in the DWeb space. Users have been burned by centralized companies over and over again. From the onslaught of data breaches to the training of machine learning algorithms, users are tired of feeling violated. </p><p>The decentralized web attempts to curb this through minimal data collection, explicit and informed consent, end-to-end encryption, and cryptography. Furthermore, since there is no central server to attack in a system of interconnected nodes, it reduces the risk of single points of failure and makes it harder for malicious actors to compromise the system.</p> 3) Openness and Interoperability <p>The decentralized web promotes openness and interoperability. Open standards, protocols (like <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCAN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM</a>), and APIs foster secure and seamless information sharing across services and apps. As a result, the Web3 user experience continues to improve and even exceed that of Web2 in some instances, and users face fewer locked doors than ever before.</p> 4) Data Ownership and Control <p>The decentralized web promotes the idea that individuals should have ownership rights over their data, allowing them to decide how and where their information is stored, accessed, and shared. Ensuring users have a <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/credible-exit">credible exit</a> is vital. Distributed control and self-governance mean the decision-making power is spread across multiple participants (not one central authority), promoting a more democratic and open system. </p><p>For example, Fediverse social networks like Mastodon have individual servers run by community members. If at any time a user disagrees with the way a server is being managed, they can move their account to another Mastodon instance. </p> 5) Censorship Resistance <p>The decentralized web seeks to mitigate censorship and promote freedom of expression. By distributing content across multiple nodes, it becomes more challenging for any central authority to censor or restrict access to information. </p><p>In some countries, access to social media or information-sharing sites get blocked during political demonstrations. The intent is to stop the flow of communication and keep people in the dark, attempting to extinguish dissent. The decentralized web works against that, ensuring access remains as long as the information is available on at least one node.</p> 6) Trust and Transparency <p>Trust is a vital aspect of the decentralized web. The DWeb aims to establish trust through transparency by leveraging decentralized consensus mechanisms such as blockchain technology and <a href="https://jaygraber.medium.com/web3-is-self-certifying-9dad77fd8d81">self-certifying protocols</a> like cryptographic user identifiers and content-addressed data. Furthermore, persistent data structures, like IPFS's MerkleDag structure and CRDTs, mean users can always traverse the data to get to the root of the data. &nbsp;</p><p>By making transactions and actions publicly auditable, the decentralized web fosters an environment where trust can be built without relying on central authorities.</p> 7) Collaboration and Community <p>The decentralized web encourages collaboration and community-driven initiatives. Since there is often a crossover between the DWeb and open source, it's not uncommon to see users and developers banning together to build new features and solutions. For example, Fission is leading an effort to bring <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission/contribute/ipfs-media-support-for-mastodon-48315">IPFS support for media files on Mastodon</a> on Open Collective. </p> <p>In conclusion, the development of the decentralized web seeks not to commodify its users but rather to work in concert with them, thereby fostering a more equitable balance of power and superior user experience.</p>

<p>The advent of virtual assets has brought forth considerable challenges to the financial and regulatory landscape. A pivotal analysis conducted by MONEYVAL, the Council of Europe’s anti-money laundering body, reveals that its member nations grapple with the complexity of these challenges. As indicated by the report, approximately 80% of assessed members are only partially or not compliant with the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/financial-action-task-force-fatf/"> Financial Action Task Force (FATF) </a>Recommendation 15. This recommendation is an international standard designed to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, specifically in the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) sector.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, Coinfirm’s <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/blog/vasp-registrations-global-analysis/">latest VASPs analysis</a> provides a unique perspective on how MONEYVAL member jurisdictions are adapting to this new digital world. Among the MONEYVAL members, Estonia and Lithuania significantly stand out in terms of VASP registrations.</p>



<p>Estonia, a member of MONEYVAL, leads the global pack with an 11.4% share in VASP registrations, according to Coinfirm, whereas Lithuania holds a 7.2% share. This notable presence in the VASP industry indicates a robust<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/digital-asset/"> digital asset </a>sector in these countries and could potentially reflect their strides in implementing effective regulations, thereby shaping the trajectory of the digital asset industry globally.</p>



<p>However, the MONEYVAL report starkly uncovers the reality that a majority of its members are still struggling to fully implement the FATF Recommendation 15. The challenges primarily revolve around accurately determining the materiality of the VASP sector and the effective implementation of licensing, registration, and regulation.</p>



<p>The Coinfirm analysis also reveals a potentially troubling misinterpretation within the VASP landscape – less reputable firms often use VASP registration as a stamp of legitimacy, misleading customers who rarely understand the distinction between registration and actual regulation. This calls for stringent oversight and comprehensive public communication in managing the industry.</p>



<p>Detecting unlicensed/unregistered VASPs has also surfaced as a key concern in the MONEYVAL report, implying an underlying gap in the system that could be capitalized on by malevolent actors. Moreover, the oversight of cross-border transactions remains a complex issue, indicating a profound need for bolstered international collaboration and data sharing.</p>



<p>The MONEYVAL report also draws attention to the underwhelming number of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) received from VASPs. This finding underscores the importance of stringent regulation and supervision in heightening STR reporting awareness and volumes.</p>



<p>Technological tools for <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/products/blockchain-investigations/">blockchain investigations</a> play a crucial role in risk identification and assessment, with more advanced jurisdictions employing <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/products/coinfirm-analytics/">blockchain risk evaluation tools</a>. However, the MONEYVAL report emphasizes that reliance on these tools should not replace human analysis and expertise. The sophistication of these tools is even more critical when considering the prevalence of fraud and child sexual exploitation as underlying offences identified by VASPs.</p>



 <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MONEYVAL202312_VASP-Typologies-Report.pdf">MONEYVAL202312_VASP-Typologies-Report</a><a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MONEYVAL202312_VASP-Typologies-Report.pdf">Download</a> 



<p>In conclusion, understanding the interplay between regulatory landscapes and VASP registrations is essential to decipher the intricacies of the digital asset sector. The insights from both the MONEYVAL report and Coinfirm’s analysis offer invaluable direction for jurisdictions, emphasizing the need for robust regulation, increased public education, and continual development of technological tools and expertise. As the sector continues to evolve, continuous dialogue and collaboration between the industry, regulators, and law enforcement agencies will be instrumental in fostering a sustainable and secure future for virtual assets.</p>

<p></p><p>With the emergence of Web5 comes the exciting possibilities for individuals seeking more control over their online identities, data and content. With Web5, traditional authentication methods are no longer the sole means of verifying identity and ownership. Instead, users can leverage <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> to establish their digital presence while retaining full control over their data. Let's explore how this revolutionizes authentication and content ownership as we know it. </p><p>Decentralized Identifiers, or DIDs, lie at the heart of Web5's identity management. DIDs provide individuals with unique and globally resolvable identifiers that are persistent and always under their control. By using a DID, users establish their online presence, similar to a username. This paradigm shift empowers individuals to manage and control their personal information, granting them the freedom to partake in various online platforms all while owning the content and data they share.</p><p>Web5 applications eliminate the need for centralized authorities to authenticate us through methods such as two-factor authentication or username/password combinations. Instead, DIDs, alongside data associated with DIDs like Verifiable Credentials, become the foundation of trust. When users interact with Web5 applications, they present claims associated with their DIDs as proof of identity. These applications can verify the authenticity of the user's attestations without the need for traditional username/password authentication.</p> How It Works<a title="Direct link to How It Works">​</a> <p>Let's delve into the technical aspects of this. When you acquire a DID, it comes with a public-private key pair. Your DID can be resolved by anyone into a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers#what-is-it">DID document</a>, containing your public key, similar to a username that can be copied and pasted into a login screen. </p><p>However, to prove that you are the rightful owner of the DID and it is indeed you logging in, your private key becomes crucial. Your private key should never be shared, and it allows you to generate a digital signature. Whenever you author a message, it automatically carries a digital signature. To verify the same message, it requires the public key. For example, when logging into example.com, sending a message and successfully authenticating it, the online platform will utilize your public key for verification. If the verification process is successful, they can confirm that you are the rightful owner of the given DID, without ever needing your private key.</p><p>With Web5 authentication, you can effortlessly create an account, free from the hassle of coming up with a new handle or hoping your existing usernames are available. Instead, you can embrace the simplicity of using your DID. Your DID becomes a personalized "username" that you can use to log into any supporting app's login screen.</p><p>Your DID serves as a URI (Unique Resource Identifier) that leads to your DID document, acting as a special hub providing a glimpse into your digital identity. Within your DID document, the application utilizes the URIs as guideposts, leading them to your <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">DWNs (Decentralized Web Nodes)</a> which store your content and data.</p><p>This user-friendly approach relieves you from the burdens of creating new content or manually downloading from one platform to upload on another. All the content to which you have granted the application access to will be readily available for the application to read/write to, simply by logging in with your DID.</p> Benefits of Authentication with Web5<a title="Direct link to Benefits of Authentication with Web5">​</a> <p>One of the biggest benefits of this is the shift in content ownership. In traditional web applications, content is often stored on centralized servers, placing it under the control of the service provider you've created an account with or you're logged into. However, in Web5, individuals maintain ownership and control over their content. When users create and publish content within a Web5 application, their DIDs are linked to that content, establishing a clear link between the creator and their work. The user's content is stored in their own datastore, a DWN, as opposed to stored on the platform they’ve logged into. This ownership grants users greater autonomy and enables them to decide how their content is shared, used, and monetized.</p><p>Another benefit is the enhanced security this type of content ownership and authentication provides. With traditional web applications, data breaches and unauthorized access are a common problem that pose a significant risk to the user and the company that holds this data. In Web5, the distributed nature of the infrastructure gives the users full ownership over their data/content that is stored and protected in their DWN. By reducing the reliance on centralized servers, where multiple people have access to a user’s data the impact of potential security breaches is lower. Empowering users to have more confidence in their online interactions.</p><p>Web5 represents a significant leap forward in the evolution of the web, redefining its landscape as we know it.

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>Today we announced <a href="https://aka.ms/EntraMomentSecurityblog">significant milestones for identity and network access</a>, including the news that Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is becoming Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to simplify secure access experiences for everyone, the rebranding of Azure AD to Microsoft Entra ID is designed to make it easier for you to use and navigate the unified and expanded Microsoft Entra portfolio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to assure you that your work protecting your organization, customers, partners, and the investments you’ve made in deploying Azure AD will continue uninterrupted. All configurations and integrations will continue to work as they do today, without any action needed from you. You’ll see the new name start appearing in Microsoft product experiences In August 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No action is needed from you&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can continue to rely on familiar Azure AD capabilities accessed through the Azure portal, Microsoft 365 admin center, and the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Entra admin center</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Only the name is changing&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make the transition seamless for you and your organization, there are no changes to any Azure AD capabilities, APIs, login URLs, PowerShell cmdlets, Microsoft authentication library (MSAL), developer experiences, or tooling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All licensing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">plans and pricing for Azure AD</a> and Microsoft 365 plans that include Azure AD remain the same, with only the display names for the licensing plans changing. The summary below provides easy mapping from our current Azure AD SKU names to the new SKU names under Microsoft Entra ID.  Service plan display names will change on October 1, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Premium P1 and P2 offers are becoming Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2, also included in Microsoft 365 E3 and E5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the new name rolls out, all Azure AD features will also move under the new name. For example, Azure AD Conditional Access will become Microsoft Entra Conditional Access, Azure AD MFA will become Microsoft Entra MFA, Azure AD single sign-on will become Microsoft Entra single sign-on, and so on. If you are a content creator, developer, or partner who needs detailed renaming guidance, please read the Microsoft Learn article “<a href="https://aka.ms/aadrebrandFAQ">New name for Azure Active Directory</a>.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Timeline for the Azure AD name change&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today’s announcement kicks off a month of informing all Azure AD customers about the upcoming change. You’ll see the news on Tech Community, Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Learn, and other communication channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August 2023, the Microsoft Entra ID name will&nbsp;start replacing the Azure AD name across Microsoft product experiences including <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">the newly upgraded Microsoft Entra admin center</a>, Azure portal, Microsoft 365 admin center, and other Microsoft commercial products, documentation, learning content, and websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect the name change from Azure AD to Microsoft Entra ID to be complete across most product experiences by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why we’re changing Azure AD to Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s been a year since we introduced Microsoft Entra as a new product family for all our identity and access products, bringing to life our expanded vision for secure access. At the time, the Microsoft Entra product family included Azure AD plus two new products—Microsoft Entra Permissions Management, a cloud infrastructure entitlement management product, and Microsoft Entra Verified ID, a decentralized identity solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve added several new products into the Microsoft Entra family—Microsoft Entra ID Governance, Microsoft Entra Workload ID, and the new products we introduced today, <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2FEntraMomentSecurityblog&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C041ee42008a6480fec1608db6c361992%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638222751861869262%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=yqCK2jJHQgpJKTrWV3GcRDqYuReXyuKnfMWtESxPFBA%3D&amp;reserved=0">Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access</a>. All to advance our promise to deliver a complete repertoire of solutions that provide secure access for any identity to any resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers have embraced new Microsoft Entra products while continuing to rely on our hero cloud identity product, Azure AD, that currently protects over 720,000 organizations worldwide. We see that most customers, just like <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1478082375112165122-avanade-partner-professional-services-verifiable-credentials">Avanade</a> and <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1508854534910834689-condatis-partner-professional-services-entra-verified-id">Condatis</a>, successfully deploy our new products alongside Azure AD, bringing to life our vision for unified secure access with Microsoft Entra.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unifying all identity and access capabilities under the Microsoft Entra name will make it easier to navigate and use all products and capabilities in our expanded portfolio, ensuring that you have the strongest protections for any access point.&nbsp;We’re also standardizing the use of the term “ID” for all our identity products: Microsoft Entra ID, ID Protection, ID Governance, External ID, Workload ID and Verified ID. The visual below represents the future state of Microsoft Entra portfolio once we finalize the new name roll-out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 You’re an important part of this journey&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you have been with us on this journey since the earliest days of identity and access management, starting with Windows Active Directory, then embracing digital transformation and adopting our cloud identity—Azure AD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your feedback and insights guided the evolution of identity security beyond directory-based identity management to a connected global fabric of people, devices, apps, and digital workloads—all needing secure access to anyone, anywhere, at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’d like your help spreading the word about the name change and implementing it in your own experiences. If you’re a content creator, author of internal documentation for IT or identity security admins, developer of Azure AD–enabled apps, independent software vendor, or Microsoft partner, we hope you’ll use the <a href="https://aka.ms/aadrebrandFAQ">naming guidance in Microsoft Learn</a> to make the change to Microsoft Entra ID by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are grateful for your continued partnership in building a safer world for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/us-consumers-prefer-seamless-and-fully-integrated-payment-experiences-new-entrust-survey-reveals">recent survey</a>, we collected feedback from 1,000 consumers in the United States. The resulting report gives an extensive overview on the state of the American consumer regarding payment methods and how they prefer to interact with their financial institution.</p>
<p>Here are some key takeaways:</p>
 
 Consumers trust credentials they can control and are able to access across channels. 
 Digital card controls increase lift across physical and digital credentials. 
 
<p>We discovered that if a financial institution offers their cardholders in-app card and transaction controls, like for example the ability to set a threshold for payments or the ability to disable a card, the card is more likely to sit “top of wallet” and to become the preferred payment for e-commerce transactions.</p>
<p>More specifically, 85% of respondents said card controls in the payment app would make them more likely to choose that card as their preferred payment method. App-based card and transaction controls help cardholders take control and manage their digital and physical cards without bank staff intervention. This self-service model brings tremendous value to cardholders in terms of convenience and efficiency across card formats and, in turn, drives lift for banks.</p>
<p>With card and transaction controls, cardholders have more control over:</p>
 
 Their card: The cardholder can block and/or unblock their card. 
 Their transactions: The cardholder can allow or disable different types of transactions, like contactless, e-commerce, or magstripe payments. They also get more control over their transactions thanks to threshold alerts that they can set, and they will be notified if the limit has been reached. 
 
<p>Card and transaction controls are a unique opportunity for banks, as well. They allow them to:</p>
 
 Ensure their top-of-wallet status, both for physical and digital payment cards. 
 Differentiate themselves from the competition by giving more power and self-service capability to the cardholder. 
 
<p>Additionally, for an extra level of security, card and transaction controls allow cardholders to deactivate lost or stolen cards via the bank’s application quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>We recommend banks offer card and transaction controls that allow the cardholder to manage their card(s) on their own, via their bank app. In addition to enabling top-of-wallet status for the bank, these offerings also enhance the value proposition of the bank app itself. By enhancing the bank app with these digital card features, the app becomes the center of the relationship between the bank and the cardholder.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to share the public preview of <a href="https://aka.ms/restrictedmanagementaus">restricted management administrative units</a>, a new role-based access control (RBAC) feature in Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What you can do with restricted management administrative units&nbsp; 
<p>With restricted management administrative units, you can now designate specific users, security groups, or devices in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant that you want to protect from modification by tenant-level administrators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some situations in which this is useful:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 You want to protect sensitive user accounts, such as C-level executives, from being able to have their password or multifactor authentication settings changed by regular helpdesk administrators.&nbsp; 
 
 
 You want to ensure that certain user accounts, security groups, or devices from a specific country can only be modified by designated administrators from that country. 
 
 
 You have specific security groups granting access to sensitive data and you want to restrict who can modify the membership only to a small set of administrators. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By placing your sensitive objects in a restricted management administrative unit, your tenant-level administrators will not be able to modify them.&nbsp; Only the administrators you explicitly assign to the scope of the administrative unit itself will be able to make changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant-scoped and other admin unit-scoped administrators are blocked from resetting executives' account passwords.&nbsp; Only the explicitly designated Executive admin can manage these accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a much easier way to protect your sensitive objects than having to identify and scope every single role assignment in the tenant just to your non-sensitive objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to use restricted management administrative units in your tenant&nbsp; 
<p>Here’s a quick example of how restricted management administrative units make it a breeze to secure a few sensitive user accounts in your tenant:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Under Roles &amp; admins, select Admin units and click Add to create a new administrative unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Set the Restricted management administrative unit setting to “Yes” and click Next: Assign Roles&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Add the designated administrator(s) who should be the helpdesk administrators for these sensitive accounts (these are the people who you do want to manage the accounts) and finish creating the administrative unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Now, you can go ahead and add the sensitive user accounts to the restricted management administrative unit you just created (just like you would for any other administrative unit).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s it!&nbsp; Now the sensitive user accounts can only be modified by the users you designated, regardless of how many other administrative roles may be assigned in your tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 represents a substantial shift in UK’s crypto regulation, establishing comprehensive oversight and defining the range of digital&nbsp;assets.  The Act successfully strikes a balance between security and innovation, emphasizing clarity, consumer protection, and consistent growth in the rapidly expanding UK crypto&nbsp;market.  On the flip side, the Act could also potentially stifle innovation and present compliance challenges in the rapidly evolving crypto industry.  <p>On June 29, 2023, a key event for UK’s cryptocurrency sector took place. The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/29/enacted">Financial Services and Markets Act 2023</a>, or FSMA 2023 for short, was officially approved by King&nbsp;Charles.</p><p>This momentous event signified a dramatic shift in the status of crypto trading, moving it from the fringes into the mainstream as a regulated financial activity in the UK. This monumental change was akin to the dawn of a new era, officially placing crypto trading under the UK’s regulatory oversight.</p><p>Why is this such a big deal? Well, it’s because this Act isn’t just another piece of legislation. It’s a whole lot more. It’s a comprehensive blueprint charting out the future course for the crypto industry in the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p><p>And the real cherry on top, according to local crypto experts, is the establishment of new objectives for the heavyweight regulatory bodies — the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).</p><p>With the stage set on the importance of FSMA 2023, let’s shift our focus toward the scale of the UK’s crypto industry. By grasping the size and potential of this burgeoning sector, we can better comprehend why this Act stands to have such a profound&nbsp;impact.</p> The UK Crypto Industry: A Cursory Health&nbsp;Check <p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/uk-growing-crypto-industry-top-markets/">Reports</a> published in April 2023 predict the global crypto market to gross nearly US$38 billion in revenue in 2023. If achieved, it will be a 105% growth year-over-year.</p><p>The United Kingdom is the fastest-growing among the top five markets in the crypto space, including the United States, Germany, Japan, and&nbsp;Canada.</p><p>Studies suggest that the United Kingdom’s crypto market grew by more than 450% between 2021 and 2023. The jump in market size exceeds the United States or Switzerland by significant margins. The United States crypto market grew by 120% during the same period, while Switzerland registered a growth of&nbsp;80%.</p><p>Between 2022 and 2023, the United Kingdom’s crypto market size grew from US$0.84 billion to US$1.89 billion, a growth of more than 125%. When it comes to the volume of individual users, the number is more than 3&nbsp;million.</p><p>From all possible perspectives, cryptocurrencies occupy a significant part of the United Kingdom’s financial market landscape. And therefore, any change or shift in the regulatory provisions is met with sincere analysis, both from the providers and consumers.</p> Rules and Regulations Governing the Crypto Market in the United&nbsp;Kingdom <p>The most crucial piece of regulation that would have a decisive bearing on the entire crypto market in the United Kingdom is the Financial Services and Markets Act&nbsp;2023.</p><p>The implications of this groundbreaking initiative are poised to fundamentally reshape the UK’s financial landscape, promising to redefine not only the country’s macroeconomic scene and business environment but also its interplay with the global financial order. And for the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry, the implications could be profound.</p><p>A crucial part of this initiative will be restructuring the retained EU law (REUL), creating a new, comprehensive framework. This could potentially include digital asset regulations, which would directly impact the operation of cryptocurrencies in the UK, bringing about a regulatory paradigm&nbsp;shift.</p><p>The Act also seeks to recalibrate the UK’s legislative structure, particularly the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR), using insights gathered from the HM Treasury’s Wholesale Markets Review. In the dynamic world of digital currencies, such a recasting of rules might prove pivotal. It isn’t just about creating rules but about crafting an efficient, responsive system that truly aligns with the nation’s financial needs, including those of the crypto&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Moreover, it will establish a robust framework for identifying and designating critical third parties. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this might involve regulatory considerations for crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and more, which are crucial to secure and facilitate transactions on the blockchain.</p><p>A key component of this transformation is the comprehensive reform of the financial promotion regime. This reform could influence how cryptocurrency products and services are marketed and offered to the public, possibly creating a more conducive environment for crypto-based innovation and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>What’s potentially even more compelling for the crypto industry is the new mandate set for the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) and PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority). With new objectives outlined, these regulatory bodies may have an expanded role in overseeing the evolving crypto market, ensuring it operates transparently, fairly, and in the best interests of investors.</p><p>The scope of this regulation is indeed vast, with each facet potentially impacting the cryptocurrency industry. This represents a bold stride towards a comprehensive and updated financial landscape in the&nbsp;UK.</p> FSMA 2023 Implications for Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The FSMA brought in stablecoins or <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1079348/Stablecoin_FMISAR_Consultation.pdf">digital settlement assets</a>, as referred to them in the bill, within the regulatory scope and initiated them for use as a recognized payment&nbsp;means.</p><p>Notably, the bill achieved two significant things. While it proposed regulating crypto assets, it also promoted&nbsp;them.</p> The Proposed Regulation of Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The UK’s HM Treasury is pursuing four well-defined policy objectives in its mission to regulate crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>First, it aims to foster growth, innovation, and competition in the domestic market. Second, it aspires to enable consumers to make well-informed decisions by comprehending the associated risks. Third, the initiative seeks to safeguard the financial stability of the UK market. And finally, it’s dedicated to protecting the integrity of the UK&nbsp;market.</p><p>In pursuit of these goals, the UK government plans to keep a vigilant eye on the evolving technologies, assessing potential risks on a case-by-case basis. They are committed to ensuring the regulations do not stifle the industry’s innovative potential, preferring to intervene where the risks and opportunities are most pronounced.</p><p>Evolving Framework and Phased Implementation</p><p>Recognizing the dynamic nature of digital assets, the UK government intends to create a regulatory framework that can accommodate the rapidly developing crypto market. The process of regulating crypto assets will be phased, with the first stage already in effect since January 2022 under the AML/CFT registration regime.</p><p>This regime, aligning with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations (MLR) 2017, applies to providers offering crypto asset exchange and custody wallet services in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Expanded Regulatory Coverage</p><p>Under the new law, the government plans to extend regulatory oversight to crypto asset activities.</p><p>The FCA will ensure that promotions relating to crypto assets are clear, fair, and not misleading. Further, the government plans to regulate fiat-backed stablecoins for payments.</p><p>The second phase will introduce a broader regulatory regime encompassing trading, investment, and other high-risk areas.</p><p>Defining Crypto Assets and Compliance</p><p>The FSM Act provides a comprehensive definition of crypto assets, facilitating legal recognition and regulatory compliance. It encompasses a broad spectrum of digital assets, including exchange tokens, utility tokens, NFTs, stablecoins, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Following the FSMA’s introduction, crypto asset firms are now expected to adhere to the same financial crime standards applicable to traditional financial service activities such as&nbsp;banks.</p><p>Issuance, Trading, and Promotion</p><p>The UK government also plans to establish an issuance and disclosure regime for crypto assets and plans to treat the public offers of crypto assets <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1133404/TR_Privacy_edits_Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_vP.pdf">akin to security offerings</a> in principle. And trading platforms for crypto assets will be subject to consumer protection, operational resilience, and data reporting requirements.</p><p>Promotions of crypto assets will be tightly controlled, too. Only an authorized person can communicate the promotion or approve it if communicated by an unauthorized person. Additional promotional aspects include risk warning statements, cooling-off periods for first-time investors, and record-keeping requirements.</p><p>In essence, the FSMA serves as a comprehensive regulatory mechanism to ensure the crypto asset landscape in the UK is secure and efficient and promotes innovation.</p> The UK Regulations from a Global Perspective <p>Given their timing and nature of enforcement, it is quite natural to draw parallels between the FSMA and MiCA in the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>With the European Parliament’s approval of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, the European Union countries are set to introduce structural governance practices to crypto firms. MiCA, apart from looking at crypto assets from AML/CFT perspectives, also aims to prevent panic selling of crypto assets that could lead to sharp falls in prices and a potential domino effect on other&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Recognizing the need for similar measures, the UK’s FSMA is also striving to carve out a clear and comprehensive regulatory landscape in the realm of crypto assets. Like the MiCA, the FSMA fosters a sense of clarity and transparency.</p><p>Both frameworks understand the increasing importance of stablecoins in the digital asset universe and aim to bring them under regulatory oversight.</p><p>Moreover, the areas of regulation don’t stop at stablecoins for either of these frameworks. Both the FSMA and the MiCA have set their sights on a wider array of crypto activities. This includes the regulation of exchange tokens and utility tokens, as well as custody activities, trading venue operations, and issuance and intermediation services.</p><p>Also, akin to the HM Treasury, the EU aims to set up a clearly defined authorization route for firms to safeguard them from AML/CFT activities.</p><p>However, there are areas of divergence between the two regulatory frameworks. The MiCA, for instance, is more comprehensive than the FSMA, as its purview extends to non-fiat-backed stablecoins, broadening the regulatory net and allowing for more comprehensive crypto market oversight.</p><p>Another distinct difference lies in the domains of advice and portfolio management. While the MiCA has sought to regulate these areas, the UK’s legislative approach, at present, has not ventured into these territories.</p><p>Both MiCA and FSMA are at nascent stages in their life cycle. Therefore, it would be premature to comment on the impact they would have on the crypto market. However, legislations often adopt best practices from each other, and the same is expected to happen in the cases of the MiCA in the EU and FSMA in the UK. Crypto regulations in the UK will likely learn from similar use cases around the world and enrich themselves with available results.</p><p>As the world of crypto-assets continues to evolve and mature, regulatory frameworks such as the FSMA and the MiCA will play a crucial role in shaping the sector’s trajectory. Their shared ambitions and unique divergences hint at an exciting, dynamic future for crypto asset regulation.</p> Conclusion Thoughts <p>As the digital frontier continues to expand, the United Kingdom is taking a decisive step into the future with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023. With its bold vision, the Act reshapes the landscape of the crypto industry, nurturing an environment of transparency, innovation, and security.</p><p>While setting a new benchmark for global regulatory practices, it also opens the door to boundless opportunities. By placing the sector under regulatory oversight, the Act invites trust and stability, strengthening the relationship between investors and the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>However, it’s not a unilateral growth story. With this regulation, the UK has also taken on the mammoth task of constantly evolving with an industry known for its development speed. The Act’s success will greatly rely on the regulators’ ability to stay one step ahead, protecting investors while fostering innovation.</p><p>The interplay between the UK’s FSMA 2023 and the EU’s MiCA regulation is also a space to watch, potentially offering fascinating insights into harmonizing regulatory frameworks in a global context. As the ripple effects of the FSMA 2023 start to surface, stakeholders worldwide will be keenly watching the UK for lessons and precedents.</p><p>This legislation indeed signifies a new era, not only for the UK but for global crypto regulations as well. With it, the UK has boldly stepped into unchartered territory, setting the stage for what could be the dawn of a new epoch in the crypto universe. The world watches as the UK shapes its crypto destiny, wielding the double-edged sword of opportunity and responsibility.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 Re:Permissioning the City — Unlocking cities’ growing underutilised spatial assets for an emergent civic&nbsp;economy <p>In recent years, various macro-level shifts, including public health crises, demographic changes, and climate risks, have had cascading effects that compelled us to reconsider how we govern, plan, and operate our cities. These changes have prompted us to question the prevailing notion of space as a mere real estate asset defined by ownership and rental agreements, urging us to explore alternative perspectives on urban&nbsp;space.</p>  What if we could foster reciprocal, stewardship-based agreements and perceive space as a foundational ‘civic’ asset capable of generating positive outcomes for the entire&nbsp;city?  How might we harness the capabilities of citizens to shape our urban environments and create opportunities for emergent uses that have the potential to revitalise our&nbsp;cities?  <p>In this article, we attempt to explore these questions of urban governance and planning as we outline our work on “Re:Permissioning the City”. This experiment in urban spatial governance is something that we have been developing in the past two years, in collaboration with Daegu Metropolitan City in South Korea, along with other collaborators around the&nbsp;world.</p>  Part 1 — Context: In this part, we describe the broader context of the experiment and attempt to locate the significance of Re:Permissioning the City as a resident-led urban governance system  In Part 2 — Proposal: In part 2, we dig deeper into the different layers of the proposal, elaborating on what we call a “protocols-driven permissions system”  In Part 3 — Pilot: In the last part, we close with our plans for a pilot project in Daegu, and an open invitation to cities and organisations around the world to develop this new type of civic infrastructure with&nbsp;us   PART 1 — Context  City as an emergent ecosystem <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities">Jane Jacobs (1961)</a> believed cities should function like ecosystems, prioritising diversity as a core value for urban planners. She advocated for multiple choices, opportunities, and encounters that would allow people to satisfy their diverse desires and interests. More than half a century later, in Tokyo, Japan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emergent-Tokyo-Patterns-Spontaneous-Micro-Urbanism/dp/1951541324">Jorge Almazán and Studiolab (2022)</a> explored the concept of a ‘human-scale urban ecosystem’, which emphasises light-touch urban planning that allows spontaneous and emergent spaces to&nbsp;develop.</p>Mixed-use neighbourhoods in&nbsp;Tokyo<p>Situated in the interstices of top-down modernist grids and corporate-led urbanism of the 1980s, Tokyo’s emergent spaces (located in alleyways and underneath overground train tracks) represent a dynamic urban environment of order and functionality built from the bottom-up. The conditions for emergent urbanism include urban planning and design that makes intentional allowances for organic growth, as well as affordances for micro-level interactions and relationality — think of urban residents and the spaces that they create as birds in a flock that, over time, builds coherence and order by simply responding to the movements of their neighbours.</p><p>However, current bureaucracies aren’t allowing that full emergence to&nbsp;occur.</p>Commercial buildings under threat of increasing vacancy&nbsp;rates Planning for emergence in the post-pandemic city <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, cities worldwide underwent a silent but significant transformation to adapt to the changing needs of their residents. The explosion of remote work, mixed with often higher interest rates, single-use zoning and other contributing factors, has seen a reduction in commercial space use, leaving a massive trail of empty shops, restaurants and offices in inner urban areas. Montreal has seen its <a href="https://financialpost.com/fp-work/empty-office-towers-remote-work-montreal/wcm/7ab7c7f4-900f-45e3-8072-23f09cd6c20c/amp/">office-vacancy rates double from 2019 figures</a>, and the change is even more pronounced in megacities like New York City, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/10/opinion/nyc-office-vacancy-playground-city.html">the equivalent of 26 Empire State Buildings could fit into Manhattan’s empty office spaces</a> or 74,582,671 square feet. With similar trends around the world, including in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/sweden-property-crisis-deepens-with-one-of-the-biggest-landlords-on-the-brink">Sweden </a>and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-06/legoland-korea-s-default-adds-to-risks-for-nation-s-developers">South Korea</a>, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-23/commercial-real-estate-reset-is-causing-distress-from-san-francisco-to-hong-kong">commercial real estate market is approaching a perilous precipice</a> that requires radical reimaginings.</p><p>The office as we know it shows no sign of returning to pre-pandemic reality. Researchers are calling this phenomenon a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/10/opinion/nyc-office-vacancy-playground-city.html">“shift from vocation to recreation”</a> and that the economic futures of cities rely on embracing the opportunities opening with this transition.</p><p>At the same time, the public health risks of indoor spaces during the pandemic provoked a need for more open-air public spaces, which were used for COVID testing, vaccine distribution and emergency medical care, as well as permitted small-scale civic activities. With strict social distancing rules in place, cycling, walking and personal mobility devices replaced public transportation. Several cities in Europe saw the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/covid-19-change-cities-public-transport-work-from-home-lockdown-aviation-social-distance-overpopulation/">expansion of cycling and pedestrian infrastructures</a>, which became permanent after the pandemic and outdoor seating areas in restaurants and cafes became a common feature. During this time, concepts such as ‘15-minute cities’ emphasising the all-inclusive, walkable, healthy, sustainable and pleasantly dense neighbourhoods were embraced by mayors around the world from Daegu to&nbsp;Paris.</p><p>As cities implemented measures to limit inbound travellers and in-person social interaction, life in the city underwent a dramatic change. In Barcelona, the quiet streets of COVID-19 — devoid of tourists, offered a glimpse of what had been overlooked in the business-as-usual mode of the city. Shortly after pandemic measures began, citizens published an open letter to the mayor called the “<a href="https://manifiesto.perspectivasanomalas.org/en/manifiesto-2/">Manifesto for the reorganisation of the city after the COVID-19</a>”, which included new demands for (re)naturalising the city, decommodifying housing, reorganisation of mobility, and degrowth.</p><p>At the heart of this request is a collective desire for communities to be able to shape the city they are a part of and prioritise other indicators of well-being and sustainability over economic interests. One of the suggestions in the manifesto, the reappropriation of streets for children’s play as opposed to “artificially organising dedicated play areas”, is a good example of bottom-up, light-touch planning that allows for emergence. It reflects a growing desire for a radically different utilisation of the city — one that privileges ‘play’ over&nbsp;‘work’.</p><p>In the context of the post-pandemic (and mid-pandemic) reorganisation of urban space outlined above, we began an experiment called “<a href="https://www.permissioning.city">Re:Permissioning the City</a>” in collaboration with Daegu Metropolitan City in South Korea. Developed initially as a proposal for the <a href="https://www.daegu.go.kr/english/index.do?menu_link=/icms/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do&amp;menu_id=00000844&amp;bbsId=BBS_00131&amp;nttId=517463">Bloomberg Mayors Challenge in 2021</a>, the concept has since developed further in conversations with various cities around the world. In short, Re:Permissioning the City is a citizen-led governance and permissions system which interrogates how we use, manage and share urban&nbsp;space.</p><p>It takes as a starting point the numerous vacant and underutilised spaces that opened up due to the pandemic and larger demographic and industrial restructuring, with the intention to aggregate and unlock them for civic uses. Core to this concept is the light-touch, flexible, and multi-use planning approach by the local government that permits citizen-driven, creative appropriation of space. Enabling this new capacity of the city is a new governance model operated through a digital system that facilitates autonomous decision-making around when and how a space can be used, for what and by whom. In the following parts, we will describe in detail how this system would be organised in terms of functions and design principles, and illustrate its significance as it attempts to build upon the existing legacy of experiments in temporary use, meanwhile spaces and tactical urbanism.</p> PART 2 — Proposal  Protocols-driven permissions system <p>When we first began exploring the concept of a not-for-profit <a href="https://www.hel.fi/en/decision-making/grants-and-premises/book-a-space">‘Airbnb-like platform’ for publicly owned space</a> in Daegu with the local government, municipal administrators were very keen on the idea of digitising and automating the permission process. In the case of Daegu, leasing a (publicly-owned) space involved lengthy bureaucratic processes that involved multiple departments across neighbourhoods, districts and city levels. In other words, procedures for temporarily renting a space in a public park differed from a room in a community centre or a stage in a traditional market, and streamlining the process required a new kind of central authority.</p><p>Our challenge was then to push the thinking further from a centralised, government-operated permission system to envisioning distributed, community-driven permissions. After a series of workshops with civil servants and communities to design the blueprint of the permissions system, we have identified the following design questions to take forward as we develop and test&nbsp;further.</p><p>Protocols for a self-governing space: How can the system facilitate new governance of urban space that is based on discursive (as opposed to coercive) practices of collaborative rule-making and trust-based compliance? How can we encourage a culture of stewardship towards shared urban assets that goes beyond traditional rental or ownership agreements?</p>  Spatial protocols for governing the use of&nbsp;spaces  The permissioning space  Human-machine feedback&nbsp;loops  Towards a protocols-driven governance  <p>Measuring spatial outcomes: How can the system encourage the repurposing of spaces to drive positive (neighbourhood/city) outcomes? Specifically, how can we develop the tools to measure, monitor and aggregate the spatial impact of civic activities in the city — impact that is aligned with the city’s larger objectives?</p>  Linking spatial data to city-wide strategies  Potential use&nbsp;cases   Protocols for a self-governing space <p>A common practice regarding the management of publicly-owned spaces is that they are ‘governed’ by public authorities and ‘managed’ by local entities, which can range from district or neighbourhood-level government entities to non-profit organisations entrusted with the responsibility. This means that the purpose of such spaces is pre-determined by certain policies or mandates of the government, and often through a lengthy public procurement process, an entity will be assigned to operate and manage the space for a specific period of time. This was a significant pain point in the case of Daegu, as it posed a barrier to aggregating available spaces and centralising their permissions. Also, on the part of the local entity, the selective procurement process carried significant ethical and administrative burdens.</p><p>The idea of a self-governing, demand-driven space enabled by flexible planning regulations (mixed-use, light-touch) appealed to civil servants and citizens alike. It allowed civil servants to be unburdened by the responsibility to select who gets to manage and operate the space and citizens the ability to shape the use of spaces based on their changing needs. However, for such a concept to be used in practice, many layers of standards and mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure accountability, transparency, safety, and fairness. Below we describe how these layers can be defined and organised.</p><p>Spatial protocols for governing the use of&nbsp;spaces</p>  General standards<br>Taking inspiration from London’s <a href="https://www.hackneynights.co.uk/">Hackney Nights venue accreditation scheme</a>, which sets out a new standard for nighttime spaces based on inclusivity, safety, well-being, and sustainability, and accredits venues that follow these standards, Re:Permissioning the City system will also aim to set certain general standards that govern the listing of spaces in order to lower thresholds to entry. In effect, the system will serve as a verification tool that filters spaces that adhere to certain standards and principles in a given&nbsp;region.  Site-specific standards<br>Each space is embedded in its unique and relational context — spatial histories and stories, physical conditions, materialities, users, neighbours, historical uses, and possibilities for the future. The unique conditions that make up the characteristics of a space form certain ‘site-specific standards’ that determine how the space can be accessed and used, by whom and for what purpose. These standards act as a kind of profile that is unique to each space. As spatial data accumulates over time, based on activities and its users, it will serve as a form of digital spatial memory that influences the decisions that are made about the space, including permissions for&nbsp;access.  Community standards<br>As space stewards, citizens agree to community standards, including codes of conduct, shared principles and values that make explicit the behavioural standards and responsibilities of civic actors engaging with the&nbsp;space.  <p>The permissioning space</p><p>These three layers of standards form what we call the ‘permissioning space’ or ‘contracting space’. This is both a discursive space where negotiations occur and a decision-making space where micro-contracts are easily signed electronically to enable the use of spaces. Clauses in this micro-contract are formed from the standards described above, but these are continuously evolving through the iterations made through peer-to-peer nudging, negotiation and validation. There are numerous ways to test how this permissioning space can operate. Currently, we are exploring the use of a conversational chatbot that takes on the character of the space and functions as an interface between itself and the&nbsp;users.</p><p>Human-machine feedback&nbsp;loops</p><p>Standards and shared protocols require an important additional step, which oversees compliance and enforcement of said standards. New developments in sensing and monitoring technology and the ability to record and distribute real-time feedback may enable a different kind of compliance model that is more automated and autonomous, as opposed to top-down, analogue and penalty-based systems. Imagine noise, air, and light sensors in the space, monitoring and auto-adjusting for the optimal well-being of its occupants and neighbours. Peer-to-peer feedback systems, such as digital social ‘nudges’ and ratings, as well as shared incentives for repair and maintenance, can also help with voluntary compliance and collective care/stewardship of spaces. A new type of spatial compliance system that ensures the sustainability of public spaces would need to be balanced and make use of both machine and human capabilities.</p><p>Towards a protocols-driven governance</p><p>In a nutshell, Re:Permissioning the City is an experiment in technologically assisted collective governance and regulation. We are particularly interested in exploring how ‘rules’ and ‘rule-making’ can evolve and adapt to a complex system that requires flexibility and responsiveness in the design of our societal structures.</p>  The existing ‘rules-driven’ governance system operates on predefined rules set by a central authority such as the government. Rules are meant to be applied universally, and the system struggles to make allowances for ambiguity and emergent alternatives that fall within the grey areas of regulation.  The second step in this gradual transformation is what we call ‘parametrics-driven’ governance, which takes advantage of technology to allow more flexibility and adaptability. Instead of a simple yes/no or right/wrong equation, real-time sensing technologies allow us to collect and analyse situational data and thus enable conditional permissions based on a degree/parameter of tolerance. Rules are still predefined and set by a central authority, but they are governed with a higher level of shared risk assessment and tolerance through the aid of technology.  The third and most ambitious model of governance — one that we hope to test through the system, is a ‘protocols-driven’ model. Here, a set of rules — “protocols” — are defined and iterated in a distributed way by multiple stakeholders, including human and more-than-human agents.  <p>Underpinning this, an expansive tech stack, which includes data registries that document and validate various identities, rights, and provenance, allows us to compute the interdependencies of each agent — be it a human, a stray cat, or a window in a building. Protocols do not function to control or limit the agents but serve to discover optimal conditions of mutual&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>A key question in this experiment is how the system can enable a different kind of relationship between spaces and the people using them. Beyond ownership and rental agreements, beyond the capitalist logic of perceiving space as real estate assets holding speculative market value — can we foster reciprocal, stewardship-based agreements and see space as a foundational ‘civic’ asset with the potential to produce positive civic outcomes?</p> Measuring spatial&nbsp;outcomes <p>One of the most commonly cited challenges of temporary and transitional uses of vacant spaces is the need for continuity and scalability. The dynamism created through these uses tends to dissipate with the turnover of its users and, ultimately, with the end of the time-limited lease. So for Re:Permissioning the City we posed the question — how can the impact and the values created through civic activities in space be measured, and each legacy of use be archived and built&nbsp;upon?</p><p>Linking spatial data to city-wide strategies</p><p>Measuring spatial outcomes involves a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Energy consumption, footfall, indoor air quality, noise levels, number of activities hosted and participants attended are some of the easier indicators that can be measured using sensors and platform metrics. Space users’ feedback, social media posts, and a pattern of activities and users can also be fed into the impact analysis. These site-specific data points (informing site-specific standards described above) would be combined with existing social and economic indicators (such as crime rates, and loneliness index) to form part of a larger impact evaluation metric connected to city-wide strategies and objectives.</p><p>Imagine if we could better account for the mental health benefits of a particular space, or a cluster of spaces in a neighbourhood. This data could validate the public value of spaces, helping to ensure the sustainability of spaces and encourage further investment. (See more on our thinking on commons-based investment <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/financing-city-transitions-a-public-civic-deep-code-innovation-challenge-9f2ef55b4bda">here</a>)</p><p>Spatial outcomes and patterns of civic activities aggregated on a neighbourhood level or city level could inform future urban planning as well, serving as a core data set of a city’s urban space and the micro-level activities that take place within it. In effect, this could mean that spatial permissions can be granted based on iterative feedback. In the future, we hope that the data aggregation and analytics provided by the digital system, linking ‘space’, ‘people’ and ‘civic activities’ can become an integral part of the city’s collective intelligence, helping to measure impacts and contribute to developing new types of indicators of wellbeing, resilience, and sustainability of a city. (Read more about our work on developing new community-led indicators <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-587c48ef16a0">here</a>)</p><p>Potential use&nbsp;cases</p><p>Below is a compilation of potential uses that could be unlocked by Re:Permissioning the City. It is important to note that these examples are merely indicative, as the diverse potential of spaces will emerge through the creativity of people reappropriating the city to their own needs, desires, and&nbsp;hopes.</p> PART 3 — Pilot  Pilot sites <p>The Re:Permissioning the City concept can be applied in various contexts of vacancy and underutilisation, and in the case of Daegu, we have found that it aligns well with the City’s existing strategies around urban regeneration. As an attempt to salvage historic buildings in the old inner city from demolition, the City’s Urban Bureau has committed significant funding over the next 20 years to acquire sites of historical significance. Among these buildings is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBubsxUChj4">‘Muyeongdang(무영당)</a>’, the first department store in Daegu, opened by a Korean entrepreneur under the 1930s Japanese colonial government. The place served as a cultural hub for many young intellectuals and artists of the day, selling books, and hosting poetry readings and art exhibitions. In the same neighbourhood is another modernist building that served as a place of refuge for artists and literati fleeing from the Korean War of the 1950s, called ‘Kotzari <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZEPHVOlQEY">Dabang(꽃자리다방)</a>’. These two buildings have been selected as potential sites for testing the Re:Permissioning the City concept in the real world. Taking into account the rich cultural history of these sites as a refuge for creative minds, the City hopes to enable more young people to make creative use of these spaces through Re:Permissioning the City. In the upcoming pilot, we will be working with local artists and cultural groups to build and test the foundational parts of the permissions system, including shared protocols and compliance systems.</p> Next steps <p>Many areas still require further thinking and development, for instance, defining the boundaries and units of spatial permission — should it be by square metres, or rooms, buildings, or virtual boundaries drawn with geofencing technology? How do we deal with data governance and privacy if we install sensors in spaces and use digital platforms to generate analytics about a space? How can we operationalise and enable self-compliance, deliberation and conflict resolution?</p><p>We are also actively exploring ways to ensure that protocols for a self-governing space can reflect the diverse interests of more-than-human agents, such as bees, cats, plants, microbiomes and of course, the space itself. Learning from past experiments in temporary/meanwhile use and tactical urbanism, we also acknowledge the importance of designing for long-term viability, so developing new kinds of civic business models and incentive structures will be a critical area that needs more&nbsp;work.</p><p>Despite uncertainties and unknowns, we believe that this is a critical moment for cities to explore and experiment with civic technologies that centre civic capabilities/capacities, democratising the way we plan and use our cities and demonstrating how public space, as one of many civic assets, can be harnessed for an emergent civic&nbsp;economy.</p><p>The Re:Permissioning the City project team at Dark Matter Labs is actively looking for new partnerships with organisations and governments with an appetite for exploring and testing the core instruments. While the contexts of each city are unique, we hope that Re:Permissioning the City can serve as a common technological infrastructure that can be shared across cities and enable compound learning and&nbsp;impact.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more, supporting the development, and/or doing a system pilot in your city, please contact&nbsp;us:</p><p>🇰🇷: Eunji Kang (<a href="mailto:eunji@darkmatterlabs.org">eunji@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)<br>🇰🇷: Eunsoo Lee (<a href="mailto:eunsoo@darkmatterlabs.org">eunsoo@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)<br>🇨🇦: Jonathan Lapalme (<a href="mailto:jonathan@darkmatterlabs.org">jonathan@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)<br>🇫🇷: Theo Campbell (<a href="mailto:theo@darkmatterlabs.org">theo@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)<br>🇬🇧: Chloe Treger (<a href="mailto:chloe@darkmatterlabs.org">chloe@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)<br>🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿: Adam Purvis (<a href="mailto:adam@darkmatterlabs.org">adam@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)</p><p>This blog is written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eunjikangsin/">Eunji Kang</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tteslee/">Eunsoo Lee</a>, with contributions from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanlapalme/">Jonathan Lapalme</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-treger-6a6bb47b/">Chloe Treger</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pocalvin/">Calvin Po</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theo-campbell/">Theo Campbell</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/indy-johar-b440b010/">Indy&nbsp;Johar</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/re-permissioning-the-city-unlocking-cities-growing-underutilised-spatial-assets-for-an-emergent-1550997714a4">Re:Permissioning the City — Unlocking cities’ growing underutilised spatial assets for an emergent…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      <p>Welcome to our Crypto Money Laundering Explained series, where we break down individual risk categories and help you learn how criminals use the platforms and mechanisms involved to launder the proceeds of crime.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>The majority of <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/learning/what-is-a-blockchain/">blockchains</a> are inherently “transparent” by design. This means that anyone with the right tools can see any and all activity that has taken place on the blockchain. With this in mind, criminals are always looking for ways to obfuscate the source and destination of their illicit cryptoassets. <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/learning/what-is-a-mixer/" title="What is... a Mixer?">Mixers</a> and privacy wallets – although not intrinsically illicit by nature – can help them do just that.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>In this blog, we’re going to explore how and why bad actors attempt to use these methods to overcome existing crypto compliance systems and launder their funds.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>First up, let’s make sure we’re all aligned on what mixers and privacy wallets actually are.</p> 
       &nbsp;  
       What is a Mixer?&nbsp;  
      <p>Mixers are services that allow users to mix their cryptoassets with those of other clients and then withdraw them to a different destination, with the aim of obscuring their ownership and breaking the link between sent and received funds.</p> 
       &nbsp;  
       What is a Privacy Wallet?&nbsp;  
      <p>Privacy wallets typically refer to self-custodial and open-source cryptoasset wallets. These wallets have built in functionality to obfuscate the senders and recipients of funds flowing in and out of them. This makes it hard for law enforcement to trace funds on the blockchain and may allow bad actors to more easily hide the flow of their ill gotten gains.</p> 
       &nbsp;  
       How These Mechanisms are Used For Money Laundering&nbsp;  
      <p>Let’s take a look at a couple of scenarios that showcase exactly how these mechanisms are abused to effectively launder illicit funds.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>Scenario 1: Using Mixers or Privacy Wallets To Obfuscate The Source Of Funds&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>By sending illicitly gained funds through a mixer or privacy wallet before depositing them into an exchange, criminals can obfuscate the source of those funds. This helps them to give the appearance that certain cryptoassets may not have a nexus to the fraud, theft, or other problematic event that they, in fact, do. Use of these obfuscation technologies reduces the likelihood that the illicit source will be picked up by an organization’s compliance systems.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>Some businesses use a hop-based compliance approach to manage risk mitigation. This means if criminals can add enough steps between the original illicit activity and the organization that they seek to do business with, they can effectively hide their illicit activity and avoid detection. This then allows them to convert their crypto into fiat or other less transparent currencies, such as privacy coins.</p> 
      <p>Scenario 2: Using Mixers or Privacy Wallets To Obfuscate The Destination Of Funds&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>By sending funds from an exchange to a mixer or privacy wallet before then conducting illicit activity, criminals are able to obfuscate the destination of funds. This helps them to increase their anonymity before engaging in illegal activity such as purchasing stolen credit card data, malware or drugs on the dark web.</p> 
      <p>This added anonymity makes it more difficult to follow the flow of funds and prevents non-holistic compliance systems from tracing the activity to the criminal. For instance, if the target in question is using a fully licensed exchange to purchase their crypto, then they need a means by which they can obscure this information and break the link to prevent law enforcement agencies tracking them down in the future.&nbsp;<br></p> 
       &nbsp;  
       How Blockchain Analytics Helps Tackle Bad Actors Using Mixers or Privacy Wallets  
      <p>Typically <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/#:~:text=Elliptic%20powers%20the%20intelligence%20that,compliance%20in%20the%20crypto%20industry.">blockchain analytics</a> firms cannot trace through a mixer or privacy wallet on an automated basis. However, what they can do is identify when a transaction has interacted with such a service.</p> 
      <p>Using this information, organizations can then take steps to assess the relevant risk based on their risk appetite and decide whether to allow or reject a given transaction. Factors that typically come into play in this decision-making process include the size of the transaction and how often the client has engaged with potentially risky services.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>While both have legitimate uses, these scenarios highlight why it’s important your blockchain analytics tools can identify exposure to mixers and privacy wallets.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Flexible work arrangements and accelerating digital transformation changed the way we secure access. Traditional network security approaches just don’t scale to modern demands. They not only hurt end user experience but also grant each user excessive access to the entire corporate network. All it takes is one compromised user account, infected device, or open port for an attacker to access and laterally move anywhere inside your network, exposing your most critical assets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legacy network security approaches are no longer sufficient&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you adopted modern access solutions for your organization, you still need to integrate and manage multiple identity and network tools as neither identity nor network security controls alone can protect all access points. But if you use disconnected tools, some critical integration points can be missed. Skilled adversaries often exploit seams between solutions. Organizations need an easier, more agile approach to protecting access to all applications and resources. The new networking model we’re introducing today will transform the way you secure access.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we’ve <a href="https://aka.ms/BlogEntra">announced two new products</a>: Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access. With Identity and Network Access solutions working together, organizations don’t need to spend time deciding which tool would work better for each app, or how to bridge the policies your identity team created with the policies your networking team created. You can now configure unified identity and network controls with Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can connect any end user, application or external resource, and internal IT systems through a cloud-delivered, identity-centric network access solution. This cloud service provides agility, is easy to manage, and proves cost effective, when compared to legacy on-prem systems, so you don’t need to sacrifice user productivity to get best-in-class security controls. This model is built on Zero Trust principles. It helps to verify each identity and uses risk-based context, giving users access only to applications, resources, and destinations they need to do their job. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Internet Access&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Microsoft Entra Internet Access is an identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG) for SaaS apps and internet traffic that protects against malicious internet traffic, unsafe or non-compliant content, and other threats from the open internet. For example, you can block access to all external destinations for your high-risk users or non-compliant devices except self-service password reset pages. It also extends the conditions of Conditional Access with network conditions. This would prevent, for example, a stolen access session token from being replayed by requiring a user to be on a “compliant network” to access resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also has unique capabilities for Microsoft 365, including Universal Tenant Restrictions, to prevent data exfiltration to other tenants or personal accounts including anonymous access, near-real time threat detection, higher precision of the risk assessment on user, location, and device, and more seamless access to Microsoft 365 apps. Internet Access can be deployed as a main solution or side-by-side with other SSE solutions, and integration opportunities will be offered via a new API in Microsoft Graph. Traffic can be acquired using either cross OS from end user devices or IPsec tunnels from remote networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Access for Microsoft 365 scenarios and the Windows client are now in public preview. Internet Access for all traffic, cloud firewall, threat protection and support for all other OS types will be available later this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure access to all internet, SaaS, and Microsoft 365 apps and resources with an identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Private Access&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Some of you may be familiar with Application Proxy in Microsoft Entra - thousands of customers use it to access private web apps today. We’re excited to introduce an even better solution: an identity centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution that shares the same application connectors but offers so much more, to help organizations simplify and secure access to any private resource, port, or protocol. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Private Access, users can quickly and easily connect to private applications, no matter where the user is – in the office or remote - and regardless of where the application is hosted – a local on-premises data center or in any public cloud. You don’t need to make any changes to those applications or resources to add another layer of security controls such as multifactor authentication (MFA), device compliance check, identity protection, identity governance, and single sign-on to any TCP/UDP-based application, including SSH, RDP, SAP, and SMB file shares and other private resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using attribute-based Conditional Access policies, you can now create simple policies to more effectively target groups of applications based on the sensitivity of the application for the enterprise. Examples of such policies include requiring MFA, device compliance, low user risk, compliant network for highly sensitive applications, or even specific per application Conditional Access policies. With deep integration with Conditional Access and Continuous Access Evaluation, you can enable secure, seamless access with modern authentication in front of legacy auth protocols such as Kerberos or NTLM without changing legacy apps. Private Access is now in public preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure access to all private apps and resources, for users anywhere, with an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Secure access to any app or resource, from anywhere, with an identity-centric security service edge (SSE) solution&nbsp; 
<p>Together, Internet Access and Private Access, coupled with our SaaS –security-focused CASB – Microsoft Defender for Cloud apps - comprise Microsoft's Security Service Edge solution. This solution integrates deeply with broader Microsoft’s security portfolio and enables an open partner ecosystem, so it also works with your existing network and security solutions. Internet Access and Private Access share the same agent, which works across operating systems and provides consistent connectivity across devices and networks. You can enforce unified Conditional Access policies that consider identity, device, application, and now network conditions with any application or website, regardless of which IdP the application uses and without changing those applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure access to any app or resource, from anywhere, with an identity-centric security service edge solution. Enforce unified Conditional Access controls that simplify network access security and deliver a great user experience anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s SSE solution is delivered from one of the largest global private networks, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft global network</a>. The global network connects our Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/">data centers</a> across 61 Azure regions with more than <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/global-network/#features">185 global network POPs</a> and a large mesh of edge-nodes strategically placed around the world, enabling organizations to optimally connect users and devices to public and private resources seamlessly and securely. Currently, Microsoft’s SSE solution is available in a select set of locations in North America and Europe, with additional locations to be added throughout the course of this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the introduction of our SSE solution, Internet Access and Private Access enable customers to secure access with a unified, identity-centric approach to any application, resource, or destination, using user identity, device compliance, application, and now new network compliance as conditions. This is an easy way to unify and centralize all your access policies and strengthen them with continuous access evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In July 2023, the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/bank-for-international-settlements/"> Bank for International Settlements </a>(BIS) published a comprehensive report titled “The crypto ecosystem: key elements and risks.” This report sheds light on the key components of the crypto ecosystem, identifies structural flaws, and emphasizes the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Let’s delve into the main highlights and risks outlined in the BIS report.</p>



 Key Elements of the Crypto Ecosystem 



<p>The report begins by discussing the rise of cryptocurrencies, noting their global spread and the involvement of various investors. In theory, cryptocurrencies aim to provide decentralized alternatives to traditional financial systems, relying on anonymous validators instead of central bank money and trusted intermediaries. The growth of<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/decentralized-finance/"> decentralized finance (DeFi) </a>within the crypto universe further aims to replicate conventional financial services.</p>



<p>However, the report reveals a significant divergence between the crypto vision and reality. It highlights the presence of new centralized intermediaries in the crypto ecosystem, including exchanges. These intermediaries have played a crucial role in fund allocation and management within the crypto universe. The report argues that despite the claims of decentralization, crypto and DeFi often exhibit substantial de facto centralization, which introduces potential vulnerabilities.</p>



 Structural Flaws and Risks 



<p>The BIS report identifies several structural flaws and risks within the crypto ecosystem. These include:</p>



 
 Fragmentation and Congestion: The report highlights the inherent fragmentation and congestion within the crypto ecosystem. Lack of standardization and coordination across different platforms leads to inefficiencies, higher fees, and slower transaction processing times. 



 Stablecoins: Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value by pegging to a specific asset, introduce risks due to the search for a nominal anchor. These stablecoins rely on the credibility of central bank-backed currencies and may impact monetary sovereignty. 



 False Decentralization Claims: Despite claims of decentralization, the report emphasizes the presence of centralized intermediaries that challenge the notion of true decentralization. This introduces concerns around accountability, regulatory compliance, and concentrated power. 



 Risks within the Crypto Ecosystem: The report notes various risks associated with cryptocurrencies, such as fraud, hacking, vulnerabilities in crypto infrastructure, and risks related to smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). 



 Risks in DeFi: DeFi platforms, which aim to provide financial services without intermediaries, carry their own risks. These include code vulnerabilities, governance challenges, and potential losses for participants. 



 Interconnectedness with Traditional Financial System: As the crypto ecosystem becomes more intertwined with the traditional financial system, risks like money laundering, terrorist financing, and impacts on financial stability need to be closely monitored and managed. 



 Risks to Emerging Market and Developing Economies: The report emphasizes the importance of considering risks specific to emerging market and developing economies. These risks include potential capital flight, limited access to financial services, and the impact on monetary policy and exchange rates. 
 



 Addressing the Risks 



<p>The BIS report acknowledges the need to address these risks and suggests options for mitigation. It emphasizes the importance of robust governance frameworks and regulatory compliance measures to foster a safer and more sustainable crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>The BIS report on the crypto ecosystem provides valuable insights into the key elements and risks associated with cryptocurrencies and DeFi. It highlights structural flaws resulting from fragmentation, false claims of decentralization, and the risks posed within the crypto ecosystem. Addressing these risks will be crucial for ensuring the long-term viability and stability of the crypto market.</p>

<p>In light of the risks identified by the BIS report, solutions like <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/products/coinfirm-analytics/">Coinfirm Analytics</a> become increasingly important. Coinfirm Analytics addresses these risks by providing robust AML and KYC compliance, risk monitoring and reporting, transaction monitoring and due diligence, and regulatory compliance and risk assessment. By leveraging our comprehensive set of tools and capabilities, crypto businesses can not only mitigate the risks outlined in the BIS report but also foster growth and sustainability in the crypto ecosystem. Coinfirm Analytics empowers businesses to navigate the complexities of the crypto landscape, ensuring they can thrive while maintaining responsible and compliant practices.</p>

<p>Breath in, Breath out. Another <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> has come and gone.</p><p>Held at Camp Navarro in <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/northern-pomo?ref=blog.holochain.org">Northern Pomo Territory</a>, DWeb Camp is something between a celebration and a caucus. “Conference” doesn’t really sum it up. Five days at an immersive woodland camp, hosted by the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and attended by the best minds of the distributed web, is a special time. “The work” is not at DWeb Camp, it’s back at our organizations, deep in our codebases, and with our communities. The relationships, the cross pollination, the alignment between projects, policies, and people? That’s DWeb Camp.</p> Why DWeb Camp? <p>DWeb Camp is an opportunity to support and build with the broader distributed web community. From conversations with Tim Berners-Lee to learning from the DWeb Fellows about the actual needs of communities, DWeb Camp makes us and our work better. A testing ground for ideas, this event marks progress towards a web truly built for all.</p>DWeb Camp Volunteers and Build Crew at the opening of camp. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>. How we Showed up <p>Holochain came to DWeb Camp with an aim towards collaboration. Many of us have our own pet projects for saving the world, but what we can agree on is that a better world is possible. Working with humility, and in cooperation, we want to build the relationships needed to walk in that direction. As a sponsor of DWeb Camp it was important to us not to be overbearing, or to push a particular agenda, but rather to partner with the Internet Archive and DWeb community in order to host a fantastic, experiential week.</p><p>At the same time, we talked to a lot of people about Holochain, showed and asked people to try Holochain apps, connected folks to our work, and held space for deep questioning.</p> Panels, Talks, and Workshops <p>Participation was a big theme of how we held space at DWeb. Every event we hosted invited the community to speak, ask questions, or get their hands onto the technologies and ideas.</p><p>Co-founders Art Brock and Eric Harris-Braun held a fishbowl on the Grammar of Intelligence which explored the evolution of complex adaptive systems as they relate to AI, sensemaking, and coordination. The fishbowl format sets up four chairs in the middle of the room, one of which must always remain empty. This arrangement invites participants to sit in the empty chair, requiring someone else to step out, encouraging a participatory conversation where anyone has the opportunity to be heard. Thank you to those who took the chance in the hot seat and joined the conversation.</p><p>Paul d’Aoust and Collin McClain held a workshop titled Thinking Differently: How do distributed patterns affect the way we do things? Building from a design exercise that helped illuminate the relationship between our technical tools and the social effects of our innovations, they pointed to the need for a new toolbox of distributed patterns.</p><p>On Saturday, the last full day of the conference, the event transformed into a series of emergent sessions, where anyone could propose and hold sessions on anything they wanted. During this, the Holochain team and our community held six separate, intimate sessions. We opened with The What, Why, and How of Holochain, an audience question focused panel discussion between Ferananda Ibarra, Art Brock, Mary Camacho, and Collin McClain. Throughout the rest of the day we held a rolling Hands on Holochain session where we let DWeb participants try out and use Holochain apps. Simultaneously Zacchaeus Scheffer (a tiny machine learning expert), Holochain dev and trainer Guillem Cordoba and a group of other participants, worked through possible Designs of Distributed Machine Learning with Private Data; Paul d’Aoust and Michael Dougherty held a Holochain Under the Hood AMA; Eric Harris-Braun ran a Holochain Dev Session; and Mary Camacho and Matt Schutte discussed how to Build Businesses with Holochain.</p><p>Outside the Holochain team, community projects ran wonderful sessions such as <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Neighbourhoods</a> demonstration of their Distributed Groupware Framework and <a href="https://trustgraph.net/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Harlan Wood’s</a> talk Trust Graphs in the Age of AI: Privacy, Sovereignty &amp; Collaboration, both on Thursday.</p>DWeb Camp was honored by the music of the <a href="https://www.delsolquartet.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Del Sol Quartet</a>.

The distributed web community has been building fantastic technologies in the last few years, but the situations in which we need this tech to work are not always readily available for testing at scale. And so DWeb Camp decided to shut off the connection to the internet for the day and focus on the implementation of peer-to-peer technologies in the real world. Running solely on the local meshnet, Holochain and many other projects brought technologies for people to use in this environment. We want to build things that work out in the real world, with real people, who have actual problems, and so we need tests and challenges that mimic those contexts to get there. </p><p>Folks from the Holochain team as well as volunteers from the community worked for months building the Emergence app, specifically to support Saturday’s emergent sessions. We are planning another blog in the coming weeks that will explore the technical hurdles we faced and the lessons we learned, but we want to call this a success in terms of the leaps forwards for both development of Holocahin apps and what we learned about using a Holochain app in the world when trying to solve real problems. </p><p>We had more people than ever before log in to a Holochain application at once, this while working entirely off a local network. Running multiple team and community tests over the week, we saw the improvements and challenges with the system we custom designed for DWeb Camp. Our prototype wasn’t perfect, but it broke in fantastically informative ways. </p><p>We appreciate the community of DWeb Camp for being on this adventure with us. This new pattern of testing and using peer-to-peer apps ‘in the wild’ feels like a massive win for the DWeb community, and one that we hope will be continued into the future.</p>The DWeb Camp Fellows passed a flame of hope around the amphitheater during the opening ceremony.

Community and Growth <p>The Holochain community showed up in force at DWeb Camp with eight team members and over twenty-five community members, making us perhaps the best represented project in attendance. Connecting with our community was a key goal of Holochain’s at this event. As a distributed team and an even more distributed community, we don’t get a lot of face time. It’s our intent to always work with our community and to create a healthy ecosystem of both builders and users, but we recognize that this is tough without clear spaces for that to happen within. DWeb Camp both provides an incredible example of community nurturing in action and acts as an opportunity for us to connect with many of the people building a more distributed web.</p><p>We are also growing our capacity for community development. If you haven’t seen our recent announcement W<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/new-head-of-developer-relations/">elcoming our New Head of Developer Relations Mark Franks</a> to the team, we encourage you to read it and to hear his remarks on meeting our team and community at DWeb Camp.</p><p>Beyond our immediate community we found allyship with others across the distributed web, digital identity, Web3, and more. We see the need for policy work in these spaces and the importance of collaboration with other aligned projects to achieve real change. </p><p>We are excited for what the future of the distributed web holds. There is more to say about how we do that work and what next steps look like, but that will have to wait for another article.</p><p>In the meantime…</p>Group photo taken on the last day of camp.

To the Internet Archive and particularly Wendy Hanamura; to the DWeb Camp volunteers, fellows, and staff; to the Holochain and DWeb communities; to the builders and the dreamers. Thank you for another year of magic, in the woods where we celebrate and in the world where we live.</p>

 Ubisecure and VerifyVASP announce partnership supporting LEI adoption for VASPs and non-individual entities ahead of new FATF regulation. 
<p>LONDON, UK, &amp; SINGAPORE – 11th July 2023&nbsp;– RapidLEI by Ubisecure, the leading issuer of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), has announced an exciting new partnership with Singapore-based RegTech solutions provider, <a href="https://verifyvasp.com/">VerifyVASP</a>. The venture makes VerifyVASP the first Travel Rule solution provider to become a Validation Agent (VA). The collaboration will enable VerifyVASP to quickly and seamlessly obtain LEIs for their Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) clients, using RapidLEI’s automated issuance technology.</p>
<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has set comprehensive standards for AML/CFT regulations, which are then adopted by regulators worldwide for enforcement in the respective regions. As part of the FATF Recommendations, Recommendation 16 pertaining to the Travel Rule was introduced to mitigate the AML/CFT risks associated with Virtual Asset transfers. The Travel Rule mandates VASPs to to obtain, hold and submit required and accurate originator and beneficiary information for all VA transfers.</p>
<p>Some countries have begun to adopt and enforce the Travel Rule. There have also been global calls for accelerated enforcements globally, leading to the European Union (EU) approving the recent Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation &nbsp;and Transfer of Funds Regulation which mandates the Travel Rule. VASPs, otherwise referred to as Crypto Assets Service Providers (CASPs) in the EU, are expected to comply within approximately 1.5 years.</p>
<p>Within some of these regulations, the LEI will be required for non-individual entities that are the originator or beneficiary in Virtual Asset transfers. The LEI is also anticipated to support counterparty due diligence between VASPs – another key requirement in several regulations.</p>
<p>By becoming a Validation Agent, VerifyVASP, who is a leading global Travel Rule solution provider, can streamline the issuance of LEIs to its members, facilitating improved counterparty due diligence. It will also assist members with the issuance of LEIs to their non-individual customers, fostering increased adoption of LEIs ahead of the EU regulations coming into force. This will drive broader adoption of the LEI across the entire Virtual Asset industry, globally, for international transfers.</p>
<p>RapidLEI’s API offering enables automated LEI issuance and management. The API enables VA capabilities to be integrated directly into partner applications easily, supporting new and innovative LEI use cases. VerifyVASP will use the LEI as one of the key organisation identifiers in its platform. This LEI use case showcases the value of the LEI in identifying players of virtual asset transactions and facilitating Travel Rule implementation.</p>
<p>Shihyun Chia, CEO of VerifyVASP, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Travel Rule is effectively a messaging protocol that would require data standards, taxonomies and industry best practices for effective frictionless compliance. The adoption of LEI as prescribed by regulations such as the TFR would be a cornerstone in achieving this. Additionally, LEI would also facilitate the identification and verification of counterparties in establishing counterparty or correspondent relationships between VASPs/CASPs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris Hudson, Director of Channel Sales at RapidLEI, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“LEIs are increasingly becoming part of regulatory requirements across multiple industries, with over 300 regulations already requiring LEIs in some capacity. Our partnership with VerifyVASP will increase adoption of LEIs for VASPs ahead of the MiCA and Transfer of Funds Regulation mandates. We are eager to support their work to implement LEIs in and around RegTech and Travel Rule solutions.”</p></blockquote>
