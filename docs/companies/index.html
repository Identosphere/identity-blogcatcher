 IDnow InstantSign and eID eSign reduce the cost and complexity of contract signing 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, July 9, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, has launched two new <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">e-signature solutions</a> to the market. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/instantsign/">InstantSign</a> empowers financial businesses to innovate friction-heavy and lengthy signing processes, such as loan contracts, by way of a reusable identity, while eID eSign enables users to verify their identity and digitally sign contracts with the help of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.</p>



 AML compliance redefined: QES without reverification 



<p>Existing solutions traditionally either require a new identity verification before a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> can be issued or the identification needs to be handled by the financial institution. IDnow’s latest signing solution InstantSign removes these obligations, allowing users who have already performed Anti-Money-Laundering (AML)-compliant identity verification at onboarding to digitally sign contracts at a qualified level, with no additional integrations required and in accordance with European eIDAS regulations.</p>



<p>“Eliminating the requirement for reverification by reusing an existing identification significantly streamlines the process of issuing a QES in an AML-compliant e-signing journey. InstantSign has been proven to reduce drop-offs and accelerate contract completion. With physical signing processes sometimes taking days, our customers can now cut this to mere seconds with InstantSign, by foregoing the printing, signing and return process of a hard copy contract”, explains Vikas Seth, Chief Product Officer at IDnow. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Additionally, if reverification is needed due to an expired identity document, InstantSign works seamlessly with IDnow’s entire range of identity verification solutions from automated and hybrid, to video, thus keeping identity data up-to-date, and providing a compliant solution for financial services organizations.”</p>



 eID eSign – Fast verification and secure signing thanks to NFC technology &nbsp; 



<p>eID eSign allows end customers to quickly verify their identity and digitally sign contracts remotely. In less than a minute, users can verify themselves by utilizing compliant and secure NFC technology, for a QES that is the legal equivalent to a wet-ink signature on the Level of Assurance (LoA) High. IDnow’s eID eSign solution currently works with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">German ID card</a>, residence permit or EU citizen card, using a secure, compliant NFC chip readout of these documents. It expands IDnow’s existing signing solution portfolio and complements the available identity verification methods for various types of signatures with solutions like VideoIdent, AutoIdent and IDCheck.io.</p>



<p>“With eID eSign, our customers can future-proof their offering according to the German AML laws (GwG) and the European eIDAS regulations. The use of the NFC chip reduces the risk of identity theft and unauthorized access while cutting costs associated with printing, storage and manual handling of documents. Both solutions propel us and our customers into the next stage of compliance digitalization,” concludes Seth. &nbsp;</p>

The solution to password attacks—still the most common attack vector for compromising identities—is to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa">turn on multifactor authentication (MFA)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as more customers do the right thing with MFA, actors are going beyond password-only attacks. So, we’re going to publish a series of articles on how to defeat more advanced attacks, starting with token theft. In this article, we’ll start with some basics on how tokens work, describe a token theft attack, and then explain what you can do to prevent and mitigate token theft now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tokens 101&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we get too deep into the token theft conversation, let’s quickly review the mechanics of tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A token is an authentication artifact that grants you access to resources. You get a token by signing into an identity provider (IDP), such as Microsoft Entra ID, using a set of credentials. The IDP responds to a successful sign-in by issuing a token that describes who you are and what you have permission to do. When you want to access an application or service (we’ll just say app from here), you get permission to talk to that resource by presenting a token that’s correctly signed by an issuer it trusts. The software on the client device you’re using takes care of all token handling behind the scenes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Basic token flow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first token you get, called a session token, shows that you successfully signed into the IDP, and how you signed in. When you sign into an app, it can exchange that session token for an access token, which gives you access to a specific resource for a certain amount of time without having to reauthenticate. To use an analogy, think of an amusement park. The IDP is the ticket office, which issues a park pass that provides credits for different rides. If you want to go on the roller coaster, you go to the ticket office, show your season park pass, and receive a ticket for that ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as you might be able to buy a day pass, season pass, or lifetime pass to the park, each token has a lifetime, usually between one and 24 hours. And just as a 12-month season pass may get you a one-day pass to a specific ride, session tokens can have different—and usually much longer—lifetimes than access tokens. Moreover, access token lifetimes can differ, so the roller coaster pass may last an hour while the Ferris wheel pass is good for an entire day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditionally, longer lifetimes are more convenient for users and more resilient against potential IDP outages (they save round trips to the IDP and associated latency) but riskier, while shorter lifetimes are safer (the IDP checks the integrity of the request more often). Technologies such as continuous access evaluation provide continuous assessment, so a shorter token lifetime isn’t a benefit when these are in place. When a token expires or continuous access evaluation reports heightened risk, the client goes back to the IDP and requests a refresh. This process is typically invisible to users, but if a risk condition has changed, and your organization policy requires it, then you may have to reauthenticate and get a new token. One last thing to note: while it’s a bummer to lose your roller coaster ticket, it’s really bad to lose your season park pass. An attacker can use your roller coaster ticket to get on a single ride for a short while, but with your season park pass, they can get on any ride for as long as they want. It’s similar with which, if stolen, give an actor a lasting ability to get access tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How token theft works 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attackers steal tokens so they can impersonate you and access your data for as long as that stolen token lives. To do this, they get access to where a token is stored (on the client, in proxy servers, or in some cases in application or network logs) to acquire it and replay it from somewhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ticket office</p>




<p>Session token</p>


<p>Season park pass</p>




<p>Access token</p>


<p>Individual ride ticket</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When an attacker steals your session token, it’s like picking your pocket after you’ve purchased your all-access season park pass at the fair’s ticket office. Because a token is digital, token theft is like stealing the pass from your pocket, making a photocopy, and then putting the original back in your pocket. The attacker can use their copy of your session token to get unlimited new access tokens to keep stealing your data, just as they can show a copy of a valid park pass to keep getting on rides without paying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An attacker stealing your access token is comparable to someone stealing your ride ticket as you stand in line. They do the same copy-and-replace trick, using their copy of your token to access the resource, just as they could show a copy of a valid ticket to get on an individual ride without paying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because in both cases the attacker puts the original pass or ticket back in your pocket, you don’t even know an attacker is riding the rides in your name. Your token seems fine, even though an attacker is using an illegitimate copy of it, and it may take a while to determine that anything is amiss—if you ever do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contoso stores all their documents in a secure cloud storage service and requires all employees to verify their identity using MFA before accessing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, after starting their workday by signing into Contoso's cloud storage service, a user inadvertently installed malware on their device by clicking on a malicious 'phishing' link sent to them via email. The malicious code copied the user's session token and sent it to the attacker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacker then used the stolen and MFA-validated session token, now copied to their machine, to gain access to Contoso's environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacker then downloaded as many documents as they could access, including a bunch of confidential reports, and leaked them on the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use of malware on the client to acquire the token is one common, easy method for attackers. Other tactics used to steal tokens include:</p>
 
 Copying tokens from the network as they pass through a proxy or router that the attacker controls. 
 Extracting tokens from unsecured server logs of the relying party. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While token theft still constitutes fewer than 5% of all identity compromises, incidents are growing. alone, we detected 147,000 token replay attacks, a 111% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Protecting tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IDPs and clients should handle tokens as securely as possible by only transmitting them over encrypted channels and not storing them in the open. But if an attacker infiltrates the device or network channel as in the example above, they can steal tokens and use them until they expire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, a token would only work when used from the device to which it was issued. That is, if replayed from a different device, such as one an attacker controls, they would be rejected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key part of Microsoft’s protections against token theft is the use of tokens that are cryptographically tied to the device they own. This is often called token binding, but may also be called sender constrained tokens, or token proof of possession. Token protection makes it harder to execute the main types of attacks designed to steal tokens, including network-based attacks and those using malware on the device by restricting use of the stolen token from devices they weren't issued to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Microsoft Entra, token protection binds tokens to cryptographic keys specific to the device and ties them to the device registration. Once developers enable their applications to use protected tokens, you can enforce an Entra Conditional Access policy that requires client applications to use protected tokens to access a service. This policy rejects tokens which are not cryptographically tied to the device they were issued to. In the theme park analogy, this is like the ticket office taking your picture and printing it on your ride ticket and requiring ride operators to match the picture to your face before letting you ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a large project, spanning operating system platforms, native and web applications, all our cloud services, and the full range of different tokens in use for each case. It will be released in stages for specific scenarios. The first stage, in public preview now, protects the sign-in session tokens that native applications on Windows devices use when accessing Exchange, SharePoint and Teams services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token protection policy is available for Windows clients today. We’ll support Azure management scenarios and web applications that access Microsoft 365 resources and extend our cross-platform capabilities to Mac, iOS, Android, and other clients over the next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Practical steps for countering token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token protection will offer the strongest protection against token theft; however, it will take the industry time to update all applications to use bound tokens. The good news is that Microsoft offers compelling countermeasures against attacks involving token theft that you can use today to reduce their risk and impact. We recommend a systematic defense-in-depth approach:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Reduce the risk of successful token theft. 
 Prevent malicious use of stolen tokens. 
 Be prepared to detect and investigate attacks that use stolen tokens. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reduce the risk of successful token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first line of defense is to reduce the chances of attackers stealing tokens in the first place, and below are some well-established techniques for building it. It’s the equivalent of keeping your ride tickets and park passes safe from pickpockets while you’re in the theme park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Require managed and compliant devices. Use device management and define Conditional Access policies to require that users access resources from a compliant device. Compliance policies we recommend to reduce the risk of successful token theft from devices include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 To help prevent accidental infection with token-stealing malware, require users running on Windows to run as standard users rather than with device admin rights and require that all devices run up to date anti-malware and virus tools. 
 Use storage encryption to protect device content, including tokens, in case someone steals the device itself. 
 Enable Local Security Authority (LSA) protection to help protect Entra ID tokens in LSA memory. LSA protection is on by default for new devices and can be enabled for other devices via Intune. 
 Use jailbreak or rooting detection for mobile devices. Jailbroken devices are more likely to expose tokens and cryptographic secrets to potential attacks.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn on Credential Guard for your Windows users. If your users are running Windows 10 or later, you can prevent theft of Active Directory credentials by configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/?source=recommendations">Credential Guard</a>, which uses virtualization-based security (VBS) to isolate local and cached credentials so that only privileged system software—and not malware—can access them. Starting in Windows 11, version 22H2, Credential Guard is on by default for devices that meet requirements. This also helps protect cloud applications and resources when hybrid-joined devices using Active Directory authentication initiate a session to access cloud applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for enabling credential guard in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/configure?tabs=intune#enable-credential-guard">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Prevent malicious use of stolen tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While device management and strong credentials certainly reduce the risk of token theft, not everyone has them, and they’re still not completely foolproof. The next layer of defense is to prevent attackers from using stolen tokens for ongoing access by configuring policies to reject them wherever possible, and by detecting attempted use and responding automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Require token protection in Conditional Access, and where possible, choose apps and services that use token protection. Microsoft is updating our apps, identity provider, and operating systems to support token protection, so if you’re using our apps and platforms, be sure to use the latest versions. Then configure Conditional Access to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-token-protection-for-sign-in-sessions/ba-p/3815756">require token protection for sign-in sessions</a> so only applications and devices using bound sign in session tokens, which can’t be used if they’ve been stolen and moved to another device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for creating a Conditional Access policy that requires token binding in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-token-protection#create-a-conditional-access-policy">our documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a risk policy to disrupt token theft in your environment automatically. When a user initiates a session or attempts to access an application, ID Protection will examine user and session risk factors to see if any have changed. Configure Conditional Access policies to protect both medium and high-risk sessions by either challenging users with MFA or by <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/prompt-users-for-reauthentication-on-sensitive-apps-and-high/ba-p/4062703">requiring reauthentication</a>. This will make it difficult or impossible for an attacker to initiate a session using a stolen session token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever available, <a href="https://aka.ms/CAE">Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)</a> can automatically invalidate tokens when ID Protection raises the risk for a user or a service principal. This triggers the risk-based Conditional Access policies to mitigate in real-time, requiring re-authentication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for creating risk-based Conditional Access policies in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reduce the risk of token reuse by restricting sessions for use within network boundaries. Most attackers use stolen tokens from untrusted IP addresses. You can establish network boundaries with policies that prevent users from accessing your resources if they’re coming from unknown locations or from known bad locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restrict networks with Entra Conditional Access:&nbsp;Conditional Access includes controls that will block requests from outside a network compliance boundary that you define. This will prevent an attacker from refreshing a stolen Entra token, restricting its use to the lifetime of the token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for defining a network compliance boundary with Conditional Access in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-location">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhance network controls with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access">Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution</a>: To prevent the attacker from using a token outside of a trusted network at all, Entra Internet Access and Entra Private access use agents installed on endpoints and a compliant network check (enforced in real-time via CAE) to verify whether a user is connecting from a trusted network. Find step-by-step instructions for enabling compliant network check with Conditional Access in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-compliant-network">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAE-capable applications and services such as Teams, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online will continuously enforce the IP-based named location Conditional Access policies and compliant network policies to ensure that tokens can be used only from trusted networks to access services. CAE offers a strict location enforcement mode to maximize protection. Find the step-by-step instructions for enabling this in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation-strict-enforcement">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revoke tokens using Continuous Access Evaluation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring that the supported services can only be accessed from trusted locations, <a href="http://aka.ms/cae">CAE</a> can revoke tokens when admins (or users themselves) take action in response to detecting an account compromise or token theft. These include disabling accounts, changing passwords, and revoking refresh tokens. Learn more about Continuous Access Evaluation in <a href="https://aka.ms/CAE">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Be prepared to detect and investigate attacks that use stolen tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use Entra ID Protection and Microsoft Defender to monitor for token theft. When a threat actor replays a token, their sign-in event can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#risk-types-and-detection">trigger detections</a>&nbsp;such as ‘anomalous token’ and ‘unfamiliar sign-in properties’ from both Entra ID Protection and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#premium-detections">Premium detections</a> recognize abnormal characteristics such as an unusual token lifetime, a token played from an unfamiliar location, or token attributes that are unusual or match known attacker patterns. Signals from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) can indicate a possible attempt to access the Primary Refresh Token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for investigating token theft in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/operations/token-theft-playbook#investigations">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pull all your data into one Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), such as Microsoft Sentinel, to investigate potential token theft. If you receive an alert for an event that may indicate token theft, you can investigate it in the Microsoft Sentinel portal or in another SIEM. Microsoft Sentinel gives you important details about a specific incident, such as its severity, when it occurred, how many entities were involved, which events triggered it, and whether it reflects any MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics or techniques. You can then view the investigation map to understand the scope and root cause of the potential security threat.</p>

  <p>In the past few weeks, we’ve announced the general availability of Microsoft Entra External ID and Microsoft Entra ID multi-tenant collaboration. We’ve received requests for more detail from some of you regarding licensing, so I’d like to provide additional clarity for both of these scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 One person, one license 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Included in the first announcement of more multi-tenant organization (MTO) features to enhance collaboration between users, we stated that only one Microsoft Entra ID P1 license is required per employee per multi-tenant organization. Expanding on that, the term “multi-tenant organization” has two descriptions: an organization that owns and operates more than one tenant; and a set of features that enhance the collaboration experience for users between these tenants. However, your organization doesn’t have to deploy those capabilities to take advantage of the one person, one license philosophy. An organization that owns and operates multiple tenants only needs one Entra ID license per employee across those tenants. The same philosophy applies to Entra ID Governance: the organization only needs one license per person to govern the identities of these users across these tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that this philosophy includes administrative accounts. In some organizations, administrators use standard user accounts for day to day tasks, and separate administrator accounts for privileged access. A person with a standard user account and an administrator account only needs one Entra ID Governance license for both identities to be governed. Of course, they could also leverage Entra ID Governance’s Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to temporarily elevate the access rights of a single account, instead of maintaining two accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate this scenario, let’s consider an organization called Contoso, which owns ZT Tires and Tailspin Toys. Mallory is hired by Contoso, which uses Lifecycle Workflows in Entra ID Governance to onboard her user account and grant her access to the resources she needs for her job. Her account receives an access package with an entitlement to ZT Tires’ ERP app, and she requests access to Tailspin Toys inventory management app. Because Mallory has an Entra ID Governance license in the Contoso tenant, her identity can be governed in the ZT Tires and Tailspin Toys tenants with no additional governance licenses – one person, one license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diego is an identity administrator whose user account is in the ZT Tires tenant. He uses a separate administrator account for privileged access tasks in Contoso, Tailspin Toys, and ZT Tires tenants. Because Diego has an Entra ID Governance license in the ZT Tires tenant, both his user and administrator identities can be governed in all three tenants with no additional governance licenses – again, one person, one license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Entra ID Governance in Microsoft Entra External ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other announcement covered Entra External ID, Microsoft’s solution to secure customer and business collaborator access to applications. In November, I&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-business-guests/ba-p/3575579">blogged</a> about the licensing model to govern the identities of business guests in the B2B scenario for Entra External ID and shared that pricing would be $0.75 per actively governed identity per month. Because metered, usage-based pricing to govern the identities of business guests is a different model than the existing, licensed-based pricing model to govern the identities of employees, I’d like to share more detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A business guest identity in Entra External ID will accrue a single $0.75 charge in any month in which that identity is actively governed, no matter how many governance actions are taken on that identity. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Contoso employee named Gerhart collaborates with Pradeep of Woodgrove Bank to produce Contoso’s quarterly financial statements. Contoso has deployed Entra External ID for its business partners such as Woodgrove Bank. In April, Pradeep accesses Contoso’s Microsoft Teams where Gerhart stores his quarterly reporting documents, but his Entra External ID has no identity governance actions taken on them, so it doesn’t accrue any charges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May, Pradeep receives an access package with an entitlement to Contoso’s accounting system, and Gerhart reviews Pradeep’s existing access to Contoso’s inventory management database, as well as to the Teams with the quarterly reporting documents. Because Pradeep’s identity in Entra External ID had identity governance actions taken on it, Contoso will accrue a $0.75 charge. Note that the charge is applied once, even though there were three identity governance actions taken during the month. Once that Entra External ID identity was governed in May, additional identity governance actions do not generate additional charges for that identity in May.</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest issue of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we explore recent regulatory developments in the European Union and Turkey, examining their potential impacts on the crypto industry.</p> MiCA’s Stablecoin Regulations Are Now in Effect in the&nbsp;EU <p>The implementation of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">the Markets in Crypto-assets Regulations (MiCA)</a> will occur gradually in the European Union. For example, the stablecoin-related regulations have been in effect since June 30. Additional regulations impacting crypto asset service providers (CASPs) <a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/eu_tfr">will follow in December this&nbsp;year</a>.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/chrotania/status/1807362060948242618">Image Source</a>)<p>One immediate effect of MiCA is the psychological shift it brings, dispelling doubts about the legitimacy of crypto businesses within the EU. After all, the regulations eliminate uncertainties regarding the future of crypto in&nbsp;Europe.</p> Focus on Stablecoins <p>On the downside, MiCA also introduces market disruptions. Take Stablecoins, for example. They now must comply with stringent new requirements, which may lead to delisting non-compliant stablecoins from EU-based exchanges. Already, Uphold has delisted six stablecoins, including Tether USDT, the most dominant stablecoin globally.</p><p>Such moves might push issuers to exit the EU market altogether or transition towards euro-backed stablecoins.</p> Crypto Regulations Just One Step Away from Implementation in&nbsp;Turkey <p>Turkey passed a major crypto bill in the Turkish Grand National Assembly on June 27, 2024. This new law increases oversight of digital assets with strict penalties for non-compliance.</p> Key Provisions and Oversight <p>The bill gives control of crypto oversight to Turkey’s financial watchdog, the Capital Markets Board, which will also license digital asset exchanges. Crypto service providers must ensure that customer fund transfers are accessible and traceable by law enforcement.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/CaghanTansel/status/1806659610268283349">Image Source</a>)<p>Platforms that break these rules will face fines from $7,500 to $182,600 and prison terms of up to five years. The Capital Markets Board can also approve audit firms for digital asset companies and temporarily shut down non-compliant platforms.</p> Next Steps <p>President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is expected to approve the bill soon. Once approved, it will be published in the Official Gazette or returned to parliament for further&nbsp;review.</p> Implications for the Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>The EU’s MiCA regulations aim to bring clarity and stability, which could attract more investors. Turkey’s strict rules and penalties, on the other hand, are intended to build trust and transparency in the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>As both regions update their rules, the global crypto market is watching closely. It’s important for everyone in the crypto industry to stay informed and adapt to these&nbsp;changes.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/carret-integrates-shyft-veriscope-to-comply-with-fatf-travel-rule">Carret Integrates Shyft Veriscope to Comply with FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-guide-for-gibraltar">FATF Travel Rule Compliance Guide for Gibraltar</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-liechtenstein">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Liechtenstein</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-crypto-travel-rule-adoption-6-month-status-update">FATF Crypto Travel Rule Adoption: 6-Month Status&nbsp;Update</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the United&nbsp;States</a></p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

Building a Personal Data Bridge to enable Personal&nbsp;AI<p>We are excited to announce that Verida is building a “Personal Data Bridge” to enable user data to be unlocked from centralized platforms and made available for a new generation of personal AI applications and web3 applications that require user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Our personal data today is locked in centralized databases controlled by big tech, banks, healthcare providers, and governments. Verida is building the necessary infrastructure and tools to help individuals extract their data from these platforms and then use it for exciting new use cases such as personal&nbsp;AI.</p> Unlocking User&nbsp;Data <p>Verida is building the critical infrastructure to enable users to reclaim their personal data from any centralized platform, securely store it on decentralized database infrastructure and provide the tools to consent to the use of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>This unlocks user data to be integrated into the next generation of hyper-personal applications such as AI agents and disruptive user-centric web3 applications.</p><p>Flow of data from centralized web3 platforms, to user control, through to personal AI applications</p><p>The Personal Data Bridge is the connective tissue between centralized web2 platforms and end users, enabling them to easily take ownership and control of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Personal Data Bridge consists of a Data Connector API with corresponding framework for integrating with centralized APIs, along with a user interface in the Verida Vault for end users to easily connect, disconnect and configure the data they pull from centralized platforms.</p><p>Verida’s personal data bridge opens up numerous possibilities:</p>  DeFi: Private and reusable on-chain credentials for KYC and credit scores, enabling under-collateralized lending and insurance products.  Healthcare: AI-powered personalized care with secure messaging and follow-up processes.  Metaverse: Portable personal profiles and player data across games and&nbsp;guilds.  AI: Personalized AI products that have access to a digital twin for highly personalized interactions  <p>These applications highlight the potential of combining decentralized identity, user-owned data, and crypto assets to create a more user-centric internet.</p><p>Verida’s approach to off-chain data storage is designed for privacy, speed, and security. Data is stored in encrypted databases, inaccessible to unauthorized users, and transactions are recorded quickly without waiting for network confirmations. This method reduces the risk of data breaches and provides a seamless user experience.</p> Data Connections in the Verida&nbsp;Vault <p>The Verida Vault is currently in development and will be made available in Q3 2024. It provides an easy web interface for users to manage their personal data, connect to third party applications, and pull their data from centralized platforms.</p><p>Mockup of the user interface for the Verida Personal Data Bridge in the Verida Vault web application</p><p>Users can pull their personal data from platforms such as Meta, Google, X, Email, LinkedIn, Strava, and much more. This data is encrypted and stored in a user-controlled personal data Vault on the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>Users can accept data access requests from third party applications, allowing them to connect their personal data with emerging personal AI applications.</p> Data Connector API <p>The Verida Data Connector API is currently in development and will be made available in Q3 2024. It is a secure web service that enables a user to authenticate with a centralized platform to take ownership of their personal data stored with that service, to be stored, encrypted in the user’s personal data&nbsp;vault.</p><p>This API will operate within Verida’s recently announced self-sovereign confidential compute infrastructure, ensuring user data is not visible to any infrastructure operator and is protected at all times in the data lifecycle.</p><p>The data migration status of each connector is tracked, so data can regularly synchronize and be kept up-to-date as new information becomes available. As such, this creates a near real time stream of data flowing into a user’s personal data&nbsp;vault.</p><p>User data is mapped into common data schemas to create an ecosystem of interoperable data. For example, social media posts from X, Facebook and LinkedIn are merged into a common “social post” schema for easy integration.</p><p>All user data is signed, so it can be independently verified to have originated from a particular third party platform.</p><p>The Data Connector API is built on an open framework, enabling any developer to contribute new connectors for centralized platforms. In this way, we can rapidly scale the number of data sources available for end users and maximize the volume of personal data users can take ownership of.</p> Unlocking Innovation and Mass Adoption for&nbsp;Web3 <p>Centralized platforms have a monopoly over how your data is used, with any innovation or products using your data limited to what those platforms build.</p><p>The future of web3 depends on the growth of user adoption and application development. Verida’s data bridge is a significant step towards achieving this vision, enabling a more connected, personalized, and user-controlled internet. As more off-chain data sources are integrated, the potential for new applications and services will continue to expand, driving the vibrant Web3 ecosystem we all anticipate.</p><p>There are significant global regulatory changes occurring that are making it increasingly easy for end users to gain access to their data stored with centralized platforms. Through GDPR, the EU has introduced the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/">right to data portability</a> that is forcing the <a href="https://developers.google.com/data-portability">big</a> <a href="https://developers.tiktok.com/products/data-portability-api/">tech</a> <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/amazon-data-portability/intro-authorize.html">companies</a> to release <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2022/10/18/data-portability-and-our-transfer-your-information-tool/">data</a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/account-data-transfer-api-eu/">portability</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6214075">API’s</a>. The time is right now to connect user’s to their data and unlock it for exciting new use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Verida is building this crucial bridge, enabling users to pull their personal data from centralized platforms like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and GitHub into web3 and personal AI applications. This data is stored in Verida’s encrypted, user-controlled personal data&nbsp;Vault.</p> The Road&nbsp;Ahead <p>Verida is leading the charge in creating a bridge between web2 and web3, allowing users to reclaim their personal data and use it to enhance their digital experiences. By ensuring GDPR compliance, data privacy, and user control, Verida is setting the standard for the future of decentralized identity and personal data management.</p><p>This vision of data sovereignty, personal AI and hyper-personalized web3 applications is not just a dream; it’s becoming a reality, paving the way for a more secure, user-centric internet.</p> About Verida <p>Verida is a pioneering <a href="https://www.verida.network/">decentralized data network</a> and <a href="https://www.verida.network/verida-wallet">self-custody wallet</a> that empowers users with control over their digital identity and data.

<p>I’m making a few assumptions as to why this service is valuable:</p>



 
 Executives aren’t opposed to conforming to standards, but they need a more structured way to understand when and how to assign resources to make the standards work for their products. 



 The standards process needs more input to ensure that the standards in question serve the critical use cases worldwide. 



 Engineers and standards architects are brilliant, but they can either engage in or facilitate the process, and they (usually) can’t do both. 
 



<p>Basically, whether it’s due to resource constraints, a lack of specific expertise, or simply the rapid pace at which changes occur, many organizations are unsure of how to engage effectively without overcommitting valuable resources. I want to help with that.</p>



 Let’s Talk Inspiration 



<p>Throughout my nearly 15 years working closely with Internet standards development efforts, I’ve seen brilliant engineers and busy executives struggle to juggle (heh, rhymes!) their day-to-day responsibilities with the necessity of staying aware of and (when necessary) influencing Internet standards. As much as the people who live and breathe standards development would prefer it otherwise, not every organization is ready, willing, or able to engage in standards development fully. Yet, staying on the sidelines isn’t a viable option either if you want to ensure that emerging standards will work for, and not against, your business interests.</p>



<p>If I were the queen of the universe, resources would magically appear; enough people with the right skills would be engaged in developing standards. I am not, however, queen of the universe (give me time). So, is there any part of this problem that I can solve? What if I could summarize what’s going on for people who need information that will let them decide when they need to engage? At the same time, can I act as a neutral party to help facilitate the process so that it runs as smoothly as possible while still including outreach to encourage participation and consensus?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



 Why A Digital Identity Standards Development Service Helps 



<p>My area of interest is in the digital identity space. I am actively engaged in the APIs under development in the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">Federated Identity Community</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/">Working Groups</a>. I’m also kicking off as co-chair of the IETF’s Secure Patterns for Internet Credentials (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/spice/about/">spice</a>) working group. Those are the areas I can immediately help an executive learn more about. If your organization has services that use federated authentication via a web browser or if they are interested in potential work on credentials to be used by both human and non-human identities, then these topics should be of interest.</p>



<p>And let’s be clear: I’m not here to push any specific solutions or architectures. Instead, I focus on providing the information your team needs to make decisions that align with your business goals.</p>



<p>There are undoubtedly other digital identity-related standards out there that may also be of interest. Adding more to my plate would involve a conversation.</p>



 Making the Case 



<p>If you need language to make the case internally for the services I’m building, this might help.</p>



<p>My Digital Identity Standards Development Service will help you:</p>



 
 Stay Informed by keeping track of critical developments without needing to sift through every detail of the standards discussion. 



 Save Resources by concentrating your efforts and resources on areas that impact your business the most without spreading your team too thin. 



 Make Strategic Decisions by applying insights and expert analysis. This will enable you to decide when and how to engage effectively, ensuring you’re always a step ahead. 
 



 Wrap Up 



<p>If you’ve read this far and haven’t clicked on the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/digital-identity-standards-development-services/">direct link</a> to the page describing this new service in detail, now’s a good time for that! If you and your organization feel overwhelmed by the prospect of keeping up with Internet standards, or if you’ve struggled to figure out how to engage without overcommitting resources, this service is designed for you. It’s about strategic engagement and ensuring that you do so with the maximum impact and minimum fuss when you choose to engage.</p>

			 What is the Electronic Seal and What Function Does It Serve? 		 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is the Electronic Seal? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>The electronic seal is a digital technology that confirms the authenticity, integrity, and origin of the digital documents to which it is attached. It is regulated by the EU eIDAS Regulation (910/2014), which describes it as a set of data in electronic form, logically associated with other digital data to guarantee the origin and integrity of the document. Considered the digital equivalent of a physical stamp, the electronic seal provides certification of provenance and protection against unauthorized alterations.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Qualified Electronic Seal (QeSeal) 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>The qualified electronic seal represents the most secure and reliable form of seal available according to the eIDAS regulation. This type of seal is particularly suitable for organizations that need to ensure the integrity and authenticity of their digital documents at a high level of security. A qualified electronic seal is generated using a Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD). These devices are designed to be highly secure and resistant to tampering attempts, ensuring that the seals created are robust and secure.<br>• Certification and Compliance:<br>Each qualified electronic seal is supported by a qualified certificate, issued by a recognized certification authority. The certificate contains the identifying information of the legal entity responsible for the seal, ensuring transparency and traceability. Compliance with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation ensures that these seals are recognized and accepted in all EU member states.<br>• Practical Applications:<br>The qualified electronic seal is used in a variety of business contexts, ensuring the security of important documents such as contracts, statements, and administrative documentation. It is frequently used in regulated sectors such as banking, insurance, healthcare, and the public sector, where the need to protect sensitive information is particularly critical.<br>• Strategic Advantages:<br>Adopting the qualified electronic seal allows companies to improve operational efficiency, reduce the risk of document fraud, and enhance trust in electronic transactions. Its implementation can significantly reduce operational costs associated with managing paper documents, contributing to the digital transformation of the company.</p>   						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How to Obtain It 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>To obtain an electronic seal, an organization must undergo a rigorous verification process by a certification authority recognized by AgID. InfoCert is one of the leading providers recognized in Europe for the qualified validation of electronic seals, enabling German companies to use such seals for various applications, including registration with the European EPREL database for product energy classification.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>We’ve been hearing about Zero Trust and that “identity is the new perimeter” for years. Maybe it’s time to say, “identity is a perimeter”, because even though network perimeters are porous, they still exist. There is a growing awareness of the centrality of identity and access management in the larger field of IT security. This is because so many cyber-attacks leverage digital identities. This has led to increased emphasis and spending on IAM, beyond just the full IAM suite solutions. For example, we see higher quality and more user-friendly modular solutions for multi-factor (and passwordless) authentication, fine-grained authorization, privileged access management, and identity governance and lifecycle management, often delivered as cloud-hosted services.</p>
<p>The need for identity security was evidenced at our recent European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference, where <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/mtracks/173">our track on identity security</a> was well attended. We had speakers addressing Zero Trust implementations, Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response (ITDR), fraud techniques, the use of generative AI for perpetrating account takeovers (ATOs), gamification of cybersecurity and identity defenses to improve security postures, API security, and the role of identity in cloud security.</p>
<p>ITDR garnered much attention from both attendees and vendors. Vendors have developed solutions that are targeted at reducing threats and risks from enterprise ATOs that lead to asset compromise, data loss, and ransomware attacks. Sophisticated attackers today sometimes do not even use malware to attack victims. They simply take over legitimate accounts, often those that are not properly secured against remote attacks. In other cases, they buy access to real corporate accounts on the dark web. ITDR solutions primarily integrate with identity repositories and other security tools to understand normal activities in order to be able to identify abnormal activities that may be signs of malicious intent.</p>
<p>Some ITDR solutions leverage user behavioral analytics from endpoints, and some have identity deception capabilities, whereby fake accounts, credentials, and other lures are used to draw in would-be attackers to learn about their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). The ITDR market is relatively new and there is a lot of variety in how the products are implemented. We at KuppingerCole expect that the ITDR field will grow, mature, and standardize on more inclusive feature sets. For our latest research on ITDR, see the recently published <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80828/identity-threat-detection-and-response-itdr-iam-meets-the-soc">Leadership Compass on the subject</a>.</p>
<p>Fraud prevention is a desired outcome for identity security, especially within consumer and customer IAM. Fraudsters are constantly innovating on their techniques and finding new targets. Organizations must strive to keep up with mechanisms and services to detect fraud and prevent losses. Fortunately, numerous Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms (FRIPs) are available to help organizations of all kinds prevent ATOs, new account fraud, synthetic fraud, and ecommerce abuse. FRIP solutions typically have multiple capabilities to detect and stop fraud attempts, including identity verification, compromised credential intelligence, device intelligence, user behavioral analysis, behavioral biometrics, and bot detection and management. KuppingerCole will be updating <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81108/fraud-reduction-intelligence-platforms-frip">our research on FRIPs</a> later this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024">cyberevolution conference</a>, we will continue our focus on identity security. We will have speakers addressing ITDR and fraud prevention, as well as practical sessions on the implementation of Zero Trust to bolster identity security. cyberevolution will take place in Frankfurt, Germany on December 3-5, 2024. &nbsp;To register, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024/tickets">click here</a>.</p>

				 <p>検証可能な認証情報は、改ざん防止のデジタル情報をパッケージ化して共有する方法であり、これにより、元の情報源を常に認証できます。このテクノロジーが強力なのは、誰でも暗号を使用して認証情報の発行者を検証できることと、認証情報の作成以降にデータが変更されていないことが保証されるため、内部の情報が信頼でき、すぐに対応できる点です。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>ティム・スプリング 記</p>
<p>簡潔に説明すると、検証可能な認証情報とは、発行組織または当事者によって分散ネットワークで作成され、データ所有者によってデジタル ウォレットにローカルに保存されるデータのパッケージです。</p>
<p>作成されると、これらのパッケージを発行する当事者は、適切なソフトウェアを持っていれば誰でも検証できます。認証情報が作成されると、発行当事者は内部の情報にデジタル署名します。署名されると、データを変更しようとする試みはネットワーク上で表示され、認証情報を「破壊」します。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>検証可能な資格情報は何を表すことができるのでしょうか?</p>
<p>検証可能な資格情報の使用範囲は非常に広く、身元やアイデンティティに関連するあらゆる情報をカバーすることができます。個人、車両、建物、組織、接続されたデバイスなど、さまざまなエンティティとそれに付随する情報を、デジタル形式で安全かつ信頼性を持って表現することが可能です。</p>
<p>たとえば、大学は卒業証書や成績証明書を検証可能な認証情報として学生に発行できます。これにより、卒業生はこれらの証明書を就職先や他の教育機関など、検証を必要とする人々と簡単に共有できます。認証は瞬時に行われるため、従来のように大学に戻って手動で証明書を再発行してもらう手間が省け、全ての関係者にとって効率的な体験が提供されます。</p>
<p>こちらから<a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">Open Badges 3.0</a>に関する最新の記事をお読みください。</p>
<p>ペーパーワークと手動プロセスの終焉 </p>
<p>現代社会では、資格情報は至る所に存在します。運転免許証、パスポート、社員証など、私たちは日常的にさまざまな形で個人を証明する文書を使用しています。</p>
<p>しかし、これらの紙の文書にはいくつかの重大な欠点があります。</p>
<p>まず、紙の文書は盗まれたり、コピーされたり、偽造されたりするリスクがあります。</p>
<p>紙の文書を取得するには、発行元に直接出向かなければならない場合が多く、これが手間と時間のコストを生みます。</p>
<p>さらに、これらの文書は安全に保管する必要があり、そのためのスペースと管理も必要です。</p>
<p>紙の文書を使用する際には、意図しないデータの過剰共有や、手動で情報を入力する必要が生じることがあります。これにより、プライバシーのリスクが高まり、作業が煩雑になることがあります。</p>
<p>これらの課題を克服するために、検証可能な資格情報は、同じ情報をデジタル形式で保持し、より安全で簡単に管理できる方法を提供します。このデジタル資格情報は、ユーザーが自分の情報を好きな方法で、必要な範囲で共有できるようにします。これにより、情報の過剰共有を避け、必要な情報だけを正確に伝えることができます。</p>
<p>組織の観点から見ると、検証可能な認証情報は、複雑な直接統合を必要とせずに、さまざまなシステム間で情報をすばやく共有する方法を提供します。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>簡単な例を見てみましょう。</p>
<p>現在、DMV (米国陸運局)で発行される運転免許証には、生年月日、目の色、身長、体重、氏名、免許証番号、住所などの個人情報が記載されています。年齢制限のある商品を購入しようとすると、業者はしばしば免許証を確認し、あなたの年齢とその商品を合法的に購入できるかどうかを確認します。身分証明書を渡すということは、生年月日だけでなく、全ての情報を渡すということであり、その情報は簡単に悪用される可能性があります。</p>
<p>同じシナリオで、検証可能な資格情報は依然として DMV によって発行され、すべての個人データが含まれていますが、重要なのは、データを選択的に分離して共有できることです。さらに一歩進んで、資格を共有するだけで済みます。店は実際の生年月日を知る必要はなく、特定の年齢を超えているかどうかを知るだけで済みます。これは、単純な「はい」または「いいえ」の形で共有できます。</p>
<p>検証可能な資格情報を使用して店舗で購入する方法の詳細については、<a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-digitally-transform-banking-finance-and-payments/">金融と支払い</a>がどのように変化するかについての記事をお読みください。</p>
<p>なぜ分散化が重要なのでしょうか?</p>
<p>これは独自のブログを作成するに値する大きなトピックですが、いくつかのポイントを簡単に説明します。</p>
<p>モバイル運転免許証など、他のデジタル識別方法が普及し始めているため、文書をデジタル化するだけでは安全ではないことを覚えておくことが重要です。重要なのは、その文書がどのように保存および共有されるかです。</p>
<p>検証可能な資格情報をエンド ユーザーのモバイル デバイスにローカルに保存することで、エンド ユーザーがそのデータを確実に管理し、選択した相手とのみ共有できるようになります。</p>
<p>モバイル運転免許証が分散化されていない場合、個人の身元を確認するためにシステムに連絡する必要があることを意味します。これにより、検証プロセスが遅くなり、データベースにアクセスできない場合に問題が発生する可能性があり、悪意のある攻撃者にとって大きな標的となります。</p>

  <p>Howdy, folks! Today I'm excited to share the latest enhancements for Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA).&nbsp;CBA is a phishing-resistant, password less, and convenient way to authenticate users with X.509 certificates, such as PIV/CAC cards, without relying on on-premises federation infrastructure, such as Active Directory Federated Service (AD FS). CBA is particularly critical for federal government organizations that are already using PIV/CAC cards and are looking to comply with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/standards/memo-22-09-meet-identity-requirements">Executive Order 14028</a>, which requires phishing-resistant authentication. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we're announcing the general availability of many improvements we&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/introducing-more-granular-certificate-based-authentication/ba-p/2365668">introduced earlier this year</a> – username bindings, affinity bindings, policy rules, and advanced CBA options in Conditional Access are all GA! I am also excited to announce the public preview of an exciting new capability - issuer hints. The issuer hints feature greatly improves user experience by helping users to easily identify the right certificate for authentication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vimala Ranganathan, Principal Product Manager on Microsoft Entra, will now walk you through these new features that will help you in your journey toward phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA).    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m Vimala from the Microsoft Entra PM team, and I’m excited to walk you through the new issuer hints feature, as well as the features that will go into general availability.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issuer hints feature improves user experience by helping users to easily identify the right certificate for authentication. When enabled by tenant admin, Entra will send back <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6066#page-12">Trusted CA Indication</a> as part of the TLS handshake. The trusted Certificate Authority (CA) list will be set to subject of the Certificate Authorities (CAs) uploaded by the tenant in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-1-configure-the-certification-authorities">Entra trust store</a>. The client or native application client will use the hints sent back by server to filter the certificates shown in certificate picker and will show only the client authentication certificates issued by the CAs in the trust store. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Enhanced certificate Picker with issuer hints enabled</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also thrilled to announce the features below are going to be in general availability. You can read more about each of the features in detail in our public preview blog: <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/enhancements-to-microsoft-entra-certificate-based-authentication/ba-p/1061417">Enhancements to Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication - Microsoft Community Hub</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA username bindings, which CBA added support for three remaining username bindings and is now at parity with on-premises Active Directory. The three bindings that are being added are: IssuerAndSerialNumber, IssuerAndSubject, and Subject. More at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-4-configure-username-binding-policy">Configure Username binding policy</a>.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Affinity Binding allows admins to set affinity binding at the tenant level, as well as create custom rules to use high affinity or low affinity mapping for covering many potential scenarios our customers have in use today. More at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive#understanding-the-username-binding-policy">CBA Affinity Bindings</a>.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Authentication policy rules help determine the strength of authentication as either single-factor or multifactor. Multiple custom authentication binding rules can be created to assign default protection level for certificates based on the certificate attributes (Issuer or Policy Object Identifiers (OID) or by combining the Issuer and OID). More at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-3-configure-authentication-binding-policy">Configure authentication binding policy</a>.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced CBA options in Conditional Access allow access to specific resources based on the certificate Issuer or Policy OIDs properties. More at <a href="https://aka.ms/authstrengthadvanceddocs">authentication strength advanced options</a>.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more about Microsoft Entra CBA <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication">here</a> and Microsoft’s commitment to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/federal/CyberEO.aspx">Executive Order 14028</a>.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last year, we’ve seen many federal and regulated industry customers migrate off AD FS to Microsoft Entra ID seamlessly by leveraging staged migration and providing end users a familiar sign-in experience with CBA. In fact, in the last 12 months, we’ve seen an over 1400% increase in phishing-resistant authentication for United States government customers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep your feedback coming at <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra/bd-p/Azure-Active-Directory">Microsoft Entra Community</a>! We’re working diligently to bring more enhancements like the removal of limits on Certificate Revocation List (CRL), new certificate authority trust store, CBA support on the resource tenant for B2B external guest users, and iOS UX enhancements, to name just a few! </p>

<p>The convergence of AI and blockchain technologies represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development. According to PwC, AI is <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html">projected</a> to inject a staggering $15.7 trillion into the global economy by 2030, catalyzing a notable 14% increase in global GDP. This profound impact underscores AI’s role in reshaping the future of technology and driving economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>As AI redefines security, automation, and data management, Web3 developers are poised to harness these advancements for groundbreaking innovations. Leading the charge is Safle, a cutting-edge non-custodial, multi-chain wallet provider, seamlessly integrating AI to revolutionize user experience and elevate blockchain technology to new&nbsp;heights.</p> AI and Blockchain — A Powerful Combination <p>Blockchain and AI are two transformative technologies, each enhancing the other. Blockchain provides a transparent, immutable ledger for secure data transactions, while AI uses data to mimic human problem-solving and make informed decisions. AI includes machine learning and deep learning, training algorithms for predictions and classifications.</p><p>The synergy between AI and blockchain is powerful. Blockchain’s transparency ensures reliable data for AI, and its decentralized nature supports AI operations without central servers. Blockchain’s cryptographic techniques bolster AI privacy, and decentralized computing (DePIN) supports the computational needs of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>In return, AI enhances blockchain by creating more secure smart contracts and processing data to improve blockchain networks. This integration boosts trust, scales AI applications, and streamlines business processes. AI-powered smart contracts can resolve disputes and drive sustainable solutions, making systems faster and more efficient.</p> How Safle integrates AI in its Offerings <p>Leading the intersection of AI and blockchain is Safle. It features a cross-resolving Web3 naming registry, multichain and crosschain swaps, and integrated on-ramp and off-ramp solutions, deFi Access for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Safle’s identity wallets provide easily manageable multichain identities, seedless onboarding with full self-custody, Built-in features include NFT discovery, access to real-world assets, the security of cold wallets with smartphone simplicity, upcoming NFC recovery, an easy-to-use dashboard, and biometric access. Safle is committed to advancing the adoption of decentralized technologies with its comprehensive offerings.</p><p>Safle’s AI integration strategy is meticulously structured into three advanced&nbsp;phases:</p> 1. Informational Phase <p>In this initial phase, Safle introduces the next-gen Portfolio Viewer, a powerful tool enabling users to gain a holistic view of their digital asset portfolio. Portfolio Viewer’s advanced AI algorithms and data analytics, allows users to meticulously track performance metrics, scrutinize DeFi holdings, NFTs, and transaction histories.</p> 2. Informational with DeFi Integration <p>In this phase, Safle integrates advanced AI-driven DeFi features into its wallet. Users can use AI to scan their portfolios and find yield optimization opportunities. The AI identifies inefficiencies and suggests strategies for better yields, utilizing the ERC-4626 standard for easy integration. It also creates comprehensive transaction bundles, allowing users to execute multi-step DeFi strategies with a single approval, interacting smoothly with various DApps and staking protocols.</p> 3. Executional — Intent-Based Phase <p>In this phase, Safle transforms crypto wallet interfaces with account abstraction (AA) and AI agents, making Web3 interactions more intuitive and efficient. Users can express their needs using natural language, either by text or voice. The AI agents, using advanced natural language processing (NLP) models, understand these inputs and create optimal solutions. These solutions automatically match the appropriate DApps and blockchain networks, utilizing protocols like EIP-3074 (AUTH and AUTHCALL operations) and EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction via Entry Point Contract Specification) for seamless operation.</p><p>Once users approve, their AA-enabled accounts automatically execute the solutions, managing complex DApp interactions and transactions. This process relies on smart contracts, enabling users to verify outcomes on-chain.</p><p>In conclusion, Safle’s phased approach to AI integration leverages cutting-edge Web3 technologies and protocols, enhancing user experience and interaction in the decentralized ecosystem.</p><p>About Safle</p><p>Safle is a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet and blockchain infrastructure provider. It offers cross-resolving Web3 naming, multichain swaps, and on-the-go off-ramp and on-ramp infrastructure. Safle supports seamless identity management, seedless onboarding, and NFT discovery.

<p><a href="https://mysudo.com/reclaim/">RECLAI</a><a href="https://mysudo.com/reclaim/">M</a>, powered by <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, is a new personal data removal service that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to help you reclaim control of your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a> from the companies that store and might sell it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>RECLAIM scans your email subject lines and senders to identify which companies have your personal details, such as phone, address, and credit card details, and then gives you instructions for either switching out your personal information for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a> information or asking the company to delete your data altogether. <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a> are secure digital profiles with <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email</a>, and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">payment cards</a> to <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">use instead of your own</a>. You create your <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a> in the <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo all-in-one privacy app</a>, part of the same app family as RECLAIM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just released in beta, RECLAIM is a great place to start reducing the online exposure of your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private/">personally identifiable information</a> and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital footprint</a>, and boosting your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/11/9-reasons-why-data-privacy-matters/">data privacy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 RECLAIM has 6 handy tools built in&nbsp; 



 
 Dashboard – Start here. See your email scan and a first look at who has your data.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Footprint – Get the complete list of companies that have your data based on your email, and where your information might have been exposed in a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-caught-in-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Key insights – Dive into the nitty gritty of what information each company has on you and what they might be doing with it based on their privacy policy and terms of service, which RECLAIM extracts and summarizes using AI.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Protection Manager – Take the wheel by opting to either protect your data with <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a> or delete it altogether.&nbsp; 
 



 
 MySudo Protection – If you decide to protect your information with MySudo, follow the steps to switch out your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private/">personal details</a> for your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">Sudo</a> secure digital profile details.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Deletion – If you opt to ask the company to delete your information, you’d do that here.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>When you start with RECLAIM, head to your dashboard to see your footprint scan and then start reclaiming control. It’s quick and easy, and definitely worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>



 Sign in with Google to reclaim your Gmail account&nbsp; 



<p>The beta version of RECLAIM only scans Gmail accounts. If you don’t have Gmail, there’s an option to share with us which email service you’d like our next release to support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you log in with Google, RECLAIM will read the metadata of your Gmail messages. Email metadata includes date and time, sender and recipient email addresses, and email subject. RECLAIM does not have access to the attachments or body of your Gmail inbox messages&nbsp;</p>



 RECLAIM works best with MySudo&nbsp; 



<p>Once you’ve regained control of your personal information with RECLAIM, keep up the good work by using <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">Sudos</a> to proactively protect your online presence. Sudos are secure digital profiles with <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email</a>, and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">payment cards</a> to <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">use instead of your own</a>. You can sign up for new accounts and services with your Sudo information, not your personal information. You’d simply give companies your Sudo nickname, phone number, email address and payment card details instead of your own. Then, if that Sudo information is hit in a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-caught-in-a-data-breach/">data breach</a> or the company sells it to <a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a> for profit, your own information is safe because it’s masked. You might choose to delete the affected Sudo and create a new one based on your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2023/10/4-steps-to-setting-up-mysudo-to-meet-your-real-life-privacy-needs/">personal needs</a> (you have up to <a href="https://mysudo.com/mysudo-plans/">nine Sudos</a> in the app).

  <p>Last month <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDGABlog">we announced the general availability</a> of our next generation customer identity and access management solution, <a href="https://aka.ms/External_ID">Microsoft Entra External ID.</a> External ID makes Customer Identity &amp; Access Management (CIAM) secure and simple by enabling you to: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure all external identities: Managing several disparate solutions can overcomplicate your security strategy. By adopting External ID as your CIAM solution, you can secure all identity types within your Microsoft Entra admin center, safeguarding all external identities with industry-leading security, including our own conditional access engine, verifiable credentials, and built-in identity governance.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Create frictionless user experiences: The rise of fraud, GenAI, and identity attacks has increased end-user fear when it comes to security risks online. With External ID, you can build frictionless, branded, user centric interfaces into your web and mobile applications to increase brand awareness, build user trust and drive user engagement. Check out an example in the <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDWoodgroveDemo">WoodGrove Groceries demo!</a>&nbsp; 
 
 
 Streamline secure collaboration: Collaborating with external users and ensuring they have the right access at the right time is complex. Simplify collaboration by inviting business guests with External ID and defining what internal resources they can access across SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Accelerate the development of secure applications: Integrating robust and extensive user flows into apps can take developers months. Shorten development time to minutes by leveraging External ID’s rich set of APIs, SDKs, and integrations with developer tools, such as Visual Studio Code, to build secure and branded identity experiences into external-facing web and mobile apps.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Best in class value at scale: Managing several security stacks can be costly. External ID brings innovative CIAM features at a cost-effective value for any growing customer without compromising on scalable, end-to-end security. For example, this approach helps us bring best-in-class identity verification like Face Check with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/02/06/microsoft-entra-verified-id-introduces-face-check-in-preview/">Verified ID</a> to reduce help desk costs for combatting fraud. <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDPricing">Learn more about External ID pricing here.</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide best in class protection from bot attacks, sign in and signup fraud and ability to audit every step of external user’s journeys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				  Managing age-restricted purchases using decentralized identity and verifiable credentials is a simple, reliable way to provide a faster checkout experience while preventing illegal transactions.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>All around the United States this week people will be gathering to celebrate the national July 4th holiday with (hopefully) contained explosions.</p>
<p>The purchase of fireworks is controlled at the state level, meaning that it can vary from state to state, but generally requires the customer to be 18 years or older. Which is why many teenagers looking to celebrate with their friends will be trying to work around these restrictions, and some will resort to fraudulent IDs.</p>
<p>This gives us a great framework to explore how to manage age verification with verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale age verification is something that most people experience throughout their lifetime; usually, it takes a few seconds and requires a driver’s license and an interaction with a clerk or salesperson to purchase the requested item. This can be time consuming if a clerk is not readily available or even if the clerk is and there’s a long line. If fake IDs were always easy to spot at a glance, this wouldn’t be a problem; but they aren’t, and people are fallible, especially under pressure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A verifiable credential is a digital credential held in a wallet app on a mobile device. The information in the credential can be verified as to its source and its integrity —&nbsp;whether it has been altered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any verifiable credential that contains a claim about age, such as a date of birth, can be instantly checked for its source —&nbsp;is it a valid student ID, a driver’s license or a passport — and its integrity.&nbsp; Some credentials will be able to present age in the form of a zero-knowledge proof, meaning that age can be verified without revealing the actual age. The result is seamless, instant, and reliable age verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the age of self-checkout, being able to present a secure credential that a machine can verify removes the annoyance of waiting for an employee to be available to help you. It also allows you to share only your age with the verifying party, rather than other information on your driver’s license such as address, full name, height, weight, etc.</p>
<p>As the world moves more digital customers expect fast, convenient interactions. Decentralized identity and verifiable credentials provide the perfect way to both speed up these mundane processes — providing a better experience for your customers, while allowing you to see more of them — and also reduce your liability of mistakenly letting a fraudulent ID make a purchase.</p>
<p>Happy holidays from all of us at Indicio! We hope everyone is safe on the 4th, and if you have any questions about how decentralized identity can improve efficiency for your organization please don’t hesitate to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact our team.</a></p>

 Change announcements 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security update to Entra ID affecting clients which are running old, unpatched builds of Windows</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're making a security update to Entra ID such that use of older unpatched version of Windows which still use the less secure Key Derivation Function v1 (KDFv1) will no longer be supported.&nbsp; Once the update is rolled out, unsupported and unpatched Windows 10 and 11 clients will no longer be able to sign in to Entra ID. Globally, more than 99% of Windows clients signing in to Entra ID have the required security patches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Action required:</p>
<p>If your Windows devices have Security Patches after July 2021 no action is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Windows devices do not have security updates after July 2021, update Windows to the latest build of your currently supported Windows version to maintain access to Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All currently supported versions of Windows have the required patch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you keep Windows up to date with Security Updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Security Update to Windows <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-33781">CVE-2021-337</a>81 was issued in July 2021 to address a vulnerability where Primary Refresh Tokens were not stored sufficiently securely in the client.&nbsp; Once patched, Windows clients used the stronger KDFv2 algorithm.&nbsp; All versions of Windows released since that time have the update and handle the token securely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A small percentage of Windows devices have not yet been updated and are still using the older v1 key derivation function. To improve security of the system, unpatched devices using the KDFv1 algorithm will no longer be able to sign in to Entra ID using Primary Refresh Tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the user experience on unsupported Windows devices when this change is rolled out?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users of Windows devices which haven’t been updated with patches since July 2021 may experience sign in failures with their Entra ID user accounts on joined or hybrid joined Windows device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I diagnose this situation?</p>
<p>The error code, which will show in sign in logs, is 'AADSTS5000611: Symmetric Key Derivation Function version 'KDFV1' is invalid. Update the device for the latest updates.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Important Update: Azure AD Graph Retirement</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">June 2023</a>, the Azure AD Graph API service is in a retirement cycle and will be retired (shut down) in incremental stages. In the first stage of this retirement cycle, newly created applications will receive an error (HTTP 403) for any requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net">https://graph.windows.net</a>). We are revising the da20te for this first stage from June 30 to August 31, so only applications created after August 31, 2024, will be impacted. The second stage of the Azure AD Graph service retirement cycle will begin after January 31, 2025. At this point, all applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs will receive an error when making requests to the AAD Graph service. Azure AD Graph will be completely retired (and stop working) after June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph. We are providing an optional configuration (through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors">authenticationBehaviors</a> setting) that will allow an application to continue use of Azure AD Graph APIs through March 30, 2025.&nbsp; If you develop or distribute software that still uses Azure AD Graph APIs, you must act now to avoid interruption. You will either need to migrate your applications to Microsoft Graph (highly recommended) or configure the application for an extension, and ensure that your customers are prepared for the change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To identify applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs, we have provided two <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Entra recommendations</a> with information about applications and service principals that are actively using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important Update: AzureAD and MSOnline PowerShell retirement&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, the legacy Azure AD PowerShell, Azure AD PowerShell Preview, and MS Online modules <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-update-deprecation-of-azure-ad-powershell-and-msonline/ba-p/4094536">are deprecated</a>. These modules will continue to function through March 30, 2025, when they are retired and stop functioning. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview?view=graph-powershell-1.0">Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK</a> is the replacement for these modules and you should migrate your scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK as soon as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: as indicated in our April update, MS Online with “Legacy Auth” will stop functioning in the weeks after June 30, 2024. Legacy Auth is typically associated with versions before 1.1.166.0, and involves use of MS Online PowerShell with the Microsoft Online Sign-In Assistant package installed. If you are using MS Online versions before 1.1.166.0 or MS Online with Legacy Auth, you should immediately migrate to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK or update the MS Online version to the latest version (<a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MSOnline/1.1.183.81">1.1.183.81</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you identify usage of Azure AD PowerShell in your tenant, you can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Entra Recommendation</a> titled Migrate Service Principals from the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs to Microsoft Graph. This recommendation will show vendor applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant, including AzureAD PowerShell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are making substantial new and future investments in the PowerShell experience for managing Entra, with the recent Public Preview launch of the <a href="https://aka.ms/EntraPSPreview">Microsoft</a> Entra PowerShell module. This new module builds upon and is part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. It’s fully interoperable with all cmdlets in the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, enabling you to perform complex operations with simple, well documented commands. The module also offers a backward compatibility option to simplify migraiton from the deprecated AzureAD Module. Additionally, we are aware that some of our customers were unable to fully migrate to scripts that managed Per-user MFA from MSOnline to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Microsoft Graph APIs were <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/changelog?search=e22b3741-9f9a-4d25-af9d-e935018a8b68">recently made available</a> to read and configure Per-user MFA settings for users, and availability in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK cmdlets is soon to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Preview – QR code sign-in, a new authentication method for Frontline Workers</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are introducing a new simple way for Frontline Workers to authenticate in Microsoft Entra ID with a QR code and PIN, eliminating the need to enter long UPNs and alphanumeric passwords multiple times during their shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the private preview release of this feature in August 2024, all users in your tenant will see a new link ‘Sign in with QR code’ on navigating to <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/">https://login.microsoftonline.com</a> &gt; ‘Sign-in options’ &gt; ‘Sign in to an organization’ page. This new link, ‘Sign in with QR code’, will be visible only on mobile devices (Android/iOS/iPadOS). If you are not participating in the private preview, users from your tenant will not be able to sign-in through this method while we are still in private preview. They will receive an error message if they try to sign-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feature will have a ‘preview’ tag until it is generally available. Your organization needs to be enabled to test this feature. Broad testing will be available in public preview, which we will announce later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the feature is in private preview, no technical support will be provided. Please learn more about support during previews here <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/licensing-preview-info">Microsoft Entra ID preview program information - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to phone call settings: custom greetings and caller ID</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting September 2024, phone call settings (custom greetings and caller ID) under Entra's multifactor authentication blade will be moved under the voice authentication method in the authentication method policy. Instead of accessing these settings through the Entra ID or Azure portal, they will be accessible through MS Graph API.&nbsp;If your organization is using custom greetings and/or caller ID, please make sure to check the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings#phone-call-settings">public documentation</a> once we release the new experience to learn how to manage these settings through MS Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS Graph API support for per-user MFA</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting June 2024, we are releasing the capability to manage user status (Enforced, Enabled, Disabled) for per-user MFA through MS Graph API. This will replace the legacy MS Online PowerShell module that is being retired. Please be aware that the recommended approach to protect users with Microsoft Entra MFA is Conditional Access (for licensed organizations) and security defaults (for unlicensed organizations).&nbsp;The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates">public documentation</a> will be updated once we release the new experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server&nbsp;- 3-month notice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p><br>Beginning September 30, 2024, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server deployments will no longer service MFA requests, which could cause authentications to fail for your organization. MFA Server will have limited SLA and MFA Activity Report in the Azure Portal will no longer be available. To ensure uninterrupted authentication services and to remain in a supported state, organizations should <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-migrate-mfa-server-to-azure-mfa-user-authentication">migrate their users’ authentication data</a> to the cloud-based Azure MFA service using the latest Migration Utility included in the most recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55849">Azure MFA Server update</a>.

<p>Decommissioning of Group Writeback V2 (Public Preview) in Entra Connect Sync - Reminder</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public preview of Group Writeback V2 (GWB) in Entra Connect Sync is no longer available and Connect Sync will no longer support provisioning cloud security groups to Active Directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another similar functionality is offered in Entra Cloud Sync, called “Group Provision to AD”, that maybe used instead of GWB V2 for provisioning cloud security groups to AD. Enhanced functionality in Cloud Sync, along with other new features, are being developed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers who use this preview feature in Connect Sync should&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/migrate-group-writeback">switch their configuration from Connect Sync to Cloud Sync</a>. Customers can choose to move all their hybrid sync to Cloud Sync (if it supports their needs) or Cloud Sync can be run side-by-side and move only cloud security group provisioning to AD onto Cloud Sync. Customers who provision Microsoft 365 groups to AD can continue using GWB V1 for this capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visual enhancements to the per-user MFA admin configuration experience</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of ongoing service improvements, we are making updates to the per-user MFA admin configuration experience to align with the look and feel of Entra ID. This change does not include any changes to the core functionality and will only include visual improvements. Starting in August 2024, you will be redirected to the new experience both from the Entra admin center and Azure portal. There will be a banner presented for the first 30 days to switch back to the old experience, after which you can only use the new experience. The<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates"> public documentation</a> will be updated once we release the new experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updates to “Target resources” in Microsoft Entra Conditional Access</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in September 2024, the Microsoft Entra Conditional Access 'Target resources' assignment will consolidate the "Cloud apps" and "Global Secure Access" options under a new name "Resources". &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers will be able to target "All internet resources with Global Secure Access", "All resources (formerly 'all cloud apps') or select specific resources (formerly "select apps"). Some of the Global Secure Access attributes in the Conditional Access API will be deprecated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will start in September 2024 and will occur automatically, admins won’t need to take any action. There are no changes in the behavior of existing Conditional Access policies. To learn more, <a href="https://aka.ms/CA-target-resources-update">click here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upcoming Improvements to Entra ID device code flow</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to security, we are announcing upcoming enhancements to the Entra ID device code flow. These improvements aim to provide a more secure and efficient authentication experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've refined the messaging and included app details within the device code flow to ensure a more secure and precise user experience. Specifically, we've adjusted headers and calls to action to help your users recognize and respond to security threats more effectively. These changes are designed to help your users make more informed decisions and prevent phishing attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes will be gradually introduced starting in July 2024 and are expected to be fully implemented by August 30, 2024. No action required from you.</p>

  <p>One year ago, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> on the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will occur in incremental stages. In the first stage of this retirement cycle, newly created applications will receive an error (HTTP 403) for any requests to Azure AD Graph APIs. We’re revising the date for this first stage from June 30 to August 31, and only applications created after August 31, 2024 will be impacted. After January 31, 2025, all applications – both new and existing – will receive an error when making requests to Azure AD Graph APIs, unless they’re configured to allow extended Azure AD Graph access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph. We’re providing an optional configuration through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors">the authenticationBehaviors property,</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;will allow an application to use Azure AD Graph APIs through June 30, 2025. Azure AD Graph will be fully retired after June 30, 2025, and no API requests will function at this point, regardless of the application’s configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you develop or distribute software that still uses Azure AD Graph APIs, you must act now to avoid interruption. You’ll either need to migrate your applications to Microsoft Graph (highly recommended) or configure the application for an extension, as described below, and ensure that your customers are prepared for the change. If you’re using applications supplied by a vendor that use Azure AD Graph APIs, work with the software vendor to update to a version that has migrated to Microsoft Graph APIs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How do I find Applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Microsoft Entra recommendations</a> feature provides recommendations to ensure your tenant is in a secure and healthy state, while also helping you maximize the value of the features available in Entra ID. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve provided two Entra recommendations that show information about applications and service principals that are actively using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant. These new recommendations can support your efforts to identify and migrate the impacted applications and service principals to Microsoft Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra Recommendations for Azure AD Graph migration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Configuring an application for an extension of Azure AD Graph access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To allow an application created to have an extension for access to Azure AD Graph APIs through June 30, 2025, you must make a configuration change on the application after it’s created. This configuration change is done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface. By setting the blockAzureADGraphAccess flag to false, the newly created application will be able to continue to use Azure AD Graph APIs until further in the retirement cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: In this first stage, only Applications created after August 31, 2024 will be impacted. Existing applications will be able to continue to use Azure AD Graph APIs even if the authenticationBehaviors property is not configured. Once this change is rolled out, you may also choose to set blockAzureADGraphAccess to true for testing or to prevent an existing application from using Azure AD Graph APIs.&nbsp; </p>

 About Microsoft Graph 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph represents our best-in-breed API surface. It offers a single unified endpoint to access Entra and Microsoft 365 services such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Intune. All new functionalities will only be available through Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph is also more secure and resilient than Azure AD Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph has all the capabilities that have been available in Azure AD Graph and new APIs like identity protection and authentication methods. Its client libraries offer built-in support for features like retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication, and payload compression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What about Azure AD and Microsoft Online PowerShell modules? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, AzureAD, AzureAD-Preview, and Microsoft Online (MSOL) PowerShell modules are deprecated and will only be supported for security fixes. These modules will be retired and stop working after March 30, 2025. You should migrate these to Microsoft Graph PowerShell.

<p>Zug and Singapore — July 1, 2024 –The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, comprising <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a>, <a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.ai</a>, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, has today announced the launch of the multi-coin merger, forming the unified token. This merger of AGIX, OCEAN, and FET tokens marks a significant step towards creating a fully decentralized AI ecosystem. By aligning incentives, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance drives the vision of a decentralized, efficient, and transparent AI landscape, polling resources and expertise from its members to accelerate advancements in the ethical and transparent development of AI solutions.</p><p>Today, SingularityNET’s $AGIX and Ocean Protocol’s $OCEAN tokens merge into $FET. FET trading remains uninterrupted as the project rebrands to Artificial Superintelligence Alliance across platforms including CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The migration platform is now open on the <a href="https://www.singularitydao.ai/migrate-asi">SingularityDAO dapp</a>, and $AGIX and $OCEAN are starting to delist from exchanges. This phase aims to onboard exchanges and data aggregators for a smooth transition.</p><p>Phase II will focus on community onboarding and $ASI deployment, prioritizing self-custody holders and deploying ASI tokens across multiple chains. The transition includes new migration contracts for $AGIX and $OCEAN tokens not yet converted to $FET and for EVM-based FET. All FET Mainnet Tokens will automatically convert to ASI during Fetch.ai’s mainnet upgrade. The migration contracts will be open for years, allowing ample time for all conversions. Detailed guides and tutorials are being provided to support a smooth transition. The timing of this phase is still underway, ensuring all necessary preparations are completed.</p><p>“Today’s token merger underscores our commitment to advancing safe artificial intelligence,” said Humayun Sheikh, chairman of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and CEO of Fetch.ai. “By merging our tokens, we aim to enhance operational efficiency and seamlessly integrate decentralized AI systems, ensuring broad access to cutting-edge AI technologies. This merger marks the beginning of an ambitious journey to foster unparalleled collaboration and openness, setting new standards for the industry.”</p><p>“We’re excited to have reached this milestone along the path to realizing our vision of an Artificial Superintelligence Alliance capable of winning the AGI and ASI race for the decentralized ecosystem,” stated Ben Goertzel, CEO of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and SingularityNet. “This tokenomic merger paves the way for a series of R&amp;D and product collaborations combining Alliance technologies toward beneficial superintelligence.”</p><p>“We’re grateful to the community, exchanges and other partners for accommodating this token merge. We’re really looking forward to focusing on our users and products that increase adoption.” said Bruce Pon, Council Board Director of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and founder of Ocean Protocol.</p><p>This milestone reflects the alliance’s commitment to accelerating AI research and development by combining Fetch.ai’s autonomous agent technology, Ocean Protocol’s data exchange frameworks, and SingularityNET’s decentralized AI services. The three technology partners will develop products leveraging each project’s diverse solutions to ensure ethical AI development. This open collaboration invites others to join the alliance, fostering an inclusive environment that promotes cutting-edge advancements while emphasizing responsible and transparent AI practices.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ASI_Alliance/status/1805316078060417307">LINK TO ASI MIGRATION GUIDELINES</a></p><p>About The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance<br>The Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) Alliance is a collective formed by Fetch.ai, SingularityNET (SNET), and Ocean Protocol.

Security is always a driver, but deploying organizations want useful data to improve marketing effectiveness and increase revenues. New privacy regulations put more requirements for information collection and handling on customer organizations. CIAM systems must also be able to integrate with other IT, security, and enterprise IAM solutions. To capture market share, CIAM vendors have to be innovative.

<p></p>
<p>Following the successful <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/tbdex-v1">launch of tbDEX 1.0</a> in Rio de Janeiro, TBD embarked on a roadshow across Africa, visiting Accra, Nairobi, and Cape Town.
Our mission was to engage with local developers and share tbDEX, an open source protocol for global payments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recognizing that many African countries face significant barriers to participating in the global economy, we aimed to support the vibrant and growing developer communities in these regions.
These communities are already tackling these challenges head-on, and we wanted to contribute by providing open source tools to build robust payment applications.</p>
<p>The roadshow featured full-day, hands-on workshops in Accra and Nairobi, where hundreds of developers gathered to learn how to utilize tbDEX.
The excitement was palpable as participants built wallet applications using the tbDEX SDK.
The enthusiasm and curiosity among the developers were evident, and the success of these workshops was widely shared across <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7199777112713486337/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7199777112713486337%29">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://x.com/yellowcard_app/status/1795385010117386749">Twitter</a>.</p>
 <blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/user/status/1794038435218387164"></a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/user/status/1794018057012072690"></a></blockquote> 
<p>Angie Jones, Head of Developer Relations, and Adewale Abati, Staff Developer Advocate, led the workshops, demonstrating the capabilities of developers eager to integrate advanced payment solutions.
Co-sponsored by Yellow Card and Circle, these sessions saw developers integrating wallet applications with tbDEX in just one day.</p>
  
<p>In addition to the workshops, TBD actively participated in notable conferences across Africa.
At the 3iAfrica conference in Accra, Mike Brock, CEO of TBD, delivered an insightful session titled "Trust Reimagined in the Digital Assets World," discussing the economic principles behind digital assets and their impact on trust and value exchange in business.
Angie Jones hosted a roundtable discussion on tbDEX as an open protocol for global money movement."</p>
  
<p>The team also made a stop at Joy 99.7 FM radio station in Ghana, where Mike and Angie discussed how digital identity can enhance payment systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The journey continued to the ID4Africa conference in Cape Town, where TBD engaged with local stakeholders to gain deeper insights into the challenges surrounding digital identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Overall, the roadshow was a significant step in connecting with developer communities across Africa.
We were inspired by the talent and determination we encountered and look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that will emerge from these collaborations.</p>
 
<p>Get Started with tbDEX</p>
<p>With tbDEX, anyone can dive into building innovative payment solutions without needing permission.
This open source tool empowers developers to start building immediately.
We welcome your <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex">feedback and contributions</a> to make tbDEX even more robust and versatile.
Join us in breaking down barriers and building the future of global payments today.</p>

<p>I live in Slack. The rest of the team at YeshID does, too. So do a lot of our customers. That’s why we created the Slack integration we wrote about in <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/ditch-reminder-chaos-yeshid-slackbot-manages-onboarding-offboarding/">this other post.</a></p>
<p>Here, I’m going to tell you how we’ve taken that integration to the next level.</p>
 The Problem 
<p>Imagine you’re in Slack, discussing some problem. Steve’s the guy who seems to have a handle on what to do. The best way for Steve to take the next step is with an app he doesn’t use all the time. He knows how to use it but doesn’t have access right now. So, let’s just get him access. Easy, right? But according to the customers we’ve been talking to, it’s not.</p>
<p>They’ve told us what they have had to do:</p>
 
 Get out of Slack and send an email (or write a JIRA ticket) to the admin for the app to request access. 
 The admin may not be the approver, so the admin has to email the approver. 
 When the approver approves, they reply with an email to the admin, who grants access. 
 The admin then has to notify the requester. 
 However, the requester might not be the person who will use the app, so they have to notify that person. 
 
<p>It’s a mess. Or as it’s usually described, it’s a cluster- umm cluster-something.</p>
<p>Oh, and compliance? You need an audit trail for compliance. A bunch of emails is not an audit trail. You’ve got to record the decision in an organized way–like in a spreadsheet. Ugh spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Of course, some customers have a Slack channel for requests instead of emails. As the organization grows with multiple IT members, they often have a generic channel for access requests (or perhaps you’re just using the general IT team chat). But now you have to hope your request isn’t missed or forgotten in the buffer.</p>
<p>And you still need an audit trail for compliance. And a way to make sure things get done</p>
 The Solution: YeshID’s Access Workflow 
<p>We listened to them, and YeshID solved that problem a while ago. Anyone can go to their YeshID console and request an app, and YeshID will manage everything downstream. Anyone who’s clicked on the “Get Started Now” button on the YeshID website, that is.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.yeshid.com/signup"></a></p>
<p>Hint: click <a href="https://app.yeshid.com/signup">here</a> or on the button to Get Started Now,</p>
<p>If you’ve signed up for YeshID, here’s how it works:</p>
 
 Go to <a href="https://app.yeshid.com">https://app.yeshid.com</a> 
 Click on “My Apps” 
 Click on “Request an application.” 
 Pick the application or request a different one if the one you want isn’t on the list 
 
<p>And you’re done.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID generates a task and gets it to the right person–approver or admin–depending on how you’ve set things up. YeshIID tracks actions and notifies the requester when the request has been completed.</p>
<p>Having YeshID manage the process and provide the artifacts needed for compliance is better than an unmanaged collection (mess) of emails or Slack messages that you have to round up and put into a spreadsheet.</p>
 Even Better: Request Directly from Slack 
<p>But why even switch focus from Slack to YeshID?</p>
<p>With YeshID’s new Slack integration, you make the request right in Slack—no tool switching. And even better, you can request an application for someone else. Here’s how it works.</p>
 
 Just type <code>/request</code> 
 YeshID will pop up a request form in Slack 
 
<p></p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll see if you were part of T’s Tangerine Organization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And the image below&nbsp; how it would look if you wanted to make a request for Figma on behalf of a guy named Steve Jobs. (Not that Steve Jobs. That one has ceased to be, expired and gone to meet his maker, is bereft of life, rests in peace… see <a href="http://montypython.50webs.com/scripts/Series_1/53.htm">Monty Python Dead Parrot Sketch</a>. This is another Steve Jobs.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The request goes straight to YeshID and gets forwarded to the right approver or administrator. YeshID monitors the entire process and constructs an audit trail. When approval has been granted, YeshID notifies both the person who has been given access and the person who requested it for them. No loose ends. All loops closed.</p>
<p>Ready to Revolutionize Your Access Management?</p>
<p>Don’t let outdated processes hold you back. Embrace YeshID and experience:</p>
 
 Increased productivity 
 Enhanced security 
 Simplified compliance 
 Happier employees and IT staff 
 
<p>Start your journey to streamlined access management today with YeshID!</p>

  <p>We’re thrilled to announce the <a href="https://aka.ms/EntraPSDocs">public preview of the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module</a>, a new high-quality and scenario-focused PowerShell module designed to streamline management and automation for the Microsoft Entra product family. In 2021, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/automate-and-manage-azure-ad-tasks-at-scale-with-the-microsoft/ba-p/1942489">we announced</a> that all our future PowerShell investments would be in the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. Today, we’re launching the next major step on this journey. The Microsoft Entra PowerShell module (Microsoft.Graph.Entra) is a part of our ongoing commitment and increased investment in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to improve your experience and empower automation with Microsoft Entra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re grateful for the substantial feedback we’ve heard from Microsoft Entra customers about our PowerShell experiences, and we’re excited to hear your thoughts after evaluating this preview module. We plan to build on our investment in the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module going forward and expand its coverage of resources and scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Microsoft Entra PowerShell? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra PowerShell module is a command-line tool that allows administrators to manage and automate Microsoft Entra resources programmatically. This includes efficiently managing users, groups, applications, service principals, policies, and more. The module builds upon and is part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. It’s fully interoperable with all cmdlets in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview?view=graph-powershell-1.0">Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK</a>,&nbsp;enabling you to perform complex operations with simple, well-documented commands. The module also offers a backward compatibility option with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-2.0">deprecated AzureAD module</a> to accelerate migration. Microsoft Entra PowerShell supports PowerShell version 5.1 and version 7+. We recommend using PowerShell version 7 or higher with the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module on all platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Benefits of Microsoft Entra PowerShell 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Focus on usability and quality: Microsoft Entra PowerShell offers human-readable parameters, deliberate parameter set specification, inline documentation, and core PowerShell fundamentals like pipelining. 
 Backward compatibility with AzureAD module: Microsoft Entra PowerShell accelerates migration from the recently <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-update-deprecation-of-azure-ad-powershell-and-msonline/ba-p/4094536">announced AzureAD module deprecation</a>. 
 Flexible and granular authorization: Consistent with Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, Microsoft Entra PowerShell enables administrative consent for the permissions you want to grant to the application and supports specifying your own application identity for maximum granularity in app permission assignment. You can also use certificate, Service Principal, or Managed Identity authentication patterns. 
 Open source: The Microsoft Entra PowerShell module is open source, allowing contributions from the community to create great PowerShell experiences and share them with everyone. Open source promotes collaboration and facilitates the development of innovative business solutions. You can view Microsoft's customizations and adapt them to meet your needs. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Next steps 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installation: Install Microsoft Entra PowerShell, which uses the “/v1.0” API version to manage Microsoft Graph resources, from the PowerShell Gallery by running this command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Entra -AllowPrerelease -Repository PSGallery -Force</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or install the Beta module, which manages Microsoft Graph resources using the "/beta" API version, by running this command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Entra.Beta -AllowPrerelease -Repository PSGallery -Force



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authentication: Use the Connect-Entra command to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID with delegated access (interactive) or application-only access (noninteractive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Connect-Entra -TenantId 'your-tenant-id' -Scopes 'User.Read.All'</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see more examples for using your own registered application, Service Principal, Managed Identity, and other authentication methods, see the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.entra/connect-entra">Connect-Entra command documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find all available commands: You can list all available commands in the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module by using the command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Get-Command -Module Microsoft.Graph.Entra</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get Help: The Get-Help command shows detailed information about specific commands, such as syntax, parameters, cmdlet description, and usage examples. For example, to learn more about the Get-EntraUser command, run:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Migrating from AzureAD PowerShell module: You can run your existing AzureAD PowerShell scripts with minimal modifications using Microsoft Entra PowerShell by using the Enable-EntraAzureADAlias command. For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Import-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph.Entra</p>
<p>Connect-Entra #Replaces Connect-AzureAD for auth</p>
<p>Enable-EntraAzureADAlias #enable aliasing&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get-AzureADUser -Top 1</p>

 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the difference between the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK and Microsoft Entra PowerShell modules?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra PowerShell is a part of our increased investment in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. It brings high-quality and scenario-optimized Entra resource management to the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. Still, it keeps all the benefits of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK for authorization, connection management, error handling, and (low-level) API coverage. As Microsoft Entra PowerShell builds on the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, it is completely interoperable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module compatible with Microsoft Graph PowerShell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. You don't need to switch if you’ve already used the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module. Both modules work well together, and whether you use Entra module cmdlets or Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK cmdlets for Entra resources is a matter of preference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to migrate from the deprecated AzureAD or MSOnline modules. Should I wait for Microsoft Entra PowerShell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. One of our goals with Microsoft Entra PowerShell is to help you migrate from Azure AD PowerShell more quickly by setting Enable-EntraAzureADAlias. Microsoft Entra PowerShell supports simplified migration for scripts that were using AzureAD PowerShell, with over 98% compatibility. However, the legacy AzureAD and MSOnline PowerShell modules are deprecated and will be retired (stop working) after March 30, 2025. We recommend that you act now to begin migrating your MSOnline and AzureAD PowerShell scripts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both modules use the latest Microsoft Graph APIs. For test environments and non-production systems, you can migrate to Microsoft Entra PowerShell. We recommend migrating to this module for production systems only after it reaches general availability. If you migrate scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK now, there is no need to update them again with Microsoft Entra PowerShell, as it enhances and will not replace Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I update Microsoft Graph PowerShell scripts to Microsoft Entra PowerShell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not necessary but a matter of preference. Microsoft Entra PowerShell is part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell solution, and the two modules are interoperable. You can install both modules side-by-side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Microsoft Entra PowerShell add support for more resources in the future?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it is a long-term investment. We will continue to expand support for more resources and scenarios over time. Expect new cmdlets for Privileged Identity Management (PIM), Entitlement Management, Tenant Configuration settings, Per-User multifactor authentication (MFA), and more. We'll also enhance existing cmdlets with additional parameters, detailed help, and intuitive names. Check out <a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/entra-powershell">GitHub repo</a> for ongoing updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Microsoft Entra PowerShell use a pre-consented app like AzureAD or MSOnline modules?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. Microsoft Entra PowerShell permissions aren't preauthorized, and users must request the specific app permissions needed. This granularity ensures that the application has only the necessary permissions, providing granular control over resource management. For maximum flexibility and granularity in application permissions, we recommend <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/entra-powershell/create-custom-application">using your own application identity</a> with Entra PowerShell. By creating different applications for different uses of PowerShell in your tenant, you can have exacting control over application permissions granted for specific scenarios. To use your own application identity with Microsoft Entra PowerShell, you can use the Connect-Entra cmdlet:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Connect-Entra -ClientId 'YOUR_APP_ID' -TenantId 'YOUR_TENANT_ID'&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you still relying on traditional passwords to authenticate users, even while cyber threats grow more sophisticated today? This article will examine passkey authentication work, a modern digital identity verification and security solution. You’ll learn everything about passkey authentication work, from its basic principles to its practical applications, along with the advantages and challenges it presents. By the end, you’ll gain valuable insights to determine if passkey authentication is suitable for enhancing your organization’s digital user verification and security.</p>
 
Traditional Methods vs. Passkey Authentication 
<p>While familiar and straightforward, the traditional password system presents numerous security challenges. These challenges include susceptibility to brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries numerous combinations to guess the password, and phishing attacks, where a user is tricked into revealing their password.<br>
Passkeys mitigate these risks effectively. They provide an additional or an alternative to passwords as a layer of security by issuing a new and unique code for every authentication attempt.<br>
Unlike static passwords, which are vulnerable to reuse in multiple services, passkeys are service-specific and time-bound. This dynamic nature makes it significantly more challenging for unauthorized users to access an account.<br>
If an attacker were to gain your static password, they could use it repeatedly until you notice and take action. With passkeys, however, each code is invalidated after use or after the expiration of a predetermined time, thus nullifying this type of attack vector.</p>
 
Layers of Security: Multi-Factor Authentication 
<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly enhances account security by requiring two or more independent credentials: what the user knows (password), what the user has (security token or phone), and what the user is (biometric verification).<br>
The first layer is typically the password, which the user sets and knows. The second layer, a passkey, is often generated and stored on a users device or within a browser.<br>
Implementing MFA means that even if one layer is compromised, the likelihood of an unauthorized individual gaining access is significantly reduced.<br>
For instance, if your password were to be compromised, an attacker would still need to pass the subsequent layers of authentication, such as the passkey or biometric scan, to access your account.<br>
This multi-layered approach is increasingly considered best practice in cybersecurity to protect against a broad range of attacks and vulnerabilities.</p>
 The Authentication Sequence 
<p>When you try to log into a secure site, a unique passkey is made just for that attempt. It’s like when a game show host says, “Here’s the public key and the private key for your special question.Once the passkey is created and registered, it is stored on your device and can be used to access the associated website or app. To log in, simply select the saved passkey and authenticate using your device’s screen lock, such as a fingerprint sensor or facial recognition.<br>
The passkey is a permanent digital credential that replaces traditional usernames and passwords, providing a seamless and secure login experience without the need to enter anything manually each time.</p>
 
Types of Passkeys 
<p>Not all keys look the same, and neither do all passkeys. Some passkeys stored are a mix of letters and numbers. Others are just numbers but have a time limit, like a game you must beat before time runs out. Some people even use their fingerprints as a passkey.<br>
The type of passkey you use depends on what you’re trying to keep safe. If it’s just an email account, maybe a simple passkey sent through text is enough. But if it’s something like your bank account, you might want more layers, like a fingerprint plus a time-sensitive code.</p>
 
Encryption and Secure Transmission 
<p>Imagine you’re passing a secret note in class. You wouldn’t want anyone else to read it. That’s why you might write it in code or a language only you and your friend understand. This is similar to what encryption does for passkey, unlike passwords and cryptographic keys.<br>
When a passkey is sent to you, it’s scrambled into a code. This scrambled version is the only thing that gets sent over the internet. Even if someone catches it, like catching your secret note, they can’t read it because it’s still in code. Only your device knows how to unscramble it back into the same passkey you can use.</p>
 
Advantages of Passkey Authentication 
 
Security Benefits 
<p>One significant advantage of using passkeys is that they add an extra layer of security key safety to your online activities. Passkeys are often temporary, unlike traditional passwords that remain the same until you decide to change them.<br>
They expire after a short time or after you’ve used them, making them useless to anyone who tries to misuse them later. Another upside of traditional passwords is that passkeys are generated on the spot and sent to you directly; they are much harder for hackers to predict or intercept.<br>
This makes them a sturdy barrier against unauthorized access to Google accounts and user devices, effectively acting like a changing lock that keeps potential intruders guessing.</p>
 
User Convenience 
<p>While high security is crucial, it shouldn’t come at the cost of making life difficult for the user. Passkeys are often simpler to use than they sound. Typically, they are sent directly to a device that you already have on you, like your mobile device PIN or phone.<br>
There’s no need to memorize complex combinations of weak passwords or carry additional hardware. Moreover, because a new passkey is generated each time, the user is less pressured to create and remember a strong password. You don’t need to keep track of a complex string of characters; the passkey system handles the complexity.</p>
 
Scalability and Compatibility 
<p>Passkey systems are highly scalable and can easily expand as a business or organization grows. They can be implemented on various platforms and are usually compatible with existing software and hardware. This makes them a flexible option for both small businesses and large enterprises.<br>
Regarding compatibility, many passkey systems can be integrated into existing multi-factor authentication setups. Adding passkey authentication often doesn’t require an overhaul of the user’s current security system, making it a cost-effective upgrade.</p>
 Passkey Authentication in Corporate Security 
<p>In a business setting, protecting sensitive data is paramount. Passkey authentication is increasingly used to ensure only authorized employees can access crucial company information. Depending on the employee’s role, the passkey support system can be customized to provide different access levels.<br>
Moreover, since passkeys replacing passwords are often combined with other forms of authentication, they help create a robust security environment against remote attacks. This makes it difficult for potential intruders to gain unauthorized access to remote servers, safeguarding the company’s intellectual and financial assets.</p>
 
Use in Financial Transactions 
<p>Regarding banking and financial transactions, the stakes for security are incredibly high. Any vulnerability can lead to financial loss or identity theft. This is why many financial institutions turn to passkey technology for user authentication.<br>
Passkeys’ temporary nature and direct delivery to the user’s device make them a robust security measure for online financial activities. The use of passkeys as authentication factors can also streamline the user experience.<br>
For instance, during a financial transaction, a passkey can be quickly sent to the user’s device, reducing the steps needed to verify the user’s identity and making the process more efficient while maintaining high-security standards.</p>
 
Public and Government Sector Adoption 
<p>The need for secure passkey authentication and public key cryptography isn’t limited to corporations and financial institutions.<br>
Government agencies and public services also handle sensitive information and require high levels of security. Passkey authentication offers a feasible and efficient solution for these sectors.<br>
In many cases, government systems have to be accessible to the public for services like tax filing, voting, or accessing personal records.<br>
Passkey authentication provides a user-friendly yet secure method of using cryptographic private keys to facilitate these interactions, maintaining the integrity of data breaches in the system while ensuring ease of use for the general population.</p>
 
Security Vulnerabilities 
<p>While passkey authentication provides significant advantages, it is not entirely foolproof. For instance, if the device receiving the passkey is compromised, the user’s entire system’s integrity could be at risk. Malware or keyloggers on your smartphone or nearby device could potentially intercept passkeys, rendering the added layer of security ineffective.<br>
At the end of the encrypted call, there’s the possibility of ‘Man-in-the-Middle’ attacks, where an unauthorized entity intercepts the passkey during transmission. While encryption methods are generally strong enough to withstand such attempts, the risk of data breach, although low, still exists.</p>
 
Usability Concerns 
<p>The effectiveness of a security key system also depends on its ease of use. If users find a system cumbersome or confusing, they might avoid using it, compromising security.<br>
For instance, older adults or people not comfortable with technology might find the login process of receiving and inputting a passkey too complex, leading to resistance to adopting this security method.<br>
Also, the dependence on a single device, like a mobile phone, to receive a passkey can be problematic. If the phone is lost, broken, or out of battery, the user’s devices could get locked out of essential services until the issue is resolved.</p>
 
Cost and Complexity of Implementation 
<p>Switching to or adding security keys to a passkey or passwordless authentication-only system is not always straightforward. It requires investment in the technology and could necessitate updates or changes to existing operating systems, too.<br>
This can be a significant challenge for small businesses or organizations with limited resources. A new system will often require staff training who manage it and user education. This entails additional costs and effort, and the transition period could pose temporary but disruptive challenges.</p>
 
Implementation Best Practices 
 
Choosing the Right Passkey Tool 
<p>The first step in implementing passkey authentication is choosing the system that best fits the needs of the organization or service. Factors to consider include the level of security required, ease of use for the target audience, and compatibility with existing systems. Additionally, it’s advisable to opt for plans that offer strong encryption and reliable delivery methods for the user’s passkeys.</p>
 
Technical Requirements 
<p>Before deployment, organizations must ensure their infrastructure is compatible with the new passkey authentication system. This may require hardware and software upgrades or the integration of new modules into the current systems. A well-defined technical requirement will facilitate a smoother transition and mitigate potential challenges.</p>
 
Training and Awareness Programs 
<p>Security measures are most effective when users understand how and why they work. Training programs should be initiated to educate users and administrators about the new system.<br>
This can range from simple guides and FAQs to more intensive training sessions for staff responsible for system management. Ongoing awareness programs can help maintain high levels of compliance and effectiveness.</p>
 Technological Advancements on the Horizon 
<p>Passkey authentication will likely evolve with advancements in biometric authentication and sensor technology. Future systems might incorporate biometrics or behavioral traits as additional forms of biometric authentication of passkeys. There’s also a potential for integrating Artificial Intelligence to detect unauthorized activities more efficiently, making the system even more secure.</p>
 
Integrating with Other Authentication Methods 
<p>As public key cryptography and private key technology evolve, passkey authentication is expected to become more sophisticated and may integrate seamlessly with biometric data and other authentication methods. Combining passkeys with biometrics or hardware tokens can create an even more robust security landscape, offering identity providers high security and user convenience.</p>
<p>Throughout this discussion, we have unpacked the complexities of passkey authentication, shedding light on its benefits, technical implementations, and security best practices.

<p>You have a problem. You see the looming effects of climate change and want to ensure a livable future for your children, but the money you are investing to support your children when they grow up is in mutual funds that likely support fossil fuel companies, arms manufacturers, and others directly responsible for the destruction of our climate.&nbsp;</p><p>The money that you hope will give your children a future is also actively destroying that future.</p><p>There is a new push into ethical funds which are meant to avoid these pitfalls, but these funds are limited in their investment opportunities and the tools for you to audit their activities are in their infancy. This article seeks to expand perspectives on better investing.</p><p>What if you could invest in the environment, in efforts for climate justice, in carbon markets, and systemic change? What if you could invest in a future that you and your children want to live in?&nbsp;</p><blockquote>What we need are new ways of expressing the very real value of these resources so that we can bring them into the system, investing in their preservation and growth. What we need is for our economies to not be at odds with our ecosystems.</blockquote><p>Let me introduce the concept of Regenerative Economics (Regen). The idea is to account for all the costs and values that are missed by traditional economics. That means both social effects, and externalities like carbon emissions.</p><p>If a marsh is drained to allow for a new property development, there is a loss of habitat for important species, there is a release of stored carbon and also a loss of future carbon sequestering and oxygen producing capacity by all of the plants and algae, and then there is a loss of the recreation space which is enjoyed people who live in the area. And all of this before we account for the carbon burned by the construction of the shopping centers and roads and homes that replace the original habitat. These are material and social costs that are paid by local residents, future generations, and the ecosystem as a whole. There is also an economic benefit to the developers, investors, and community members who use the services and spaces of the new development. These benefits and costs both matter, but our current economy only has methods to account for the expenses and value of the development, forgetting the value of the marsh and costs of its loss. Sometimes environmental offsets are bought to compensate, but the specificities are largely unaccounted for. Instead, those socio-ecological losses are termed “externalities” and considered outside the system.&nbsp;</p><p>But, you and I both know that these losses are not external to our lives. The loss of a local wetland, or our favorite childhood hike, or the salmon runs that bring life to our local rivers all impact us and our families for generations. </p><p>What we need are new ways of expressing the very real value of these resources so that we can bring them into the system, investing in their preservation and growth. What we need is for our economies to not be at odds with our ecosystems.</p> Case Studies <p>Two leading projects in the Holochain Ecosystem are attempting to solve pieces of this conundrum. One, Kwaxala, is building financial tools for investing in the environments we want to preserve; and the other, IOEN (the Internet of Energy Network), is connecting global finance to the local renewables that need to be developed. Together, they represent the beginning of a movement for ethical investment and regenerative economics.</p><p>Let’s start with IOEN.&nbsp;</p> IOEN <p>Renewable energy is the future. If our civilization has a future, we will have to shift to more sustainable methods for meeting our energy needs. That much is clear. It’s also clear that fossil fuel companies are resistant to this change, and that large solar and wind farms can only be one part of the solution. Small scale local energy production will be a large portion of the global market. Minigrids and Microgrids are emerging as solutions that are more efficient and resilient as they don’t need the massive infrastructure of energy distribution on top of the infrastructure of production. Energy is generated, stored, traded, and used locally.</p><p>The pathway to fully clean, tradable energy is not immediate. On the way to full access to clean energy, organizations including large corporations are taking seriously the responsibility to offset their production of carbon emissions. A factory produces a lot of carbon, both from the energy it uses and the industrial processes themselves. They can get their electricity from renewable sources, but depending on where a particular factory is and when they are operating, they might not have access to renewables. Renewable energy generation is subject to location, geography, and access to resources like wind, enough sunshine, and the ability to store electricity.</p><blockquote>What if you could invest in the environment, in efforts for climate justice, in carbon markets, and systemic change? What if you could invest in a future that you and your children want to live in?</blockquote><p>But, just because they are incapable of directly using renewable energy doesn’t mean that they cannot support the use of renewables generally. Environmental Attribute Credits (EACs), including carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), help create incentives to invest, support, and use renewable energy.</p><p>Currently, large renewable energy farms can sell carbon credits or RECs (depending on the system used), helping corporations offset their carbon emissions. But these are economies of scale. The accounting needed to get government issuance of these carbon credits only works at large scales (a single electrical meter is a lot easier to measure and monitor than many distributed meters). IOEN is providing a way for small scale energy producers who serve their local communities to aggregate their energy production and access global renewable certificate markets.</p><p>In order to ensure auditability and to account for distributed energy production by a collection of small holders, data is needed to track energy production. IOEN’s current work with partners in Asia is helping companies and home owners provide two types of data. First, photos of their solar arrays, preferably at the time of installation. Secondly, ongoing readings from their meter, showing the energy that they feed back to their local grid. IOEN’s partners then add satellite data which is used to confirm the installation of solar panels at the sites claimed. All of this data becomes available to regulators who can cross reference each source, ensuring that the meter readings match the expected generation range for the panels.&nbsp;</p><p>Aggregating the data of many individual producers allows IOEN to meet the scale requirements to work with government regulators, procuring and then selling the certificates to corporations. As each individual energy producer’s contributions to this larger pool is tracked, they are able to then be compensated directly in relation to the amount of energy they produced.</p><p>Key to IOEN’s value in the market is the ability for clients to store the data (meter data, photographs etc.) in private networks hosted on Holochain which provides auditors with assurance that the certificates minted are validated and true. This creates transparency and integrity in the certificate. IOEN’s blockchain solutions that sit on top of that data then allow secondary markets to emerge, along with fractionalised investment opportunities in these renewable assets, creating liquidity. Because transactions are all tracked on the blockchain, and linked to secure data in Holochain, different organizations involved in the assets all can be paid seamlessly and transparently through fractionalised payments. Already small businesses, communities, and large corporations are seeing the value in this approach for a number of energy-related environmental assets.</p> Kwaxala <p>Kwaxala is an indigenous forest regeneration cooperative taking a different approach to nature protection that goes far beyond carbon credits.</p><p>Rather than focusing on energy production, they are concerned with the preservation and stewardship of what we already have. Remember that marsh? We agreed that it has a value. And the question is: how can we invest in that value? Kwaxala is making that a possibility. Most land used for logging, oil drilling and fracking, and other resource extraction is government owned and often in contradiction with recognised Indigenous land rights in the area. Companies own or buy the permits and right to extract resources from that land, without buying the land itself. Kwaxala is working to buy those same rights, but rather than using them for extraction, they are securing the right to protect and regenerate the ecosystems threatened by extraction. This legal guarantee of preservation, in an area previously at genuine threat of extraction, is then used to generate carbon offsets each year which can be sold to corporations meeting their net zero commitments.</p><blockquote>This rich dataset then provides detailed provenance for both the particular offsets generated by the protected ecosystems and for the long term investments in the ecosystems themselves so that there is detailed visibility into the health and stewardship of the ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Kwaxala offsets not only represent sequestered carbon, but also a wider range of monetized ecoservices such as biodiversity protection and ecosystem preservation alongside positive social outcomes such as Indigenous equity and reconciliation. This enables them to command a premium market price per tonne. Additionally, by enabling capital investment directly into the organization holding the right to regenerate, they provide a new way for investment funds to flow into the asset value of the protected natural ecosystem, generating much needed upfront capital to establish these protected areas and counterbalance the extractive economic pressure to destroy the area.</p><p>But how do we ensure that the land is well taken care of? Here Kwaxala is using overlapping datasets to build a picture of the ecosystem and its health. Working with Indigenous land stewards, who are also the principal shareholders in Kwaxala itself, they are developing the metrics needed to monitor and support the wellbeing of the particular ecosystems. For some situations, that might be the water and air quality; for others, it might be the presence of indicator species; for many, it will be the conglomeration of multiple data points, collaborating to tell a story. This rich dataset then provides detailed provenance for both the particular offsets generated by the protected ecosystems and for the long term investments in the ecosystems themselves so that there is detailed visibility into the health and stewardship of the ecosystem.</p><p>To collect, manage, and maintain this data — and to share it with community members, government regulators, and investors — they are investigating the development of a distributed platform, built on Holochain. Building on Holochain in this case ensures that control of the data isn’t managed solely by the organization claiming to be protecting the ecosystem, but is rather distributed between all stakeholders. With data provenance baked in, it is also easy to track exactly what agent adds any particular piece of data. This combination of verification and distributed storage of overlapping datasets allows for a high degree of trust to be developed, and holds the organization itself accountable.</p><blockquote>...we start to see the potential for a new regenerative economics to be developed. Based not on extraction, but rather the regenerative value of all ecosystem activities.</blockquote> Going Long on the Climate <p>In his book The Ministry for the Future, Kim Stanley Robinson introduces the idea of going long on the climate — basically, investing in our futures. As popular opinion shifts to focus on the climate crisis, we can expect the economic value of climate mitigation strategies to rise. One of the biggest issues to date in the space is a lack of reliable investment opportunities. With the capacities for data provenance that Holochain provides, investors can have more transparent access to the assets they are investing in.</p><p>There isn’t a one size fits all approach here. In comparison to the global replication of industry, climate mitigation is about <a href="https://hackernoon.com/economies-of-specificity?ref=blog.holochain.org">economies of specificity</a>, because ecosystems are specific to their place and relationships.</p><p>Holochain is designed so individual applications can be customized to their particular context, while still being compatible with each other. This gives the flexibility needed for hyper-specific economies to interact with the global market in accountable ways. Add to this <a href="https://hrea.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">innovative accounting methods</a> being developed on the framework and we start to see the potential for a new regenerative economics to be developed. Based not on extraction, but rather the regenerative value of all ecosystem activities.&nbsp;</p> Early Entry into a New Economy <p>The projects outlined above are only first steps towards solving your original problem. You want a way to invest in a future for yourself and your children. A future not only rich in a financial sense, but also an experiential one. Quality of life hinges on the environment and the wellbeing of our society.&nbsp;</p><p>There won’t be any single bulletproof investing strategy, but it’s going to take a multiplicity of tactics to address climate change. Looking at these pilots, we feel that the best way to diversify and to be an early investor in the regenerative economy is to go out and build it. We are looking for more projects innovating in this space. It’s going to take new business structures, financial tools, and community initiatives to shift the landscape and to build a thriving economy. But let’s thrive together, building on real tangible things, building on relationships with the nature we cherish.</p>

 6th Anniversary Celebrations <p>Ontology Network, launched in June 2018, has evolved from a blockchain platform focused on digital identity and data solutions to a comprehensive Web3 infrastructure. Over the past six years, Ontology has achieved significant milestones, including the launch of its MainNet, integration of layer-2 technology, and the introduction of an Ethereum Virtual Machine, while expanding its ecosystem through strategic partnerships and community growth. Let’s take a journey through some of the key highlights of Ontology’s evolution.</p> MainNet and TestNet&nbsp;Launches <p>The Ontology MainNet has undergone several significant changes and upgrades since its inception:</p><p>· 2018: Ontology MainNet version 1.0 officially launched, marking the beginning of Ontology’s independent blockchain. This launch included the implementation of a unique dual-token system consisting of <a href="https://ont.io/tokens/">ONT and ONG</a>, as well as tools to support developers in building dApps and smart contracts.</p><p>· 2019: Ontology introduced sharding technology and launched its cross-chain TestNet, enhancing the network’s scalability and interoperability.</p><p>· 2020: Ontology MainNet 2.0 was released, integrating layer-2 technology to improve transaction speed and efficiency.</p><p>· 2021: The Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) test network was launched. This significant update allowed Ontology to support four types of smart contracts — Native, NeoVM, WasmVM, and EVM — making it one of the most versatile public-chain platforms in terms of development languages and virtual machines supported.</p><p>· 2022: The project’s commitment to expansion is further evidenced by its $10 million EVM fund, aimed at supporting global developers and fostering growth within the Ontology ecosystem.</p><p>· 2023: Ontology introduced liquid staking, represented by the stONT token. This significant update allows ONT token holders to maintain liquidity while participating in network consensus. The stONT token accumulates rewards by growing in value relative to ONG, providing users with more flexibility in managing their staked&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The consistent updates demonstrate Ontology’s commitment to regular and substantial improvements to its network infrastructure. These launches have progressively enhanced Ontology’s capabilities, from basic blockchain functionality to advanced features like sharding, cross-chain compatibility, and EVM integration.</p><p>In terms of <a href="https://node.ont.io/">staking</a>, Ontology implements a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The network has gained popularity among node operators of various sizes and maintains an active staking community. Stakers can earn ONG as rewards for participating in network consensus and governance.</p> Slash Mechanism for Consensus Nodes <p>To further enhance the security and stability of the blockchain, Ontology is introducing a Slash mechanism for Consensus Nodes. This new feature ensures that the network operates in a safer and more stable manner by penalizing nodes that act maliciously or fail to perform their duties properly. This addition strengthens Ontology’s commitment to maintaining a robust and reliable blockchain infrastructure.</p> TestNet Faucet: Empowering Developers <p>As part of our continuous effort to support developers, <a href="http://bwarelabs.com">Bwarelabs</a> now provides faucets for ONT and ONG test tokens on Ontology and Ontology EVM. This initiative aims to lower the barriers for developers, making it easier to test and deploy their applications on the Ontology MainNet. By offering easy access to test tokens, we hope to foster innovation and growth within our developer community.</p> Developer Relations: Breaking&nbsp;Barriers <p>In collaboration with <a href="http://stackup.dev">StackUp</a>, Ontology is launched a campaign focused on removing barriers for the developer community. This initiative aims to provide comprehensive support and resources, ensuring that developers have everything they need to succeed in building on the Ontology MainNet. Together, we are committed to creating an inclusive and supportive environment that empowers developers to innovate and&nbsp;thrive.</p> Sneak Preview of Our Giveaway Campaigns <p>To celebrate our 6th anniversary, we’re excited to announce some amazing giveaway campaigns!</p><p>Stake2Earn — Giveaway to Ontology Stakers: Win a share of 3000 ONG!

             June 2024   
	 
		 
			 Tokenized Securities Unaffected by MiCA, Utility Tokens and Stablecoins Face Stricter Rules 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>As the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is set to partially become applicable&nbsp;on 30th June 2024, it is crucial to understand its implications for various types of crypto-assets. While tokenized securities remain largely unaffected by MiCA, utility tokens and stablecoins will face significantly stricter regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>MiCA introduces comprehensive measures to regulate the crypto-asset market, providing much-needed clarity. However, it’s important to note that&nbsp;MiCA does not apply to crypto-assets qualifying as financial instruments, such as transferable securities. These assets continue to fall under the existing regulatory framework of MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II). This provides clear guidance to securities’ issuers.</p>
<p>In contrast,&nbsp;MiCA imposes significant new requirements on utility tokens and stablecoins, fundamentally changing how these assets can be issued and managed. Most cash equivalent tokens currently use the ERC-20 token standard, which lacks owner identification capabilities. Under MiCA, issuers might need to consider a transition to the&nbsp;ERC-3643 token standard to issue permissioned tokens, enabling the necessary compliance features such as owner identification and additional controls.</p>
<p>In addition, providers of services linked to crypto-assets may have to obtain a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP) license. Obtaining such a license would involve considerable financial and time investments. To some extent,&nbsp;the complexity and costly legal processes could make issuing security tokens easier than issuing utility tokens and stablecoins under MiCA.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the stricter but clear regulations present opportunities for&nbsp;large institutions such as banks to tokenize cash, providing institutionally acceptable money onchain, which is missing today.&nbsp;They are likely to issue permissioned cash coins to enforce compliance, as we discussed in the previous newsletter “<a href="https://csqny04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VVxqrs54ScBmW8y7vlW2Nh3VjW7HlLKX5gQClQN9k7Mbb3qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3myW5tBQN98Z5hL_VhrCLX5BrzP3VzWR3s4w4yykW8lwFvr3TgQkhW4w8Xcq6_7dmhW1flrsg32LtRxW3_rYy35KL1yFW2Hs1y_35jRCRW90NyVs7-hzRXW7zzmpD7m6p8MW12BNJj5xyVGSW5rTFpr8R5-XzW7_ZcFq14xcwWN2FDpsKBTtg2N8pW667XsjsrW7DyR5k70HmJNW6hWYXF7PZvkdW48p9sb1_TL2RW5hWWWc2C12yvVxSbX18R5m-3W5ZPQfZ3FrL7LW6Ghxv28HlT0qW31FG2R4CT-gYW6l7yyM5ZSbySW3nMCZz46lhq5W1gkJLg1Khrnvf1pw0C804">Institutional RWA Tokenization Needs Permissioned Cash Coins</a>”.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, we are well-positioned to leverage these opportunities. Our technology enables both payment coins and securities issuers to&nbsp;identify token holders, track ownership, and enforce automated compliance onchain, which is increasingly crucial as regulations tighten.</p>
<p>This is a historic moment for Europe to position itself as the hub of institutional tokenization, we are excited for what’s coming!</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule in Gibraltar applies to all cryptocurrency transactions above EUR&nbsp;1,000.  VASPs must register with the GFSC, verify identities, and perform enhanced due diligence for high-risk transactions.  VASPs must collect additional information for transactions involving unhosted wallets to ensure thorough verification and monitoring.  <p>In Gibraltar, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a>, also informally called the Crypto Travel Rule, came into effect with the implementation of the<a href="https://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/legislations/proceeds-of-crime-act-2015-transfer-of-virtual-assets-regulations-2021-6003"> Proceeds of Crime Act 2015 (Transfer of Virtual Assets) Regulations 2021 (POCA)</a> on March 22, 2021. However, virtual asset service providers (VASPs) were given an 18-month grace period, making full compliance mandatory only by September 22,&nbsp;2022.</p> Key Features of the FATF Travel Rule in Gibraltar <p>The FATF Travel Rule in Gibraltar requires VASPs to share detailed transaction-related personal information for all virtual asset transfers above EUR 1,000. This information includes the full names, wallet addresses, and other identifying information of both the originator and the beneficiary.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>VASPs in Gibraltar must comply with several key requirements.</p>  Registration and Licensing: VASPs must obtain a DLT Provider License from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC). The <a href="https://www.fsc.gi/">GFSC provides a structured process</a> for applying for authorization, which includes pre-application engagement and an initial application assessment.  Verification of Identities: VASPs must verify the identities of their counterparties, especially when dealing with high-risk jurisdictions. The aim behind this measure is to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations.  Enhanced Due Diligence: For transactions involving unhosted wallets, VASPs are required to collect additional information such as the originator’s name, physical address, national identity number, customer identification number, or date and place of birth. Through enhanced due diligence, GFSC seeks to mitigate the risks associated with unhosted wallets and ensure thorough verification and monitoring.  <p>For Originators, it includes:</p>  Full name  Wallet address  One of the following: physical address, national identity number, customer identification number, or date and place of&nbsp;birth  <p>For Beneficiaries:</p>  Name  Wallet address  <p>If the required Travel Rule data is missing, incomplete, or delayed, the beneficiary VASP must implement risk-based procedures to address these gaps, potentially suspending or rejecting the transfer until compliance is achieved.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>VASPs in Gibraltar, including cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers, must adhere to the FATF Travel Rule under the supervision of the GFSC. This regulation is crucial for preventing money laundering and terrorism financing.</p><p>VASPs must monitor crypto transfers. All transactions, especially those involving unhosted wallets, require monitoring and additional information gathering during high-risk transactions. They must also develop risk-based policies for managing transfers involving unhosted wallets and ensure thorough verification and monitoring.</p><p>Failure to adhere to the FATF Travel Rule requirements in Gibraltar can lead to significant penalties. For a summary conviction, the penalties may include imprisonment for up to one year, a fine up to level 5 on the standard scale, or both. In the case of conviction on indictment, the penalties can be more severe, with imprisonment for up to two years, a fine, or&nbsp;both.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>Gibraltar enforces a EUR 1,000 threshold for the Travel Rule, aligning with FATF recommendations. Comparatively, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-switzerland">Switzerland’s Crypto Travel Rule threshold</a> is 1,000 CHF, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-kingdom">whereas in the United Kingdom</a>, it is 1,000 GBP, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">in Japan</a>, the threshold is&nbsp;$3,000.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Since implementing the FATF Travel Rule in March 2021, Gibraltar requires detailed verification for cryptocurrency transactions over EUR 1,000. This regulation aims to safeguard financial transactions and prevent illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing.</p> FAQs  1. What is the minimum threshold for the Travel Rule in Gibraltar? <p>The Travel Rule applies to all cryptocurrency transactions above EUR&nbsp;1,000.</p> 2. What information must VASPs collect and verify under the Travel Rule in Gibraltar? <p>VASPs must collect and verify full names, wallet addresses, and additional identifying information such as a physical address, national identity number, customer identification number, or date and place of birth for both originators and beneficiaries in Gibraltar.</p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Urban <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> has undergone considerable expansion thanks to the digitalization of its services, made more accessible through a simple application. A societal topic thanks to its public service quality, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marteau-urban-mobility-and-carsharing/">urban mobility</a> contributes not only to the inclusiveness of certain populations, but also to the <a href="https://cor.europa.eu/en/engage/studies/Documents/The%20New%20Urban%20Mobility%20Initiative%20Can%20it%20deliver%20inclusive%20local%20mobility%20needs%20and%20European%20decarbonisation%20goals%20at%20the%20same%20time.pdf">reduction of carbon-based transport</a>. Urban mobility plays a key role in our strategy to combat global warming, by encouraging the use of public transport through the connection of different transport offers, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility</a> and car-sharing.</p>



<p>To encourage the use of public transport, various pricing initiatives have been put in place. For example, reduced-price season tickets have been introduced for certain categories of the population, such as students. These age-based fares are offered by many transport networks in Germany as well as in France, such as <a href="https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en">Île de France Mobilités</a> or <a href="https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-france/mainline-cards-and-fares/avantage-card/avantage-jeune/">SNCF</a>, with offers reserved for those under 26 or senior citizens.</p>



<p>While such measures encourage the adoption of these services, they also open the door to fraudulent practices, with harmful consequences. It therefore seems necessary to provide solutions in terms of age verification of users, to guarantee a fair and efficient service and avoid attempts at fraud and identity theft.</p>



 The importance of discounted fares in urban mobility. 



<p>Discounted tickets exist on many types of platforms and services. From telecom operators to streaming or cultural services, there is a plethora of places offering this type of service. In the field of transport, it is a social policy tool, where the existence of specific offers according to age and income categories promotes access to transport for different categories of the population.</p>



<blockquote><p>The introduction of reduced fares for young people is justified by a number of social and equity considerations: young people are often dependent on public transport (lack of driver’s license and/or vehicle).</p>Île de France Mobilités</blockquote>



<p>These special fares are also used by transport companies as a means of building customer loyalty. However, in a tense economic climate, it is sometimes tempting for users who are not entitled to special fares to abuse the loopholes in a subscription system in order to benefit from them. As a result, mobility providers are increasingly detecting fraud in this area. This may involve the use of false identity documents to take advantage of discounts, or the theft of another person’s identity.</p>



<p>The impact of such fraud is twofold: not only does it adversely affect the revenues of transport operators, it also limits the scope of these offers and the fairness between users. However, it is possible to curb this damaging occurence with online identity verification solutions, which are transparent and easy for the user.</p>



 Combating fraud through identity verification. 



<p>Traditionally, age verification on public transport has been carried out by means of identity documents presented when purchasing season tickets. The possibility of subscribing to these services online has made it easier to commit fraud and obtain discounted fares. It is now easy for anyone to forge an identity document, thanks to editing software that has become readily available.</p>



<p>At the same time, anti-fraud and identity verification technologies have also become more sophisticated, providing even more secure and appropriate responses.</p>



<p>For a transport operator, using these solutions means effectively guarding against identity fraud during the subscription process. They also ensure that users benefiting from an offer are indeed who they say they are.</p>



<p>IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> is a solution that has been used for many years in banking and financial services, but is now proving its worth in the mobility and transport sector. By verifying a user’s identity document and photo, IDnow ensures that users are thoroughly screened and their age confirmed in just a few steps:</p>



  The user submits an identity document when subscribing to the offer;  A biometric capture (facial recognition or live detection) is then performed to obtain a correlation with the user making the subscription;  The document is then analyzed by our APIs to verify its authenticity, and cross-referenced with the biometric capture for comparison. This ensures that it is the same person;  The account is validated in a matter of seconds, based on the results.  



<p>Transparent to the user, the identity verification solution is easily integrated into a mobile or web application via our SDK.</p>



<p>Using this solution limits the risk of identity theft, as the user cannot use someone else’s document to subscribe to an offer. Any alteration is identified and forces the user to terminate the subscription process.</p>



 Safer access to offers for both operators and users. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">constantly evolving</a> mobility sector has undergone digital transformations that have revolutionized our habits. At the same time, fraudsters have adapted to these new operating modes, impacting the economic efficiency of various players. Age and identity verification provides transport operators with the guarantee that their users have access to the offers they are entitled to. </p>



<p>Identity verification solutions can be seamlessly integrated into the user journey, simplifying the user experience. In addition to contributing to the fight against fraud, identity verification solutions help improve operators’ economic efficiency. As a result, they are able to enhance their transport offering, as well as the quality of their services. In the end, all users benefit from these measures.</p>

 Shifting through the noise in the age of information overload — the power of evidence synthesis <p>It is hard for organizations that address complex social, economic, and environmental challenges to determine what strategies may have the greatest impact. This should be easier with more organizations publishing what they learn and AI tools supporting efficient curation of insights. In reality, the vast amount of data generated is met with overwhelm, and impact-focused organizations struggle to determine what data can be meaningfully used to support their strategic ambitions and what is just&nbsp;noise.</p><p>Over the past ten years of working with foundations, government agencies, and private sector organizations, <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou Digital</a> has found that impact evidence synthesis is one of the more powerful tools to support strategic decisions. Evidence synthesis is the process of compiling and analyzing multiple studies to provide comprehensive impact insights on a set of interventions or products.</p><p>In this article, we share our experience of the value that evidence synthesis has catalyzed, the need to improve prevailing impact evidence synthesis norms, and how we have refined our evidence synthesis processes and products to drive impactful decisions.</p> The power of leveraging collective insights <p>Organizations that address complex social, economic, and environmental challenges are not doing it alone. Scattered across the internet and within these organizations’ own knowledge management systems, there is an abundance of insights that could be harnessed to explore the pertinent questions of what works, under what conditions, and for whom. Impact evidence synthesis brings these insights together.</p><p>Individual research efforts provide puzzle pieces that evidence synthesis assembles to create the impact picture. It adds immense value&nbsp;by:</p>  Generating a holistic view: Combining varied perspectives provides a comprehensive view of an issue, allowing for inclusive assessments of what works and what is untested.  Optimizing resources: Identifying promising interventions and avoiding duplicating those with limited impact are valuable tactics in light of finite resources.  Enabling adaptive strategies: Creating an information infrastructure supports agile strategic responses to the changing social and economic landscape.  <p>By basing actions and investment decisions on a curated body of evidence, organizations can establish a clear and justified basis while also building an evidence ecosystem and infrastructure that encourages a collective approach to engaging in shared&nbsp;issues.</p> Challenges within the prevailing forms of impact evidence synthesis <p>There are two phases to unlocking the value of evidence synthesis. The first is intentionality on what is included in a given synthesis, and the second is ensuring the outputs are delivered in ways that support access and — fundamentally — the use of evidence. While there are diverse views on these phases, there are dominant practices. These dominant practices serve some sectors well; in others, they present challenges that can limit their value. Two of the main challenges are:</p>  A bias toward experimental methods: In some sectors, an exclusive focus on one methodology can be challenging for numerous reasons, including issues of power, diversity, and representation, and discounting early insights in emerging and rapidly changing sectors — like digital — where experimental evidence may not be available when investment decisions are being&nbsp;made.  Static representation: Evidence synthesis products often exist as static narratives that summarize the state of evidence. The last decade has seen an increase in evidence maps: graphic representations of the landscape of impact evidence plotted against a set of interventions and outcomes. Maps vary but are usually one-off and focus on visualizing the number of studies rather than the insights gained from them. Unless they are accompanied by narrative summaries, evidence maps leave impact insights on the table. Like all knowledge products, content and medium directly affect engagement and use by different audiences.  <p>At Caribou Digital, we have struggled with these prevailing norms and forms, which sparked our work to innovate and improve the practice of evidence synthesis.</p> How we’ve refined our approach to connect insights to decisions <p>Our approach seeks to provide timely insights with rigor, context, and diversity of perspectives. Five elements distinguish our evidence synthesis approach:</p>  Iterative Theory of Change: Designed with thematic experts, the Theory of Change outlines impact pathways for specific issues as the basis of the synthesis.  Diverse and credible impact methodologies: Experimental and theoretical approaches each offer important views on the evidence. We need both and include&nbsp;both.  Impact results: We include a view of the volume of data points that initiated positive, negative, or no impact, not just the number of studies on a given&nbsp;topic.  Design and delivery mechanisms of interventions: Interventions or products (e.g., upskilling, e-commerce platforms) are not homogeneous. They have unique design and delivery features that can and do affect their impact. We include these features in our analysis to really drill down into what&nbsp;works.  Contextual insights: Who is being studied and where influences impact. We extract contextual data, leveraging localized evidence to support targeted interventions that are more likely to&nbsp;succeed.  <p>Including and extracting this level of detail from individual studies supports a rapid and deeper interrogation of the impact data — many of these elements are visualized in our existing evidence maps on <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/publication/digital-finance-evidence-map/">digital financial services</a> and <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">digital and data-first approaches to driving small business&nbsp;growth</a>.</p> Transforming the way users interact with evidence synthesis <p>At Caribou Digital, we are proponents of interactive and ongoing evidence synthesis. Our experience delivering interactive evidence synthesis has revealed a strong demand for customized and detailed insights on demand. This entails extracting and synthesizing impact evidence from the database on specific questions, such as “<a href="https://strivecommunity.org/insights/library">What is the impact of market-place platforms on small business growth?</a>” This recurring need has led us to further innovate with evidence outputs to support greater access to insights using generative AI. Below are three ways we share our evidence synthesis outputs:</p>  An interactive impact database holds the raw coded data. Guided by a code book, we can filter, search, and access extracted summary insights and data points from the impact database. This has been a successful format for (manually) mining the database on-demand to craft impact narratives on interventions/products in specific countries on specific segments. All our evidence syntheses have an underlying impact database, resulting in a significant body of evidence on <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/publication/digital-finance-evidence-map/">digital financial services,</a> <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">digital approaches to driving small business growth</a>, digital tools to support women’s economic empowerment, and geospatial data for humanitarian action (forthcoming).  Interactive evidence maps provide a visual overview of the entire impact evidence landscape, plotting interventions to outcomes and the direction of impact. The maps are integral for communicating a snapshot of the impact landscape and quickly discerning where evidence is concentrated. Filter buttons enable users to get more specific on other variables of interest (i.e., methodology, design and delivery mechanisms, country, segment, etc.) Alongside these interactive syntheses, Caribou Digital has crafted dozens of targeted insights for client strategy and the public (e.g., <a href="https://www.financedigitalafrica.org/tag/evidence-gap-map/">DFS</a> and <a href="https://strivecommunity.org/insights/library">small business</a>).  <p>3. A chatbot-based conversational interface queries the impact evidence database using natural language queries. This utilizes language-learning models to interpret queries and return synthesized results from the evidence base, with cited references, allowing users to, for example, type a query “Outline e-commerce products that have positively impacted women’s income in India.” This interface opens up new possibilities to engage with impact evidence, particularly when convenience and speed are prioritized and when supporting greater access to insights for those traditionally marginalized from more complex knowledge products.</p> What’s next <p>This is an exciting time to be working in evidence synthesis. With innovative new tools and processes to work with, there are more possibilities than ever to advance the efficiency, accuracy, diversity, and inclusivity of evidence synthesis. In the coming months, we will share more about our iterations with Gen AI and our approaches to deepening inclusivity and equity within the evidence synthesis process and products. We are keen to connect with users and practitioners alike to refine and perfect these approaches.</p><p>Contact <a href="mailto:niamh@cariboudigital.net">niamh@cariboudigital.net</a> with any feedback or questions about our evidence synthesis approach.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/shifting-through-the-noise-in-the-age-of-information-overload-the-power-of-evidence-synthesis-6157e5bc472a">Shifting through the noise in the age of information overload — the power of evidence synthesis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Munich-based identity pioneer looks back on ten years of revolutionizing the KYC space and doubles down on reusable identities and trust services 



<p>Munich, June 27, 2024 – IDnow, a leading platform provider for identity verification in Europe, is looking back on ten successful years of revolutionizing the German and European Know-Your-Customer (KYC) market and is now doubling down on reusable identities and trust services. Founded in 2014 by Armin Bauer, Sebastian Bärhold, Felix Haas and Dennis von Ferenczy, the Munich-based company’s flagship product at the time was <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">the revolutionary VideoIdent</a>, which had just been allowed by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">BaFin</a>).</p>



 A platform with automated and expert-led solutions that serves all needs 



<p>Since then, a variety of solutions have been added to the portfolio, following market needs and technological trends: the AI-supported, fully automated AutoIdent solution was introduced in 2018, followed by the electronic function of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">German ID card (eID)</a> in 2019. Just last year, IDnow introduced ShopIdent, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">onsite solution for identification</a> in German petrol stations and stores. The transaction figures prove the success of these solutions: Over 13.2 million transactions have been processed via IDnow AutoIdent, while the scale-up looks back on another 13 million successfully identified users with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent</a> to date.</p>



<p>In 2019, Andreas Bodczek was appointed as CEO at IDnow: “We have made it our mission over the past five years to actively shape and lead our industry and show our customers why digital identities are essential to their business. In the last decade, we have grown into a platform provider that serves all market needs with the help of the latest technology. We have earned the trust of our customers because we focus on our core business every day without losing sight of the secular trends that are shaping the market.”</p>



 Munich-based scale-up has long been one of the largest European players 



<p>In 2021, increased expansion opportunities led IDnow to acquire the French market leader for identity verification technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German provider identity Trust Management AG, establishing IDnow as one of the largest European players in the identity industry.</p>



<p>In addition to its traditional financial and telecommunications applications, new growth areas for IDnow have opened up in the mobility and travel industry, online dating, gaming, human resources and social media. Although user needs and regulatory requirements differ greatly from traditional industries, the desire for increased trust in digital transactions has grown across territories, regardless of the use case.</p>



 Reusable identities and trust services determine the future 



<p>The digital identity industry is facing a paradigm shift due to regulations, such as eIDAS 2.0 at the European level or announced changes to the Videoident regulation in Germany. With its more than 900 trusted customers, the company aims to leverage these relationships and take them to the next level by building up its own trust service and a digital identity pool of several million users in the next few years. In doing so, the scale-up intends to lead the way in the transformation of the digital identity market heralded by eIDAS 2.0: European trust services, reusable identities and a fully integrated, broad product portfolio form the basis of the company’s long-term product strategy.</p>



<p>“Today, we are facing a fundamental transformation of our industry – away from the one-time verification process and towards reusable identities – and we will once again lead this revolution,” Bodczek says. “Since its founding, IDnow, with its broad and continually evolving portfolio, has shown a great deal of foresight, resiliency, and adaptability to market developments. With a team of over 450 highly skilled colleagues across ten offices in Europe, we are already one of the largest players in the identity industry. The experience, expertise, and innovation drive that we have assembled in-house make us extremely optimistic about the next ten years of our company and the industry at large,” he concludes.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that the <a href="https://setup.cloud.microsoft/entra/migrate-ad-fs-to-microsoft-entra-id">migration tool</a> for Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) customers to move their apps to Microsoft Entra ID is now generally available! Customers can begin updating their identity management with more extensive monitoring and security infrastructure by quickly identifying which applications are capable of being migrated and assessing all their AD FS applications for compatibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/introducing-ad-fs-application-migration-your-path-to-simplicity/ba-p/3980232">announced AD FS Application Migration</a> would be moving to public preview, and the response from our partners and customers has been overwhelmingly positive. For some, transitioning to cloud-based security is a daunting task, but the tool has proven to dramatically streamline the process of moving to Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simplified workflow, reduced need for manual intervention, and minimized downtime (for applications and end users) have reduced stress for hassle-free migrations. The tool not only checks the compatibility of your applications with Entra ID, but it can also suggest how to resolve any issues. It then monitors the migration progress and reflects the latest changes in your applications. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJYmEOK6UJo">Watch the demo</a> to see the tool in action.</p>
<p>Moving from AD FS to a more agile and responsive, cloud-native solution helps overcome some of the inherent limitations of the old way of managing identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to more robust security, organizations count greater visibility and control with a centralized, intuitive admin center and reduced server costs as transformative benefits of moving to a modern identity management. Moreover, Entra ID features can help organizations achieve better security and compliance with multifactor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies—both of which provide a critical foundation for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More Entra ID features include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless</a> and MFA for better user experience. 
 A rich set of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-integrated-apps">apps, APIs, SDKs, and connectors</a> for customization and extensibility. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-conditional-access">Granular adaptive access controls</a> to define and monitor conditional access. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-user-self-service-portals">Self-service portals</a> that allow employees to securely manage their own identity.

<p>In the dynamic landscape of Web3, ensuring trust and authenticity is paramount. Proof of Humanity (PoH) emerges as a pivotal solution, combining social verification, video submission, and decentralized dispute resolution to create a Sybil-proof registry of real humans on the blockchain. This revolutionary system addresses key challenges by verifying that each registered entity is a unique individual, thus fostering a more secure and trustworthy digital environment.</p> Key Features of Proof of&nbsp;Humanity   Sybil-Proof Registry: Guarantees each registered user is a real, unique human, preventing fraudulent multiple accounts.  Social Vouching: Existing verified humans vouch for new registrants, adding a layer of community-based verification.  Challenge Mechanisms: Users can challenge suspicious submissions, which are resolved through a decentralized process.  Reverse Turing Tests: Distinguishes humans from bots using advanced behavioral analysis.  Decentralized Dispute Resolution: Utilizes systems like Kleros for unbiased resolution of disputes.   Importance in&nbsp;Web3 <p>With the rise of AI and bots, distinguishing between human and machine interactions in Web3 is increasingly difficult. PoH mitigates these challenges by preventing Sybil attacks, ensuring fair resource distribution, and enhancing transparency in digital interactions. This system empowers users to interact only with verified accounts, akin to content moderation on social media, fostering authentic relationships in the digital&nbsp;realm.</p> Challenges and Considerations <p>Despite its advantages, PoH faces several challenges:</p>  Privacy: Balancing verification with user privacy is crucial, as PoH systems may require sensitive personal&nbsp;data.  Scalability: Ensuring PoH can handle large-scale adoption efficiently.  Inclusivity: Overcoming barriers such as access to technology and digital literacy to ensure widespread participation.  Evolving AI: Continual adaptation to differentiate increasingly sophisticated AI from&nbsp;humans.   Applications and Use&nbsp;Cases <p>PoH’s applications span various sectors. In decentralized finance (DeFi), it enhances trust in transactions and lending protocols. For governance, it ensures fair voting in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) by preventing Sybil attacks. In social media, PoH verifies user identities, enabling portable reputations across platforms. Additionally, it supports fair distribution of resources in schemes like Universal Basic Income (UBI), ensuring each verified individual receives their due&nbsp;share.</p><p>Proof of Humanity stands at the forefront of human-centric blockchain innovations, safeguarding trust and authenticity in the evolving Web3 ecosystem.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/building-trust-and-reputation-in-web3-with-proof-of-humanity-b20497c81360">Building Trust and Reputation in Web3 with Proof of Humanity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Be aware of potential scams during this transition period. Malicious actors may attempt impersonation, spoofing, and social engineering tactics.</blockquote><p>Trust only official sources of information as outlined&nbsp;here:</p>  Official ASI website: <a href="https://www.superintelligence.io/">https://www.superintelligence.io/</a>  Official Fetch.ai website: <a href="https://fetch.ai/">https://fetch.ai/</a>  Official Ocean Protocol website: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">https://oceanprotocol.com/</a>  Official SingularityNET website: <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">https://singularitynet.io/</a>   The Dawn of a Unified AI Ecosystem — Phase&nbsp;I <p>The highly anticipated token merger between Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET is on the horizon. This unique and ambitious undertaking aims to create a powerful and unified Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) ecosystem under the new ASI ticker. This unified network aspires to become the leading force in decentralized AI (decentralized Artificial Intelligence).</p> Key Dates and Action&nbsp;Items <p>As a web3 token holder of FET, AGIX, or OCEAN, understanding the key aspects of this token merger is crucial. Here’s a breakdown of important dates and&nbsp;actions:</p><p>July 1,&nbsp;2024:</p>  Migration Opens: Conversion contracts allowing AGIX and OCEAN holders to convert their tokens to FET will be available.  Deposits and Withdrawals: AGIX, and OCEAN deposits and withdrawals will be halted on exchanges in preparation for the migration process.  AGIX and OCEAN: tokens will be delisted from exchanges.  Branding Changes: Project branding will transition to Artificial Superintelligence Alliance across third-party platforms.   Your Token Migration Journey <p>The token merger will impact your existing tokens. Here’s what you need to&nbsp;know:</p><p>*Exchange-Held Tokens: These tokens will be automatically converted to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Conversion Rates</p><p>The conversion rates are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  AGIX tokens will migrate to $FET at a conversion rate of 1 AGIX to 0.433350&nbsp;$FET.  OCEAN tokens will migrate to $FET at a conversion rate of 1 OCEAN to 0.433226&nbsp;$FET.  <p>*We have received inquiries from numerous exchanges expressing their support for the upcoming token merger. While we appreciate this overwhelming interest, it’s important to mention that we cannot guarantee participation from absolutely every exchange. Our team is diligently working to facilitate widespread support, prioritizing a seamless transition for all token&nbsp;holders.</p><p>Please note there is no immediate urgency to convert your assets during this initial phase. Our current focus lies in the strategic onboarding of supporting platforms, ensuring robust infrastructure is in place before proceeding further.</p> Supported Wallets and Conversion Processes <p>The new ASI token merger will be compatible with all major software wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) and hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) familiar to the respective communities. For manual conversion (on-chain, self-custody):</p><p>During Phase I, the assets will be consolidated across the Ethereum Network with future plans to significantly increase interoperability with other ecosystems such as BNB Chain and Cardano active in Phase&nbsp;2.</p>  Connect your existing wallet to the official conversion portal hosted on the SingularityDAO dApp.  Follow the on-screen instructions to convert your tokens. Example images have been attached to illustrate the process. The first picture depicts the contract approval process. The second picture just below demonstrates the migration confirmation. The final step would be to confirm the transaction through the wallet. Holders working with AGIX, OCEAN or FET for the first time might have to add the token contract to the wallet to ensure balances are properly displayed. A guide on that can be found <a href="https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask/">here</a>. The SingularityDAO conversion portal makes this easy by incorporating an “Add to Wallet’’ feature as part of the migration interface.  <p>Verify the conversion using a block explorer like <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a>. If you’re holding FET for the first time on a wallet such as <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> you may need to add FET as a custom token to ensure that it’s properly displayed in the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Important Reminders:   The conversion window will remain open for years, so there’s no immediate pressure to&nbsp;convert.  Dedicated conversion smart contracts are the only official tools that community members will need to rely on. Expect standard transaction fees, but no additional conversion charges. At no point during the conversion process will you need to input private information including your seed&nbsp;phrase.  With respect to native FET holders, it’s important to note that staked tokens will be automatically migrated during Phase 2. Staking rewards will continue uninterrupted.  Liquidity providers will need to manually withdraw their funds and re-allocate them to updated pools for optimal efficiency. More details will be provided.   The Migration from FET to ASI and the network upgrade — Phase&nbsp;II <p>The final step of the merger involves the migration from the FET token ticker to ASI. During this step, new migration contracts will become available for any AGIX and OCEAN tokens yet to be migrated to FET. Migration contracts will also be deployed for EVM based FET. FET Mainnet Tokens will be automatically converted to ASI as the Fetch.ai mainnet completes its scheduled upgrade. Below you’ll find the specific migration ratios&nbsp;again.</p>  FET tokens will migrate to $ASI at a conversion rate of 1 FET to 1&nbsp;$ASI.  AGIX tokens will migrate to $ASI at a conversion rate of 1 AGIX to 0.433350&nbsp;$ASI.  OCEAN tokens will migrate to $ASI at a conversion rate of 1 OCEAN to 0.433226&nbsp;$ASI.  <p>A non-trivial component of this token migration is the network upgrade, which involves enhancements to the underlying blockchain infrastructure. This upgrade ensures improved performance, security, and scalability for the ASI network. The network engineers and validators will execute a series of precise steps to carry out this&nbsp;upgrade:</p><p>Code Deployment: Engineers will deploy the new codebase to all nodes in the network, incorporating the latest improvements and security&nbsp;patches.</p><p>Smart Contract Migration: Existing smart contracts will be migrated to the new network with necessary updates to ensure compatibility and functionality.</p><p>Node Synchronization: All network nodes will be synchronized to ensure they operate on the same updated protocol&nbsp;version.</p><p>Testing and Validation: Extensive testing will be conducted on a testnet before deploying changes to the mainnet to identify and resolve any&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Final Rollout: Once all components are thoroughly tested, the final rollout will occur, and the network will officially transition to the upgraded&nbsp;state.</p><p>As part of the process, all trading pairs on exchanges will be updated to reflect the new ASI token, and integrations with popular wallet and block explorer providers will be completed to ensure broad accessibility. Additionally, comprehensive resources will be delivered to all stakeholders, including token holders, to provide support and information throughout the transition.</p><p>During the network upgrade, there may be potential network downtime and temporary disruptions on exchanges as they update their markets.

 Verida Network Community Update — 26 June&nbsp;2024  Following a $5M raise and recent announcement to support personalized AI with confidential compute on the Verida Network, here’s what it means for the future of&nbsp;Verida. Verida Network Community Update: 26 June&nbsp;2024 Hello, gm everyone! <p>Chris Were here, the CEO and Co-founder at Verida&nbsp;👋</p><p>With our <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/301318/verida-raises-5-million-to-protect-user-data-amid-rise-in-generative-ai">$5M raise</a> and recent <a href="https://x.com/Verida_io/status/1803935148502872434">announcement</a> to support personalized AI with confidential compute on the Verida Network, I wanted to provide a community update to share with you all what it means for the future of&nbsp;Verida.</p> Confidential Computation to Fuel Personalized AI <p>Some of you may have seen our important announcement about Verida and how we’re going to <a href="https://news.verida.io/extending-the-verida-network-for-personalized-ai-with-confidential-compute-9b1bf93ff2fb">extend the Verida network to support confidential computation</a>. This is a significant step to unlock decentralized infrastructure for personalized AI. I want to explain what this means and how it fits into the broader story of AI and the critical infrastructure and technology we’ve been building.</p><p>You can <a href="https://youtu.be/OuFEbFs1jsc">watch my community update on YouTube</a>, where I share my ideas in a live scratchpad, or dive into this article for the&nbsp;details.</p> Honing in on Personalized AI <p>Until a few weeks ago, our focus at Verida was on decentralized infrastructure for private databases, particularly addressing data storage for personal data. We ensured that data was securely handled, encrypted by private keys, and met all necessary authentication, security, and regulatory requirements. Recently, we announced that we are extending the Verida network to support personalized AI with confidential compute.</p> Why Verida? Why are we well-placed to make this&nbsp;move? <p>Firstly, everyone has seen the rapid growth in AI and its evolving use cases. Verida has always focused on helping people own their data and benefit from it. The idea of having all your data and using it with AI is powerful, and I’ll elaborate on that&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>From Verida’s perspective, we’ve always been about protecting and adding value to your data. We’ve built infrastructure around database storage for user data, making it well-suited to extend to confidential computation leveraging that&nbsp;data.</p><p>For example, if you’re technical, you might build software to interact with a database. But with an API, you get computation attached to it, adding business logic and making it much more powerful and useful for developers and product builders.</p><p>This is what we’re doing — saying, “databases are great, but what if we could add business logic and confidential compute?” This extension will provide APIs for other builders, making it easy to build AI platforms using your personal&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“Data matters more than the AI or the compute” — Emad&nbsp;Mostaque</blockquote><p>To highlight the importance of this, Emad Mostaque from <a href="https://stability.ai/">Stability AI</a>, who recently founded Shelling AI, emphasized that “data matters more than the AI or the compute.” At the <a href="https://www.superai.com/">Super AI</a> conference in Singapore, he talked about the idea of <a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/ai-for-the-people-emad-mostaque-part-2">self-sovereign AI</a>.</p><p>Verida has discussed self-sovereign data, and now we’re advancing to self-sovereign AI, which needs self-sovereign identity and data as foundational pieces. Verida is well-placed to provide this infrastructure for a future of self-sovereign AI.</p> AI privacy issues are&nbsp;critical <p>For instance, Elon Musk highlighted concerns about <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800265431078551973">Apple devices potentially sharing personal information with OpenAI</a>. Imagine if all prompts and information you sent to an AI were exposed — this is a real risk, not a hypothetical one.</p><p>Data breaches, like the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ashley-madison-data-breach-netflix-documentary-b2545067.html">Ashley Madison hack in 2015</a>, show the potential consequences of sensitive information leaks. Verida’s work on database infrastructure supports end-to-end privacy for AI, and we can extend this to the compute&nbsp;side.</p><p>It’s important to note that we are not providing decentralized computation for training AI models. Instead, we focus on personalized AI, using personal data confidentially with&nbsp;AI.</p> So, what does personalized AI&nbsp;mean? <p>We have products with AI built into them, like facial recognition and autocomplete in Gmail. Another type of AI involves prompts, like ChatGPT, which provides contextual help by accessing your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Examples include answering questions about your purchase history or creating itineraries based on your emails and bookings. More complex prompts might involve estimating taxes by accessing your pay slips and other financial information. AI agents, which act on your behalf, represent another aspect of personalized AI. These agents, supercharged by direct access to your personal data, can perform tasks like searching for shoes or helping advance your career by suggesting networking opportunities, online courses, and relevant connections.</p><p>For personalized AI to work, it needs access to personal data and guaranteed end-to-end privacy.</p><p>This is where Verida excels. We’ve been building infrastructure for storage and a personal data bridge, allowing users to connect to web2 platforms and pull their data into Verida’s decentralized storage&nbsp;network.</p> Introducing the Verida&nbsp;Vault <p>The Verida Vault is the user interface that enables this, allowing you to connect, browse, and authorize access to your data. Here’s a preview of the Verida Vault, where you can connect to the personal data bridge and pull in data from various platforms. Once your data is in the Verida Vault, you can authorize access to different AI products and services that enhance their features with your&nbsp;data.</p>Sneak preview of the Verida&nbsp;Vault The journey from web2 to web3 data unlocks personal&nbsp;AI <p>Verida’s infrastructure includes the personal data bridge and Verida Vault, ensuring secure and private access to your data. By adding confidential compute, we enable AI products and services to interact with your data securely, enhancing its usefulness.</p>Enabling Personalized AI with Verida Vault and Personal Data&nbsp;Bridge Your data, your control, our commitment. <p>Verida is solving the problem of bringing your data from web2 to web3, enabling personalized AI use cases with guaranteed privacy. This infrastructure will play a critical role in the future of self-sovereign AI, leveraging confidential compute to provide secure, personalized AI experiences.</p><p><a href="https://linktr.ee/verida_io">Follow us</a> for more updates and join the conversation with me on <a href="https://x.com/tahpot/">X/Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswere\">LinkedIn</a> about the future of personalized AI.</p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>Chris Were — CEO &amp; Co-founder, Verida</p> About Verida <p>Verida is a pioneering <a href="https://www.verida.network/">decentralized data network</a> and <a href="https://www.verida.io/">self-custody wallet</a> that empowers users with control over their digital identity and data.

<p>This blog is third in a series explaining how Mydex’s personal data infrastructure works. It explains how our platforms help deliver our mission of empowering individuals with their own data, enabling them to use this data to manage their lives better and assert their human rights in a practical way on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>So far in this series we’ve talked about some absolute basics: <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-is-a-personal-data-store-a583f7ef9be3">how personal data stores work</a> and how they enable <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/personal-data-stores-and-data-sharing-1f59f5381c85">a new approach to data sharing</a>. But very often, to get something done, you don’t just need personal data. You also need data about the world out there — data about those aspects of the world which relate directly to your task at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Ideally, what you want to be able to do is to connect your personal data to this relevant info ‘about the world’ so that the two types of data get integrated together, providing everything you need either to make a better decision or to act well on this decision, efficiently and effectively.</p> Today — friction, effort, risk and cost all&nbsp;round <p>Today however, this connection and integration happens only rarely. Usually, the two types of data are kept completely apart, which involves you in all sorts of to-ing and fro-ing, looking for which bits of data are relevant and working out how to bring them together.</p><p>Here’s an everyday example. You need to send something in the post but you don’t know the postcode. So you have to stop what you are doing, search for the right website, enter it, and then once there, search again for the information you need. Then you need to copy the information, leave the web site, and go back to what you were doing. A time consuming, irritating interruption — a classic example of what we call FERC — which stands for Friction, Effort, Risk and&nbsp;Cost.</p><p>This is just a trivial example. It gets more complicated — and the FERC just grows and grows — with more detailed, sensitive information such as the medicines that a patient should be taking, where there are more things to think about such as when you should take what dose, what other medicines you can’t take with it, contra-indications and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>This isn’t personal information as such. It’s information about the drug — information that is very important to the person at this time in this context, because it relates and connects directly to what they need and are trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Most services are made up of these two different types of information: Information about the person themselves and information about some aspect of the world that relates to what the person needs and is trying to achieve. Both types of information are needed if a person is to receive a comprehensive, quality&nbsp;service.</p><p>For example, health and care service providers need to integrate detailed data about the particular individual being cared for (personal data) with data about what services they need, based on their specific health conditions and medications they are to take (data about ‘the world’). This extends to referrals to specific services the individual may want to use as part of getting the support they&nbsp;need.</p><p>Currently, such data is kept separate, making it difficult and time consuming for people (both people needing support and service providers providing the support) to bring it together in a way that speaks directly to that particular person’s situation at that particular time.</p><p>The UK’s NHS has developed painstakingly curated lists of the medications it enables doctors to use, and of health conditions they are likely to come across. These lists are freely available and accessible to everyone&nbsp;… if, that is, you know they exist (in separate websites) and have the time, will and energy to jump through all the hoops you need to access and use&nbsp;them.</p><p>To do this, you first have to find the URL for the website in question (a different search process just to get started); navigate your way through mountains of information that’s not relevant for you; then once you have found, it capture the information in some way (such as copy and paste); go back to what you were originally doing; and find some way to integrate it into what you were trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Very often, well-meaning service providers develop general information packs for people dealing with a particular health condition. Very often these information packs are truly informative and helpful&nbsp;… but to find what’s truly informative and helpful in relation to this particular individual with these particular circumstances the person then has to wade through them, looking for the few bits of information that are particularly relevant to them right&nbsp;now.</p><p>Many people feel overwhelmed and exhausted by such processes. Often they feel overloaded with information, get confused. Sometimes frightened.</p> A breakthrough in service provision <p>We have developed our Master Reference Data service (MRD) to get rid of all this hassle so that people can access exactly the right information that they need, at the right time, from within what they are doing, seamlessly. This means they don’t have to stop what they were trying to do to go searching for&nbsp;it.</p><p>Instead, the individual needing the information (the person themselves or a front line team member in a service provider) can instantly look up exactly the right relevant information, sourced from a reliable, curated source as an integrated part of what they are doing — from within whatever application they are using. Individuals can link it into their own records stored in their Personal Data Store and service providers can use it to build personalised information packs and resources for the people they&nbsp;serve.</p><p>Take the example of a service provider arranging an appointment with a person who needs support regarding a particular condition or situation. The appointment is being arranged seamlessly online (no need for letters or emails). It mentions some medications which need to be reviewed and plus some other services they might want to use. As soon as the medication is mentioned, a link to exactly the right place in the curated list is created, so that both sides can instantly see exactly the right information. Same for services and specifics relating to the health condition involved.</p><p>Or, looking at it the other way round, an individual can develop an ‘About Me’ profile that summarises all the key personal information about themselves and their condition, medications, support services etc. They can integrate this information seamlessly into their own records, with all the links stored in their personal data&nbsp;store.</p><p>They can then share this full profile with a new service provider as and when needed, so that the new service provider gets presented with all the key information they need straight away, without delay. This also means that the individual doesn’t keep on having to tell the same story to different people over and over&nbsp;again.</p><p>Result: a much better quality service and process with much lower FERC (Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost) for both the individual and the service provider.</p> Getting the details&nbsp;right <p>Of course, explaining it like this makes it sound simple (as it should be). But behind this simple experience lies a lot of technicalities. So, for example, a key part of the Master Reference Data Service is the detailed support services for developers covering such issues as <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/mrd-api/mrd-authentication.html">authentication</a> to access the service, how <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/mrd-api/cross-service-search.html">cross-service search works</a>, and <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/data-schema/developer-helpers.html">help support services</a>.</p><p>At a higher level, Figure One below sums up how we provide these services.</p>Figure One: Overview of how our Master Reference Data Services&nbsp;work<p>It starts with the curated data sources themselves (the coloured circles at the bottom of the diagram). We access the data from these curated data sources and crunch them so that a) people using different software languages or formats can easily access the data (interoperability) and b) so that the data they contain can be sliced and diced so that only those bits of data that are particularly relevant to a person at a particular time can be easily presented (configuration).</p><p>This means that if you are looking for information about a particular thing that may be referred to in a range of different curated databases, you can search for this information from within our service across all these different databases, all at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>For example, a patient with a particular condition could access information about the condition itself, information about medicines related to treating that condition, and about local services or community groups supporting people with that condition.</p><p>The top of the diagram then shows subscribers subscribing to any and all curated data sources that are relevant to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Currently these data sources include ALISS (A Local Information System for Scotland) and NHS curated content covering a wide range of&nbsp;areas.</p><p>ALISS is a service designed to help citizens find help and support close to them when they need it most. ALISS is maintained and published by the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland (the ALLIANCE) and is funded by the Scottish Government.</p><p>The NHS databases cover:</p>  Health Conditions information for the top 600 health conditions experienced by People. Symptoms, assessments, testing, treatment and implications.  Live Well, which covers advice about healthy living, including eating a balanced diet, healthy weight, exercise, quitting smoking and drinking less alcohol, sexual health and addiction support.  Mental Health support. This covers feelings, symptoms and behaviours, mental health conditions, advice for life situations and events, self-help, mental health services, mental health for children, teenagers and young adults, talking therapies, medicine and psychiatry, social care, mental health and your&nbsp;rights.  Medicines This covers content about common medicines. Includes how and when to take the medicine, possible side effects and answers to common questions.  Pregnancy&nbsp;, including modular advice and guidance about trying for a baby, pregnancy, labour and&nbsp;birth.  <p>Many of these curated lists of information also link with each other. MRD makes it easy to link and pull them together into a seamless payload that can be integrated into any application. This reduces the amount of duplication involved across organisations and their applications, improves the data quality and reduces the complexity of delivering interoperability and integration.</p><p>Subscribers accessing this curated content via our MRD API can be confident that the information they are accessing is accurate and up-to-date. This is because each one of them is refreshed once a week to include any changes that may have been made in the last seven&nbsp;days.</p><p>The list of data services covered by our MRD service is continually growing. For example, we are in the process of adding the World Health Organisation’s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine — Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) which is another standardised, multilingual vocabulary of clinical terminology that is used by physicians and other healthcare providers for the electronic exchange of health information.</p><p>We are seeking to enable standardised lists of the sorts of adaptations people may need in their homes if they are disabled, frail or at risk of falling, postcode look-ups, and (further into the future) comprehensive lists of operational GPs and dentists.</p><p>We also include (or will soon include) data services designed to help service providers improve the quality of the personal data they hold and share. These include personal data quality relating&nbsp;to:</p>  Race and Ethnicity, and Age Range classifications.  Activity and Measurement reference tables covering the full spectrum of datasets supporting wearables (for example relating to activity types, temperature, sleep and exercise)  Postcode and geolocation cross references  <p>The potential list is endless. In this blog we have only talked about health and care, but the concept applies to every aspect of life. The underlying goals and core processes remain the same: it’s all about bringing exactly the right information to people at the right time, as and when they need&nbsp;it.</p> Conclusion <p>Personal data lies at the heart of every service that deals with an identified individual: we need to be able to access and use it to manage our lives better. But very often, for the service to really fulfil its function it needs to relate information about some important things of ‘the world out there’ to the specific needs and context of the individual, as identified by their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Very often, the key to service quality and efficiency is the ability to access and integrate both types of data so that all the right data is made available at the right time, and so that everybody involved can be confident that the information they are using is reliable (i.e. comes from a professionally curated&nbsp;source).</p><p>We have spent years developing our Master Reference Data Services so that both individuals and service providers can use data in this way. Its potential is simply enormous.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/connecting-data-about-me-to-the-world-around-me-18c6c632b94c">Connecting data ‘about me’ to the world around me</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs has the most advanced decentralized identity (DI) <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">mobile wallet SDK</a> on the market—and the newly released version 2.0 has even more features for customers to apply to their own products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a market leader in innovative <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity (DI)</a> technology offerings, Anonyome Labs is proud to bring version 2.0 of the Sudo Platform DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK to market. Like its <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">predecessor</a>, this SDK unites industry-standard DI protocols with <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>’s modularity, reliability and security, and then adds new features that give customers more options for applying the technology to their product suite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">edge agent</a> is an application that sits on an ‘edge device’, such as a user’s mobile phone. Edge agents can provide an array of DI functionality such as <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">wallet</a> and peer-to-peer services. <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">Learn more</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article we run through the technical specs of Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0, but here are the 5 ways the version 2.0 mobile wallet SDK is more advanced than its predecessor:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adopts the latest v2.0 suite of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Hyperledger Aries RFCs</a> for receiving and securely storing credentials and verifiably presenting credentials. Learn about how the banking industry is using <a href="https://anonyome.com/2024/02/revolutionizing-credit-union-kyc-reusable-credentials/">verifiable or reusable credentials</a>, for example.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 still supports <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Hyperledger Anoncreds</a>, and now also supports more credential and presentation formats, particularly <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs)</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adds support for Aries-based chat functionality, so users can exchange end-to-end encrypted chat messages with their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/08/whitepaper-innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">DIDComm</a> connections.&nbsp; 
 



 
 The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to exist in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">DI offerings</a>, such as in the <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Sudo Platform Cloud Agent Service</a> and the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo Platform Decentralized Identity Relay</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 In future we will add into the SDK support for OpenID4VC and more of the latest Hyperledger Aries RFCs. This will be part of our new roadmap as we move on from the initial roadmap we outlined <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">here</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>Let’s now go into more detail about these 5 features:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adopts the latest Aries credential and presentation exchange RFCs&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to expand its support for the Hyperledger Aries RFCs. Having already supported most of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md">Aries Interop Protocol (AIP)</a> 1.0 suite of protocols, we have progressed to the latest AIP 2.0 suite. To do this, we’ve implemented these new Aries RFCs into our edge agent:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2">Issue Credential Protocol 2.0 (RFC 0453)</a> for negotiating and receiving verifiable credentials from Aries issuers&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0454-present-proof-v2">Present Proof Protocol 2.0 (RFC 0454)</a> for presenting verifiable credentials to Aries verifiers.&nbsp; 
 



<p>This means version 2.0 is significantly better than version 1.0 because it can receive and present credentials in a range of different formats, such as W3C VCs, in addition to Anoncreds. We discuss these new supported formats below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As was the case with version 1 of the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK, we implement the core of these Aries RFCs by leveraging and contributing to the open-source Hyperledger project that Anonyome co-maintains: <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">Aries-VCX</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Version 2.0 adds support for W3C credentials and presentations&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Using the latest Aries protocols for credential and presentation exchange, we built support for new credential and presentation formats, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCs and VPs</a>. This means our customers can pick and choose from a wider range of ‘DI flavours’ that best suit their business use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome has <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">previously analysed Anoncreds and W3C VCs</a>, both of which play a crucial purpose in the DI ecosystem. Some benefits the Edge Agent SDK’s support for W3C VCs offers include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Higher interoperability from standardization and widespread adoption as a result of being formalized by W3C&nbsp; 



 Highly flexible data structure in comparison to Anoncreds, including support for more complex credential structures such as nested attributes and lists, suitable for a broad range of applications&nbsp; 



 More maturity and backing by a global standard, with many implementations and growing adoption.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Where Anoncreds may beat W3C VCs is in its advanced privacy-preserving features. Anoncreds thrives in this area, with support for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">zero knowledge proofs</a> (ZKPs) of credential attributes, and partial disclosure of credential attributes (only reveal the attributes that need to be revealed).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To retain some of these privacy-preserving use cases in W3C VCs credentials, the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK adds support for presenting selectively disclosed credentials using BBS+ cryptography (as defined in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0646-bbs-credentials">Aries RFC 0646</a>). This means edge agent users can present a proof with a subset of their BBS credential’s attributes without revealing all the other attributes that may contain sensitive data. This is not otherwise possible with other W3C VC types, such as Ed25519-based VCs.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Version 2.0 adds support for end-to-end encrypted chatting&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>All Aries protocol messages transmitted between the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK and its peers (issuers, verifiers, etc.) are already end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), but with our added support for Aries “Basic Messages” (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0095-basic-message">RFC 0095</a>), our users can now send and receive text chat messages with their DIDComm connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome has built a <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity/edge-agent-sdk/messaging">comprehensive API around this feature</a>, with support for message storage and real-time subscriptions. This new suite of APIs allows our customers to build E2EE chat use cases into their applications, whether that is E2EE chat with an issuer or verifier (e.g. a bank or DMV), or with a fellow edge agent (mobile to mobile chat). The Edge Agent SDK supports these use cases.&nbsp;</p>



 
 The SDK exists in Anonyome’s suite of DI offerings&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Anonyome continues to advance its <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/decentralized-iam/">collection of DI offerings</a>, supporting a wide range of use cases. The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to seamlessly integrate with our highly scalable DI message relay solution, the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo DI Relay SDK</a>, allowing the edge agent to reliably receive messages from the DIDComm peers it connects with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, we continue to thoroughly test our edge agent against our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Cloud Agent Service</a> offering (in addition to a suite of open-source Aries agents) to make sure all our features remain interoperable in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 
 We have a rich roadmap ahead for the SDK&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Maturing into its second stable release, the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK has achieved the roadmap tasks that we laid out in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">this article</a>. But given the evolving nature of the DI industry, Anonyome plans to continue adding new features to every new release of the SDK so our customers’ applications can stay up to date with the latest and greatest in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the future for the SDK, we plan to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Implement V2 Aries protocols for connection establishment, particularly DIDExchange (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0023-did-exchange">RFC 0023</a>) and Out-of-Band protocol (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">RFC 0434</a>)&nbsp; 



 Implement parts of the <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID4VC</a> DI stack, allowing the Edge Agent SDK to receive and present credentials with a wider audience of standards, particularly the EUDI’s <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/arf.md">Architecture and Reference Framework</a>&nbsp; 



 Expand the set of DID methods we support, such as did:cheqd, did:indy, and did:peer, again increasing the level of interoperability with more DI agents.&nbsp;

				  Learn how easy it is to use decentralized identity to transform KYC, customer onboarding, and account management in banking with Indicio Proven®.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio has a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE2gFx-msuE">demonstration</a> of how you can use verifiable credentials for reusable KYC, and bank account authentication for passwordless login — and it’s really easy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demonstration is from the perspective of a bank working with a customer to open an account. It starts with collecting the required personal information to open a bank account&nbsp;(aka KYC — know your customer). Assuming this has been assessed by the bank as being accurate, the customer is sent a QR code to establish a secure, direct communications channel for accepting and receiving a KYC credential, which they store in a digital wallet (in this case, Indicio’s Holdr+ wallet).</p>
<p>Because the source of the credential can be cryptographically verified and the KYC information can be shown to have not been altered, the credential can be reused to share this information.</p>
<p>For example, other bank departments or other institutions, such as insurance companies, can use this credential to avoid re-doing the same KYC. Verifying the information is very simple. The customer scans a QR code to present the credential, and the verifying software on the financial institution’s side verifies its source and that it has not been tampered with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The customer can also use the credential for passwordless login to their bank account. Rather than messing with passwords and two-factor authentication, you can simply scan a QR code to present your account credential to the bank, and you will be instantly authenticated and granted access to your account.</p>
<p>This is a game changer for banking and finance. One of the biggest reasons that customers give up is long and frustrating processes, and now, with a simple scan, you can keep your customers happy and coming back for more.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how verifiable credentials can simplify processes for your organization please<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"> contact the Indicio team</a> and our industry veterans will be happy to help.</p>

  <p>Today, we're excited to announce the general availability of user insights in Microsoft Entra External ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User insights, which was launched in public preview in October 2023, is a powerful tool that enables admins and developers to gain deeper insights into their customers’ behavior, preferences, and challenges. It provides key metrics such as monthly active users (MAU), daily active users (DAU), new users added, requests over time, authentications over time, multi-factor authentication (MFA) usage by type, and MFA success versus failure rates. You can also filter and segment the data by time range, operating system, country, and application id. With user insights, you can:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Analyze the trends and patterns of your customers’ application login and registration activity and discover new opportunities for growth and improvement. 
 Optimize user experience and identity management strategies for your customers and make data-driven decisions that align with your business goals and user needs. 
 Build customized dashboards in tools like Power BI using user insights from Microsoft Graph APIs, allowing more flexibility and control of your customer identity data.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access user insights, you need to have a <a href="https://aka.ms/External_ID">Microsoft Entra External ID</a> external tenant. Once you have your tenant ready, you can access the dashboards on the <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDUserInsights">Microsoft admin center</a> or access raw data via <a href="https://aka.ms/userInsightsGraphAPIs">Microsoft Graph APIs</a>. The features we’re announcing today provide significant value and are based on direct feedback from our preview customers. Sign up for your free trial <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_B2CAdmin/Trialtenantcreation.reactview/isFromDevHub/true">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Export data to Excel for offline analysis 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ‘export to Microsoft Excel’ feature is a convenient way to access raw data from the dashboards to suit different user preferences and use cases. You will now be able to export data in comma-separated values (CSV) format to facilitate the seamless importation and manipulation of data with Excel, or any other preferred CSV editor. This allows customers to use data offline for their own customized analysis and manipulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Export authentications data to Microsoft Excel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tailor and optimize your identity management solution for different user segments&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can filter data by language and identity provider to get more insights into the preferences and behavior of your users. For example, you can see which languages are most popular among your users and how they vary across applications and regions. You can also see which identity providers are used the most for authentication and how they may affect the user experience and retention. These filters help you tailor and optimize your identity management solution for different user segments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Analyze authentications data by identity provider or language customization</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improving user experience and security with MFA failure insights 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MFA failure chart shows the number of sign-in attempts that failed due to MFA issues and why they failed. You can see the breakdown by three categories:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Bad request: the sign-in request was malformed or invalid. 
 MFA denied: the user entered the wrong verification code or declined the MFA request.

 Decentralized Approaches Across Industries <p>The urgency to innovate identity management systems has never been greater. Recent statistics paint a sobering picture of identity theft and fraud across various sectors: approximately one in three Americans have fallen victim to identity theft. Moreover, the global cost of cybercrime, including identity fraud, is projected to soar to an astonishing $9.5 trillion annually by 2024. The prevalence and sophistication of these threats are accelerating, exemplified by a tenfold increase in detected deepfakes worldwide from 2022 to 2023, posing significant security challenges across all industries.</p><p>These figures not only reflect the scale but also the evolving complexity of cyber threats. The average cost of a data breach now stands at a record $4.45 million globally, marking a 15% increase over three years. Simultaneously, the number of data breaches and their severity continue to escalate, with a 15% rise in incidents and an 11% surge in breach severity noted just within the United States from 2022 to&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Such statistics underscore the critical vulnerabilities within traditional, centralized identity management systems and highlight the growing imperative for more secure, resilient solutions. Decentralized identity (DID) technology, leveraging blockchain’s inherent security and transparency, offers a promising alternative. By empowering individuals with control over their personal data through self-sovereign identity principles, DID not only enhances security but also significantly mitigates the risks of data breaches and identity theft. This technological shift is crucial for protecting personal and organizational assets against the increasingly sophisticated landscape of cyber threats and for paving the way toward a more secure digital&nbsp;future.</p><p>To address these pervasive challenges, this article delves into several compelling use cases of decentralized identity (DID) across diverse sectors such as healthcare, finance, education, and more. Each example illustrates how DID not only counters the threats outlined but also offers transformative benefits — enhancing privacy, streamlining operations, and fostering innovation. As we explore these use cases, it becomes evident how DID stands as a cornerstone for building a resilient, efficient, and more equitable digital landscape, empowering individuals and institutions alike to navigate the complexities of the modern cyber environment safely and effectively. This exploration aims not just to inform but to inspire action towards the widespread adoption of decentralized identity solutions that are vital for securing our digital&nbsp;futures.</p> Healthcare <p>The healthcare sector handles highly sensitive personal data, including medical records, insurance details, and patient identities. Remarkably, one out of every three Americans has faced identity theft in healthcare, highlighting an urgent need for robust, secure solutions. Decentralized identity (DID) systems could be the key to revolutionizing how we manage healthcare information, making processes more secure, efficient, transparent, and patient-centered.</p><p>In the realm of healthcare, DIDs are particularly pivotal. The landscape of healthcare data encompasses a vast network of providers, emergency services, and facilities. Through DIDs, patients gain complete ownership and control over their data. This empowers them to access, review, amend, and manage consent for data sharing, request deletion of their data, or even choose to be forgotten.</p><p>A prime application of DIDs in this sector is in verifying the credentials of healthcare staff and vendors. The healthcare ecosystem is a complex web of interactions requiring stringent authentication. Decentralized identity management enables individuals to create and control their digital identities securely via cryptographic, verifiable credentials stored in digital wallets. This method ensures that individuals can prove their identity and qualifications without unnecessary exposure of their information or dependence on a central authority.</p><p>Moreover, DIDs can significantly cut administrative costs. Individuals can use their verifiable credentials to explore medical benefits, compare healthcare plans, and enroll in services directly through a digital portal, eliminating the need for repetitive paperwork. These credentials can also store insurance details and provide necessary proof of attestation when required.</p><p>DIDs enhance secure communications between patients and healthcare providers as well. For example, patients can verify their eligibility for services through a mobile application before even visiting a clinic. At the healthcare facility, this same application can seamlessly integrate necessary details like names and insurance information for efficient check-in processes.</p><p>Additionally, blockchain technology can serve as a decentralized record-keeping service, storing metadata about a patient’s records primarily in the form of public keys and non-personally identifiable information (PII).</p><p>However, the integration of decentralized identity management in healthcare is not without its challenges. Issues such as interoperability, regulatory compliance, widespread adoption, and the inherent technical complexities need to be addressed. The road ahead involves extensive research, development, and rigorous testing to ensure these systems are both practical and beneficial.</p><p>Despite these hurdles, the potential for improved data security, privacy, immutability, interoperability, and enhanced patient autonomy positions decentralized identity as a transformative force in healthcare. This promising technology could very well redefine the landscape of healthcare decision-making, ushering in a new era of digital health empowerment.</p> Finance <p>In the world of finance, handling monetary transactions, investments, and safeguarding customer financial data are paramount. With the average cost of a data breach soaring to $4.45 million globally in 2023, the role of decentralized identity (DID) in bolstering security and minimizing fraud has never been more&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>DID is set to revolutionize the financial services industry with its secure, efficient, and user-centric approach to identity management. Leveraging cryptography, DID ensures the protection of identity data while empowering individuals to manage their personal information access and sharing. This enhanced control fosters greater ownership over one’s digital and financial identities.</p><p>A significant advantage of DID is its ability to streamline the customer onboarding process. By eliminating repetitive identity verification, DID not only enhances the user experience but also simplifies access to financial services. Additionally, the shift from traditional, insecure password systems to decentralized authentication boosts security significantly.</p><p>DID also aids financial institutions in adhering to stringent regulatory requirements, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). The blockchain’s immutable ledger ensures that transactions cannot be altered, which helps prevent certificate fraud and other forms of tampering. Over time, this can lead to reduced costs associated with identity verification and management for financial organizations.</p><p>Another critical application of DID is promoting financial inclusion. Approximately one billion people globally lack official identification, which blocks their access to essential financial services. DID offers a solution where only an internet connection and a smart device are needed to establish a self-sovereign identity on the blockchain. This capability is invaluable, particularly in regions affected by political instability where paper records may be compromised. By enabling the unbanked to establish an economic identity, DID opens doors to participation in the global financial ecosystem.</p><p>Despite its potential, the adoption of DID within financial services encounters several hurdles.

 We sit down with our internal subject matter expert in the telecommunications industry to learn what trends this sector is seeing, predictions on where it is headed as well as advice for the future. 



<p>Telecommunications is becoming an ever-growing market, not only because we live in a connected world but also because the number of devices and network connections just keeps increasing. One recent study predicts that <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/5g-iot-connections-to-surpass-100-mn/">5G IoT (Internet of Things) connections will reach 116 million globally by 2026</a>. This industry is therefore confronted with many challenges as the number of devices and connections continues to rise.</p>



<p>According to an identity verification survey conducted by Regula in 2023, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/telecoms-turn-to-identity-verification-as-fraud-concerns-soar">9 out of 10 organizations in the telecommunications industry consider identity verification (IDV) a crucial tool in combating the increasing threat of identity fraud</a>. Furthermore, in the coming years, <a href="https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/information-technology/images/infographics/2024-cio-agenda/2024-cio-agenda-infographics/2024-cio-agenda-banking-and-investment-infographic">CIOs will increase investments by 83% in Integration Technologies/APIs/API Architecture according to Gartner</a>. But fraud isn’t the only challenge this industry faces. Telecommunications needs to stay up-to-date and meet the demands that modern technology brings to the table, or shall I say device, if it is to have any future. Since smart devices are as common and habitual as brushing one’s teeth, the direction in which this industry is headed is one in which needs to stay ahead of the curve or get left behind in the pile of outdated technology.</p>



<p>We spoke with Duke Golden, Director Sales at IDnow, with his almost 30 years within the industry and past experiences at 1NCE, Huawei and Vodafone to name just a few, to learn what topics in the telecommunications sector are trending, his predictions on where this industry is headed and his advice for telco operators.</p>



 As an industry that is perhaps overlooked due to the fact that it is very much part of our everyday lives and common for the generations that grew up within this technology boom, what major trends would you say the telecommunications industry is therefore seeing? 



<p>Telecommunications in our daily lives is almost invisible these days – but it is truly the foundation for our digital lives. It’s just something that you think should be there. I’ve been in the telecommunications industry for about 25 years now. But you’re right, that comment is very much what you get from a generation that grew up with the Internet. But there is a lot that goes into this. Everything we enjoy today from dating apps to ordering groceries, telecommunications is the driving force behind all of these innovations. Nothing happens without a network connection.</p>



<p>To describe it in a different way, network connectivity has very much become a commodity, especially over the last 10-15 years. Connectivity is like bread, milk, eggs, oil, gas—it’s just something we need for our everyday life. However, the struggle right now within the telecommunications industry, especially with regards to Tier-1 operators, is that they need to find a way to make that connectivity into something like a value add for their customers. It can’t just be about the connectivity. The question now is what do telecommunications operators do with that connectivity? They have a great opportunity to do something really special, being the owner of the network connectivity.</p>



<blockquote><p>So right now we’re at a point where telecommunications providers really need to provide new solutions, incorporating their connectivity to bring additional value add to customers.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>A big part of that value add for customers is the IoT—API driven economies. What they’re doing is basically providing the connectivity and then a platform for API integration for a million different types of services that are intrinsically connected to their connectivity.</p>



<p>But how do you monetize connectivity? You have to create an ecosystem where you can generate revenue based on new ideas using that connectivity. Telecommunications providers still want connectivity to be at the center of their proposition but the really interesting and attractive part for customers is the ability to monetize this in a variety of forms. And this is where the IoT starts to come in.</p>



 Yes, IoT (Internet of Things) seems to be one of those trends on the radar within telecom, why is this the case? 



<p>IoT is evolving to become one of the most disruptive and enabling technologies for end users in recent memory. It’s revolutionizing the way we approach network connectivity and digitalization in our daily lives. In the beginning it was just machine to machine which was basically the first iteration of the IoT.</p>



<p>IoT is basically a blank canvas for an artist to use connectivity to paint a picture which didn’t exist before, and that’s what’s happening with the IoT, especially with telco-driven IoT initiatives. Because it’s not just the telcos who are doing IoT. It is a hugely competitive and largely proprietary space where the only limitation to business cases is the creator’s imagination. This is where only the strongest telcos will prosper. Deutsche Telekom, for instance, has a very strong expert approach to IoT which can accommodate entire ecosystems to create business value for their customers.</p>



<p>Now, the pressure on the telecom world is really to bring the knowledge that they have, not just about networks but about industry verticals themselves, into play to develop something meaningful for individual customers.</p>



 What tools and resources will help these initiatives in the telco sector? 



<p>What we do at IDnow is possibly one of the most important enabling solutions within the IoT potentially. One of my goals is to connect IDnow into this API economy so customers of a telco service have the option to conduct an ID verification process. To date, IoT has been more concerned with locating individual devices. A lot of people think IoT is a device-driven type of world where you don’t need to know the person behind it. But that’s changing, especially with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marcel-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/">AI and deepfakes</a>. You can really manipulate a traditional device-based IoT network in a big way unless you verify who the person is working on the IoT platform. You really need to know who has access and who is accessing the platform. Maybe it doesn’t have to be a deep dive, but the key with IoT is trust.</p>



<blockquote><p>Trust is the number one factor that will either enable a customer to deploy a telco-based IoT solution or will stop it in its tracks.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>If there are doubts about the authenticity of the platform, or the ability for that platform to control unauthorized usage, then a lot of times IoT initiatives never make it off the ground, especially in Germany. It’s all about 1% risk means 100% opposition in many cases. Germany has kind of a very strict sense when it comes to these things like 0 risk is the only acceptable risk.</p>



 Since trust is the number one factor within telco, the term Zero Trust with regards to network connections and security has been used a lot recently. Is this something widespread in the telecommunications industry? 



<p>Zero Trust is widely used. That is a term that you will hear everywhere from network engineers to security operations technicians. Zero trust—trust nothing. The reason that it has become popular is because security has become completely endangered, especially over the last five to 10 years. In the network engineering world, there are different points of ingress into the network. In the past before IoT, before cloud, before all these other innovative ways to connect to the Internet, the Internet protocol basically protected these environments. They were standardized environments where you could only enter them with a specific network protocol and it was much easier to protect them. Zero Trust wasn’t really needed at that point because you knew that if someone broke into the network, it was an inside job.</p>



<p>Now, anyone has the opportunity to interface with any layer of the network from a completely unverified position. So Zero Trust was born, and it became probably the strongest terminology used especially in the telco world. You need to verify every single user to a different degree. For example, if you’re talking about an online dating platform, you don’t need to verify everything about this person’s character. You just need to verify they are over 18. Zero Trust doesn’t mean you have to conduct a complete background check on every single individual person, but you need to know who you’re dealing with.</p>



 With the need to verify a person and bind them to the device they are using, will there be hesitation from users with concerns to data privacy? 



<p>Enterprises want to know more about their customers because the more they know the better they can serve their customers. Nothing is for free. A well-known CEO of a cybersecurity company once told me, if you are getting something for free, then you are the product. Thus, we’re not dealing in a cash-based economy anymore. True value lies in information these days.</p>



<p>And with regards to the telecommunications industry, there is a huge push right now to monetize in different ways the connectivity that they’re already providing to people. With the price of connectivity sinking daily, the push now for telcos is to recover that depreciation in the cost of actual connectivity in extra value-added services like IoT, like cloud services, 5G campus Networks and other digitalization initiatives. And the key to all these other value-added services is to verify who those services are going to, not only for the safety and security aspect, but having the knowledge to serve their customers better. That knowledge for telecommunications providers is essential to designing or altering services to fit specific types of the widest possible scope of business cases.</p>



<p>As with all new initiatives, especially from my experience in Europe, there will be hesitation. But it depends on the country and on the culture. Every society globally is very different when it comes to their aversion to risk. At the end of the day, it’s all about the economy and people’s ability to pay for things, either with money or information.</p>



<p>While there might be kickback in conservative countries like Germany, the vast majority of the world will have no problem with signing up for services and giving them a certain amount of information. But it needs to be tied to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">identity verification solutions</a> because the only way to really increase security in a very complicated online services world is to start with a single point of truth. And the only way to truly verify who a person is, is by verifying their identity. But they can’t only be verified one time. It needs to be an ongoing activity verifying and reverifying, especially with regards to critical infrastructure. And this is where the telecommunications industry and IDV is headed.</p>



 How regulated would you say is the IoT industry? For example, in Germany, there is the Telecommunications Act (TKG) but are there any other regulations? 



<p>With regards to the IoT specifically, IoT is still very much wild, wild West. There is very little regulation.</p>



<p>I think there is a serious risk that the IoT can become too dangerous in some ways if we don’t regulate ourselves using best practice instead of waiting for regulatory agencies to act. The difference between traditional telecommunications networks and IoT networks is that telecom networks are completely standardized internally and with IoT all of these solutions are proprietary. There is no standardization within the IoT industry. So that means our ability to secure the IoT is much less than with standardized industry standards like on the traditional network side which have well thought out, highly developed security protocols built into them.</p>



<p>What better place to secure the IoT than at the point of ingress for all users, both internal and external? That means performing a comprehensive ID verification process for admins and users, depending on what type of IoT platform it is. We just need to change our view on what is an acceptable level of risk.</p>



 With the number of smart devices continuing to increase and experts predicting that by 2030 the world population will be around 8.3 billion and the number of devices will have reached an estimated 43.2 billion, what are the main challenges this industry faces when considering these numbers? 



<p>Traditionally, in the IDV sector it’s been about verifying users before they buy their prepaid mobile or before they activate it and then they’re good to go. </p>



<blockquote><p>Now, verification needs to become an integral part of the entire value chain for technology, not just at the point of purchase, but at the point of usage.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>The ID verification process is something that needs to be always going on in the background. And this is where the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0 regulation</a> would come into play with a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a>. But we’re just not there yet. Regulations will always be behind technology.</p>



<p>At IDnow and as an ID verification solutions provider, it’s our responsibility to fill the gap between regulation and everyday business risks that aren’t being addressed by the regulatory environment. Building this bridge of trust for our customers is our core mission which we take very seriously.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule applies to all crypto transactions above 1 CHF in Liechtenstein.  To operate legally in Liechtenstein, VASPs must register with the FMA and verify transaction parties’ identities.  VASPs must use blockchain analytics to verify and monitor transactions, especially with unhosted wallets in Liechtenstein.  <p>Since January 1, 2020, Liechtenstein has enforced the Blockchain Act (TVTG), creating a comprehensive legal structure for cryptocurrencies and related services.</p><p>Subsequent amendments to the Due Diligence Act (SPG) and the Due Diligence Ordinance (SPV) have integrated <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p> Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>In Liechtenstein, the Travel Rule obliges VASPs to exchange detailed transaction-related personal information for all virtual asset transfers above the minimum threshold of 1 Swiss Franc&nbsp;(CHF).</p><p>This includes the full names, wallet addresses, and other identifying information of the transaction’s originator and beneficiary.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>VASPs in Liechtenstein must register as outlined in the TVTG, with the Financial Market Authority (FMA) having three months to respond to registration applications.</p><p>All VASPs must also verify the identities of counterpart VASPs, particularly when dealing with high-risk jurisdictions, and implement enhanced due diligence measures. These requirements apply to both domestic and cross-border transfers.</p><p>For Originators:</p>  Full name  Wallet address  One of the following: physical address, ID document number, customer identification number, or date and place of&nbsp;birth  <p>For Beneficiaries:</p>  Name  Wallet address  <p>If the required Travel Rule data is missing, incomplete, or delayed, the beneficiary VASP must implement risk-based procedures to identify and rectify gaps, potentially suspending or rejecting the transfer until compliance is achieved.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Liechtenstein, VASPs like cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services must adhere to the Travel Rule, supervised by the Financial Market Authority (FMA). This regulation is crucial for preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. Here’s what they need to&nbsp;do:</p> Registration and Licensing <p>VASPs must register and get licenses as per the Trustworthy Technologies Act (TVTG), with the FMA reviewing and approving these applications. This ensures that all VASPs meet high regulatory standards and contribute to a secure financial system.</p> Monitoring Transfers <p>Exchanges must monitor all transactions, especially those involving unhosted wallets that let owners directly control their private keys. This includes collecting extra information on these wallets during high-risk transactions to prevent illegal activities.</p><p>For this, VASPs must conduct laser-focused diligence and use blockchain analytics tools to verify the ownership of the wallets involved in transactions. Additionally, transactions involving these wallets must be scrutinized using blockchain analysis tools to ensure they do not facilitate money laundering or terrorist financing.</p> Risk-Based Policies <p>Both sending and receiving VASPs need to develop policies tailored for managing transfers involving unhosted wallets. These policies must focus on thorough verification and monitoring to align with local and international regulations.</p> Global Context <p>Liechtenstein enforces a low threshold for the Travel Rule, requiring compliance for transactions as small as 1 CHF. This is in contrast to places like the United States, where the threshold is $3,000, and Singapore, where it’s S$1,500. The European Union, on the other hand, is exploring the idea of applying the FATF Travel Rule to all crypto transactions, regardless of&nbsp;amount.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Since implementing the FATF Travel Rule in 2020, Liechtenstein requires detailed verification for cryptocurrency transactions over 1 CHF. This is in sharp contrast to the higher thresholds in <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">the United States</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Singapore</a> and the potential for no minimum in the European Union. Liechtenstein’s strict approach aims to safeguard financial transactions and prevent illegal activities like money laundering and terrorism financing within its&nbsp;borders.</p> FAQs  1. What is the minimum threshold for the Travel Rule in Liechtenstein? <p>In Liechtenstein, the FATF Travel Rule applies to all cryptocurrency transactions above 1 Swiss Franc&nbsp;(CHF).</p> 2. What information must VASPs collect and verify under the Travel Rule in Liechtenstein? <p>VASPs must collect and verify full names, wallet addresses, and additional identifying information such as a physical address, ID document number, customer identification number, or date and place of birth for both originators and beneficiaries in Liechtenstein.</p> 3. How must VASPs handle transactions involving unhosted&nbsp;wallets? <p>VASPs must use blockchain analytics tools to verify the ownership of unhosted wallets and conduct enhanced due diligence to prevent illegal activities in Liechtenstein.</p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Authors: Yanisa Sunanchaiyakarn &amp; Nuttawut Kongsuwan, Finema Co.&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>As we enter the era of generative AI, the risk of identity theft for both individuals and organizations is escalating. A <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">recent case</a> in Hong Kong highlights this threat, where an office was deceived into transferring $25 million after a video call with a deepfake CFO and colleagues. As advances in AI erode trust, it becomes apparent that a robust digital identity solution for organizations is urgently&nbsp;needed.</p><p>In the past few years, the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a> framework has emerged as one of the most promising solutions to this global crisis. The vLEI framework offers one of the most secure and trustworthy digital organization identity management to date and potentially revolutionizes digital business transactions worldwide.</p><p>Since vLEI is also still in its infancy, there is a significant challenge for the community to overcome its adoption hurdle. In this article, we propose 4 pragmatic criteria for identifying fair, good, and great use cases for vLEI from the adoptability perspective. These criteria are by no means rigid rules set in stone but serve as a useful mental model for pioneers and early adopters exploring vLEI use&nbsp;cases.</p> The 4&nbsp;Criteria <p>We have identified 4 criteria for good and great vLEI use&nbsp;cases:</p>  Use cases that involve organization-to-organization transactions  Use cases that involve cross-border transactions  Use cases that are highly regulated  Use cases that have open ecosystems   1. Org-to-Org <p>The first criterion for viable vLEI use cases is that they involve organization-to-organization (Org-to-Org) transactions. This includes business-to-business (B2B), business-to-government (B2G), and government-to-government (G2G) use cases. This is because org-to-org transactions often involve significant monetary value, which far outweighs the initial friction associated with adopting&nbsp;vLEI.</p> 2. Cross-Border <p>Cross-border transactions often face challenges in identifying and verifying clients, suppliers, or partners across different countries, leading to significant perceived risks. The vLEI framework is ideal for addressing these challenges as it is specifically designed for international use. It can potentially streamline the cross-border identification and verification processes, mitigating risks and improving efficiency.</p> 3. Highly Regulated <p>Highly regulated use cases are subject to strict requirements and standards, where non-compliance can result in severe penalties or legal consequences. As a result, these use cases often require extensive due diligence of business partners, including Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)&nbsp;checks.</p><p>The process of obtaining vLEI for organizations and their representatives involves robust identity verification that is more stringent than those often conducted in the financial sector. As a result, vLEI, which is built on the global LEI system, can help streamline the due diligence process, significantly reducing compliance costs.</p> 4. Open Ecosystems <p>The final criterion for viable vLEI use cases is that they operate within open ecosystems, allowing the addition of organizations whose identities are not known in advance. Onboarding a new organization to the ecosystem often incurs significant cost, time, and effort. vLEI allows these onboarding costs to be offloaded to a third party, specifically a qualified vLEI issuer (QVI), which ensures that the organization and its representatives have undergone strict identity verification.</p> Fair, Good, and Great Use&nbsp;Cases  Great Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Great use cases are those that satisfy all 4 criteria, making them ideal candidates that could benefit from integrating vLEI into their workflows.</p><p>A prime example of a great use case is trade finance. It typically involves organizations (criterion 1) which are often located in different countries (criterion 2). Trade finance is also highly regulated, with financiers subject to AML and CFT requirements (criterion 3). The trade finance ecosystem is open, allowing any company worldwide to initiate trades and apply for, e.g., a letter of credit (criterion 4).</p> Good Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Good use cases are those that satisfy 3 out of the 4 criteria. We consider these use cases worth pursuing.</p><p>An example of a good use case is the financial reporting of banking institutions in Europe to the European <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-discussion-paper-centralisation-eea-banks">Banking Authority (EBA)</a>. This exemplifies a B2G scenario (criterion 1), encompassing banks across multiple European countries (criterion 2) that operate within a highly regulated environment (criterion 3). What makes this use case simply good rather than great in our criteria is that European banks are already known entities within the closed ecosystem supervised by the&nbsp;EBA.</p> Fair Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Fair use cases are those that satisfy two or fewer criteria. While they may be a feasible use case for vLEI, we consider them a low-potential candidate. We argue that fair use cases will become viable once vLEI has achieved widespread adoption. For instance, organizations that already possess vLEI for stronger use cases might contemplate applying it to these fair use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>An example of a use case we consider “fair” for vLEI is an HR platform. Such a platform is used internally between employers and employees (not org-to-org) and is also not highly regulated. Typically, employees and employers have alternative means to verify each other, diminishing the necessity for vLEI in this&nbsp;context.</p> Conclusion <p>While vLEI holds significant potential to transform global business operations, it currently faces a challenge known as the “cold start problem,” where there are not enough holders and use cases to foster exponential growth in the ecosystem. Pioneers and early adopters are encouraged to prioritize exploring high-potential use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Do you agree with our criteria? Are there additional criteria we should consider adding to the list? We welcome your feedback and invite you to contact us at contact@enauthn.id.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/4-criteria-for-great-vlei-use-cases-c5fa0e04a6f5">4 Criteria for Great vLEI Use Cases</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Beyond code, Copilot understands shipping <p>I know, we all drowned in “OMG” posts last year as people shared their AI experiences. We’re beyond that now; we’re looking for use cases, value adding application and bundling.</p><p>Nonetheless, I can’t hide from the fact that I had one of those OMG experiences yesterday. I was designing a JSON Schema for a Mill Test Report (MTR)— a document used in the Steel industry to describe the type and quality of steel products. MTRs can contain a large number of tests, and I had modeled a few of them&nbsp;already.</p><p>As I got to Surface Condition tests, I typed “surface” — and look what Github Copilot suggested…</p>Stupid amount of code generated.<p>As my colleague stated, it generated “stupid amount of code” for me. Not rocket science, mainly repeating a pattern of the previous tests — but still a lot I didn’t have to&nbsp;type.</p><p>But then I moved to generating an example JSON instance. Now&nbsp;look…</p>Copiloting on both horizontal and vertical&nbsp;domains.<p>As the test standard for Microstructure Analysis, it suggests “ASTM E112–13”. That is indeed a standard for microstructure analysis! Copilot pulls industry vertical knowledge into my Visual Studio Code environment. The fact that it “copilots” on both horizontal (the technical coding domain) and vertical (industry domain) is just…&nbsp;Cool!</p><p>In all fairness, Copilot subsequently suggested “ASTM E112–13” again for Hydrostatic Tests, which (to my knowledge) does not define such test standards.

 In the age of the Internet of Things, autonomous and connected cars are revolutionizing the way we drive. As these vehicles become increasingly sophisticated, verifying user identity is becoming a crucial issue in ensuring safety and preventing fraud. Let’s explore the challenges and solutions associated with this mobility revolution. 



<p>By 2025, it is estimated that <a href="https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/en/braincamps/planet/how-to-reduce-carbon-emissions-of-the-digital-sector/internet-of-things-50-billion-greenhouse-gas-producers/">50 billion objects will be connected worldwide</a>, covering everything from household appliances to urban infrastructure. Among these objects, cars occupy a prominent place, with functionalities multiplying at an impressive rate. According to <a href="https://www.geotab.com/blog/what-is-connected-car/">Geotab</a>, the smart device is what has changed the game the most in recent years. As technology advances, connected vehicles become more sophisticated, offering advanced functionality that goes far beyond simple driving. These advances are not just limited to improving mechanical and safety aspects, but also extend to features that enhance the overall experience for drivers and passengers.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://www.febiac.be/en/article/connectivity-in-cars-seen-from-all-aspects">Belgian Automobile Federation (FEBIAC)</a> explains: “There are two types of connected cars. The first category has a 4G/5G card that vehicles use to be constantly connected to the Internet, and more specifically to the manufacturer’s online services. The second category connects via your smartphone, whose screen will be replicated on that of the vehicle.”</p>



<p>Connected cars are increasingly integrating smartphones into their ecosystems, thanks in particular to the democratization of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple CarPlay</a> and <a href="https://www.android.com/auto/">Android Auto</a>. As Apple points out, it’s now possible to integrate your iPhone with your car’s digital keys, to open and start your vehicle. Users are now able to link their phone to their vehicle, enabling them to benefit from functions such as remote opening and starting, or purchasing options directly from their phone.</p>



<p>However, such functionalities require a high level of user verification. With the <a href="https://www.confused.com/meet-our-experts/content/automotive-hacking-and-connected-cars">risk of hacking on the rise</a>, it is essential to protect against fraud and identity theft by adopting appropriate solutions.</p>



 Connectivity: the new spearhead of the automotive sector. 



<p>Connected cars have opened up a whole new world of opportunities for automakers and end-users alike. Connectivity has made a major contribution to enhancing the driving experience, through the deployment of new functionalities. These include:</p>



  Predictive maintenance, thanks to remote diagnostic modules, or maintenance notifications based on real-time analysis of vehicle data;  Personalized services, such as notification of available parking spaces nearby, or suggestions for restaurants and services based on location;  Entertainment and connectivity, including smartphones accessing streaming services, or compatible applications from stores;  Remote control and command, enabling the vehicle to be locked, unlocked or started remotely, or the vehicle temperature to be preset.  



<p>Some of these advantages require a connection with a smartphone to operate. More and more cars no longer need a key to start, for example. Cards are gradually replacing ignition keys. They can also be dematerialized on a smartphone, for even greater convenience. This is one of the reasons behind the success of car-sharing services such as <a href="https://getaround.com/">Getaround</a> or <a href="https://zity.eco/en/">Zity</a>, which rely on remote unlocking of vehicles, thanks to strong user identification.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/critical-information-systems-and-cybersecurity/news/new-security-methodology-connected-cars">Thales</a> points out, another crucial point in terms of security for connected vehicles lies in web applications. These enable “the exchange of information between the vehicle and/or driver and the manufacturer’s IT system. If the authentication process is not secure enough, an attacker can enter a user’s account and take control of the vehicle.”</p>



<p>For all these reasons, strong identification measures are essential to anticipate these new uses.</p>



 



 

 



 Securing new uses through identification. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">car-sharing</a> is one of the benchmark use cases, there are other situations in which it may be useful to identify the driver of a vehicle. Lending a vehicle to an employee, rental between private individuals or even self-service cars are all examples of uses that justify better identification of the driver.</p>



<p>These new uses require strong authentication of users using their smartphone, as well as identification of the smartphone by the vehicle. This begins as soon as the vehicle is delivered, where an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> check and biometric verification can be carried out, in order to associate a user with his or her account.</p>



<p>When a key is exchanged digitally with another user, it is necessary for the user to prove his or her identity. By going through the same identification and authentication process as the owner, both parties can optimize the security of vehicle access.</p>



<p>It is also possible to request an additional biometric element to reinforce authentication. For example, the use of biometric features such as facial recognition can add an extra layer of security, allowing the user to access their account in complete safety. Many modern smartphones are equipped with biometric sensors that can be used to authenticate the user before allowing them to unlock the vehicle. Even if an ill-intentioned person has the smartphone of the vehicle’s rightful owner, it will not be possible for him or her to gain access, or even worse, to start it.</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’re helping to enhance the security of connected vehicles by offering <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">ID document verification</a> via our APIs, capable of handling over 3,000 ID documents from 195 countries. By leveraging the latest technologies in facial recognition and life detection, we are able to confirm the physical presence of the person during the verification process. By integrating these technologies and strategies, manufacturers and users of connected vehicles can ensure secure identification of users via their smartphones, minimizing the risk of fraud.</p>



 Anticipating future uses. 



<p>As vehicles become increasingly autonomous and integrated into our daily lives, reliable and secure identification systems are essential to protect drivers and their vehicles. Faced with these new uses, we need to think about security and identification, both on the user side and on the component side. Proactive measures will have a positive impact on users’ peace of mind and their confidence in connected cars.</p>

Extending the Verida Network for Personalized AI with Confidential Compute<p>The AI revolution is undeniable, with a market poised to hit $10 trillion by 2025. But there’s a catch: the data fueling this growth is often centralized, leaving it vulnerable and raising serious privacy concerns.</p><p>However, alongside its huge impact lies a looming concern: data privacy. Traditional AI models typically rely on centralized data storage and centralized computation, raising concerns about ownership, control, and potential misuse. Apple’s recent data-sharing practices and HuggingFace’s security breach underscore these&nbsp;risks.</p> Verida’s Vision: Your Data, Your&nbsp;AI <p>Verida’s mission has always been clear: empower individuals to own and control their data. Now, we’re taking it&nbsp;further.</p><p>The Verida Network has commenced extending its platform to support not just decentralized, privacy preserving databases, but also decentralized, privacy preserving compute suitable for handling personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>We’re integrating personal data with leading AI models, ensuring end-to-end privacy. This safeguards your data and unlocks a new era of hyper-personalized AI experiences.</p><p>AI is only as good as the data it has access&nbsp;to.</p><p>Learn more about the data privacy problems in AI in the previous series we published.</p><p><a href="https://www.chriswere.com/p/top-three-data-privacy-issues-facing">Part 1: Top Three Data Privacy Issues Facing AI&nbsp;Today</a></p><p><a href="https://www.chriswere.com/p/how-web3-and-depin-solves-ais-data">Part 2: How web3 and DePIN solves AI’s data privacy problems</a>.</p><p><a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-is-enabling-the-privacy-preserving-ai-tech-stack-7e9558f822f3">Part 3: Verida is enabling the privacy preserving AI tech&nbsp;stack</a></p> Confidential Compute Unlocks New Capabilities <p>Adding confidential compute to the Verida Network opens up new capabilities to developers and enables powerful new use cases for personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>It enables “Personalized API’s” that provide advanced capabilities beyond data storage, such as enabling existing AI prompts and third party applications easy access to personal data via traditional web2 integration methods.</p><p>Adding “Personal Data Search” enables hyper-personalization to existing applications, while also enabling existing AI models to leverage private user data — without leaking this to third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>For builders on the Verida Network, this new pathway extends capabilities allowing developers to build and offer custom “user agent” code that securely operates on behalf of a user. For example, automating sending messages (email, telegram etc.) or a background agent that runs on behalf of a user, pulling their latest data from centralized API’s every hour, scheduling calendar invites and managing personal tasks and requests. All of this operating in a highly secure, decentralized confidential compute environment, protected by a user’s private&nbsp;keys.</p> Join Verida in building a user-owed AI&nbsp;future <p>The Verida network is designed for storing private, personal data. It is a <a href="https://news.verida.io/revolutionizing-web3-storage-a-deep-dive-into-ipfs-and-verida-dbstore-7a15745dd118">highly performant, low cost, regulatory compliant solution</a> for storing structured database data for any type of application. Data stored on the network is protected with a user’s private key, ensuring they are the only account that can request access to, and encrypt their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Verida has always been about allowing individuals to own and be in control of their personal data, enabling their data to benefit them. When Verida was first established, AI was barely a blip, but has now become a huge force and demonstrated great utility across almost every industry&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Privacy preserving AI will need access not only to private data, but also preserving computation to train AI models and respond to user&nbsp;prompts.</p><p>Our core values and objectives remain; to provide the underlying infrastructure for personal data ownership, and now extend that to support the development of user-owned, privacy preserving AI products.</p><p>Through the extension of the Verida Network to support personal confidential compute, there is a very clear pathway to enable personalized, privacy preserving AI leveraging a 100% DePIN technology stack.</p><p>This is incredibly exciting, as it will provide a more secure, privacy preserving solution as an alternative to giving all our data to large centralized technology companies.</p><p>If you’re a developer looking to future proof your application with private self-sovereign data storage and compute capabilities, get in touch with our experts in our <a href="https://discord.verida.io/">Discord</a> server or register your project for the Verida Ecosystem <a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem#build-with-us">here</a>.</p> About Verida <p>Verida is a pioneering decentralized data network and self-custody wallet that empowers users with control over their digital identity and data.

<p>In the first release of 2024 we have updated SSO Swedish BankID adaptor to enable the core Authentication Flow, utalising animated QR codes for all two device authentications. This modern specification helps to limit the potential phishing attacks through the use of continuously changing QR codes.</p>
<p>We have altered our CustomerID application to help reduce the potential of misconfigurations which could result in user invitations being sent repetitively if your PostgreSQL service were misconfigured or became unavailable.</p>
<p>We have also updated Tomcat, Redis, OpenLDAP and PostgreSQL to the latest possible versions for use with Identity Platform. Additionally, as RedHat7/CentOS 7 becomes end of life during 2024, we have updated our support to RedHat9/Rocky9.</p>
<p>For full details over the IDS 2024.1 release, please review the <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> and <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms">System Recommendations</a> pages found on our Developer Portal. </p>
 Patch update: 
<p>SSO 9.4.1 – within this patch release we have updated the Mobile PKI (MPKI) service to fulfil current Traficom requirements. Additionally we have updated Tomcat to 9.0.87</p>
<p>CustomerID 6.4.1 – within this patch release we correct a coding error present when using SSO’s TOTP along with CustomerID’s ability to move users between Organisations. Prior to this patch, moving a user would result in errors and impact both LDAP and PostgreSQL databases. If you utalise TOTP and have CustomerID in active use, we encourage you to update to this patch version of CustomerID.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage all our customers to update to the latest available versions of software. For full details over our latest releases, please review the <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> and <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms">System Recommendations</a> pages found on our Developer Portal.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 1st to 16th&nbsp;June <p>Welcome to the latest issue of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we analyze the recent regulatory developments in Taiwan and South&nbsp;Korea.</p> Taiwan’s Proactive Stance with the VASP Association <p>Taiwan has seen a unique development with the creation of the Taiwan Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) Association.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/AsafGivoli/status/1801287168758776050">Image Source</a>)<p>Formed by 24 local crypto firms, the association is a response to the Justice Ministry’s proposed amendments to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules for crypto operations. These changes could introduce penalties for non-compliance, including fines and prison&nbsp;time.</p><p>The association’s goal is to work with the government to ensure fair regulations that balance growth with fraud prevention.</p><p>This development has both pros and cons. On the upside, this collaborative effort between the industry and government could foster a more stable and growth-oriented market environment, enhancing Taiwan’s position as a forward-thinking hub for digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The association also faces challenges, particularly in aligning the diverse interests of its members with the strict requirements proposed by the Justice Ministry. The severity of the penalties for non-compliance, ranging from heavy fines to imprisonment, places significant pressure on the association to not only ensure adherence to these rules but also advocate effectively for regulations that do not stifle innovation.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/moneygurusumit/status/1773710914472349886">Image Source</a>)<p>So, will other countries follow in Taiwan’s footsteps?</p> South Korea’s New Guidelines on&nbsp;NFTs <p>On the other side of the strait, South Korea has taken a different path, focusing on the classification of non-fungible tokens&nbsp;(NFTs).</p><p>The Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea recently announced that certain NFTs, which are mass-produced and used similarly to cryptocurrencies, will now be regulated under existing cryptocurrency laws.</p><p>(<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/digital-assets/nft/south-korea#revenue">Image Source</a>)</p><p>This is a significant move that can impact the global NFT landscape, as South Korea is one of the largest markets globally for NFTs. According to Statista, NFT sales are projected to <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/digital-assets/nft/south-korea#revenue">reach $58M by 2028 from $38M in&nbsp;2024</a>.</p><p>Through this move, South Korean authorities aim to bring clarity and stability to the NFT market by treating NFTs similarly to other digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>This move provides clearer legal boundaries and increased protection for investors, potentially making South Korea a more attractive market for institutional investment in NFTs and enhancing the overall stability of the digital asset sector. On the other hand, these regulations might also bring challenges for NFT creators and platforms, who will now face stricter compliance requirements.</p> What’s Next? <p>As both countries refine their regulatory frameworks, the global crypto market watches closely. Taiwan’s and South Korea’s different approaches reflect their unique market dynamics and regulatory philosophies. It’s essential for crypto industry stakeholders to stay informed about these changes as they&nbsp;develop.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-crypto-travel-rule-adoption-6-month-status-update">FATF Crypto Travel Rule Adoption: 6-Month Status&nbsp;Update</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the United&nbsp;States</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">A Guide to Crypto Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Japan</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-philippines">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the Philippines</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-estonia">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Estonia</a></p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>A few weeks ago, we had the pleasure of attending Identiverse 2024, the premier conference dedicated to identity and security. Now that we’ve had time to reflect, we’re excited to share our key takeaways from the event. Packed with insightful sessions, innovative workshops, and inspiring keynotes, Identiverse 2024 offered a wealth of knowledge and forward-thinking ideas that are shaping the future of digital identity.</p>
 Fundamentals of Passkeys 
<p>One of the standout sessions was on passkeys, which provided a comprehensive overview of FIDO passkeys, their flow, multi-device capabilities, and the evolution of the standard to support new functionalities. The demonstration of transferring 1Password passkeys to Dashlane showcased significant progress in passkey management flexibility. This interoperability is a game-changer, enabling users to move seamlessly between keychains and enhancing their overall experience. Additionally, Air New Zealand’s rapid adoption of passkeys was notable, with 25% of sign-ins using passkeys and a 30% opt-in rate within the first 24 hours. Such success stories underline the potential of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) in real-world applications.</p>
 Innovation Workshop: Overcoming Obstacles to Empower Innovators 
<p>This workshop addressed key challenges and innovative solutions in advancing identity and security. Inspired by a 2015 data breach affecting 21.5 million federal workers’ fingerprint data, the session emphasized the need for technologies that securely handle biometric data while preserving privacy. The concept of open innovation was also explored, particularly in industries with tight IP restrictions like healthcare and defense. Crowdsourcing platforms like InnoCentive were highlighted as tools to drastically reduce innovation time and effectively solve complex problems.</p>
 Opening Keynote: Andre Durand, Ping Identity 
<p>Andre Durand’s keynote was both engaging and thought-provoking, setting the tone for the conference. Durand highlighted the emerging crisis of deepfakes and the critical need for reliable identity verification solutions. He also emphasized the issue of repeatedly proving one’s identity across multiple systems and the necessity to address this fragmentation. The merging of verification and authentication processes was discussed, aligning well with identity-based authentication solutions. Durand stressed that protecting consumer reputation should be a top priority for identity professionals.</p>
 Keynote: Digital Identity at United Airlines 
<p>United Airlines provided insights into their advancements in integrating digital identity into their customer experience. One of the highlights was the Information Security team reporting to the Customer Success team, demonstrating the importance of combining security with a delightful user experience. The transition from security questions to Email &amp; SMS OTP for second-factor authentication was noted as a step forward, though it presents its own set of challenges. United Airlines is leading the way in embedding identity into every customer touchpoint, from personalized in-flight entertainment to recommending nearby flights during delays.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Identiverse 2024 was a resounding success, offering valuable insights and innovative solutions that will undoubtedly shape the future of digital identity. At 1Kosmos, we’re excited to implement these learnings and continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in identity and security.

 Overview <p>This challenge invites data scientists to analyze 40 years of French tax information, utilizing data collected in a project with the <a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en">EU Commission’s Science Hub, the Joint Research Centre</a> (JRC). Held in collaboration with the JRC, known for its commitment to providing rigorous, evidence-based scientific and technical support to EU policymakers, this challenge presents a unique opportunity to examine extensive tax data to enhance data-driven decision-making. Participants will explore trends in municipal finances, develop predictive models, uncover correlations between population size and tax revenue, and assess the impact of tax policy changes on municipal revenues, aiming to offer valuable insights into the fiscal dynamics of French municipalities.</p> Objectives <p>Participants will conduct an in-depth exploration of the dataset, beginning with ranking municipalities by their tax revenue to identify those with the highest income from direct local taxes. It includes creating graphical representations to illustrate revenue trends in selected towns, enabling the drawing of meaningful conclusions from these visualizations. Additionally, the challenge extends to classifying municipalities based on their growth in tax revenues over various periods, investigating the relationship between population size and tax revenue, and assessing the impact of eliminating the professional tax collected before 2010. This comprehensive approach seeks to provide actionable insights into the fiscal management of French municipalities.</p> Data <p>We have meticulously prepared the dataset for this challenge, ensuring its efficiency for analysis. We aggregated French REI (<a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/repertoire-national-des-elus/">Répertoire des Élus et des Institutions</a>) data files to create a comprehensive data pipeline. REI, a directory of elected officials and institutions in France, provides detailed information on French municipalities’ financial and administrative aspects. Originally a 3.6GB CSV file, we have transformed this dataset into a 0.6GB <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Parquet</a> file. Parquet’s columnar storage format allows faster data access, reduces file size, and improves query performance, making it particularly suitable for handling complex queries and large datasets. This meticulous preparation instills confidence in the quality of the data and provides participants with a powerful tool for their analysis.</p><p>We highly recommend using <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> to interact with the dataset and facilitate querying. DuckDB is a high-performance, in-memory database engine optimized for SQL querying on local machines. We have set things up for participants to use DuckDB at no cost and with minimal friction. This is not just a tool but an exciting opportunity to learn a new, efficient way of querying data for an ML model. This combination of Parquet and DuckDB ensures that participants can quickly and effectively analyze the data, gaining deeper insights into the fiscal dynamics of French municipalities.</p> Mission <p>The mission of the French Fiscal AI Innovation and Prediction Challenge is to leverage data science and machine learning to gain valuable insights into the fiscal dynamics of municipalities in general. This challenge aims to foster data-driven decision-making and enhance the understanding of municipal financial management.</p><p>Participants will engage in various tasks to contribute to evidence-based policymaking by offering actionable insights that can improve fiscal governance and public administration. This collaborative effort underscores the importance of rigorous, data-driven analysis in shaping effective policies. It seeks to empower data scientists to use their skills to make a tangible impact on society, promoting transparency, efficiency, and innovation in public financial management.</p> Rewards <p>We’re dedicated to acknowledging excellence and nurturing talent, so we’ve designed a reward system that celebrates top performers while motivating participants of all skill levels. With a prize pool of $15,000–50% larger than our regular challenges — distributed among the top 10 performers, our structure brings excitement and competitiveness to the 2024 championship. Not only do the top 10 contenders receive cash rewards, but they also accumulate championship points, ensuring an even playing field for both seasoned data scientists and newcomers alike.</p>Prize pool and 2024 Championship points distribution Opportunities <p>By engaging in this challenge, participants will showcase their #AI and #ML skills and play a crucial role in contributing to the broader goal of making European policies grounded in science. This collaborative effort between data enthusiasts and the JRC aims to generate actionable insights that will significantly aid in French municipalities’ effective governance and fiscal management. Your work, therefore, holds immense value and influence in shaping evidence-based policymaking.</p><p>But wait, there’s more!

<p>London, June 18, 2024 – Ahead of the busy summer betting period, IDnow, a leading identity verification provider in Europe, has seen a significant spike in the number of gambling customers requesting identity verification.</p>



<p>Between 14 and 16 June, IDnow saw a 750% increase in the number of players being verified with a European gambling operator [1]. The busiest sign-up day was 14 June, the day of the opening match of UEFA EURO 2024, which saw a much higher volume of verification requests than was seen during the 2022 World Cup. </p>



<p>This latest spike coincides with the lead up to the opening game of UEFA EURO 2024 on 14 June. During each country’s first game, IDnow is expecting these figures to stay at a high level. With that, an increased likelihood of bonus abuse, multi-accounting, underage gambling, money laundering and fake documentation.</p>



 Effective, compliant verification processes to onboard vast numbers of players 



<p>“The challenges operators face during major sporting tournaments are not necessarily any different to their regular daily compliance hurdles, but the sheer volume of new players from all around the world, coupled with increased activity is likely to cause issues for unprepared operators,” said Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.<br><br>“EURO 2024 will be a huge opportunity for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gambling platforms</a>, new and old, so it’s essential they capitalize on the event, while safeguarding their players and their reputation. It’s important they have effective, compliant verification processes in place to onboard vast numbers of players as smoothly and safely as possible. Only when operators are confident they can verify accounts thoroughly, and onboard the right players during such busy period, will they be effective in fighting fraud.”</p>



<p>As global sporting events have such broad appeal, they often attract both casual and regular bettors. Combined with the convenience and accessibility that online platforms now offer, betting during these periods is getting increasingly popular. Indeed, betting during the 2022 World Cup increased by <a href="https://www.openbet.com/news/openbet-processes-more-than-200m-bets-during-the-world-cup">13 percent compared with the 2018 FIFA World Cup</a>.</p>



<p>Worryingly, the surge in gambling activity was seen on both regulated and unregulated sites. For example, in the UK alone, <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/black-market-world-cup">250,000 people visited unregulated, black-market sites during the last World Cup</a> compared with just 80,0000 during the same time frame of the previous year.</p>



<p>Other key security concerns that are exacerbated by major sporting events, such as EURO 2024:</p>



  Increase in site traffic is often used by fraudsters as a smoke screen for nefarious activities. They may conduct identity theft, or attempt account takeovers by launching phishing attacks and cyberattacks on unsuspecting users.  Unsecured public Wi-Fi networks can pose a security risk when players log in to place bets. These networks are susceptible to interception by hackers, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts, exposure of sensitive personal information and potential financial losses for both users and operators.  Rising rates of gambling fraud, with chargeback fraud a particularly common issue. While identity verification solutions can help verify the identity of users and detect fraudulent activity, preventing chargeback fraud requires additional measures, such as transaction monitoring and collaboration with payment processors to identify and block suspicious transactions in real time.  



<p>Although all global gambling platforms are likely to see an uptick in player onboarding, it will likely be European nations that share the same time zone as the tournament that will see the biggest increase in usage.</p>



<p>“Gaming operators in these particular regions must offer secure player onboarding, deposits and withdrawals, and conduct seamless Anti-Money-Laundering and age verification checks to help fight the expected proliferation of fraudulent activity in both the build up to EURO 2024 and throughout the tournament,” concluded Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk. </p>

<p>As enterprises shift from on-premises to cloud systems, hybrid cloud solutions have become essential for optimizing performance, scalability, and user ease. However, risks arise when poorly configured environments connect to the cloud. A compromised Microsoft Active Directory can fully compromise a synchronized Microsoft Entra ID tenant, undermining the integrity and trust of connected services.</p>  
<p>Researchers at Horizon3.ai <a href="https://www.horizon3.ai/attack-research/n0-attack-paths/on-prem-misconfigurations-lead-to-entra-tenant-compromise/">recently published a fascinating analysis</a> on how on-premise misconfigurations in hybrid Microsoft environments can be exploited by attackers using well-documented techniques. In this case, the attack chain can lead to full compromise of the Entra Tenant. In complex enterprise environments, such misconfigurations are all too common. It’s critical for security teams to understand the tactics attackers use and strategies to close these points of vulnerability. Here we take a closer look at the attack chain and offer some additional mitigation strategies.</p> 
 The Attack Chain  
 Using the NodeZero™ tool:

    &nbsp; 
      MITRE ATT&amp;CK Technique(s)   
      Attack Chain Step   
    
    
      1   
     <p>T1557.001</p>  
     <p>NBT-NS traffic from Host 1 is poisoned to relay a netNTLM credential to Host 2 — an SMB server that doesn’t require signing.</p>  
    
    
      2   
     <p>T1003.002, T1078.003</p>  
     <p>Host 2 SAM database dump exposes a local administrator credential that is reused on Host 3 and Host 4.</p>  
    
    
      3   
     <p>T1003.001, T1078.002, T1078.003, T1219</p>  
     <p>Shared local admin credential is used to run a remote access trojan (RAT) on Host 3 and perform an LSASS dump, discovering a domain administrator credential (HOST3$).</p>  
    
    
      4   
     <p>T1003.004, T1078.002, T1078.003</p>  
     <p>Shared local administrator credential is used to remotely dump LSA on Host 4, revealing another domain administrator credential (Admin2).</p>  
    
    
      5   
     <p>T1087.004, T1003</p>  
     <p>Admin2’s credentials used to query AD, determining that the domain uses Entra Connect; credential dumping techniques used to harvest the cloud credential for Entra Connect.</p>  
    
    
      6   
     <p>T1003.003, T1558</p>  
     <p>HOST3$’s credentials used to perform an NTDS dump on another Domain Controller (DC2), discovering the credential utilized to sign Kerberos tickets for Azure cloud services when Seamless SSO is enabled.</p>  
    
    
      7   
     <p>T1528</p>  
     <p>Entra Connect credential used to log into Entra tenant. Refresh token obtained for easier long-term access.</p>  
    
    
      8   
     <p>T1087</p>  
     <p>Analysis of AzureHound data reveals on-premise user Global Administrator (EntraAdmin) within the Entra Tenant.</p>  
    
    
      9   
     <p>T1558.002</p>  
     <p>Silver ticket attack used to forge Kerberos Service Ticket for Entra Admin.</p>  
    
    
      10   
     <p>T1098</p>  
     <p>Access granted to the Microsoft Graph cloud service, without being prompted for MFA, with Global Administrator privileges.</p>  
    
   
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fortunately, this hacking exercise was carried out by white hat pentesters. The researchers at Horizon3.ai noted that, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the company’s environment, it took the NodeZero tool only an hour to compromise the on-premises AD domain, and the associated Entra ID tenant was compromised in less than two hours.</p> 
 Prevention Strategies  
<p>The team at Horizon3.ai included a set of solid initial mitigation recommendations. These include:</p> 
  
  Prevent NTLM Relay: Disabling NBT-NS and enforcing SMB Signing would have prevented the initial access technique used, although other vectors can be used for initial domain access.&nbsp;  
  Use LAPS: Reuse of credentials for Local Administrators enabled key lateral movements that lead to the discovery of Domain Administrator credentials.&nbsp;  
  Treat Entra Connect as a Tier-0 Resource: Install Entra Connect on a non-DC server (with LAPS enabled) and adequately protected with an EDR solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Do not Use On-Premises Accounts for Entra Administrator Roles: Microsoft recommends limiting the number of Entra Administrators and their level of privilege.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 Further Critical Recommendations  
<p>In addition to those, we recommend specific strategies to close common security gaps in Microsoft Entra ID environments.</p> 
  
  Use HYPR as a complement to LAPS to ensure administrators access their devices and systems using a phishing-resistant authentication method.  
  Review and revise your PAM (Privileged Access Management) program. The Static Domain Admin password should be rotated after it is used / checked out. You should also reduce the viability of the Domain Admin Credential in Cache.  
  Use secure <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/single-sign-on-sso">passwordless SSO</a> methods such as HYPRspeed that don’t rely on shared secrets and instead leverage public key cryptography.  
  Enforce the use of phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> methods, such as HYPR, for privileged Entra users access.  
  Begin migration to Entra ID from legacy on-prem technology. While not a small project, it will reduce the threat model of older protocols that rely on hash/passwords.

  Name: Libby Brown<br>Team: Product Management<br>Based in: Seattle area   About Libby <p>I’ve been working in technology and product management for longer than I care to admit, the past 6 years of which were in Identity at Microsoft as product manager of the Microsoft Authenticator app, then all of our passwordless credentials for Microsoft Entra (formerly known as Azure Active Directory.) I really enjoyed working at that intersection of building new technologies in the identity and security ecosystems, and driving the adoption of those technologies by creating user experiences that were compelling both on an individual and organizational level.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming to SpruceID was just a “shift left” in my career, moving upstream in the identity lifecycle, moving to concepts that are earlier in their definition and implementation stages, while at a company still in its launch phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>As Product Manager, I see my role as setting the longer-term direction of the products we are building while staying grounded in the day-to-day details of what and how we deliver&nbsp; on customer promises today. I want to define who SpruceID’s customers are, what they need, and how we’ll meet them, then get everyone on board to deliver.&nbsp;</p> What do you find most rewarding about your job?&nbsp; <p>Startup life is amazing! I love the hustle, the energy, the pressure to deliver because everyone on the team has to play their part to make the whole company successful - it’s invigorating!&nbsp;</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Product (and program) managers need to be able to explore and understand a subject's big picture and then dive down to the nitty gritty details to be successful. Problem-solving and collaboration are also key skills—my current mantra is, “Yes, and….” as in, “Let’s say yes to the idea or challenge, and what else do we need to do to make it happen?” It’s in those discussions of how to do something that good ideas rise up, and the consensus is gained; that doesn’t happen if the first response is a No.&nbsp;</p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>First, I’m still learning non-Microsoft tools - I doubt I will ever come to love Google Calendar – but after 2 decades of muscle memory, I’m beginning to leave Outlook behind.&nbsp;</p><p>I was reading the AAMVA Implementation Guide yesterday afternoon; digging into the W3C VCDM email digests earlier; and last week was refreshing my knowledge of NIST IAL levels. Learning is just a constant in this space, which is one of the reasons I love working on the bleeding edge of identity and security. If I ever find myself NOT learning, that’s when I know it’d be time to move on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>I was in Rio de Janeiro for our all-company meeting, my second week on the job. It was definitely one of my best onboarding experiences ever! It was a great way to meet everyone at once and learn folks’ roles and responsibilities. Also, being a part of big, foundational conversations we were having as a team helped me jump right into product management tasks when I returned home.&nbsp;</p> What's the best piece of advice you’ve received since starting your job here? <p>“Meet Everyone.” Each person at SpruceID has unique skill sets, so it’s been great to learn what those are and jointly figure out how to combine those capabilities to deliver great results.&nbsp;</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>I have done my job successfully when:&nbsp;</p>  customers know what SpruceID can deliver through our digital identity capabilities with the Credible platform;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Customers can realize the business value to their organization from digital credentials and&nbsp;  SpruceID has a long and lustrous roadmap to continue delivering features of value to our customers, existing and new.&nbsp;   What is your favorite part about working at SpruceID? <p>I love #startuplife! After a long time working in and around Microsoft, the direct control I have for driving product definition is wonderfully both terrifying and invigorating.&nbsp;</p> Fun Facts <p>What do you enjoy doing in your free time? I enjoy spending time with my kids. They’re at a fun age where they still want me to be a part of their activities. </p><p>What is your favorite coding language (and why?): HAHAHAHAHA—I am not a programmer, though I’ve spent my life around computers and technology. My first language was Basic, written on a Timex Sinclair computer and saved on an audio cassette. I built my first website via Notepad and FTP. I really didn’t advance in computer science much beyond that until I took an Intro to Programming class taught in Java this spring. </p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: A weeping willow - they love being near water and make perfect playgrounds and climbing gyms for children under their long boughs.&nbsp;</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Key Insights: 
 
 Germany’s approach to driving wallet adoption includes an innovation competition (“Funke”) and a consultation process with civil society. 
 Interoperability profiles, such as OpenID4VC and the Dutch Decentralized Identity Interoperability Profile (DDIP), aim to promote adoption and innovation by providing a common subset of technologies and specifications. 
 The role of big tech companies in providing mobile operating systems and browsers is a double-edged sword, enabling better user experiences but also raising concerns about control and data monetization. 
 Governments have a crucial role in setting regulations and fostering an equal playing field for all stakeholders in the digital identity ecosystem. 
 
 Strategies: 
 
 Governments can promote innovation and adoption by creating testbeds, innovation competitions, and consultation processes. 
 Interoperability profiles, updated in a cadence, can help organizations and vendors align on a common set of specifications and technologies, enabling interoperability. 
 Separating the roles of big tech companies as infrastructure providers (mobile operating systems, browsers) and product providers (wallets) can help address concerns about control and data monetization.

<div class='wrap'>

 We sit down with our Director of Global Regulatory and Government Affairs, Rayissa Armata and our&nbsp;Senior Architect, Sebastian Elfors to discuss collaboration, consortiums and the honor of being invited to join the European Blockchain Sandbox. 



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/consortium-crypto-assets-compliant-eu-regulations/">we revealed</a> that we had joined the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a> consortium, alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="http://havn.network/">HAVN Network</a> and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the aim of creating a Web3-ready KYC and identity verification solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This initiative will enable Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets to become compliant with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer in Funds Regulation (TFR)</a>, which is part of the greater EU Anti Money Laundering Package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sounds relatively straight forward, right? Well, yes and no. New regulations mandate all crypto transactions to a) carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver and b) comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. The issue lies with CASPs also being required to comply with new rules regarding GDPR compliance, which stipulate that personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter the consortium; each partner bringing its own strengths and areas of expertise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, Rayissa and Sebastian fill us in on how the project has been going since it was announced in February 2024.</p>



 As Web3 is still just an idea for a ‘new internet’, why did we decide to join the consortium to try and solve this ‘theoretical problem?’ Will this project be important for the future of payments, in particular in the crypto space? 



<p>Rayissa: Great question. Yes, there were several reasons why IDnow joined the consortium. For one, it is important to collaborate and to be able to adapt to new environments be it from a regulatory or technological perspective. Although concepts can be developed quickly, building the frameworks and ultimately achieving a usable product or service does not happen in a vacuum.</p>



<p>As you know, Europe established the crypto regulatory framework and licensing regime, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA)</a> and the companion rule known as TFR, which applies to transactions between cryptocurrency businesses and personal wallets. Due to be applied by the end of the year, TFR applies to transactions between cryptocurrency businesses and personal wallets. For example, with transactions, TFR requires CASPs to store certain PII so it can be cross matched to verify information on the originator of the transferred funds and the beneficiary of the transfer. The consortium took on the challenge of how this information can be transferred on and off chain. These solutions not only address privacy concerns, KYC and interoperability but will enhance trust in a relatively new technology ecosystem.</p>



<p>Sebastian: One key objective with this project is to design and implement a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/"> KYC solution</a> that can be used when issuing credentials that are stored as SoulBound Tokens (SBTs) on a blockchain. Technically speaking, the consortium is using Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. Having said that, the SBTs must also be compliant with GDPR regulations, so the SBTs contain anonymous identifiers instead of PII  in clear text. If there is a need for an authority to verify the user’s identity, this can be done by requesting the initial KYC user information from walt.id in conjunction with IDnow.</p>



 What has the consortium been working on since February? Do you have any updates? 



<p>Sebastian: The consortium has spent the past four months testing the solution and refining the implementation with scalability for production purposes in mind. Long term archiving and retrieval of identity documents is one such topic. We have also presented and demonstrated the solution to several stakeholders, with very positive feedback.</p>



 
   
     
                     Preparing for the known: Operating in a world of crypto regulation. 
                      Download to discover how crypto exchanges can prepare for the brave new world of crypto regulation.&nbsp;  
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/whitepaper-crypto-regulation-uk/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
	     
 


 Now onto the good news. The consortium’s Web3 Identification Solution (which will enable KYC and identity verification in the Web3 environment), has been selected to take part in the European Blockchain Sandbox. What is it and why is it important? 



<p>Rayissa: Let me share a little about the European Blockchain Sandbox initiative since we have already covered a little about the consortium’s aims and activities above. The European Commission provides various opportunities to introduce new solutions that meet European regulatory requirements, such as data sharing in the TFR. This European Blockchain Sandbox initiative is geared so that new use cases that involve DLT can be developed and tested. This Blockchain initiative began in 2023 and will continue until 2026.</p>



<p>Sebastian: We are proud and happy that our consortium has been selected to participate in the Sandbox. This is a way for IDnow to demonstrate blockchain-based solutions to EU legislators, and pinpoint how they can meet the relevant EU regulations for cryptocurrencies. In particular, the IOTA solution is targeted to comply with the upcoming TFR regulation and we are keen on proving how the product can meet those requirements.</p>



 Why is cross-collaboration so important for such a project? 



<p>Rayissa: The European Commission recognizes the need for collaboration and cooperation between public and private sectors. Part of the regulatory framework is to set requirements that address interoperability, innovation, security and user accessibility. Collaboration is key to enabling this set of requirements and we have many legal experts and technology-savvy developers guiding our project to build something new. IDnow has been at the forefront of good management, regulatory compliance and smart growth since we began and collaboration is a big part of our success.</p>



<p>Sebastian: In addition to the cross-collaboration with the EU Commission, we are also very proud of working with the IOTA-founded consortium. All parties contribute with cutting edge technologies: </p>



  IOTA provides the underlying network based on the IOTA Smart Contract Chain<br>  HAVN Network integrates hybrid blockchain technologies<br>  IDnow delivers the ID verification, prior to the tokenization into a SBT<br>  walt.id has developed the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs<br>  Bloom provides the digital wallet for storing and presenting the SBTs  



 How will our existing and future crypto clients, who use our solutions to onboard customers and process transactions, be able to benefit from the research and development that is going into the Web3 Identification Solution? 



<p>Rayissa: From a compliance perspective, CASPs will be able to use this solution to comply with national and European KYC and TFR requirements to share personal data between the originator and beneficiary of a specific transaction. This will enable trust in the crypto ecosystem and beyond in Web3 and use cases. There may not be a regulatory framework with set requirements for Web3 or Web4 applications, but trust brings growth and what a great opportunity for these environments to become more mainstream.</p>



<p>Sebastian: The solution developed by the IOTA solution has the potential to go beyond the realm of cryptocurrency transactions, which is the current scope of the project. The SBTs that are issued could also be used for digital identities in the Web3 metaverse, for example for identifying avatars purchasing NFTs such as digital paintings.</p>



 Will the Web3 Identification Solution be commercially available in the future? If so, which companies and industries will the product appeal to? 



<p>Rayissa: Yes, certainly that is a goal. We are already in discussions with our consortium members and external CASPs and companies specialized in IOT services.</p>



<p>Sebastian: The term Web3 was initially coined in 2014 by the Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood when he created the vision of a “decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain.” So yes, the Web3 Identification Solution can be used by all industries that have a need for digital identification. In addition to authentication for CASPs, totally different verticals such as the gaming industry could benefit from Web3 identification. Only the imagination sets the limits.</p>

Participants examined a dataset encompassing repositories, commits, and historical price movements for tokens from Ocean Protocol, Bittensor, Fetch.AI, Numerai, and SingularityNET.</p><p>Participants analyzed correlations between developer engagement and token price fluctuations to determine if developer activity indicates project success. They focused on commit frequency and repository creation metrics, reflecting market dynamics and influencing investor decisions.</p><p>Through data processing, temporal analysis, and advanced statistical methods, participants uncovered patterns that reveal the interplay between development efforts and financial performance. This challenge highlighted participants’ analytical skills and provided insights into how developer activities impact market perceptions and financial metrics within the crypto&nbsp;space.</p> Podium and Top 10 Submissions <p>The top submissions for this challenge were truly impressive. Participants showcased remarkable abilities in utilizing data to explore the relationship between developer activity and token prices. Each participant provided valuable insights through detailed analysis and statistical modeling. Let’s look at the top ten submissions and explore the top three that stood out due to their comprehensive analytics and insightful conclusions.</p>Top 10 submissions for the GitHub Developer Dynamics challenge 1st Place:&nbsp;Anamaria <p>Anamaria’s <a href="https://arweave.net/LOYGCsF3I3R-39MtgXXcPav5yABXADnlClxA4YK8qXU">submission</a> analyzed the correlation between GitHub commits and token price movements using a dataset of over 20,000 commits. She found that a 10% increase in commits leads to an average of 2.5% increase in token price. Her analysis detailed how consistent development activity can positively influence market perceptions and token&nbsp;value.</p><p>Anamaria’s study revealed that the frequency of commits significantly impacts token stability during high volatility periods. She discovered that increased commit activity during these times reduces price swings by 15%. By examining the temporal patterns of commit frequency, Anamaria demonstrated how developer engagement can stabilize the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Her findings indicate a strong relationship between developer activity and market performance, suggesting that active project development can enhance investor confidence. This insight provides valuable information for project managers and investors in the crypto space. Anamaria’s work underscores the importance of continuous and visible development efforts in maintaining and growing token&nbsp;value.</p> 2nd Place:&nbsp;Ahan <p>Ahan’s <a href="https://arweave.net/sxOWXJrRRbaNhXLZAblAMW-YYKGONQDw5uvpx20INCI">submission</a> leveraged a comprehensive dataset to build predictive models analyzing the correlation between developer activity and token price movements. He focused on projects like Ocean Protocol and Fetch.AI, revealing a long-term positive correlation of 0.26 and 0.38 between cumulative commits and token prices. His analysis highlighted that a 25% increase in token prices often coincided with periods of heightened developer activity.</p><p>Ahan’s model achieved an accuracy rate of 87%, showcasing the predictive strength of his approach. He employed advanced statistical techniques to parse the data, identifying key trends and patterns. His work demonstrated that developer activity, measured through metrics like cumulative commits, can be a reliable indicator of token price movements, especially over longer time&nbsp;frames.</p><p>His findings underscore the potential of using developer activity as a predictor of market performance. Ahan’s insights provide valuable guidance for investors and project managers looking to gauge cryptocurrency projects’ health and future potential. By linking development efforts directly to market outcomes, his work offers a practical tool for strategic planning and investment decision-making in&nbsp;crypto.</p> 3rd Place:&nbsp;Malihe <p>Malihe’s <a href="https://arweave.net/ENHnlab52IN8wMkF5ho-3dDj4mK8yO99vhF9icxiyrs">submission</a> focused on the impact of developer engagement on token prices, analyzing a dataset covering multiple crypto projects. She identified that projects with sustained developer activity, such as SingularityNET, showed a long-term correlation of 0.40 between commits and token prices. Her analysis indicated that for every 100 additional commits per month, there was a predicted 3% increase in token&nbsp;price.</p><p>Malihe’s model demonstrated the importance of continuous development efforts in maintaining token value. She highlighted that consistent commitment activity is crucial for signaling project vitality to investors. Her study also emphasized that projects with active development teams tend to perform better in the market, reflecting a direct link between developer efforts and financial success.</p><p>Her findings provide valuable insights for project managers and investors in the crypto space. Malihe’s work suggests monitoring developer activity can offer predictive insights into token performance. By establishing a clear connection between development activity and market outcomes, her analysis supports the strategic importance of fostering active and engaged development communities within crypto projects.</p> Interesting Facts <p>Developer Activity Boosts Token&nbsp;Prices</p><p>Analyzing data showed that a 10% spike in GitHub commits can increase token prices by 2.5% on average. This demonstrates how crucial active development is in boosting market confidence and&nbsp;value.</p><p>Stability Through Active Development</p><p>During periods of high market volatility, frequent commits can reduce price swings by 15%. This finding suggests that active and ongoing development can help stabilize token prices even in turbulent times.</p><p>Engagement Correlates with Price&nbsp;Surges</p><p>Predictive models revealed a long-term positive correlation of 0.26 for Ocean Protocol and 0.38 for Fetch.AI between cumulative commits and token prices. Heightened developer activity often aligns with a notable 25% increase in token prices, showing the market’s positive response to active project engagement.</p><p>High Accuracy in Predicting Market&nbsp;Trends</p><p>The predictive model achieved an impressive 87% accuracy rate, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for forecasting token price movements based on developer activity. This level of accuracy provides valuable insights for investors.</p><p>Consistent Development Yields Long-Term Gains</p><p>Continuous development efforts pay off, as shown by a 3% increase in token prices for every additional 100 commits per month.

  Decentralized identity is gaining traction globally through diverse implementations and aligns with SpruceID's mission to empower users with control over their data.

<p>Decentralized identity is rapidly gaining momentum as an industry concept, with a growing number of live implementations. Its early roots were in pioneering projects like <a href="https://whitepaper.uport.me/uPort_whitepaper_DRAFT20170221.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">uPort</a>, appearances at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IIW</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-decentralized-id-blockchain/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Microsoft’s subsequent bet</a>, and its emergence as a hot topic at industry conferences like Identiverse and EIC. We see it in practice globally in the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">California DMV Wallet</a>, the European Union Digital Identity initiative, and even digital pioneers like <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/bhutans-national-digital-id-showcased-as-ssi-model-for-others?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Bhutan</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>It’s easy to get confused because “decentralization” has become a buzzword for many new technologies. While its source of decentralization doesn’t need to come from blockchains or cryptocurrencies, decentralized identity is ultimately aligned with the objective of returning control to end users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At SpruceID, we think about decentralized identity as systems built using the <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">issuer-holder-verifier model</a>, which achieves decentralization when open protocols are used such that any party can assume the role(s) of the issuer, holder, or verifier. These roles come with a clean separation of concerns that mitigate undesirable side effects, such as issuer “phone home” during holder usage. These systems can support either functional (“attributes”) or foundational identity. So, it’s decentralized in that we’re not forcing all digital identity-related interactions through one central control point; instead, peer-to-peer interactions are the default.</p><p>Starting with this definition, it’s easier to evaluate technical standards based on their core ability to support these interoperable capabilities, rather than indexing on affiliation with certain brands or use cases. For example, all the digital credential technologies mentioned in the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EU ARF</a>, including W3C Verifiable Credentials, SD-JWTs, and ISO/IEC 18013-5 mobile driver’s license (mDL), can fit this definition of supporting decentralized identity depending on the implementation details. These can all also violate the definition depending on implementation details.</p><p>It’s worth noting that identity and credentialing systems are already more decentralized than you might realize. Even in the United States, DMVs do not have a monopoly on all forms of identification: other documents, such as passports or permanent residency cards, are widely accepted. Even utility bills and bank statements often play a role in verifying identity.&nbsp;</p><p>If we start with a decentralized landscape, a decentralized approach to the technology seems to make the most sense. Open digital standards for sharing this already broad plethora of credentials largely amount to bringing existing credentials together under one umbrella and opening the playing field for other issuers, whom verifiers can choose to trust or not, on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Already, verifiable digital credentials issued across state and federal bodies fall under different administrations, many of which don’t see eye-to-eye, even within the same agency. This doesn’t even scratch the surface of the complexities within the private sector—and an open system is the best way to accommodate that complexity.&nbsp;</p><p>Here at SpruceID, we believe the use of decentralized identity, under this definition, furthers our mission to let users control their data across the web (and beyond). We will continue to evaluate technologies and technical standards to ensure alignment with these capabilities and our organization’s values.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about how we are working to build decentralized identity, visit our <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn?ref=blog.spruceid.com">knowledge base</a>.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Stablecoins — Inherently, Unfixably, Problematic  …And Why Gold on the Blockchain Makes Them&nbsp;Obsolete <p><a href="https://www.mattereum.com?utm_source=Medium+Stablecoin&amp;utm_medium=article">Mattereum’s</a> partnership with <a href="https://sempsajp.com/">Sempsa JP</a>, one of the world’s oldest and most respected producers and distributors of precious metals, is enabling us to <a href="https://x.com/i/spaces/1vAxRvwLmRVxl">tokenize gold</a> through our German regulated exchange partner <a href="https://mattereum.com/2023/07/23/announcing-swarm-x-mattereum-partnership/">Swarm</a> in quantity, giving investors immutable proof of ownership and provenance so that every token has a traceable, legally enforceable, connection to a specific gold bar in a named vault and warranties relating to its provenance and other qualities, legally valid in 170 countries worldwide. To make it even easier to put gold, or any other high value asset on chain, the Mattereum group, through its German subsidiary Mattereum GmbH has a discount token, <a href="https://mattereum.de/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=marsmatr">MATR*</a>, on sale through Swarm. This gives anyone onboarding assets a discount of up to 50% on their onboarding fees, which is significant when you are talking about gold&nbsp;bars.</p><p>With other forms of tokenized gold, the value of the token is backed by gold that remains in the ownership of the token issuer, and you just have to trust that it’s there. With Sempsa gold as an NFT, backed by a Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP), the token buyer indisputably owns the gold to which the token is bound, and their claim to it is enforceable by international law in over<a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/english"> 170 jurisdictions</a>. This combines the solidity and value of owning a physical gold bar with the convenience, speed and flexibility of selling NFTs. No more needing to have bars lugged from the seller’s vault to the purchaser’s vault, no more complex paperwork, no more hassle. This is new, this is revolutionary, and it has the potential to kill stablecoins stone&nbsp;dead.</p><blockquote>It has the potential to kill stablecoins stone&nbsp;dead</blockquote><p>How so?</p><p>Stablecoins exist because they claim to offer the convenience of being blockchain tokens, but with the kind of stability that Bitcoin can’t provide, through being pegged to a currency, usually the US dollar, so that the stablecoin always has a set dollar value that doesn’t fluctuate — pegging (an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegging_(sexual_practice)">unfortunate term</a> [nsfw!], I know, but given the nature of stablecoins, maybe not inappropriate). As a result, they are meant to act as stable repositories of value against Bitcoin’s wildly fluctuating price. It is not uncommon for speculators who have reaped vast profit from Bitcoin fluctuations to cash out and put the earnings into stablecoin to hold onto the profits instead of trading it in for fiat and putting it in a&nbsp;bank.</p><p>So why is tokenized gold better? Why does it make stablecoins dead men walking? Well, for a start, stablecoins are not stable. We’ve already seen that can happen when stablecoins go wrong and depeg, and it was ugly. When TerraUSD and LUNA did it in 2022, it wiped out billions of dollars in value, and there were <a href="https://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2023/moody_launches_new_digital_asset_monitor_to_track_risk">more than 600 fiat-backed stablecoin depegs </a>in 2023 alone. Not so&nbsp;stable.</p><blockquote>There were <a href="https://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2023/moody_launches_new_digital_asset_monitor_to_track_risk">more than 600 fiat-backed stablecoin depegs </a>in 2023&nbsp;alone</blockquote><p>Tokenized gold done through <a href="https://www.mattereum.com?utm_source=Medium+Stablecoin&amp;utm_medium=article">Mattereum</a> so that it legally bonds the token to a named gold bar — one bar, one token — can’t depeg, it creates a StableNFT that is massively more solid than any stablecoins. Faced with this innovation, stablecoins are already dead, they just haven’t realized it&nbsp;yet.</p><p>Let’s dig into that a bit more. So how do you make a stablecoin? Somebody gives you $1 You put the dollar in the bank. They ask for the dollar back, you take the dollar out. Okay, great. That’s fine. How’d you make a living? Well, option one is the bank pays interest, which means it’s lending that money out. And you hoped the bank is stable and doesn’t lend the money to the wrong people. Maybe that’s fine. Maybe it’s not. Option two is to charge transaction fees like Mattereum does on the gold. You give us the gold. We charge a fee. That means that we’re not doing anything stupid with gold. In the meantime, we just hold on to it, we don’t move it, and that costs us some money and we charge that to you. Option three is you give me that dollar and I go and put it into the lowest risk legitimate investment instrument — one of these index funds type things. Now the thing that I told you is worth $1 is correlated to the stock market and if the stock market crashes we’re both toast, but if the stock market booms you get your dollar back and I get to keep all the upside. Then you imagine option three, but with shitcoins, and that’s a stablecoin, and the very, very large providers of stablecoins have problems, because that model is inherently problematic, inherently unfixably problematic; Tether has horrible, horrible lockbox issues. Nobody really knows what’s going on in there. Then USDC had a bunch of money in Silicon Valley Bank. If Silicon Valley Bank had not been bailed out by the US government, they might have had really serious problems — it turns out that they had about<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/13/usdc-stablecoin-regains-dollar-peg-after-silicon-valley-bank-induced-chaos/"> 8% of their reserves</a> in that single financial institution, but no one owning USDC knew that until the bank hit trouble. So stablecoins are highly opaque. They’ve proven that they have interdependence with the global financial system and so are inherently volatile. Plus, there may or may not be issues of mismanagement that can be discovered at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>So, OK, you could say, that’s why we have central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). They are stablecoins, but unlike the privately issued stablecoins I’ve been talking about above, they are issued by a central bank so are no more likely to depeg than the money in your pocket (I am assuming some of you still use actual cash there). Well, yes, but these still have problems that make gold bound stable NFTs a better option. Like the dollar or pound, or whatever currency you choose, any CBDC linked to those is going to suffer the same problems with inflation that steadily erodes their value, at 2–3% inflation a year, which is less than recent rates, it doesn’t take long for a CBDC to have a fraction of the buying power it once did. Not so with gold, gold value, as I said, is steadily going up, and a stable NFT for a gold bar is going to do the same, so it’s still better than a CBDC stablecoin.</p><p>The core problem with privately issued stablecoins is a lack of transparency because you cannot see exactly what your stablecoin is backed by — that is proprietary information to these guys. But this proprietary information is what you would need to have full insight into a stablecoin and be able to do a full analysis and be sure what you were getting for your dollar. It’s not like it’s a small pool of these things — there’s $140 billion in them. What I’m suggesting is that the first criteria that you want for a stable instrument is staggering, bright side of the moon, black and white photography levels of clarity. You want a zero atmosphere full daylight shot of where the underlying asset is. With an on chain gold StableNFT backed by a MAP, that’s what you get. It’s this chunk of solid gold; it’s got this number; it’s in this building here. You own&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>You cannot see exactly what your stablecoin is backed by — that is proprietary information to these&nbsp;guys</blockquote><p>In theory, that could be a dollar in a central reserve bank account instead. You can have an account with the US Federal Reserve Bank — you could just say there’s a million dollars in the Fed and million tokens one to one, here’s your deal. You could have a situation where you have an absolutely transparent portfolio. We can say we own a single thing and it is backed with a BlackRock index fund and for every dollar you give us we buy BlackRock index fund; here’s an audit report that says this is exactly what we own. We own 151,000 shares and our current market value x that is more than your reserve. Have a nice day. You could use gold and then it would be dollar price, gold, you give us $1 — we buy gold, when we can show you that there is enough money in the portfolio. We like the gold option, anything even remotely tied to dollars loses value due to inflation. Gold doesn’t — in 1929, ten gold bars would buy the average house, and today, ten gold bars will still buy you the average&nbsp;house.</p><blockquote>Anything even remotely tied to dollars loses value due to inflation. Gold&nbsp;doesn’t</blockquote><p>There’s no reason that you couldn’t use any single appreciating asset in a very simplistic way. If your asset value goes up, your investment goes up, and if it goes down, so does your investment. What you wouldn’t get with that is any of the fancy schmancy obfuscated hedge fund stuff, where if that asset went down, you are meant to have something else in the portfolio that would go up. Everything balances and you aren’t supposed to lose money, and, hopefully, you gain some. But as soon as we go down that path, we wind up a highly opaque hedge fund that sells portfolios, which are being used to theoretically secure value in an asset that is not supposed to go up and down. So basically, the suggestion here is that you either pick one thing and your stable coin goes up and down to that one thing, or you pick a basket of things and they’re connected by super complicated maths and you have to pray that that thing is stable, and that’s what the grown ups are supposed to do. However, those grown ups are called hedge fund operators. And hedge funds implode all the time. So if you’re going to pick one thing and anchor to that thing, it should either be something like $1 in a Federal Reserve Bank Account, or it could be an index fund object, or it could be something like US Treasury bonds, or it could be a gold brick, but these are the kinds of assets which have extraordinary ease of audit. And then at that point, you either have a token attached to a very large very non-transparent bucket of things or you have a token which is directly attached to a thing which is extremely audited. These are your two&nbsp;choices.</p><p><a href="https://www.mattereum.com?utm_source=Medium+Stablecoin&amp;utm_medium=article">Mattereum </a>has made it easy to have a token directly attached to an asset which is extremely audited. The MAP enables a firm legal binding between the asset and the token, so that ownership is solid and provable. The asset we believe is the absolute best to bind to is gold, so that is what we have done, and we are looking to grow the gold ecosystem, we’re building to increase opportunities for token buyers to own something that really is stable and acts as a repository of value. Also, Gold is steadily going up in value, dollars are getting eaten by inflation, even without all the underlying horrors lurking in stablecoins. The whole sector is just awaiting a deeply horrible, value-incinerating implosion, it’s only a matter of time before something blows away the whole house of cards and reveals the ‘stable’ in stablecoin to be wishful thinking. With the alternative that Mattereum’s gold-bound StableNFTs offer, why take that risk?

				  Your health data is important. You should be aware of how it is stored, shared, and who has access to it. This information is even more critical for athletes, as their health data is in demand and can cost them opportunities and potentially millions of dollars.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio recently hosted an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQsWQPrf1o">in-depth discussion on athlete health data</a> featuring <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/honor-data-rights-management/">HONOR Data Rights Management</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristyagale/">Kristy Gale</a> that includes a great breakdown and thorough examination of this topic. We highly encourage you to give it a watch or a listen if you have time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Problem:</p>
<p>Athletes, particularly student athletes, are the source of a lot of data. Health, biometric, and even tracking data are all collected by teams, medical services, and wearable devices that the athletes use to monitor their workouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this data is gathered, used, and often shared without the athlete’s consent. Recruiters can get their hands on a surprising amount of data that you would think would be private, for example, how many times a player has sprained their ankle or visited the onsite medical team. They do this through legal loopholes or by going directly to the healthcare provider without the athlete’s knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple truth is that gaps in current laws and business practices leave sensitive health data open for third parties to access. While athletes feel the effects the most, everyone should be able to know who can access their data. We need a technical solution that puts control of the data back into the hands of athletes and everyday people.</p>
<p>How Verifiable Credentials can help:</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable credentials</a> are a technology that allows for a packet of information to be created using a decentralized ledger and securely stored on an end user’s mobile device. By storing the information in this way, you can be sure that the data is only shared with whoever the end user chooses, and by creating the package in this decentralized manner, you can be sure that the end user does not have the ability to change the information inside.</p>
<p>When it comes to athlete health data, all of the data they are creating, including statistics, physiological performance, evaluations, biometric data, tracking data, and more, can all be issued to the athlete as a tamper-proof credential. This accomplishes a few things:</p>
<p>1. It removes liability from teams, colleges, medical providers, and anyone who used to store this data.</p>
<p>2. It gives the athlete complete control over the information. It can still be shared with any party that needs to see it, but now they need to ask the data owner, who can choose to share all or just specific parts of the data.</p>
<p>3. All the data is now in one convenient place, no need to track down all the sources of the information when it is requested.</p>
<p>4. The data can be assumed to be as trusted as the source. The user doesn’t need to waste time double checking or verifying with the issuing party because any changes to the data would be visible on the decentralized ledger and “break” the credential.</p>
<p>5. The data can be easily shared with trusted partners, such as an agent for an athlete, who can share it on the athlete’s behalf if necessary.</p>
<p>By providing information in this new, technical way, we give control over their data back to the athletes. Not only do they have legal recourse should they find out their data has been misused, but they can also stop their data from being wrongfully shared at the point of request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find this topic interesting and would like to learn more about how athlete data is currently collected, held, and shared, the recent <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=bqQsWQPrf1o">Indicio Meetup</a> on this subject is a great place to start.</p>

 What is Behavioral Biometrics? 



<p>Behavioral biometrics is the study and analysis of an individual’s unique behavioral patterns to authenticate their identity and detect anomalies. Unlike traditional biometric methods such as fingerprints or facial recognition, behavioral biometrics examines how a person interacts with devices. This includes their typing rhythm, mouse movements, touchscreen behavior, gait, and other subtle actions. By continuously monitoring and comparing current behavior to historical patterns, behavioral biometrics can identify whether the person interacting with a system is who they claim to be, providing a robust and passive security measure against various cyber threats.</p>

<p>It’s been about five years since the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) laid down its requirements on virtual assets. Since then, the implementation of these rules by countries has increased significantly. Today, we’ll look at all that has gone down in the realm of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule#:~:text=The%20FATF%20proposed%20that%20the,Asset%20Service%20Providers%20(VASPs).">Crypto Travel Rule</a> this year, so&nbsp;far.</p><p>First, a bit of&nbsp;history.</p><p>In 2019, the FATF expanded its recommendations or Travel Rule to cover crypto and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).</p><p>Updated in 2021, the Crypto Travel Rule applies to crypto exchanges, brokers, and custodians that handle crypto transactions. It mandates that these businesses share transaction details, including sender and receiver information, above a certain threshold.</p><p>In February, at a FATF plenary, the group agreed to publish a summary of the steps jurisdictions have taken to regulate&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>Then, after a year-long process of collecting and evaluating information, late in March this year, the FATF released a report detailing <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/almost-70-of-all-fatf-assessed-countries-have-implemented-the-crypto-travel-rule">the implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule across 58 jurisdictions</a>.</p><p>These jurisdictions involved those who are official members of FATF, host VASPs with greater than 0.25% of global virtual asset trading volume, and have 1 million or more active users. These jurisdictions combined account for a vast majority (97%) of global crypto activity.</p><p>Based on the self-reported survey, the results showed that all 38 assessed members and 20 other jurisdictions have either completed or begun a virtual asset risk assessment.</p>  91% of them have either passed a law or are in the process of doing so to establish licensing or registration requirements and AML/CTF obligations for crypto businesses.  88% of the jurisdictions had already done or started administrative inspections  84% had authorized the Travel&nbsp;Rule  79% had registered VASPs  <p>According to the report, Saudi Arabia, China, and Egypt have explicitly prohibited the use of crypto and&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Gradual Alignment with International Standards <p>For several years, the FATF has urged jurisdictions to implement its recommendations. Although not mandatory, failure to adopt them may result in being placed on the organization’s watchlist.</p><p>The FATF president stated that the agency does not require jurisdictions to pass laws for successful recommendation implementation; notifications from authorities could&nbsp;suffice.</p><p>So, against this backdrop, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-guide-for-south-africa">the South African Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) issued a draft directive in May</a>. As per the draft, VASPs are required to implement the FATF Travel&nbsp;Tule.</p><p>The directive provides obligations of crypto transfer originators and defines the policies and procedures, which also need to be incorporated into exchanges’ risk management and compliance programs, to be followed when dealing with unhosted wallets. Those who fail to comply will be “subject to an administrative sanction.”</p><p>The same month, the Turkish ruling party submitted a draft crypto bill to the parliament that focuses on licensing and registration for VASPs and aligns with international standards.</p><p>Back in 2021, Turkey was put on the FATF’s “gray list” due to its failure to implement AML measures in the banking industry. As such, it has taken steps to address the organization’s concerns and align with its standards.</p><p>The bill aims to comprehensively govern the crypto market.

 A Deep Dive to ZKPs and Decentralized Technology with Extrimian 



<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital identity management, privacy and security are paramount. <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp/" title="">Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</a> stand out as a revolutionary technology, enabling the verification of claims without revealing underlying data. Extrimian is at the forefront, integrating ZKPs into decentralized digital identity systems to offer unmatched security and privacy.</p>



 Understanding Zero Knowledge Proofs 



<p>Zero Knowledge Proofs are a form of cryptographic protocol that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This technology is particularly potent for privacy-preserving digital interactions.</p>



 Key Concepts of ZKP: 



 
 Completeness: If the statement is true, an honest verifier will be convinced by an honest prover. 



 Soundness: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability. 



 Zero-knowledge: If the statement is true, no verifier learns anything other than the fact that the statement is true. 
 



 Extrimian’s Application of ZKPs in Digital Identities 



<p>Extrimian harnesses the power of ZKPs to enhance the security and privacy of digital identities. By using ZKPs, Extrimian allows users to authenticate and share their credentials without exposing any sensitive personal information.</p>



 Example of ZKP in Action: 



 <code>const { zkSnark, generateProof, verifyProof } = require('extrimian-zkp-toolkit');

// Setup: A simple example where a user proves they are over 18 without revealing their age.
const { proof, publicSignals } = generateProof({
    age: 21,
    lowerBound: 18
});

// Verification: The verifier checks the proof without ever knowing the user's exact age.
const isValid = verifyDetails({
    proof,
    publicSignals
});

console.log(isValid);  // Output: true</code> 



 



<p>This simple code snippet demonstrates how a user can prove they meet the age requirement without revealing their exact age, using Extrimian’s ZKP toolkit.</p>



 Practical Use Cases of ZKP in Decentralized Digital Identity 



<p>ZKPs empower several practical applications in decentralized identity systems:</p>



 
 Privacy-Enhanced Authentication: Users can authenticate themselves to services without revealing any unnecessary personal information, thus enhancing privacy. 



 Credential Verification: Verify the authenticity of credentials without exposing the underlying data, useful in scenarios like employment verification or accessing restricted services. 



 Fraud Prevention: Secure systems against fraudulent claims and transactions by enabling entities to prove the legitimacy of their actions without revealing sensitive data. 
 



 Extrimian’s Integration and Benefits 



<p>At Extrimian, we integrate ZKPs within our digital identity solutions to provide:</p>



 
 Enhanced Privacy: Users have complete control over their personal information. 



 Increased Trust: Entities can trust the verification process without accessing private data. 



 Scalability: ZKPs allow for complex operations to be conducted without a significant increase in transaction costs or delays.

<p>Last week, SpruceID attended the European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) in Berlin, an event that brings together industry leaders, innovators, and experts to discuss and explore the latest advancements in digital identity and cloud security.</p><p>This year, SpruceID CEO Wayne Chang was among the panelists contributing to three in-depth discussions on the evolving landscape of decentralized identity. These panels provided a comprehensive overview of how decentralized identity can help mitigate modern threats and enhance trust in digital ecosystems in today’s world.</p> Panel: Building Trust in AI through Decentralized Identity Photo courtesy of the Decentralized Identity Foundation<p>One of our most anticipated sessions was the panel "Building Trust in AI through Decentralized Identity." This session focused on the pressing issues posed by AI technologies and brought together Wayne Chang, Kim Hamilton Duffy from the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), and Linda Jeng, founder of Digital Self Labs.</p><p>In this talk, Wayne highlighted the increasing risks of traditional identification methods in the face of sophisticated AI technologies. He pointed out, “Until now, we’ve been able to get by holding a driver's license up to a webcam, but with new AI tech, you can fool these systems — this is already showing up at the edges. ” He emphasized the rise in phishing attacks utilizing AI-generated voices that can convincingly mimic trusted individuals, making it easier for scammers to deceive victims.</p><p>The panelists discussed how decentralized identity could offer solutions to these emerging challenges. Wayne explained, “We need to add authenticity to communication. We don’t want to present a strong ID every time we want to use a chat app, so it makes sense to embed decentralized identity into comms channels to prove I’m real.” Decentralized identity is not only about identity but also about establishing data governance and creating chains of trust to mitigate risks from synthetic data. This approach empowers individuals with greater control over their data.</p><p>They touched on the promising developments in automated compliance with data regulations and the potential for expanding trust to content authenticity. They emphasized the need for ongoing education and the role of user demand in driving the adoption of decentralized identity technologies. In Linda Jeng’s words, “We need to spend time educating policymakers and the public, but in the end, it comes down to end-user demand for solutions.”</p><p>Read more about the discussions that took place during this panel in the blog post published by the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/building-trust-in-ai-through-decentralized-identity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.</p> Panel: Expert/Digital Wallet &amp; Verifiers Q&amp;A Photo courtesy of the Decentralized Identity Foundation<p>In the Expert/Digital Wallet &amp; Verifiers Q&amp;A session, Anil John, Technical Director of the DHS S&amp;T Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, introduced the newest cohort members of SVIP, including SpruceID. Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO, engaged in a Q&amp;A with digital wallet solution providers and industry experts from other SVIP cohort members, including Hushmesh, Procivis AG, Ubiqu, Netis, and Credence ID. The discussion focused on the practical aspects of integrating digital identity into digital wallets and verifiable credential systems. It covered a range of topics, including the challenges and opportunities in implementing decentralized identity, the role of verifiers in ensuring trust and security, and the potential for digital wallets to enhance user privacy and data control.&nbsp;</p><p>Panelists emphasized the importance of interoperability and user-centered design in developing digital wallet solutions, which are crucial for securely and conveniently managing digital identities and credentials.</p> Panel: Decentralized Identity in Production <p>Our final panel, "Decentralized Identity in Production," explored the practical applications of verifiable credentials and the integration of decentralized identity into production environments.&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne, along with panelists from Condatis, Adobe, Spherity, and Accenture, shared valuable insights and experiences on the business case for decentralized identity, highlighting key success factors and lessons learned from recent projects and discussing how verifiable credentials have been effectively integrated into workforce certifications, supply chain documentation, and educational qualifications, demonstrating enhanced trust achieved through decentralized identity. </p><p>The panelists emphasized key success factors in project learnings, product roadmaps, and the future direction of decentralized identity, and they encouraged attendees to explore practical applications for decentralized identity technologies within their organizations.</p> Continuing the Conversations on Decentralized Identity <p>We're grateful to have been invited to speak on several panels alongside other experts in the field at this year's event. </p><p>SpruceID is excited to be at the forefront of these important discussions and committed to advancing the development and adoption of decentralized identity solutions. We look forward to continuing these discussions and working with partners and stakeholders from EIC!</p><p>Check out our website to learn more about how SpruceID uses decentralized identity to build a more secure and trustworthy digital future.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Healthcare organizations face unique challenges, including security concerns, complex regulatory requirements, and the necessity to provide seamless user experiences for consumers, employees, and partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unified Identity and Access Management (IAM) has emerged as a critical solution to these issues. A unified IAM strategy integrates various identity and access management functions, such as identity verification, identity governance and administration (IGA), identity management (IDM), access management (AM), identity orchestration, and fraud and risk solutions into a single platform. As a result, unified IAM streamlines identity processes across multiple healthcare IT systems, applications, and environments. </p>

				  When it comes to phishing, financial institutions and their customers are targeted <a href="https://www.stationx.net/phishing-statistics/">more often than others</a>. Digital credentials solve this problem and provide customers with a better user experience when logging into their bank accounts.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Phishing is where someone pretends to be from an organization you know and requests information from you that allows them to steal your login data. This might be in the form of an email requesting that you reset your password, a text message, or even a phone call.</p>
<p>Phishing is on the rise because it works: <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/articles/s/the-history-of-phishing/">22% of data breaches</a> can be attributed to phishing.</p>
<p>Phishing in finance</p>
<p>In finance, phishing often involves someone pretending to be a customer trying to retrieve their account details by contacting their bank. Bank call centers receive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/business/voice-deepfakes-bank-scams.html">thousands of deepfake calls per year</a>, wasting time and resources, and requiring vigilance on the part of the employee to spot the scams and stop the call. As deepfake technology becomes more dynamic this will be much harder for a human to do.</p>
<p>The other common vector for phishing attacks is that of a scammer pretending to be a bank. Financial institutions are the <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/list/4-things-bankers-need-to-know-about-phishing">most impersonated organizations</a> by scammers. These attacks often come via an email, text, or even a call from the bank saying that there is something wrong with the customer’s account and they need to log in immediately. Unfortunately, the link provided by the scammer will steal the personal account information of the customer when they try to use it.</p>
<p>Stop phishing with verifiable credentials and decentralized identity</p>
<p>The reason phishing works is because there is currently not a good way for identifying who people claim to be online. Passwords and logins are prone to being lost, stolen, or copied, and even assuming they are secure, they are only effective in one direction — when the customer is trying to reach out to the bank. If a bank, or someone pretending to be the bank, tries to reach out to the customer, due diligence is required on the customer’s part to make sure the message is authentic.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity solves this problem. A bank can be absolutely certain that an account holder really is an account holder, and an account holder can be absolutely certain that they are interacting with their bank —&nbsp;and this mutually assured authentication is proven instantaneously by cryptography, and occurs before any information is shared.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>A bank customer’s digital wallet software is able to create a secure communications channel directly with their bank. The customer’s wallet creates a decentralized identifier (a DID) and uses this DID to connect to their bank’s DID. DIDs enable public key cryptography.</p>
<p>Each party uses the other party’s cryptographic keys to send encrypted messages to each other. Only the bank can decrypt the message sent by the customer because the customer has encrypted a message with the bank’s key; only the customer can decrypt the bank’s message because the bank has used the customer’s key to encrypt its message.</p>
<p>In reality, this is instantaneous. But it means that when a customer uses a DID to connect to their bank and then presents a verifiable credential for their bank account, the bank knows its their customer. It is more effective than adding multi factor authentication because it doesn’t require customers to jump through hoops, allows both parties to verify who they are interacting with, and even enables <a href="https://indicio.tech/passwordless-login-will-soon-be-the-norm-for-bank-accounts-financial-institutions/">passwordless login</a> by default.</p>
<p>To learn more about how this all works you can <a href="https://youtu.be/DE2gFx-msuE">see demonstrations of the technology in action</a>.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that guidance for SAP Identity Management (IDM) customers planning to migrate their identity management scenarios to Microsoft Entra is now available. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-and-sap-collaborate-to-modernize-identity-for-sap/ba-p/4056600">previous post</a>, we discussed SAP ending maintenance for their identity management solution (SAP IDM) by 2030.&nbsp;We've since begun jointly developing documentation to help customers plan a seamless migration to the recommended alternative—Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;For many customers, it may be possible to get started immediately, leveraging the subscriptions that they already own with Microsoft 365 suites. Microsoft 365 enterprise suite licenses include Entra ID P1 features that will be the focus of this first round of guidance.&nbsp;In this post, we’ll also outline additional benefits of Microsoft Entra ID and list some key partners who can help you get started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Continuing collaboration for enterprise security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft and SAP have a long history of collaborating to keep our customers’ organizations productive and secure—an effort especially important now as more companies have adopted hybrid work arrangements, making it possible to work from office and from home. For example, last year we announced how Microsoft Sentinel is helping organizations bring&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/revolutionize-your-sap-security-with-microsoft-sentinel-s-soar/ba-p/3823857">SOAR threat monitoring capabilities to their SAP environments</a>. We continue to deepen our relationship, and now we’re extending support for SAP customers’ digital transformation and cloud adoption goals with a seamless and secure identity management solution in Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing the first set of&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/MigrateFromSAPIDM">guidance to migrate from SAP IDM to Entra ID</a>. SAP customers who are using SAP IDM for cloud and on-premises applications like SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud Identity Services, or Windows Server Active Directory can begin to use Microsoft Entra features such as Conditional Access to enforce Zero Trust access policies, and automatic provisioning that ensures users have the accounts they need for their job role. For SAP IDM customers who want more guidance on advanced IAM integrations, such as with Micosoft Entra ID Governance or external IDs, for example, we’re developing additional in-depth guidance on each of those areas that will be published later this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modernizing your security strategy and moving toward a Zero Trust framework is not an overnight process, so we recommend customers start their journey to adopt cloud services and gain productivity and security benefits.&nbsp;Therefore, we’ve included guidance for migration of the most common scenarios, including:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft and SAP will continue to enhance Microsoft Entra ID and deliver deeper integrations with SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance.&nbsp; As new scenarios become available, we’ll provide ongoing updates to this&nbsp;guidance, incorporating customer and partner feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Modern identity management is a strategic investment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Progressive organizations are switching to cloud-based identity solutions. Older systems, designed for on-site environments, fail to satisfy the demands of the modern cloud-first, mobile, decentralized workforce. Additionally, they can be expensive, complicated, and susceptible to security risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that multifactor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on methods&nbsp;<a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW166lD?culture=en-us&amp;country=us">can reduce password breaches by 99.9%</a>, but the benefits of a cloud-based solution in Microsoft Entra ID extend beyond just a stronger security posture. Optimized operational efficiency allows identity teams to do more impactful work and an improved user experience makes the entire organization less frustrated. By moving to Microsoft Entra ID, the benefits of your strategic investment continue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for SAP and non-SAP apps and systems—both on-premises and cloud&nbsp; 
 Rich set of APIs, SDKs,&nbsp;and connectors for customization&nbsp; 
 Minimized vendor footprint&nbsp; 
 Reduced costs and complexity&nbsp; 
 Help meeting identity-related requirements for GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 
<p>Modernizing identity management is key to boosting organizational security and shielding users and assets from the most common security threats. It’s more than just a cybersecurity measure; it also enhances user experience and operational efficiency. Generative AI, Zero Trust security, decentralized identity, and the flexibility to tailor access policies to exactly match your unique needs and demands offer compelling opportunities to better protect&nbsp;your apps and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Partner network ready to help 
<p>&nbsp;<br>We’ve also been working with a set of key partners to help organizations begin their migrations, including some with long-term experience in Microsoft/SAP environments. </p>

<p>In response to a recent FDS incident, we have deployed a hotfix to our blockchain explorer, Aergo Scan, enhancing its security and transparency. Looking ahead, we are preparing for a comprehensive hard fork scheduled for next month, aimed at introducing broader systemic improvements and new functionalities. This article will outline the recent updates and preview what to expect from the upcoming&nbsp;changes.</p> Updates on Aergo&nbsp;Scan <p>In anticipation of the Aergo V4 hard fork, we have introduced a new feature to Aergo Scan, the Internal Transaction UI (Beta version). This enhancement, inspired by similar features in the Ethereum Explorer, enables users and network participants to track detailed histories related to addresses and transactions effortlessly.</p><p>This is just a glimpse of what the Aergo V4 hard fork will bring, including the full implementation of internal transaction logging to increase transparency across all transactional histories. Additionally, contract sources will be stored and compiled directly on-chain, facilitating easy access and reference.</p> Upcoming Hard Fork to Aergo&nbsp;V4 <p>The Aergo V4 hard fork is focused on several key objectives:</p>  Enhancing Transparency: <br>- We are committed to increasing the Aergo mainnet’s transparency for both developers and users, fostering a more trustful environment.  Adopting a “White-Box” Model: <br>- This new model will enhance the transparency and readability of contracts and transactions, benefiting both current and future applications.<br>- The new data model will prep Aergo for applications on Machine Learning and Small and Large Language Model integration”  <p>The new features for Aergo V4 include the following:</p>  Internal transaction logging:<br>- Provides increased transparency for complex contracts that interact with each other.<br>- Essential for future developments like DAOs and enabling machine learning on the Aergo&nbsp;mainnet.  C<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/issues/149">omposable Transactions</a>:<br>- Explicit atomic transactions without relying on internal transactions<br>- Enhancing transparency and trustless transactions without the need for turing complete contract implementation (“White-box transactions”)  Text-based Contracts:<br>- All Lua contracts on Aergo will be stored as source code (in lieu of bytecode) to make it more human-readable and deterministic<br>- The basis for text-based language model applications as well (same as text-based transactions)  T<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/issues/252">ext-based Transactions (WIP)</a>:<br>- A transaction format that is both human-readable and machine-interpretable, embodying the principles of the <a href="https://webisoft.com/articles/ricardian-contract/">Ricardian Contract</a> <br>- Aims to fully realize Ricardian Contract capabilities<br>- Also serves as a foundation for text-based language model applications<br>- Enables the use of text-based transactions for prompt engineering and data&nbsp;storage  <p>The technical specifications for the new features introduced in the Aergo V4 hard fork are available on <a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/discussions/256">GitHub</a>. More details will be released as we move closer to the implementation of the hard fork.

<p>In a hybrid world that blends on-premises and cloud-based resources, securing access to sensitive data and systems is no longer achieved by defending a perimeter, but through authentication. While authentication technologies have evolved over the past decades from their humble password origins, preventing unauthorized access still hinges on choosing and implementing the right identity-based controls.</p>
<p>This involves navigating a landscape where knowledge-based, possession-based, biometric, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods offer a variety of advantages and limitations. Let’s consider each of the options available to organizations and how to select the right mix of controls to improve their security posture.</p>
 Knowledge-Based Authentication 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA), which encompasses passwords and PINs, is the most traditional form of authentication. Its widespread adoption and user familiarity make it a convenient starting point for many security protocols. However, its susceptibility to social engineering, phishing attacks, and the perennial issue of weak password creation by users necessitate a cautious approach. For environments where ease of use is paramount and risk levels are comparatively low, KBA can serve as a component of a more comprehensive security strategy, particularly when augmented with additional authentication factors.</p>
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is best suited for environments with comparatively low risk levels, where ease of use is paramount and the accessed information is not highly sensitive or critical. It can serve as a supplementary authentication factor in conjunction with other methods, such as biometric or device-based authentication. Examples include accessing non-critical information, utilizing KBA alongside other authentication methods as a first factor, and implementing it in public Wi-Fi hotspots for streamlined user access without compromising security.</p>
 Possession-Based Authentication 
<p>Possession-based authentication methods require users to have a physical object, such as a security token or a mobile device, to gain access. This approach adds a tangible layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access without physical possession of the required object. It’s particularly effective in scenarios where additional security is needed without significantly complicating the user experience, such as in financial transactions or access to high-security areas. However, the risk of loss or theft and the potential cost implications of deploying hardware devices must be considered.</p>
<p>Possession-based authentication methods offer heightened security measures for a range of scenarios, including financial transactions, remote work access, secure online transactions, and compliance-driven environments like legal and government agencies. In online banking, users require physical possession of a security token or mobile device to access their accounts securely. Similarly, in remote work settings, this method ensures that only authorized employees with designated devices can connect to corporate networks and sensitive data, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access. Additionally, in e-commerce platforms and online payment systems, possession-based authentication enhances transaction security, reducing the risk of fraud and protecting sensitive financial information. Furthermore, compliance-driven industries can benefit from this approach to meet regulatory obligations and safeguard confidential information.</p>
 Biometrics 
<p>Biometric authentication offers a high-security level by utilizing unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. This method is highly resistant to traditional hacking attempts and provides a seamless user experience. It is well-suited for environments where security cannot be compromised, such as in government or healthcare settings. Nevertheless, concerns around privacy, the potential for spoofing, and the need for compatible hardware investments can pose challenges. Organizations must weigh these factors against the critical need for secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.</p>
<p>Biometric authentication, which leverages unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, is ideal for various high-security environments. It is best suited for secure access to sensitive data and fortifying high-risk online systems. Despite its advantages, organizations must consider privacy concerns, potential spoofing, and compatible hardware investments when deploying biometric authentication systems.</p>
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>MFA combines two or more authentication methods listed above to create a layered security approach, significantly enhancing protection against various threats. By integrating knowledge, possession, and biometric factors, MFA creates a dynamic defense mechanism that is much harder for attackers to bypass. This method is ideal for protecting sensitive data and critical systems, offering a balanced solution that addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in single-method authentication systems. While MFA introduces complexity and potential user resistance, its ability to significantly reduce security risks makes it a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategies.<br>
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a versatile security method that finds applications across industries, serving to protect sensitive data and critical systems. More commonly, MFA is required to ensure secure access to corporate systems from outside the office, and in e-commerce platforms to safeguard customer accounts and high-risk customer and citizen transactions. Overall, MFA provides a defense mechanism against various threats, combining multiple authentication factors to significantly enhance security and mitigate risks inherent in single-method authentication systems.</p>
 Passwordless 
<p>Passwordless authentication represents a significant leap forward in cybersecurity, eliminating the vulnerabilities associated with traditional knowledge-based methods. The majority of authentication methods included in the above still require a user name AND password as a first step in authenticating users. But, by leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a user-friendly and highly secure alternative that reduces the risk of phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This method is particularly advantageous in creating a seamless user experience without compromising security, and ideal for environments aiming to minimize friction while maintaining high security standards. Organizations looking to bolster access security while enhancing user satisfaction should consider integrating passwordless authentication into their strategic security framework, offering an optimal balance between ease of use and robust protection.<br>
Organizations across diverse sectors, particularly those looking for a better, more secure user experience, should carefully consider integrating passwordless authentication into their security frameworks. By leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a robust and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based methods, effectively mitigating the risks associated with phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This approach not only enhances security posture but also fosters a seamless and efficient user experience, aligning with the modern landscape of digital operations where stringent security measures and user satisfaction are paramount.</p>
 Choosing the Right Strategy 
<p>The choice of authentication method should be driven by an organization’s specific needs, considering factors such as the sensitivity of the data, user experience requirements, and regulatory compliance mandates. Here are four key considerations for selecting the appropriate authentication method:</p>
 
 Risk Assessment: Evaluate the level of security risk associated with the data or systems being protected. Higher risk scenarios may warrant more stringent authentication methods, such as biometric or MFA. 
 User Experience: Consider the impact on the user. While security is paramount, overly cumbersome authentication processes can lead to poor compliance and user frustration. 
 Cost and Infrastructure: Assess the financial and infrastructure implications of deploying new authentication technologies. While advanced methods like biometric authentication offer enhanced security, they also come with higher implementation costs. 
 Compliance Requirements: Ensure that the chosen authentication method aligns with industry regulations and standards, which may dictate specific security measures. 
 
<p>Defending against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats requires understanding the unique advantages and limitations of available authentication methods, and selecting the controls that are best aligned with organizational needs and user expectations. Using the methods described above can help define an authentication strategy that ensures security measures remain robust, responsive, and user-friendly.</p>

  <p>E-signing is becoming an integral part of many processes for improved customer service and shorter processing time. However, many businesses fail to properly evaluate their risk exposure due to the use of e-signing instead of wet signatures. Many e-signing services look and work smoothly, though fail to ensure sufficient legal evidence to the business. This talk will highlight fundamental cryptographic principles used to identity-protect legal evidence in the advanced and qualified electronic signatures. It will also oppose what looks to be lighter, smoother and more affordable option - electronic sealing often promoted as “e-signing”, to the "true" electronic signing where legal evidence is identity-protected by design.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/esigning-how-to-avoid-placebo-solutions-eic24"></a>

  <p>Providing a product or service across markets internationally can come with significant technical and regulatory overhead. The challenge of such overhead might seem to reduce itself in the current market development in Europe with the soon to be standardized eIDAS architecture and unified wallet interaction protocols that seem to streamline identity integration requirements across 27 countries. In practice though, moving beyond the EU context will still require significant adaptation and often parallel implementation of identity standards and protocols, this is true for the Swiss market as much as it is true for the US or even Japanese market. While all these markets move towards the digital identity wallet paradigm as a new identity model, their technical approach differs significantly.</p>
<p>Abstracting this complexity for companies that simply want to provide their product or service across markets is a tough challenge. Solution providers need to consistently monitor changing specifications, requirements, and regulation, while making sure that their own technological platform is ready to support the variety at hand. Many incumbent solutions and platforms do not handle such diversity well since they were developed for a concrete market environment and then updated on a sub optimal path of evolution towards ever more complexity.</p>
<p>As a Swiss provider of digital identity core technologies, Procivis had to naturally tackle the challenge of a future proof technology solution that is capable of handling complexity since day one. Our home market is too small to justify a solution built for only that environment, so we had to get creative and build a product that can naturally handle complexity and interoperability without compromise.</p>
<p>This presentation will tell the story of our journey to rethink product development in times of uncertainty. It will describe how we learned to radically build for adaptability and extensibility. After the initial instinct to resist uncertainty, we learned to embrace it and I will talk about our company's journey to this new state of consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/embracing-diverse-specifications-eic24"></a>

  <p>Digital wallets are applications used to receive, store, and share identity attributes in a standards-based [preferably], secure, privacy enhancing fashion. To prove that the legitimate, natural person is receiving, in possession of, or sharing these identity attributes a means to bind them to the natural person is needed.<br> In 1995, for example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) clearly recognized the desirability of pursuing the use of biometrics in travel documents as the single best way to link the document and its rightful “owner.”<br> In this example the issuing authority binds the identity attributes to the authorized holder by including biometric data in the cryptographically signed logical data structure. When the holder makes an identity claim the relying party (verifier) can determine the authenticity and integrity of the identity attributes and, through biometric recognition, determine if the authorized holder is presenting the information. This works well for the intended use case: in-person identity verification by government authorities for cross border travel.<br> The EU, for another example, specifies three assurance levels for electronic identification (low, superior, and high) which involve different levels of rigor in the identity proofing process and in the binding process itself, from: <br> The binding has been established on the basis of nationally recognised procedures.<br> to<br> The binding has been verified on the basis of a unique identifier representing the legal person used in the national context; and on the basis of information uniquely representing the natural person from an authoritative source.<br> Here the EU defines authoritative source as:<br> any source irrespective of its form that can be relied upon to provide accurate data, information and/or evidence that can be used to prove identity; <br> The goal of digital wallets in general, and the EU digital wallet in particular, is to be able to prove identity claims to a certain level of assurance both in-person (like an ICAO ePassport or ISO 18013-5 mDL) and on-line (like an ISO 18013-7 mDL). <br> <br> This session will discuss how authentication may rely on the digital wallet to bind the holder to identity claims and what the associated challenges as influenced by varying levels of assurance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-wallet-holder-binding-eic24"></a>

  <p>The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, and traditional security paradigms are proving inadequate in the face of modern threats. As organizations strive to embrace Zero Trust principles, the role of Privileged Access Management (PAM) is pivotal. This talk explores the transformative concept of "Micro Authorizations" and its potential to shape the optimal direction for PAM implementations in support of Zero Trust initiatives.</p>
<p>The Authorization Fabric decides whether a specific principal is authorized to perform a precise operation on a particular resource and whether the resource permits this access.</p>
<p>The granularity of this approach is vital in today’s threat landscape, requiring organizations to shift their focus to a comprehensive, system-wide authorization framework. This shift, parallels the principles of microservices but applies them to the realm of access control.</p>
<p>Rather than depending on a single point of control, there is a need for a network proxy that acts as a bridge between trust and authorization.</p>
<p>Join us on a journey towards a future powered by micro authorizations, where precision, adaptability, and contextual awareness define access control. Explore how micro authorizations can address contemporary security challenges and facilitate the adoption of the Zero Trust model.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-in-privileged-access-management-eic24"></a>

  <p>Compared to externalising authentication, externalising authorization has proven elusive. Yet a combination of the rise of advanced threat actors, regulation, compliance and pressures for greater business agility is bringing it back in focus. It is tempting to think of externalising authorization as a technology problem. Technology like policy languages, authorization engines and workflow systems is necessary to enable the externalisation of authorization, but it is not sufficient. Externalising authorization requires three foundational building blocks to be in place, namely value for all stakeholders from engineers to customers, supporting business processes and technology. In this session we explore each of these building blocks should be internalised in terms of mapping value for all stakeholders, the process and culture needed to make authorization policies explicit and finally the need to drive authorization infrastructure, from policy language to enforcement engines, into the compute and network fabric to address greenfield and brownfield deployments in order to remove barriers to externalising authorization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/authorization-before-we-externalise-it-eic24"></a>

  <p>In an era marked by the pervasive spread of disinformation and the&nbsp;democratization of advanced artificial intelligence capabilities to&nbsp;create synthetic media, the need for robust defense mechanisms has never been more urgent. The Defending Against Disinformation Common Data Model&nbsp;(DAD-CDM) and the DISARM Framework stand at the forefront of this&nbsp;battle, offering structured approaches to identify, analyze, and&nbsp;counteract disinformation campaigns. The DISARM Framework and DAD-CDM&nbsp;serve as a unified platform for organizations worldwide to exchange&nbsp;critical information, facilitating early detection and rapid response to&nbsp;emerging threats. Leveraging the DISARM Framework, which codifies&nbsp;adversary behaviors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),&nbsp;stakeholders gain insight into manipulative strategies employed in&nbsp;disinformation campaigns, enabling proactive defense measures and&nbsp;enabling a more rapid and comprehensive incident response.<br> <br> In our upcoming presentation, we will explore the intricate&nbsp;intersection of AI, disinformation, and cybersecurity, shedding light on&nbsp;the pivotal role of DAD-CDM and DISARM in safeguarding against evolving threats. Through real-world case studies and practical insights, we&nbsp;explore how these frameworks empower governments, cybersecurity experts,&nbsp;industry, and organizations to mitigate the influence of disinformation&nbsp;and AI-created synthetic media. Join us as we uncover strategies to&nbsp;fortify defenses and foster collaborative efforts in combating&nbsp;misinformation in the digital age.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/combating-misinformation-in-an-ai-enabled-world-eic24"></a>

  <p>The proliferation of micro-services along with the changing threat landscape means it is no longer possible to rely on network segmentation to establish a secure permitter while allowing broad access between services inside the perimeter. As a result, we have to assume that the attackers are inside the perimeter and apply fine grained authorization at the microservice level to ensure least privilege access based on the context of each transaction. This context includes details of the transaction, the user, other services, or workloads in the call chain as well as the trust domains in which the services operate.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are two new complimentary standards being developed in the IETF OAuth working group that provide a standardised mechanism for preserving transaction context. The Transaction Tokens draft provides a mechanism for preserving context for fine grained authorization decisions within a trust domain, while Identity Chaining across Trust Domains provides a mechanism for preserving that context even when crossing trust boundaries. In this session we will provide an overview of these two emerging standards and describe how they are used to enable fine grained authorization in microservices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enabling-fine-grained-authoirization-eic24"></a>

  <p>Stolen secrets and credentials are one of the most common ways for attackers to move laterally and maintain persistence in cloud environments.</p>
<p>Modern cloud deployments employ secrets management systems such as KMS to protect key materials at rest and avoid leaking keys or credentials in source code or other build artifacts. However, secrets are unprotected at runtime, so any vulnerability or compromise of a service could lead to credential theft.</p>
<p>This talk will propose an architecture that, in conjunction with a secret manager, tokenizes secrets and rewrites requests at runtime. Through this approach, application code never directly interacts with key material. Additionally, it enforces stringent access control rules based on Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies for accessing secrets, significantly reducing the blast radius in the event of a security breach.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-workload-identities-eic24"></a>

  <p>As part of the revision of the EU common identity framework regulation, also known as eIDAS 2.0, EU Member States will all soon implement a new common structure for electronic credentials based on digital identity wallets. This includes the development of a European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet.</p>
<p>This wallet can be implemented as a web wallet running in a browser. This means a smartphone is not required to use the wallet – making it inclusive and independent of app stores and phone vendors. Instead of using native APIs to protect cryptographic keys, this web wallet can use FIDO security keys to secure the wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO is a natural fit to secure digital wallets as users are becoming more and more familiar with its associated registration and sign in flows now many websites have adopted passkeys as a means to access their services.</p>
<p>In this session, we will discuss how the wallet works, how FIDO is used to protect the wallet, highlight current use cases of how the wallet is being used by EU member states, and how this model can be replicated in other countries around the world.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-digital-identity-wallets-using-fido-security-keys-eic24"></a>

Passkey providers have seamlessly integrated the capability to synchronize passkeys across various devices, extending their reach even to different device families. Users enjoy default implementations of passkey providers with each new device, empowering relying parties to leverage passkeys across the multitude of devices.<br> In contrast, relying parties cannot assume the universal presence of identity wallet functionality on the typical devices used by their customers.<br> Given the three-year device switch cycle and the concurrent use of multiple devices, cloud storage services have efficiently addressed the migration of standard data between devices. While these services generally have access to data in the clear, they implement safeguards to prevent inadvertent disclosure.<br> Passkey providers not only synchronize passkeys but also implement robust recovery methods, crucial for scenarios involving the loss or theft of all devices. Similarly, identity wallets, tasked with managing verifiable identity attributes and associated secrets, necessitate safeguards akin to those implemented by passkey providers. <br> This webinar explores the similarities and differences between passkey providers and identity wallets, offering valuable insights into what identity wallets can glean from the proven methodologies of passkeys.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/convergence-of-passkeys-and-identity-wallets-eic24"></a>

  <p>For decentralised identity to reach its full potential we need high levels of trust and high levels of inclusion. <br>As a community we have developed some great standards and practices for identity verification, but they mostly rely on having strong documentation issued by a government if you want to gain the higher levels of trust. <br>The reality is not everyone has strong documentation and not everyone has access to digital technology to verify that documentation remotely. For example, in the UK around 11 million people have neither a passport nor a driving licence, the 2 primary documents used for identity verification. In many countries this number is far higher. <br>And, while we drive forward with more and more technological means of proving who we are online, some people will always struggle to use these technologies or simply not be able to. <br>Vouching for someone as part of the identity verification process has been around for a while but is only now crystalising in the minds of identity experts. It is also one of the most decentralised ways of proving who you are. <br>The process of Vouching is intended to increase inclusivity of population scale identity systems by enabling people with insufficient documentation (identity evidence), or those unable to complete a conventional identity registration to gain a digital identity.<br>In this session Adam Cooper seeks to outline the issues we should be addressing and the approaches we can take to create better inclusivity in digital identity ecosystems based on over a decade of working with governments, citizens, and the private sector to deliver better outcomes for all of us.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-is-already-decentralized-eic24"></a>

  <p>eIDAS version 2 has set in motion and energized identity professionals to think about and work on sharing attributes related to identity data. eIDAS version 2 provides a possible framework and set of technologies to do so. However, that framework does not match with a lot of technical and business practices already in use. In Belgium an ecosystem is forming to perform data sharing in a way which is adapted to the needs of the different existing stakeholders: data subjects, sources, attribute attestation service providers, vaults, IdP and relying parties. It reuses a lot of existing initiatives and infrastructure for a low threshold implementation with the high trust level of the existing initiatives. Nevertheless, it allows to implement important features like privacy, selective disclosure, etc.<br> During this presentation, we will see how this alternative ecosystem works, how it ensures trust and ease of use for the different stakeholders (including data subjects) and why it will lead to a low threshold for adoption.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-sharing-ecosystem-and-trust-eic24"></a>

  <p>The Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP), which just had its fourth birthday, has long held the conviction that technical trust alone is insufficient for enabling human trust in digital interactions. Thus, ToIP has been developing a dual stack that pairs technical architecture with governance architecture. <br> <br>To maximize technical interoperability, ToIP believes there must be a minimum viable “trust spanning” protocol that enables ubiquitous secure, private data exchange. Then every digital trust ecosystem can choose which higher-layer “trust task” protocols—such as exchanging digital credentials between digital wallets, or verifying ecosystem participants using trust registries—they need to meet their specific authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy requirements.<br> <br> With regards to the harder problem of human trust, in the real world this is built through relationships, agreements and other intangible elements within a context. By contrast, in the digital world trust has to be engineered. This means each ecosystem needs to be able to define their governance architecture, policies, credentials, and trust lists/registries that can be communicated both within and across ecosystems using interoperable protocols to maximize the potential for cross-ecosystem trust relationships.<br> <br> This interactive panel, moderated by ToIP’s Executive Director, will convene a set of ToIP leaders to explain why they have been investing in this new approach to decentralized digital trust infrastructure, where it fits with eIDAS 2.0, how it builds upon (not replaces) X.509 PKI and OpenID, and what to expect over the coming year.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/emerging-trust-layer-for-the-internet-eic24"></a>

This exclusive interview session, featuring Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, alongside Maarten Stultjens and Marco Venuti from Thales Group, will focus on the question about future requirements of B2B CIAM and how the transformative potential of decentralized identity technologies will influence the realm of B2B CIAM.</p>
<p>As businesses increasingly recognize the need for robust, scalable, and secure identity management frameworks, the integration of decentralized technologies offers a promising horizon. This discussion will explore:</p>
 
 The evolving landscape of CIAM solutions and the unique challenges faced in a B2B context. 
 How decentralized identity technologies are not just enhancing security but also facilitating greater autonomy and efficiency in identity transactions between businesses. 
 The impact of these technologies on regulatory compliance and data privacy, providing businesses the agility to adapt to a rapidly changing regulatory landscape. 
 Practical insights into the implementation challenges and success stories from Thales Group's experience in deploying next-generation CIAM solutions. 
 
<p>Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of the future directions of CIAM, including actionable insights on leveraging decentralized technologies to foster trust, enhance security, and drive business efficiency in their digital interactions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/b2b-ciam-future-functional-requirements-eic24"></a>

  <p>With cybercrime on the rise, ransomware attacks that target Active Directory (AD), the primary identity store for most businesses worldwide, are as common as having a cup of coffee. Many cyber incidents involve AD in one way or another. Given that an attack on AD, these days, is more of a "when" rather than an "if" scenario, organizations must have a tested AD DR plan and purpose-built solutions for securing AD before a cyberattack and recovering and securing AD after that cyberattack. In addition, if like many organizations today, you have a hybrid identity environment that connects AD with Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD), do you know what needs to happen to reconnect? Recovering as fast as possible is one thing, assessing the security of your AD and mitigating any (critical) risks is another. But what about reconnecting AD back with Entra ID? Knowing which precautionary measures to take to minimize damage (i.e., the impact on user experience and data loss) within Entra ID is of utmost importance!</p>
<p>This presentation discusses the risk to today’s enterprise organizations and explains why prioritizing hybrid identity (Active Directory and Entra ID) security is so important. Examples of various identity threat detection and response (ITDR) tools to evaluate AD security (pre- and post-attack) and discover vulnerabilities that could attract attackers are also discussed.</p>
<p>Attendees will also learn why an AD Recovery Plan is a vital resource for ongoing operational resilience, including the different ways to execute parts of that DR plan and what the impact is of such an execution. Finally, we will discuss what the problem is with reconnecting AD back with Entra ID and what you can do about it to mitigate any impact.</p>
<p>In summary, during this session, attendees will learn the following:</p>
 
 Learn how to evaluate the security of an AD 
 Learn how to prepare for a disaster scenario 
 Learn which backup to choose and why 
 Learn how to remediate risk (due to security) right after recovery 
 Learn how to remediate impact when reconnecting AD with Entra ID&nbsp; 
 
<p>If time allows, the highlights of a real-life AD recovery scenario will be discussed, to put all the pieces together.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ransomware-attack-against-your-ad-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the&nbsp;Dialectic of Enlightenment, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer introduce a critical view of the process of civilization, economy and enlightenment as such, a critical view of the seemingly self-evident notion of pure reason, science, and technology. What Horkheimer and Adorno are trying to capture and reflect is the very process of rationality backlashing into irrationality. The long history of enlightenment is thus the demystification of nature and the development of pure calculative rationality. According to Horkheimer and Adorno, we have tried to free ourselves of the dangers and brute force of nature, but in the process of developing technology and production we have ended up narrowing our rational capacities, dominating ourselves, and tying ourselves to a petrified system now even endangering our own planet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We seem to have reached the era of modern technology and exact calculation, but this leaves us with no sense of control or meaningfulness in the face of a global environmental crisis. Humanity's technological orientation to the world makes clear the responsibility of human beings to the well-being of the world. This taking of responsibility will become vital in the future since it has become perfectly clear that the Earth will not be able in the long term to support the exploitative and care-less ways in which ever growing parts of humanity have been inhabiting her since at least the Industrial Revolution. However, the need to ask about modern technology is presumably dying out to the same extent that technology more definitely characterizes and regulates the appearance of the totality of the world and the position of man in it. Thus, it is important to ask: how does modern technology affect our actuality?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will explore how technology is not merely a means to an end but also a lens through which we understand ourselves and the world. It will highlight the increasing responsibility that humanity bears for the well-being of the planet, especially in the face of a global environmental crisis. The session will demonstrate how this transformation represents a radical change in our technological relationship with the planet and with ourselves.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/philosophical-perspective-identity-cybersecurity-professionals-eic24"></a>

<p>Traditionally, authentication and API authorization functions have been combined into one system architecture, often through a managed service provided by a vendor. However, this restricts how service providers can customize their identity and access management systems to deliver a consistent brand experience.<br>To thrive in the competitive environment, service providers are increasingly opting to build their own authorization servers in-house.

   The European Central Bank is busily preparing for a potential launch of a Digital Euro, that would provide an electronic alternative to cash, significantly changing how we send money to each other. Any such system will have to meet an exacting set of requirements - including the ability to support massive scale and protecting of the privacy individuals whilst preventing fraud and money laundering.

  <p>The European Central Bank is busily preparing for a potential launch of a Digital Euro, that would provide an electronic alternative to cash, significantly changing how we send money to each other. Any such system will have to meet an exacting set of requirements - including the ability to support massive scale and protecting of the privacy individuals whilst preventing fraud and money laundering. This talk will explore the potential role of EUDI Wallets in meeting these requirements, consider gaps that exist and explore additional technologies and capabilities that may be needed. To have utility digital wallets will need to support identity, payments and other credentials. It is essential therefore that we expand our identity-focused wallet thinking into some of those other areas.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eudi-wallets-digital-euro-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the rapidly evolving agricultural sector, the importance of data management and sharing has never been more critical. Traditional methods are no longer sufficient; they create compliance burdens, inefficiencies and face a lack of trust. New Zealand is undertaking a transformative approach with the Digital Farm Wallet pilot, conceived by the Trust Alliance New Zealand (TANZ), a non-profit industry consortium recognising that trusted data sharing is essential for the growth of New Zealand’s primary sector.</p>
<p>The TANZ Digital Farm Wallet Pilot Project exemplifies the commitment to empowering stakeholders to share and verify information in a trusted and permissioned manner, fostering trust and transparency throughout the value chain. This initiative aims to offer tangible proof of brand promises, while alleviating farms from the repetitive tasks of data management.</p>
<p>To ensure international market and financial access demand of digital proofs, such as environmental claims are increasing. The Digital Farm Wallet addresses this by facilitating the sharing of key data points like greenhouse gas and Scope 3 emissions, underscoring good management practices. Exploring various applications, this initiative aims to deliver real value for farmers and food processors.</p>
<p>Klaeri Schelhowe was contracted through Scheddebrock Ltd. to act as the Executive Director for TANZ. In this role she established an industry consortium to focus on trusted data sharing within the primary sector. A significant challenge was posed in bringing together the many and varied stakeholders, many of whom competed with each other, to cooperate in the development of a functioning ecosystem. Developing stakeholder understanding and willingness to engage in a co opetition model in order to build critical mass is a more complex and demanding undertaking than the adoption and deployment of the technology itself.</p>

  <p>Choosing the right platform to secure identity access to privileged resources is more challenging. This is partly because of the escalating risk of under protected identities in the cloud and the tendency of bad actors to target those with privileged access. It’s also because the choice of tools has widened. The protection of privileged identities has traditionally fallen to PAM vendors such as CyberArk or BeyondTrust, but in the last few years, the space has widened to include CIEM and ITDR providers who focus on securing identities in the cloud, for development environments and at the edge.</p>
<p>In this session Paul will explain why these newer technologies emerged, why they are important, and the difference between them and traditional PAM. He will share his analysis of how these technologies can be orchestrated to work together and how some are being deployed in a decentralised fashion for specific identity management and protection tasks.</p>
<p>You will learn the fundamental design elements of each of these technologies, how they can protect your identities and which may offer a solution for managing privileged identities in your organization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-ciem-itdr-difference-eic24"></a>

The problem of finding and matching John Doe versus J.Doe is attempted in an end-to-end procurement process to detect internal fraud, based on data from ERP systems. We present an explainable AI (XAI) approach that attempts to explain to business users how certain features of data affect high-risk indicators in a procurement process.
